        <p>
          Tools reflect the needs of their users, and changes in these tools reflect changes in recreation, rescue and work at height. I am mostly focused on locking carabiners or interesting design dead-ends.

        <h2>Why Carabiners?</h2>
        <p>
          I am fascinated by mechanical objects, how they are designed, and how those designs reflect the needs of the users. I also love the world of vertical rope disciplines - recreational tree climbing in particular, but I have also spent time professionally on ropes courses and teaching rock climbing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a gearhead, one thing I&#39;ve always enjoyed is sharing gear with others, and seeing them understand an aspect of the rope discipline in a new way through that piece of equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a reader, I find simple personal websites interesting - something I&#39;ve become nostalgic for as more content has moved to Web 2.0 and become hidden behind logins.  
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is an expression of my collecting and climbing hobby - a continual work-in-progress representing my personal collection &amp; musings. It is not a how-to guide, or any sort of authority on how to use vertical equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Please seek proper instruction</strong>, and consider my remarks on this site with the same level of seriousness as us having a casual discussion about carabiners over a pint.

      <h2>Donations?</h2>

        <p>
          Have some old carabiners you&#39;re interested making their way to the collection? Please <a href="https://www.carabinercollection.com/about.html#contact">contact me</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of these carabiners are donations from friends and strangers-turned-friends, and the collection wouldn&#39;t be what it is without the generous help of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also interested in old catalogs, magazines or other material that might aid my research.

          Yup, this is a personal page and project, which I maintain for fun as a hobby. Again, how carabiners are used or misused can cause serious injury or death. The site certainly contains factual errors - please do not rely on information on this site to make choices about personal safety.
