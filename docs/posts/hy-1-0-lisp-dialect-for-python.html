        <p dir="auto">I&#39;m pleased to announce the release of Hy 1.0.0, after nearly 12 years of on-and-off development and lots of real-world use. Hy is a Lisp dialect embedded in Python. See <a href="http://hylang.org" rel="nofollow">Hylang.org</a> for an introduction and documentation, <a href="https://github.com/hylang/hy/blob/master/NEWS.rst">the NEWS file</a> for a version history, and <a href="https://github.com/hylang/hy/discussions/2609">the HYPE POST</a> for something a little less serious.</p>
<p dir="auto">Henceforth, breaking changes to documented parts of the language (other than dropping support for versions of Python that are themselves no longer supported by the CPython developers) will increase the major version number, and my intention is for that not to happen often, if at all. My focus will be on fixing new bugs as they arise, adding compatibility with new versions of Python, and adding support for whatever new features are added to Python in a fashion that won&#39;t break code that works on previous versions of Hy 1.x.y.</p>
