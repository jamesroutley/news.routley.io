                    <p>We all benefit from freedom and privacy to explore our identity, shape our futures and build communities where we can thrive. We all need safe spaces, especially in insecure situations.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>In 2022, European lawmakers proposed new rules with the noble intent to protect children. However, this law allows authorities to have anyone&#39;s legitimate conversations monitored.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, it harms everyone, including those it wants to protect. No one can be protected by making the internet less secure.</p>
                    <p>The EU must empower people to develop themselves, connect and organise for now and for future generations. If we work together, we can protect children whilst upholding confidentiality and security online.</p>

            <p><strong>Your private chats will be scanned.</strong> You won&#39;t able to share anything remotely intimate without the risk of your messages, photos and videos ending up in the hands of some governmental institution.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The technology is known to fail.</strong> And as a result, you may be accused of being a (child) sexual offender without having done anything wrong.
            </p>
            <p><strong>We can&#39;t afford to get it wrong.</strong> We all agree: child sexual abuse is a horrendous act. As a society, we shouldn&#39;t waste our effort to tackle this issue on actions that are proven to be ineffective and harmful.</p>

                        <p>We are trying to investigate the same governments that would have access to this scanning technology. Journalists are already under attack and being targeted. This legislation would just give more power to those in authority to abuse their position.</p>

                        <p>Scanning our phones and laptops is an easy scalable door for powerful people to access our private conversations. Today is for CSA material, tomorrow there will be another excuse. Who will say no to other uses when the technology is already there? It leads to breaking of the free flow of information and a chilling effect for freedom of speech.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It would de facto allow authorities to have access to the content of encrypted exchanges. This would weaken the online security of people who work with sensitive information (journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders, etc.). What about apps and software such as Signal and Tor that don&#39;t collect metadata about their users?</p>

                        <p>With this proposal young people and activists will be stripped of the opportunity to find a safe and encrypted space to exchange experiences and to discuss personal and political matters. We don&#39;t want to fear that our supposed-to-be private conversations can be turned against us.</p>
