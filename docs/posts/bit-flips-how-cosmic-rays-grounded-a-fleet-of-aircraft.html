His plane, an Airbus A320 commercial airliner had suddenly and unexpectedly dropped altitude during a flight from Cancun, in Mexico, to Newark, in New Jersey, US, on 30 October 2025. Three people appeared to have suffered &#34;a laceration in the head&#34;, <a target="_blank" href="https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/5582997-jetblue-emergency-landing-new-jersey-florida-mexico/">the pilot said</a>. At least 15 people were later taken to hospital when the flight landed after being diverted to Florida.</p><p>A month later, this incident would lead to the mass grounding of more than 6,000 aircraft – one of the largest ever aviation industry recalls. It triggered <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9d13x2z7o">widespread disruption and cancellations</a> over the final weekend of November 2025, one of the busiest of the year for air travel following Thanksgiving in the US.</p><p>What caused all this? Tiny, high-energy particles from outer space, according to Airbus.</p><p>An initial investigation by the company revealed that the sudden drop in altitude was linked to a malfunction in one of the aircraft&#39;s computers that controls moving parts on the aircraft&#39;s wings and tail. The malfunction seems to have been triggered by cosmic radiation bombarding the Earth on the day of the flight.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>According to emergency airworthiness directives issued by both the <a target="_blank" href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/2025-0268-E">European Union Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA) and the US <a target="_blank" href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/DRSDOCID170146585920251129034243.0001">Federal Aviation Authority</a> (FAA), such radiation-triggered computer errors could, in the worst-case scenario, lead to an &#34;uncommanded&#34; change in altitude so severe that it might exceed &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/EASA_AD_2025_0268_E.pdf/EAD_2025-0268-E_1">the aircraft&#39;s structural capability</a>&#34;.

As the BBC has previously reported, these <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221011-how-space-weather-causes-computer-errors">computer errors</a> occur when high-speed subatomic particles from outer space, such as protons, smash into atoms in our planet&#39;s atmosphere. This can cause a cascade of particles to rain down through our atmosphere, like throwing marbles across a table. In rare cases, those fast-moving neutrons can strike computer electronics and disrupt tiny bits of data stored in the computer&#39;s memory, switching that bit – often represented as a 0 or 1 – from one state to another.</p><p>&#34;That can cause your electronics to behave in ways you weren&#39;t expecting,&#34; says Matthew Owens, professor of space physics at the University of Reading in the UK. Satellites are particularly affected by this phenomenon, he says. &#34;For space hardware we see this quite frequently.&#34;</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>This is because the neutron flux – a measure of neutron radiation – rises the higher up in the atmosphere you go, increasing the chance of a strike hitting sensitive parts of the computer equipment on board. Aircraft are more vulnerable to this problem than computer equipment on the ground, although bit flips do occur at ground level, too. The increasing reliance of computers in fly-by-wire systems in aircraft, which use electronics rather than mechanical systems to control the plane in the air, also mean the risk posed by bit flips when they do occur is higher.</p><p>The JetBlue incident is reminiscent of a case in 2008 involving an Airbus A330, when a Qantas flight fell hundreds of feet twice within 10 minutes, injuring dozens of passengers. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/aair/ao-2008-070">report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau</a> that followed could not conclude that a cosmic bit flip was definitely the cause – but it was left as the most likely scenario after several others were more or less ruled out.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mkv5tz.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The emergency upgrades needed on several types of Airbus aircraft meant flights on many airlines were disrupted around the world (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption>The emergency upgrades needed on several types of Airbus aircraft meant flights on many airlines were disrupted around the world (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>Airbus told the BBC that it tested multiple scenarios when attempting to determine what happened to the 30 October 2025 JetBlue flight. In this case also, the company ruled out various possibilities except that of a bit flip. It is hard to attribute the incident to this for sure, however, because careering neutrons leave no trace of their activity behind, says Owens.</p><p>An Airbus spokesman stressed &#34;there is no link&#34; between the JetBlue flight and the 2008 Qantas incident. The corrupted electronics on the Qantas flight were situated in a component that tracks and processes flight data. By comparison, the computer error that caused problems for the JetBlue flight occurred in the A320&#39;s Elac system, which controls certain moving parts of an aircraft&#39;s wings and tail to adjust elevation and roll.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action">Airbus&#39;s initial statement</a> about the recall, however, has left some space weather scientists scratching their heads. The company referred to &#34;intense solar radiation&#34; on 30 October as potentially corrupting flight control data. But it wasn&#39;t a very notable day in terms of particles from the Sun washing over our planet.

These galactic cosmic rays are generated by huge stellar explosions known as supernovae and black holes. Airbus did not clarify why it referred to intense solar radiation, specifically, in responses to BBC questions.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>There was, however, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cpv13jpmxw7o">an unrelated major solar flare on 11 November</a> – weeks after the JetBlue incident – where sensors mounted on UK weather balloons at 40,000ft (12km) measured one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/blog/2025/world-first-data-collected-in-innovative-space-weather-project">largest radiation events to hit Earth in roughly two decades</a>.

Many airlines completed them within hours. The software works by inducing &#34;rapid refreshing of the corrupted parameter so it has no time to have effect on the flight controls&#34;, Airbus says. This is, in essence, a way of continually sanitising computer data on these aircraft to try and ensure that any errors don&#39;t end up actually impacting a flight.</p><p>By the morning of Monday 1 December, Airbus said the majority of its affected aircraft had received the necessary software updates and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-12-airbus-provides-update-on-deployment-of-a320-family-precautionary">fewer than 100 planes</a> were still to undergo modifications.
