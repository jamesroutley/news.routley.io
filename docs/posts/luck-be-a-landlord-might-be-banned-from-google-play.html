    <h1>Luck Be a Landlord Might Be Banned from Google Play</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Happy New Year everyone! Just three hours into 2025, I received an email from Google Play Support with the following subject line:</p><blockquote>Action Required: Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies (Luck be a Landlord)</blockquote><p>Nothing has changed with Luck be a Landlord in the past few months, but for whatever reason, my game &#34;contains gambling&#34; now!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-from-2025-01-01-10-29-53.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="562" height="185"/></figure><p>I&#39;ve already gone through this song and dance multiple times with Google Play over the <a href="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/luck-be-a-landlord-is-now-banned-in-13-countries-on-the-google-play-store/" rel="noreferrer">game being banned by them in 13 countries</a>, so while this isn&#39;t exactly new, it&#39;s a lot scarier!</p><p>I genuinely think Luck be a Landlord deserves the equivalent of an E10+ rating across all regions, but at this point I&#39;ve just given up and will deal with whatever inaccurate rating is slapped on the game.</p><p>I&#39;ve now filled out the Google Play age rating questionnaire to &#34;agree&#34; that my game &#34;contains gambling.&#34; I&#39;m doing this in an attempt to stop my game from being banned globally on Google Play since every time I&#39;ve tried to appeal these decisions I&#39;ve simply been sent a screenshot of my game and was told &#34;this is gambling.&#34;</p><p>Whatever happens, I hope you&#39;re still able to play my game on your Android device in 2025.</p><p>If not, consider subscribing to this newsletter for more information on my next game! Here are some stills from its upcoming trailer:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/2025/01/1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/1.jpg 600w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/1.jpg 1600w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/2025/01/1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/2025/01/2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/2.jpg 600w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/2.jpg 1000w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/2.jpg 1600w, https://blog.trampolinetales.com/content/images/2025/01/2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure>
