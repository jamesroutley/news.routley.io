    <h1>FTC wants Microsoft&#39;s relationship with OpenAI under the microscope</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft&#39;s OpenAI headaches might not be going away following reports that now the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is considering an investigation into the Windows giant&#39;s investment in the company.</p>
<p>At question, should the FTC opt to open a formal examination, is whether any antitrust rules have been broken. Despite the money poured into it over the years, OpenAI <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/our-structure">was founded as a non-profit</a> in 2015, and Microsoft&#39;s investment does not amount to control of the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft chief communications officer Frank X Shaw underlined attempts to dampen down industry talk of a probe: &#34;While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions.&#34;</p>

    

<p><i>The Register</i> contacted the FTC for its view on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/ftc-makes-preliminary-antitrust-queries-into-microsoft-openai?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reports</a> and will update should we receive a response.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft has invested upwards of $10 billion in OpenAI to fund the computing power needed to train AI models. To see a return, Microsoft is shoehorning ChatGPT into every corner of its portfolio. However, the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/microsoft_openai_altman_nadella/">departure and subsequent return</a> of OpenAI boss Sam Altman rattled execs in Microsoft HQ.</p>
<p>As such, the Windows vendor parachuted a non-voting observer into OpenAI&#39;s board.</p>

<p>At the end of last week, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/microsofts_relationship_with_openai_now/">launched</a> a consultation to ask interested parties to comment on Microsoft&#39;s relationship with ChatGPT developer, and if it could be construed as a merger that potentially skews competition.</p>
<p>If so, the CMA will itself launch an official inspection.</p>

        

<p>The FTC has already begun <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/ftc_openai_investigation/">investigating</a> OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT over privacy and reputational concerns. It is also no stranger to Microsoft. Despite the company&#39;s $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard seemingly going ahead in October, the FTC has continued its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter">attempts</a> to undo the merger.</p>
<p>In October, the UK&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/cma_criticizes_microsoft_as_it/">CMA gave Microsoft&#39;s $69 billion buy of Activision Blizzard the green light</a> but criticized the tactics employed by Microsoft to push through the deal.</p>
<p>&#34;Businesses and their advisors should be in no doubt that the tactics employed by Microsoft are no way to engage with the CMA,&#34; said the regulator&#39;s CEO, Sarah Cardell. Â®</p>
