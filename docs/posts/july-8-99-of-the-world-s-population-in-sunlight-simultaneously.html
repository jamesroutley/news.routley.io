    <h1>July 8 99% of the world’s population in sunlight simultaneously?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A fascinating claim is circulating the internet: that there’s a moment each year when 99% of the world’s population gets sunlight. Is it true?</p><div><figure data-tad-control="ClassOnClick" data-tad-options="{classname: &#39;article__figure--zoomed&#39;}"><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x337/day-night-map.png?1" width="600" height="337" alt="Illustration image" srcset="//c.tadst.com/gfx/900x506/day-night-map.png?1 1.5x,//c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/day-night-map.png?1 2x"/></p><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/day-night-map.png?1" width="1200" height="675" alt="Illustration image" loading="lazy"/></p><figcaption><p>Our Day and Night World Map for July 8 at 11:15 UTC shows most of the world’s landmasses receiving sunlight.</p><p>©timeanddate.com</p></figcaption></figure><h2>It Happens on July 8 at 11:15 UTC</h2><p>As <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/months/july.html">July</a> rolls around, our number crunchers thought it was worth <strong>fact-checking a July-related claim</strong> that has been making the rounds on the internet lately.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/ict034/oc_since_you_liked_the_other_one_every_year_on/">original post</a>, Reddit user GiddySwine presents a still image of our Day and Night World Map, claiming that 99% of the world’s population is<strong> between dawn and dusk</strong> on July 8 at 11:15 UTC.</p><p>A more widely circulated <a href="https://twitter.com/decolonialatlas/status/1412885395725905920">version</a> claims that 99% of the population <strong>gets daylight</strong> at that moment.</p><p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=99+Percent+of+the+World%27s+Population+Are+Between+Dawn+and+Dusk&amp;iso=20220708T1115&amp;p1=1440">Convert July 8, 11:15 UTC to your time zone</a></p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/sunearth.html">Day and Night World Map</a> uses different shadings for day, night, and the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html">three stages of twilight</a>:</p><ul><li>The lightest shading represents <strong>daytime</strong> when the Sun is above the horizon. </li><li>The darkest shading is <strong>nighttime</strong> when the Sun is below the horizon, and there’s no twilight. </li><li>The shadings between day and night are the <strong>three stages of twilight</strong> when the Sun is below the horizon, but there’s still some indirect sunlight. </li></ul></div><h2>Covers the World’s Most Populated Areas</h2><p>A brief look at our <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/sunearth.html?day=8&amp;month=7&amp;year=2022&amp;hour=11&amp;min=15&amp;sec=0&amp;n=1440&amp;ntxt=UTC&amp;earth=0">Day and Night World Map</a> gives some initial support to the claims (see image above). Nearly all of the world’s <strong>most populated areas receive some sunlight</strong> at the time in question. Among them are North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and most of Asia.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand, parts of Southeast Asia, and Antarctica are the only larger landmasses on the night side of Earth.</p><h2>7.7 Billion People Get Some Degree of Sunlight</h2><p>When we <strong>run the detailed numbers</strong> through our computer, we also find some support for the claim.</p><p>Combining <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/">timeanddate’s Sun data</a> with 2022 population data from the <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/">Center for International Earth Science Information Network</a> at Columbia University, we found that it’s <strong>nighttime for just under 80 million people</strong> on July 8 at 11:15 UTC.</p><p>That leaves about <strong>7.7 billion people</strong>—roughly 99% of us—on the side of the planet <strong>illuminated by the Sun</strong>.</p><p>Over 6.4 billion of them are in the daytime, while more than 1.2 billion people experience twilight.</p><figure data-tad-control="ClassOnClick" data-tad-options="{classname: &#39;article__figure--zoomed&#39;}"><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x337/worlds-population-daylight-night.png?1" width="600" height="337" alt="Illustration image" srcset="//c.tadst.com/gfx/900x506/worlds-population-daylight-night.png?1 1.5x,//c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/worlds-population-daylight-night.png?1 2x"/></p><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/worlds-population-daylight-night.png?1" width="1200" height="675" alt="Illustration image" loading="lazy"/></p><figcaption><p>©timeanddate</p></figcaption></figure><p>So, with 83% of us getting direct sunlight and another 16% getting indirect sunlight, the <strong>claims are, in one way, correct</strong>. And, before we go any further, let us say that this alone is a fascinating fact and a great find!</p><p><strong>That said, there’s a hitch</strong>: a few hundred million people on the supposedly sunlit side of Earth <strong>will think it’s night</strong>.</p><h2>Pitch-Black Twilight Sky</h2><p>This is especially true for those who reside on the outermost edge of the twilight zones, within the <strong>darkest twilight phase</strong> called <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/astronomical-twilight.html">astronomical twilight</a>. Here, the Sun is 12-18 degrees below the horizon. At that angle, the indirect sunlight becomes so thin that it is usually <strong>indiscernible to the naked eye</strong>.</p><p>The trace amounts of light in the otherwise <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/">pitch-black sky</a> are of concern only in very particular contexts. For example, it can hinder astronomers from <strong>observing the faintest celestial objects</strong>—hence the name of this twilight phase.</p><figure><p><img src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x337/starry-night-sky-idaho.jpg?1" width="600" height="337" alt="Picture of night sky with the milky way in focus and trees at the bottom of the image." srcset="//c.tadst.com/gfx/900x506/starry-night-sky-idaho.jpg?1 1.5x,//c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x675/starry-night-sky-idaho.jpg?1 2x"/></p><figcaption><p>Astronomical twilight or nighttime? When the Sun is 12-18 degrees below the horizon, the naked eye usually fails to discern the trace amounts of indirect sunlight in the sky.</p><p>©iStock.com/photographer3431</p></figcaption></figure><h2>Hundreds of Millions Will Think It’s Night</h2><p>So, <strong>256.8 million people</strong>, about 3% of the world’s population, are so far behind the curve that <strong>no sunlight is visible</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, many people in the slightly brighter <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/nautical-twilight.html">nautical twilight</a> zone will <strong>fail to notice any daylight</strong>. Especially in urban areas, whose residents make up a majority of the total population numbers, <strong>light pollution</strong> can blend out the faint glow of the Sun, which is 6-12 degrees below the horizon at that point.</p><h2>Claim Confirmed, But…</h2><p>So, the claim is <strong>technically true</strong> if you count all twilight areas, no matter how dimly lit.</p><p>But the percentage of the population actually <strong><em>perceiving</em> sunlight</strong> is a bit lower. Discounting all of the people in the astronomical twilight zone and half of the population experiencing nautical twilight, we get 7204.9 million people, or<strong> about 93%</strong> of the world’s population.</p><p>It’s still a very high number. But the wording of the more recent versions of the post, claiming that 99% of the population will “<em>experience daylight,</em>” is <strong>somewhat misleading</strong>.</p><h2>Why July 8 and Not the June Solstice?</h2><p>When doing this fact check, one thing caught our attention: <strong>the date</strong>.</p><p>By far, most people reside in the<strong> Northern Hemisphere</strong>. The <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/june-solstice.html">June solstice</a>, when the northern half of the globe <strong>receives the most sunlight</strong>, falls on or around <strong>June 21</strong>. Doesn’t that mean even more people get sunlight on the day of the June solstice than on <strong>July 8</strong>?</p><p>Well, <strong>yes and no</strong>. As before, it depends on if you account for human perception or simply follow the technical definitions of the twilight phases.</p><h3>July 8: Most People in Daytime or Twilight</h3><p>Following the technical approach, <strong>July 8 is indeed a better date</strong> than June 21. As the Sun slowly makes its way south after the solstice, its rays gradually retreat from northern areas. However, at 11:15 UTC, this change affects<strong> only largely unpopulated areas</strong>, such as the northern Pacific Ocean.</p><p>At the same time, the Sun’s southward movement <strong>extends its reach farther south</strong>, for example, in Indonesia and the Philippines. Although the change is tiny in geographical terms, it covers some of the world’s <strong>most densely populated areas</strong> and <strong>adds about 10 million people</strong> to the twilight and daylight zones.</p><h4>Comparing June 21 and July 8</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Date </th><th>June 21, 2022 </th><th>July 8, 2022 </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Night </td><td>89.7 million people (~1%) </td><td>79.7 million people (~1%) </td></tr><tr><td>Astronomical twilight </td><td>234.2 million people (~3%) </td><td>256.8 million people (~3%) </td></tr><tr><td>Nautical twilight </td><td>430.6 million people (~6%) </td><td>433.1 million people (~6%) </td></tr><tr><td>Civil twilight </td><td>575.9 million people (~7%) </td><td>548.0 million people (~7%) </td></tr><tr><td>Day </td><td>6427.6 million people (~83%) </td><td>6440.3 million people (~83%) </td></tr></tbody></table><h3>June 21: More Visible Sunlight</h3><p>Interestingly, while <strong>more people</strong> are on the <strong>night side</strong> of Earth at 11:15 UTC on the solstice than on July 8, the number of people experiencing <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/civil-twilight.html">civil twilight</a>—the brightest twilight phase—<strong>is also considerably larger</strong>: 575.9 million people on June 21 and 548.0 million people on July 8.</p><p>So, of the people in the twilight zones, a larger percentage <strong>experience discernible twilight</strong> on June 21.</p><p>If we again discount the astronomical twilight zone and half of the nautical twilight zone, the total number of people <em>actually noticing sunlight</em> increases to 7218.8 million—nearly <strong>14 million more</strong> than the 7204.9 million people doing so on July 8.</p><h3>11:15 UTC Is the Perfect Moment</h3><p>Whichever definition you use, the day-to-day difference is relatively small during this time of the year.</p><p>However, one fact remains undisputed: <strong>11:15 UTC is indeed the perfect moment</strong> each day when <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/dawn.html">dawn</a> begins on the North American west coast while <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/dusk.html">dusk</a> still reigns in East and Southeast Asia.</p><h2>Get Ready for the Instant of Global Sunlight</h2><p>If you want to mark the moment when most of humanity is bathed in sunlight, you can see the seconds tick down with <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/summer?iso=20220708T1115&amp;p0=1440&amp;msg=Instant+of+Global+Sunlight+2022&amp;font=cursive">our countdown</a>.</p><p>And while you bask in the Sun, please spare a thought for our friends Down Under who are among <strong>the 1% experiencing actual nighttime</strong> at that moment—irrespectively of definitions and technicalities.</p><p><strong>Topics: </strong><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/fun">Fun</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/sun">Sun</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/astronomy">Astronomy</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/dates">Dates</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/earth">Earth</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/geography">Geography</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/july">July</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/seasons">Seasons</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/topics/solstice">Solstice</a></p></div></div>
