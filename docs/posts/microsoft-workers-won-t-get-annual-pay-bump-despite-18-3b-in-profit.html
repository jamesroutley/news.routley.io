                <p>Full-time employees at Microsoft will not receive their expected annual salary increases this year, a decision made after the technology giant posted a massive profit.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a memo to staff <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wont-raise-salaries-for-full-time-employees-this-year-2023-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained by Insider</a> that economic conditions are to blame for the lack of a salary bump this year. Nadella said, &#34;We don&#39;t take this decision lightly, having considered it over several months.&#34;</p><p>For the quarter that ended on March 31, Microsoft posted revenue of $52.9 billion (up 7%) and a profit of $18.3 billion (up 9%). Microsoft had <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2023-q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$26.5 billion in cash and equivalents as of March 31</a>. Despite the rosy results, Microsoft employees are not getting pay increases. Nadella&#39;s own pay increased 10% from 2021 to 2022, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-ceo-nadellas-2022-compensation-rises-10-to-near-55-million-and-ceo-pay-ratio-keeps-rising-2022-10-27" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rising to $55 million.</a></p><p>In 2022, Microsoft announced plans to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/satya-nadella-details-microsoft-plan-for-significant-additional-investment-in-employee-compensation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay some of its workers a good sum more in salary and stock</a> because talent &#34;is in high demand.&#34; But in 2023, Nadella said the &#34;economic conditions&#34; of the world are &#34;very different.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Given this, we will fund our compensation commensurate with the overall market. As a senior leadership team, we don&#39;t take this decision lightly having considered it over several months, and believe it is necessary to prepare the company for long term success,&#34; Nadella said.</p><p>Some hourly roles will get pay bumps, but full-time salaried employees at Microsoft will not see increases. Nadella also said the company will not &#34;overfund&#34; the bonus and stock award budget for 2023 as it did in 2022; it is now more in line with historical averages, Nadella said.</p><p>Microsoft&#39;s promotion budget is unchanged, Nadella added, so workers who move up will see pay bumps. The executive went on to say that the lack of salary increases for full-time employees also applies to himself and other members of the senior leadership team.</p><p>&#34;As a company, we must recognize that navigating both economic uncertainty and a major platform shift is a crucial time,&#34; Nadella said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft said to Insider that the &#34;dynamic economic environment,&#34; and other factors, requires Microsoft to make &#34;critical decisions&#34; about staffing and pay.</p><p>&#34;While we will not be providing salary increases for our full-time salaried employees this year, we will continue to invest in our employees through promotions, bonus and stock,&#34; the spokesperson said.
