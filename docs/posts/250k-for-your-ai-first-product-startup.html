    <h1>$250k for your AI-first product startup</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent">

        <h2>It&#39;s time for AI-first products!</h2>

        <p> <i>Products, not papers. Tinkering, not training. Apps, not Arxiv.</i></p><p>

        The AI Grant program:
        </p><ul>
            <li>$250,000 for your AI-first product startup</li>
            <li>$250,000 in cloud credit from Azure</li>
            <li>Early access to <a href="https://stability.ai">Stability.ai</a> models</li>
            <li>A week in San Francisco with amazing people</li>
            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjq0roQmyeu_CcYduuASrMNeWIWM4jUm0fJN5kzp5Y4QgZjw/viewform">Apply
                    here</a> by October 1st, 2022</li>
        </ul>


        <p>AI researchers have given the world a revolutionary new platform in the form of large models
            trained on internet data. And the game has changed dramatically with the recent release of advanced <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion">open</a> <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen">source</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5">models</a>.</p>

        <p>Some people think that the model is the product. It is not. It is an enabling technology that allows new
            products to be built. The breakthrough products will be AI-first, built on these models from day one, by 
            entrepreneurs who understand both what the models can do, and what people actually
            want to use.</p> 

        <p>There are exciting early examples, like <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/">Midjourney</a>, <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">Copilot</a>, and <a href="https://jasper.ai">Jasper</a> – new
            applications that have grown explosively, reaching millions of users and creating huge businesses
            practically overnight. This is just the beginning.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to find and support the great entrepreneurs who are exploring this new frontier. We want to raise
            the status of building AI-first products. Research is important, but creating a product that people love on
            a new platform requires unusual levels of creativity and ingenuity – arguably more so than raising
            money and spending it to scale up a training cluster. And the rewards to the entrepreneurs who create these
            products will be enormous.</p>

        <p>Researchers have raced ahead. It&#39;s time for entrepreneurs to catch up!</p>

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <hr/>
        <p><b>Can anyone apply?</b></p>
        <p>Yes – no credentials required.</p>

        <p><b>What type of company or project qualifies?</b></p>
        <p>Anything that leverages AI models in a useful or engaging way. In particular, we&#39;re looking for technical
            &amp; pragmatic founders who want to build great products. If you get a thrill from making
            something that other people love to use, and you understand that building a new product is 1% idea and
            99% iteration, we want to support you.</p>

        <p><b>What do I get if I win?</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>A $250,000 investment via a no cap, no discount MFN SAFE (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">available here</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spend a week with peers and industry experts at the AI Grant summit in San Francisco in early November.
            </li>
            <li>
                $250,000 in cloud credits from Azure, along with other startup benefits, membership to the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, and go-to-market support.
            </li>
            <li>
                $50,000 in credits from the fine folks at <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com">AssemblyAI</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                $10,000 in human-labeling credits from <a href="https://scale.ai">Scale.ai</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability.ai</a> has graciously agreed to provide early access to their new models. Some startups building on those models may 
            also be able to get selective access to the Stability.ai ultracluster.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Wait, is this a grant or an investment?</b></p>
        <p>It is an investment. When we started AI Grant in 2017, we handed out much smaller grants for fundamental
            research. We awarded grants to <a href="https://aigrant.org/fellows.html">36 individuals</a>, who
            went on to do important research, and to found companies like <a href="http://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>, <a href="https://helia.ai/">Helia</a>, and <a href="https://cresta.com/">Cresta</a>.</p>
        <p>Five years later, it seems much has changed: AI research is abundant, but UX innovation is just getting started, and so
            we&#39;re relaunching the program with a focus on AI products &amp; investments versus AI papers &amp;
            grants.</p>

        <p><b>Will you fund multiple projects working on the same thing?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. We plan to fund many companies; some form of overlap is bound to happen. Ultimately, we don&#39;t think
            this will be an issue because we strongly believe the AI product market is enormous -- large enough to
            support both Lyft and Uber or Bing and Google.</p>

        <p><b>How will you select the winners?</b></p>
        <p>We&#39;re looking for smart and energetic people with actionable ideas that are clearly useful. Demos are a
            big plus; not just because they&#39;re fun to look at, but because they hint at the type of person that
            cares about the end-user experience, which is ultimately all that matters.</p>

        <p><b>Do I need a company to apply?</b></p>
        <p>No, but you will need one if you&#39;re accepted into the program. <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> or other programs can help
            you create one in a few days. We only invest in Delaware corporations.</p>

        <p><b>Can I apply if I&#39;ve raised money already?</b></p>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <p><b>I&#39;m a single founder. Can I apply?</b></p>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <p><b>Who is funding this?</b></p>
        <p>Nat and Daniel have invested $10M in AI Grant. The company investments themselves are made by AI Grant LLC.</p>
        <p>If you are raising more than this, come talk to us directly! We&#39;re interested in great companies raising between $2M and $200M.</p>

        <p><b>I love this idea and I want to help! Can I provide additional funding, hardware, GPU time, datasets,
                mentorship, or help reviewing applications?</b></p>
        <p>Yes! Thank you for being awesome! If you want to contribute in any way, please email us at
            sponsorship@aigrant.org.</p>

        <p><b>I have further questions! How can I reach you?</b></p>

            <p><b>What will AI-first products look like?</b></p><p>
            We have some hunches, but no one knows for sure
            </p><ul>
                <li>It’s a new world; there is no map</li>
                <li>The best products will play to the strengths of this new platform</li>
                <li>They probably won&#39;t be simple wrappers on models</li>
                <li>We&#39;re interested in all good ideas, not just ones that accord with our hunches!</li>
            </ul><p>
            The copilot model: an assistant that looks over your shoulder and removes drudgery
            </p><ul>
                <li>Copilot for support, copilot for legal, copilot for sales</li>
                <li>Fine tune on your own data</li>

            </ul><p>
            Latency matters
            </p><ul>
                <li>Scaling laws tell researchers that bigger is better</li>
                <li>But big models are slow, and slow mistakes are annoying</li>
                <li>Latency/IQ/preference curve on model size is not fully understood</li>

                <li>If it&#39;s a simple bolt-on to an existing tool, they are more likely to do it</li>
                <li>But big companies are not good at inventing new products</li>
                <li>It might start as a toy, or in a small niche</li>
                <li>If it overlaps with the responsibilities of two VPs it&#39;s harder to do</li>
                <li>It might pose too much reputation risk</li>
                <li>They don’t need to build a great product; startups do</li>
