    <h1>Adding format strings to Carp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A few weeks ago I’ve added one of the more-often requested features to Carp: format strings. I’m quite proud of how they turned out, and I’d like to talk about their implementation quickly. As a little bonus, we’ll also get to talk about Carp macros.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-type-safely">Formatting, type-safely</h2>
<p>The topic of format strings has come up on <a href="https://gitter.im/carp-lang/Carp">the Gitter channel</a> ever since I joined it. Eventually, <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/issues/108">a Github issue</a> was openend, and people started voicing their opinions on the matter. It took a very long time until I felt confident I understood the problem and an even longer time until I felt that I was able to tackle it. Even then, there was a good amount of functionality missing from Carp proper that I had to add myself. Even as a Core Contributor, this is always scary. I’d rather not make any API decisions on my own when it concerns the core language.</p>
<p>Carp is by no means big enough for a commitee, so decisions are often made in a quick chat with Erik and the other stakeholders—i.e., the Carp users interested in that specific feature. This can lead to mistakes in the design of some features, and sometimes we have to iterate over a piece of functionality multiple times until we feel we are getting somewhere.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>fmt</code>, multiple different ways of making this work were voiced. I’m not sure the solution we have now is perfect, or even good, but I believe it is a good first iteration.</p>
<p>An important consideration was that while <code>printf</code> exists, it is a type-unsafe variable-argument function, and we cannot express that in Carp—at least not yet. So we needed a type-safe alternative. A fitting interface was quickly found and implemented, and then we built a macro on top of it to deliver a clean API to the user. This is what I want to disccuss.</p>
<h2 id="a-hard-days-work">A hard day’s work</h2>
<p>As alluded to above <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/pull/154">the final PR</a> was fairly big, and it broke the behavior of some existing functionality. This particular behavior wasn’t used—at least to our knowledge—, and so we consider it okay to break things; Carp is currently versioned as <code>0.2</code>, and I would discourage anyone who would like to use it in a production context<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The PR introduced a few dynamic functions to the compiler—that is, functions that are executed at compile time—, a new interface, and a new macro.</p>
<p>The interface is fairly simple: it takes a reference to a string and a generic thing and returns a string. The string is expected to be a <code>printf</code>-style format string that tells us how to print the second argument.</p>
<pre><code>(definterface format (λ [&amp;String a] String))</code></pre>
<p>

</p>
<p>Individual implementations can do whatever they please, of course, but all primitive types currently call <code>snprintf</code> under the hood. See Figure 2 for an example of how <code>format</code> is defined for integers in C.</p>
<pre><code>string Int_format(string* str, int x) {
    int n = strlen(*str) + 32;
    char *buffer = CARP_MALLOC(n+1);
    snprintf(buffer, n+1, *str, x);
    return buffer;
}</code></pre>
<p>

</p>
<p>As you can see, the C code is not quite perfect: we allocate a fixed amount of space, which is fairly wasteful. I would hope that someone who is less afraid of programming efficient standard library routines in C than I am will come along, scoff at my code, and fix it. For now I can only ask for atonement.</p>
<p>This mechanism is also not quite as easily extensible for complex Carp types; see the next section for a list of caveats.</p>
<p>This provides us with a basis on which we can build a typesafe version of <code>fmt</code>, which is just a variable-argument version of <code>format</code>. It is pretty much just <code>sprintf</code>, statically checked and pulled apart by the macro system.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how we would implement that in the macro system. Keep in mind that it is more of a fully-fledged Lisp interpreter than a regular Lisp macro system.</p>
<p>What we are going to try to do is split the string on every format instruction, honoring escapes like <code>%%</code>, and matching them up with the arguments. Then we will instruct the compiler to join the strings back together after <code>format</code> has been called on them. This results in a somewhat expensive but extensible operation, and the interface selector will ensure that it is typesafe.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a skeleton and work our way up from there.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic fmt-internal [s args]
  (let [idx (String.index-of s \%)]
    (if (= idx -1)
      (list &#39;copy s) ; no more splits found
      ; do something
    )))

(defmacro fmt [s :rest args]
  (fmt-internal s args))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: An <code>fmt</code> skeleton.
</p>
<p>Alright, now we’ve written a macro that calls a dynamic function, because we need recursion. The dynamic function checks only the base case for now: if there are no percent formatters in the string anymore we just return a copy of the string. So far, so good. The second easiest case is encountering an escaped percent sign, i.e. <code>%%</code>. Let’s take care of that.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic fmt-internal [s args]
  (let [idx (String.index-of s \%)
        len (String.count s)]
    (if (= idx -1)
      (list &#39;copy s) ; no more splits found
      (if (= \% (String.char-at s (inc idx))) ; escaped %
        (list &#39;String.append
              @&#34;%&#34;
              (fmt-internal (String.substring s (+ idx 2) len) args))
        ; other cases...
    ))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: Honoring escapes.
</p>
<p>The snippet above in Figure 4 checks whether the character after the escaper is another percent sign, and if it is, emits an append instruction with a percent sign and recurses into the next iteration of the dynamic function, with the rest of the string.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The next case is the last one: in it we intersperse an argument. If it’s the last one, we call <code>format</code> and are done with it. Let’s implement that.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic fmt-internal [s args]
  ; prelude as seen in Figure 4
  (let [next (String.index-of (String.substring s (inc idx) len) \%)]
    (if (= -1 next)
      (list &#39;format s (car args)))
      ; the long road
    ))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: Formatting, the simple case.
</p>
<p>All we have to do is check whether there is another <code>%</code> character in the rest of the string. If there isn’t, our new case takes effect. Note that I’ve omitted the other cases in Figure 5 to make the snippet a little smaller.</p>
<p>The most complicated case is as always kept for last: we emit the same format instruction, but also recurse and add an append.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic fmt-internal [s args]
  ; prelude as seen in Figure 4
  (let [next (String.index-of (String.substring s (inc idx) len) \%)]
    (if (= -1 next)
      (list &#39;format s (car args)))
      (let [slice (String.substring s 0 (+ (inc idx) next))]
        (list &#39;String.append (list &#39;format slice (car args))
                             (fmt-internal (String.substring s
                                                             (+ (inc idx) next)
                                                             len)
                                           (cdr args))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: Formatting, the complex case.
</p>
<p>Holy parentheses, batman! What are we doing here?</p>
<p>First we take the slice we currently need, which leads up to the next percent sign. Then, we emit a call to <code>format</code> with that slice and the first argument and recurse. In the end, we’ll append it all back together.</p>
<p>This is all the code we need, sans error checking. The real implementation also checks whether we have the correct number of arguments for our format string, but I’ll leave this as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>There are multiple glaring deficiencies with this implementation of <code>fmt</code>, as far as I’m concerned. First and foremost, it will result in a lot of appends on a lot of possibly tiny strings, and this sounds very costly to me. This could—and hopefully will—be resolved with a smarter algorithm; for now I felt the need to give Carp’s users a tool that scratches their itch. Next up will be an actual remedy.</p>
<p>Another deficiency as I see it is that while the tool is certainly extensible, it suffers from C’s <code>sprintf</code> syntax, especially for complex datatypes. I would like to be able to <code>format</code> a two-dimensional vector and be able to give different format specifiers to both arguments—currently this is not easily possible. Sure, you could write your own extension to C’s formatting options, but this sounds incredibly messy to me.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>In sum, <code>fmt</code> currently tries to chart uncharted territory for Carp and, unsurprisingly, does so imperfectly. I’d be happy for any kind of input, especially from users and people who’ve done something like this before<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this installment of my series on Carp. If you’re interested in contributing or just checking it out, its <a href="http://github.com/carp-lang/carp">repository</a> and the Gitter channel—linked to in the introduction—are great places to start.</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> Fun fact: I found bugs in the code while I wrote this article. That’s how alpha it is.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> A call to <code>cond</code> would make this macro a little bit prettier, but <code>cond</code> is implemented as a macro itself and thus cannot be used in the evaluator.</p>
<p><span id="3">3.</span> I’d also be up for stealing Rusts formatting syntax, but I’m not a Rust user and thus do not know the system’s upsides and downsides well enough to know whether copying it would be of merit.</p>
