    <h1>Playing with more user-friendly methods for multi-factor authentication</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I tell people I work on authentication software, I nearly always hear some version of the same story: <em>I hate multifactor authentication</em>. No, really. People hate this stuff.</p>
<p>So I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make MFA a better user experience. We don&#39;t always need MFA to be airtight, after all. Sometimes, the Google <em>match-a-number</em> MFA flow is good enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/6PGzf1QA9MmPdGuGROLY06/999c9537ea46ad84b49ab0b60549f962/google-match-a-number.png" alt="google-match-a-number-mfa"/></p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d share here my best ideas for the future of multi-factor authentication. Here they are.</p>
<h2>The big blind</h2>
<p>We like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropic_security">entropy</a> in auth factors, so it&#39;s intuitive to start with a familiar example of randomness: playing cards. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability">Wikipedia says</a> there are about 2.5 million unique poker hands.</p>
<p>That makes poker hands a compelling secondary authentication factor. Here&#39;s what a simple version of the UI could look like: challenge the user to pick exactly five cards from a set of 52.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/3xCUrdNLeEa5PKxGBwk9ht/c3ba908c45eaa1352298071ecab243ab/Group_122.png" alt="hold-em-mfa"/></p>
<p>It&#39;s incredibly easy to remember your hand. Just ask any of your friends that play poker -- they can surely remember a bad beat. And it&#39;s pretty much impossible for an attacker to guess.</p>
<h2>Cubes</h2>
<p>This one&#39;s a bit tougher than poker, but it&#39;s much less risky. (I&#39;m not sure how comfortable I am with just 2.5M possibilities). Instead of having the user pick 5 cards from a deck of 52, we have the user scramble a digital Rubik&#39;s cube.</p>
<p>Then, when the user logs back in, they just have to scramble the cube in exactly the same way. Easy. Here&#39;s what it&#39;d look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/1fWXmv48dzZ4S17C1Ppi4c/54b9980550aa09683324ad7a086dd11b/Group_152.png" alt="rubiks"/></p>
<p>We can rest easy knowing that there are roughly <a href="https://web.mit.edu/sp.268/www/rubik.pdf">4.3 x 10^19 possible configurations</a> of the cube.</p>
<h2>The Shannon number</h2>
<p>If we&#39;re looking for even <em>more</em> entropy in our auth factors, we could use chess games as an option. It&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">been estimated</a> that there are 10^120 possible chess matches. That&#39;s a nice big number.</p>
<p>Imagine this: when you set up your account, you play out a chess match. When you log back in, you play out the exact same chess match. It&#39;s like a second password! There&#39;s no chance anyone would ever guess your chess match correctly.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/31uXqGVx9ZXBFqGUJsF5cA/2390a6c4f11145906eb3c83ae4ab7ef3/Group_30__1_.png" alt="chess-based-mfa"/></p>
<p>It&#39;s clean and intuitive. Hard to beat. Plus it&#39;ll boost your chess skill.</p>
<h2>Mavis Beacon teaches auth</h2>
<p>Everyone types a little differently. We can exploit our unique typing tendencies as an auth factor. There&#39;s a simple version of this that relies solely on approximate words-per-minute (WPM), as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/1RtPOuAUMfQjZvhdxuoPa7/a7196f2220cfd04c8f2a89b5ad619f29/Group_123.png" alt="mavis-beacon-teaches-auth"/></p>
<p>If you want access to your account, all you have to do is reliably reproduce the same typing speed!</p>
<h2>Fingerprints without the hardware</h2>
<p>Biometric factors like fingerprints are perfect -- except for the fact that they generally require fancy hardware. How does a normal web app take a fingerprint as an input?</p>
<p>Well, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. You can simply <em>present the user with a fingerprint</em> and ask whether it&#39;s a match!</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/3iUrndxuJkjbHYbPRyWQx7/ccb0ca0e602c2da39c9092c19c195040/Group_149.png" alt="fingerprints-without-the-hardware"/></p>
<p>All the benefit, none of the fuss.</p>
<h2>Airgapped TOTPs</h2>
<p>Everyone still seems to use SMS-based MFA, but we all know by now that SMS opens vulnerability to <a href="https://blog.1password.com/what-is-sim-swapping/">SIM-swapping attacks</a>.</p>
<p>How do we retain the user-friendly experience of SMS MFA while protecting ourselves from its vulnerabilities? I think I have a solution. We never put our passcodes over the air. Instead, we print them onto sheets of 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; paper and route them through a trusted Postal Service.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/1LpEPJWyzvpRPfAerfpEBT/134671837717f5677d25b6831019f1cf/Snail_mail__1_.png" alt="Snail mail (1)"/></p>
<p>Maximum security.</p>
<h2>Privacy first</h2>
<p>Many of us would like to use photographs as an auth factor. We often require photographs as <a href="https://www.login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-take-photos-to-verify-your-identity/">part of onboarding</a> for certain sensitive applications (e.g., banking, ridesharing).</p>
<p>But users really don&#39;t like submitting photographs. It can feel a bit invasive. Plus, privacy considerations aside, it&#39;s just inconvenient and puts an annoying speedbump between the user and successful use of the software.</p>
<p>Good news: we don&#39;t need to grab a <em>photo</em> of the user. With today&#39;s multi-modal AI, we can simply infer identities from self-portrait.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/1ttPg2z5ffRXmXMd6LyOMG/032463d351bc131b1d079637da531b32/Group_154.png" alt="Group 154"/></p>
<p>With self-portraits, we get two distinct vectors of comparison: first, we can evaluate the portrait for its similarity to the user&#39;s real appearance; second, we can evaluate the portrait for the user&#39;s skill level.</p>
<p>That stuff is hard to fake!</p>
<h2>Of me I sing</h2>
<p>Biometric auth based on users&#39; voices used to be reliable, but now it&#39;s too <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning">easy to spoof</a> with AI tools. But AI still has a tough time singing as poorly as normal people do -- that&#39;s why Karaoke Auth is the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/3lSWwnJfSwLSiUjbBd1L7V/c62bfe0edaa2470f02eccf35bd6d8d6b/Group_153.png" alt="Group 153"/></p>
<p>The user just has to pick a song and belt it out. For anyone thinking of implementing karaoke-based auth, I will caution you: it is <strong>critical</strong> to require the user to finish the entire song. Song fragments do not generate sufficient samples to protect against fraud.</p>
<h2>Phone a friend</h2>
<p>We can borrow an innovation from the Web3 crowd. Instead of sending a code to <em>your</em> email (predictable, boring, lame), the system sends a code to a randomly-selected relative. Like an uncle!</p>
<p>The user just has to help their uncle access a 22-year-old Hotmail account before the passcode expires (upon expiry, the system will select a different relative at random).</p>
<h2>ToothFA</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://dentistmckinneytexas.com/blog/unique-dental-records-fingerprint-comparison/">Pecan Tree Family Dentistry of McKinney, TX</a>, our teeth are as unique as our fingerprints! If you&#39;re a fan of police procedurals, you&#39;re probably acquainted with this idea.</p>
<p>This is just advanced biometrics with no specialized hardware needed. Anyone with a modern smartphone can quickly and easily take a real-time scan of their teeth.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/5vY5QrcMPmPCDWqDV6oUCt/302424525cc2922498e84d7a64995114/Group_142.png" alt="dental-records"/></p>
<p>No need for any of that complicated passkey nonsense. Just stick your phone in your mouth.</p>
<h2>LLM auth</h2>
<p>LLMs are taking over. They&#39;re writing our code, answering our phones, and responding to our tweets. They&#39;re the future of everything.</p>
<p>Auth is no exception. Disruption is coming. In anticipation of an LLM-native future, we&#39;ve designed the world&#39;s first LLM-based auth factor. It&#39;s radically simple: to access your account, you just have to convince the AI to let you in.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/5JddvIFvCdS91nQ9QsMA0X/bd9498ba5f95a76d343d784b13a97e25/Group_143.png" alt="auth-ai"/></p>
<p>There&#39;s no hard-to-remember secret. There&#39;s no secondary devices. It&#39;s just the familiar chat UI we know and trust. Future proof.</p>
<h2>Stockfish</h2>
<p>Oh, yeah, I have another chess-based auth factor. It&#39;s too hard for most of us to remember an entire chess opening. Instead, we can play against a chess <em>engine</em> and let the computer guess our skill level (as measured by ELO).</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/3sDmzFeBN9BY5cvu4sPQpK/5ac5c6a83e10a378df688f556b85bdd1/Group_144.png" alt="stockfish-auth"/></p>
<p>It&#39;s impossible to brute force. You really have to play the game.</p>
<h2>Cinemauth</h2>
<p>With just a quick OAuth grant from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a>, any app can implement the Cinemauth standard.</p>
<p>You just challenge the user to make pairwise comparisons between a series of films. Pretty quickly, you accumulate a strict ordering. When you have a strict ordering, you ping Letterboxd for feedback: <em>does this ordering accurately represent my user&#39;s preferences?</em></p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/sOOYuMrOYM8BHgVI14mZy/b5e2124acd10a6774b332fa474cb161e/Group_155.png" alt="Group 155"/></p>
<p>This is the power of identity federation at scale.</p>
<h2>Cinemauth for Enterprise</h2>
<p>The Cinemauth standard isn&#39;t suitable for enterprise applications. No CISO wants a bunch of consumer Letterboxd accounts governing access to their environment.</p>
<p>The solution is simple. We replace consumer data with enterprise data. We replace the strict ordering of <em>movies</em> with <em>coworkers</em>. There&#39;s no need to sync up with some random third-party application. You can just use the HRIS you already have!</p>
<p>You just need to hire a consultancy to implement a custom Workday app (roughly a $2M investment) to support Cinemauth for Enterprise. It&#39;ll also totally work properly forever. There&#39;s no chance that it&#39;ll devolve into a disastrous mess.</p>
<p>Just think of how elegant the UI could be:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/6KQ2J9aE8FYkHDUbM4yj7v/600f665a23156a82ed22bd4535b9edba/Group_146.png" alt="cinemauth-enterprise"/></p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Just don&#39;t show the results to the guy who heats up fish in the microwave; he might quit.</p>
<h2>Is it ... Ethan? Jackson? Liam?</h2>
<p>As with Cinemauth for Enterprise, this one requires an upfront investment. You need to build a database of your employees&#39; children (ask for forgiveness, not permission).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works: each user of the app sees a picture of a coworker&#39;s child, ideally one that&#39;s mentioned several times every week.</p>
<p>The user just has to correctly name the child! If they&#39;ve been paying attention to their coworkers&#39; anecdotes, this one shouldn&#39;t be tough at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/336y06gasq8n/7KA2Zz5q4xso1V388T4ZOf/c1ea8fc43726525f2c4feb2cf8be913f/Group_147.png" alt="whos-that-child"/></p>
<p>Easy for a considerate colleague, impossible for attackers.</p>

<p>Creativity in authentication is usually a bad idea. There&#39;s no reason to reinvent the stuff that works. Just pick something off the shelf -- like Tesseral! It&#39;s the only open source auth designed specifically for business software.</p></div></div>
