Sent to Jamie Gauther:

I've been a neighborhood homeowner since 2008 and I am against this
historic designation and against historic designations in general.

Our city has a housing shortage and homelessness problem.  There is
only one way out of this terrible situation: we must build more
housing.

The historic designation is an attempt by wealthy incumbent landowners
to prop up the value of real estate they already own, by further
restricting the supply of new housing.

It is a selfish and short-sighted policy that will be bad for
neighborhood, bad for local business, and bad for our citizens.
