    <h1>&#39;Entire ecosystem&#39; of fossils 8.7M years old found under Los Angeles high school</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Marine fossils dating back to as early as 8.7m years ago have been uncovered beneath a south <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Los Angeles</a> high school.</p><p>On Friday, the Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-13/a-huge-deposit-of-marine-fossils-found-under-san-pedro-high-school" data-link-name="in body link">reported</a> that researchers had discovered two sites on the campus of San Pedro high school under which fossils including those of a saber-toothed salmon and a megalodon, the gigantic prehistoric shark, were buried.</p><p>According to the outlet, the two sites where the fossils were found include an 8.7m-year-old bone bed from the Miocene era and a 120,000-year-old shell bed from the Pleistocene era.</p><p>The discoveries were made between June 2022 and July 2024, LAist <a href="https://laist.com/news/education/san-pedro-high-school-fossils-discovered-los-angeles-unified-lausd" data-link-name="in body link">reports</a>.</p><p>In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Richard Behl, a California State University at Long Beach geologist, said that researchers were testing the chemical and mineral composition of the fossils.</p><p>“We got to find clues and piece those clues together,” Behl said, adding that fossils from the Miocene era were encased in diatomite, a sedimentary rock <a href="https://www.imerys.com/minerals/diatomite" data-link-name="in body link">composed</a> of the fossilized skeletal remains of single-cell aquatic algae. According to Behl, the diatomite indicates that the area was rich with algae, which helped foster a rich ecosystem that comprised various marine creatures.</p><p>Echoing Behl, Wayne Bischoff, the director of cultural resources at Envicom Corporation, told LAist: “It’s the entire ecosystem from an age that’s gone … We have all this evidence to help future researchers put together what an entire ecology looked like nine million years ago. That’s really rare.”</p><figure id="1047bdc0-7d23-4de0-9010-f4015fa4229a" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div
