president and core developer with this European award for his long-term
dedication to the project. What began as a student initiative has,
through his continuous effort, evolved into one of the most widely used
media players, with billion of users worldwide.</p><figure><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/68/bb/19908b5778f4dbc90c2c4b36d90b.jpg" alt=" SFSCON participants posing for a photo with the European SFS Award winner, the president of VLC.

User Group Bolzano‑Bozen (LUGBZ), is proud to recognize Jean-Baptiste
Kempf with the European SFS Award 2025, in recognition of his
outstanding and lasting contributions to the Free Software movement and
his long-term dedication to the VLC project.</p><p>Born as a student project in 1996, this software has evolved into an
essential, all-in-one media player that plays almost anything
effortlessly. Originally a simple network streaming client, it has grown
into a powerful universal media player that continues to evolve and
impress. </p><p>“For many people running non-free operating systems, it was the very
first Free Software they ever installed. For many people running Free
Software, it saved them from installing and booting into a proprietary
operating system”, declared Matthias Kirschner, president of the FSFE
during the Award ceremony. </p><p>Jean-Baptiste Kempf joined the project as a student, and when it
faced the risk of dying after the graduation of its original developers,
he took the reins. With the help of other core developers, he
transformed it into the indispensable media player we rely on today.</p><p>Over the years, Kempf has become not only the president of the
VideoLAN non-profit but also one of the lead developers of VLC Media
Player and the founder of VideoLabs. “It’s small, fast, friendly, and
seems to &#34;understand everything you throw at it. I have always thought
of it as &#34;the program that eats everything&#34;, said Raphael Barbieri, a
member of LUGBZ, during the winner’s announcement. </p><blockquote>&#34;I am extremely honoured to receive the European SFS Award. The Free
Software multimedia community is quite niche and unknown, but we work
hard so that video content can be free, can be played and processed. The
work done around the VideoLAN community has been tremendous, despite its
little resources. I want to thank the whole VideoLAN and FFmpeg teams,
who spend their time on those projects, often with little recognition&#34;, <cite>
declares Jean-Baptiste Kemp</cite>.</blockquote><h3 id="id-the-european-sfs-award">The European SFS Award</h3><p>The European SFS Award recognizes individuals whose work has made a         
significant and sustained difference in advancing Free Software across
Europe. Since 2023 it is presented jointly by LUGBZ and the FSFE and      
honours those whose efforts strengthen software freedom, community      
building, and the ethical foundations of technology.</p><p>In previous years, the award was given to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2023/news-20231110-01.en.html">Frank
Karlitschek (2023) for his leadership with Nextcloud</a>, and
posthumously to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20241108-01.en.html">Bram
Moolenaar (2024) for creating the Vim editor</a>.</p><h3 id="id-2025-laudatio">2025 Laudatio</h3><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>There’s a program most of
us have used - on laptops, phones, tablets or desktops computers. It
might have run on screens in supermarkets or shops. It’s small, fast,
friendly, and seems to &#34;understand everything you throw at it&#34;. I have
always thought of it as &#34;the program that eats everything.&#34;</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>This amazing software did
not come from a giant technology company with a huge budget. It began
more than twenty years ago - as a modest experiment by a few students at
an engineering school. They wanted to solve a problem they identified.
Nothing fancy - just a student project to tinker, experiment, share, and
have fun. No one knew that those first lines of code written for
“network 2000” would one day reach billions of users.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>Like many student
projects, it almost faded away when graduation came and the contributors
had other priorities. But one young engineer, who had joined the group
in 2000, refused to let it die. He reorganised the code, inspired new
contributors, and slowly turned a university experiment into a
world-class piece of software. </p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>He built a healthy
community fostering the software. Hundreds of volunteers joined. They
contributed by programming, testing, auditing, helping others, with
translations, improving the design, or promoting the software. Thereby
the community grew and people started using the software on every
platform – GNU/Linux and other Unix like operating systems, Windows,
Android, or MacOS and iOS. For many people running non-free operating
systems, it was the very first Free Software they ever installed. For
many people running Free Software, it saved them from installing and
booting into a proprietary operating system.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>With this success our
winner was offered tempting deals - big money, advertising, corporate
buyouts. Every time, he gently said no. Because it was not about
maximising profit. It was about maximising freedom for computer
users.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>To protect that freedom,
he later founded a non-profit organisation - so the software would
always belong to its community. He also founded a company to support the
technical side - keeping development professional while staying true to
the values of software freedom. Under his leadership, the initiative has
reached billions of downloads, maintained and added amazing features -
all without losing its soul.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>And there’s another thing
this community is famous for - its sense of humour. Their symbol? A
bright orange-and-white traffic cone. Legend has it that the original
students used to collect these cones after late nights out. When it came
time to pick a logo, they chose it proudly - a playful symbol of
creativity, chaos, and collaboration.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>Nowadays, that little
cone has become an icon you find on a huge amount of computers
worldwide. At conferences their contributors wear the cones on their
heads with pride as a clear sign of who they are and what they stand
for.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>And the person behind it?
He’s not just a brilliant engineer. He’s a leader, a mentor, and a true
advocate for software freedom. In 2018, his contributions were honoured
with the title of <strong><strong>Chevalier de l’Ordre National du
Mérite</strong></strong> - the first Free Software developer ever to
receive that distinction. Yes - a real knight of software freedom.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>His “Holy Grail” was not
fame or fortune - it’s <em><em>freedom</em></em>: the freedom for
billions of people to watch, listen, and share multimedia files without
restrictions or surveillance. He has shown the world that integrity,
community, and a bit of humour can change how we experience digital
media.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>Today, we celebrate
someone who has made it possible for all of us to enjoy open, universal
access to media - and who continues to prove that Free Software is
powerful, beautiful, and fun.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>It is our great pleasure
to present the <strong><strong>European SFS Award 2025</strong></strong>
to the president of the VideoLAN non-profit, one of the lead developers
of VLC media player, the founder of VideoLabs, the bearer of the traffic
cone, and a true knight of Free Software....</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias &amp; Raphael: Jean-Baptiste
Kempf!</strong></strong></p></div></div></div>
