    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are few people I’ve worked as closely with as <a href="https://trashmoon.com/">Saman Bemel Benrud</a>. We built a lot of stuff together at Mapbox, from <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD">iD</a> to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a>. But he was insistent that after this job, he was going to make games and comics. No more tech rocket ships.</p><p>He’s gone and done it. Saman, along with Micah Fitch and Tom Lubanovic, released <a href="https://wilderplace.place/">Wilderplace</a> today. It’s an endlessly creative turn-based adventure game.</p><p><img alt="Wilderplace screenshot" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-09-wilderplace-wilderplace-screenshot.png"/></p><p>It’s been in the works since 2019, and has all the marks of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk">gesamkunstwerk</a>. Everything is handmade, from the hand-drawn animations to the fonts, which Saman <a href="https://github.com/samanpwbb/wilderplace-fonts">created from scratch and released on GitHub</a>.</p><p><img alt="Wilderplace font 1" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-09-wilderplace-wilderplace-font-1.png"/></p><p>Micah wrote a soundtrack that organically combines motifs as you progress through the game, and uses the still pretty cutting-edge web audio tech to emulate synthesizers.</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="320" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzveRYP1tUA" title="YouTube video player" width="640"></iframe><p>I’ve been lucky to play beta versions of the game, but it’s progressed really far in the last year. You can play it with a game controller, it has this inventory system, it’s all a pretty impressive technical achievement, on top of a fun game. And now it’s released, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769640/Wilderplace/">buy it on Steam</a> or check out <a href="https://wilderplace.place/">wilderplace.place</a>.</p><p><img alt="End" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-09-wilderplace-end.png"/></p></div></div>
