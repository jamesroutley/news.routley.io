    <h1>Emacs Solo: A Surprise System Crafters Live Demo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Last Friday, I was genuinely surprised by a live demo of my <strong>Emacs
Solo</strong> configuration on the <strong>System Crafters Weekly Show</strong>. Watching
the live demo was an eye-opener, as I hadn&#39;t expected the project to
get such attention, especially in a live setting. Seeing <strong>David
Wilson</strong> take a deep dive into the setup, testing the configuration
live, and exploring how powerful Emacs can be with only its built-in
packages was both humbling and inspiring.</p>
<p>For more details and to explore the configuration yourself, visit the
<a href="https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-solo/">Emacs Solo GitHub
repository</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Emacs Solo</strong> configuration is all about returning to the roots
of Emacs. It&#39;s a minimalist setup designed to challenge myself and
test the full potential of Emacs using only its built-in
functionality. The goal was to create an efficient, yet fully
functional environment, all while keeping things as light and fast as
possible. No external dependencies, no clutter. Just pure,
unadulterated Emacs.</p>
<h3>The Project: Emacs Solo</h3>
<p><strong>Emacs Solo</strong> is a configuration that embraces the power of Emacs
without relying on external packages. It&#39;s a setup I go back to from
time to time to remind myself of how much can be accomplished with
just what Emacs offers out of the box.</p>
<p>This configuration is designed to be both powerful and lightweight,
allowing for a fast, efficient workflow with a focus on simplicity and
minimalism. The project includes several useful features for
day-to-day tasks like searching, editing, and navigating—everything
you need for an efficient Emacs experience.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the project include:</p>
<p>» A preview of <code>icomplete-verical</code> enhancements I proposed to the
Emacs core team (custom prefixes, vertico style setup, and inline
completion closer to corfu/company that works on text buffers and
eshell).</p>
<p>» An experimental custom <code>git-gutter-like</code> feature.</p>
<p>» Supercharged eshell customization.</p>
<p>» Custom solutions for editing multiple search entries.</p>
<p>» Built-in news readers like Gnus and Newsticker.</p>
<p>» Advanced file diffing and version control.</p>
<p>» Extended viper mode for those who prefer vim-style editing.</p>
<p>» Tree-sitter modes.</p>
<p>» LSP configurations.</p>
<p>» Custom <code>rainbown-mode</code> like.</p>
<p>» And many customizations of built-in packages.</p>
<p>The idea is that Emacs is already a powerful IDE, and with a bit of
clever customization, it can be made into something even more
streamlined, adaptable, and effective without the need for external
packages.</p>
<h3>Watch the Demo</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s the video of the live demo from the <strong>System Crafters Weekly
Show</strong>:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’d like to take this opportunity to thank <strong>David Wilson</strong> for the
amazing show and to the <strong>System Crafters</strong> community for their
continued support and enthusiasm around Emacs. I also want to express
my gratitude to everyone who has contributed code that I’ve borrowed
and learned from over the years. Particularly <strong>Gopar</strong> and
<strong>Protesilaos</strong>. Without the shared knowledge and experience from
these fantastic people, the <strong>Emacs Solo</strong> project wouldn&#39;t have been
possible.</p>
<p>As always, the beauty of Emacs lies in its community, and I&#39;m grateful
for all the inspiration, contributions, and shared wisdom that make
projects like <strong>Emacs Solo</strong> come to life. Thank you to everyone who
continues to inspire and teach me along the way.</p>
