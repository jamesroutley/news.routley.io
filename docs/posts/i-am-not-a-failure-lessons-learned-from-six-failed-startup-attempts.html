    <h1>I am (not) a failure: Lessons learned from six failed startup attempts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7789507364826615271" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>A while back <a href="https://blog.rongarret.info/2024/12/i-have-failed-now-what.html" target="_blank">I wrote</a>:</p><blockquote>I&#39;ve had many, many failures in my life.  (Hm, maybe I should write a blog post about that.)</blockquote><p>This is that post.  I&#39;m writing it not as a lament, but rather because I&#39;ve ended up in a good place in life despite my extraordinary track record of failing at just about everything I&#39;ve ever tried.  If my younger self had heard these stories he might 
have had a less stressful life knowing that even a long string of 
failures in specific endeavors doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to
failure in life.  Maybe some version of my younger self is still out there and will get some similar value out of it.</p><h3>Intro<br/></h3><p>Growing up, I had two major life ambitions: to become a tenured university professor, and to found a successful startup company.  My role models were people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks" target="_blank">Rodney Brooks</a> (who was on my Ph.D. thesis committee) who made a big splash in the AI/Robotics world in the early 1990s with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture" target="_blank">Subsumption Architecture</a>, and was a co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Inc." target="_blank">Lucid</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot" target="_blank">iRobot</a>.</p><h3>Failure #0: Professor Ron</h3><p>In elementary school, my ambition was to be a doctor, specifically a brain surgeon.  That dream died in high school biology class when we had to dissect fetal pigs and I discovered that I was a lot more squeamish than I had thought.  So I traded my surgical scrubs for a computer keyboard and set my sights on AI instead.  Fast-forward to 1991, when a freshly minted PH.D. started sending out curriculum vitae (that&#39;s academic-speak for &#34;resumes&#34;) to CS departments.  Unfortunately, my timing could not have been worse.  It was the height of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_setbacks_of_the_late_1980s_and_early_1990s" target="_blank">AI Winter</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">first Bush recession</a>, and the few universities that were hiring were getting hundreds of applications for single openings.  My publication record was not great.  I hadn&#39;t published a single journal article.  My <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1867135.1867260" target="_blank">main conference publication</a> (PDF is <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/papers/aaai92.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) was well received, but (apparently) insufficiently academic for academia.  I didn&#39;t even get an interview.</p><h3>Failure #1: FlowNet</h3><p>I spent the summer of 1990 as a visiting graduate student in Rodney Brooks&#39;s lab at MIT.  While there I met a brilliant hardware engineer named Mike Ciholas, who went on to found <a href="https://www.ciholas.com/" target="_blank">a company</a> that today employs dozens of people and bears his name.  He pitched an idea to me for a new design for a computer network that he called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/327728.327731" target="_blank">FlowNet</a> (full text is <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/fnlj.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  We built working prototypes.  If they had gone into production they would have had more than an order of magnitude price-performance advantage over the competition at the time.  We had numerous meetings with VC&#39;s, but none of them ever gave us a term sheet, probably because they knew what we did not: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet" target="_blank">Fast Ethernet</a> was coming, and although it would be expensive at first, it would quickly get commodified and beat out any potential competition no matter how technically superior it might be.  We built our prototypes in 1993.  Fast Ethernet came out in 1995.  We folded up the tent in 1997.</p><h3>Interlude: Google</h3><p>In 2000 I went to work for <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">an obscure little Silicon Valley startup company</a>.  I&#39;ve told <a href="https://blog.rongarret.info/2009/12/xooglers-rises-from-ashes.html" target="_blank">that story</a> elsewhere so I won&#39;t tell it again, but I wanted to mention it for two reasons.  First, it sets the stage for what was to come, and second, while it was unquestionably a success, it was not <i>my</i> success.  In fact, on a personal level I count Google as a failure as well.  My tenure there was marked by a long series of screwups, and I had a serious case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">impostor syndrome</a>.    I lasted a year, but after that I went back to JPL to bide my time until the IPO.<br/></p><h3>Failure #2: IndieBuyer</h3><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Google#Financing_and_initial_public_offering" target="_blank">Google IPO</a> allowed me to quit JPL and pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions more seriously.  With the benefit of hindsight I should have moved to Northern California and hung out at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a>, but I had lived in Los Angeles for 17 years at that point, which was longer than any place else I had ever lived before by a wide margin.  By my standards at the time, I had deep roots there.  I have also always had a love for magic and movies, and Los Angeles was the epicenter of both of those industries.  So I decided to try to do something in the entertainment space.</p><h3>Failure #2.5: Evryx</h3><p>This is the half-failure alluded to in the title.  I count it as half a failure because, although I was actively involved, I was not a founder.  Evryx (which eventually rebranded itself as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvWV4W4r4io" target="_blank">SnapNow</a>) was founded by another engineer at JPL.  The company was an early pioneer in reverse image search.  It used an algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform" target="_blank">SIFT</a> to match an image taken with a cell phone to a library of stored images and provide information about whatever was in the image.  I was never entirely clear on what the business model was intended to be, but the technology seemed cool.  I happened to mention it in passing to a friend of mine whom I had met at a political fundraiser.  He looked into it and got sufficiently excited about it to become their CEO.  The founder became CTO.</p><h3>Failure #3: iCab</h3><p>In 2009 my wife and I took a cruise around the Pacific rim.  At one point we ended up in Saigon and needed to get back to the cruise ship, but couldn’t find a taxi.  I thought to myself: this place is chock-full of taxi drivers, all of whom have cell phones, and many of whom have smart phones.  Someone should write an app that would let me broadcast the fact that I&#39;m standing in this location looking for a ride.  It was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber" target="_blank">the exact same idea at the exact same time</a>.  I founded a company called iCab, and they founded a company called Ubercab, which eventually changed its name to Uber.</p><h3>Failure #4: Virgin Charter (nee Smart Charter)</h3><p>In 2010 my wife and I decided to get an apartment in Santa Monica so we could spend more time by the beach.  I started hanging out in the offices of a venture capital firm with an office on the <a href="https://www.santamonica.com/experience-santa-monica/neighborhoods/downtown-santa-monica-3rd-street-promenade/" target="_blank">Third Street Promenade</a>.  One day a fellow named Scott Duffy walked into the office and asked if he could hire us to do due diligence on an acquisition he was considering.  I don&#39;t remember the name of the company, but it collected business intelligence on the private aviation industry.</p><h3>Failure #5: Founder&#39;s Forge</h3><p>After being stung so hard by the private jet fiasco, I decided to design a business that I could run entirely without partners.   This was around the time that Bitcoin first appeared, though it would still be many, many years before it broke out of hacker circles and into public awareness.  I had always been interested in cryptography, and there were parts of Bitcoin&#39;s technology that I found very appealing, particularly its use of public-key cryptography and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" target="_blank">digital signatures</a>.  I foresaw increasing problems with <a href="https://blog.rongarret.info/2013/02/a-simple-solution-to-credit-card-fraud.html" target="_blank">credit card fraud</a> because of the fact that the protocol was fundamentally broken: the credentials that you use to authorize a transaction are not bound to that transaction.  They can be re-used.  This is still the basis of most credit card fraud today, and it&#39;s the reason your card has a chip in it.  That chip has a secret key in it, and it computes digital signatures.  That makes it impossible to re-use the authorization for one transaction on a different transaction, and makes the credentials in general harder (but still not impossible) to steal.</p><p>I knew that the banks controlled the credit card system, and I knew they comprised a massive, ossified industry that was going to be next to impossible to penetrate.  So I came up with a plan that would hide the fact that I was trying to solve credit card fraud by presenting it as a completely different product addressing a completely different problem and market.</p><h3>Failure #6: Spark Innovations</h3><p>I don&#39;t actually remember exactly how my last company got started.  I did this one with a partner who handled the business side of things, but was also a really good designer and front-end developer, so we made a kick-ass team.  The product was motivated by the observation that people used Microsoft Excel for purposes that it was never really intended to serve.  In particular, people tended to use it as a replacement for a SQL database.  The idea was to build a product with a spreadsheet-like UI, but with a SQL database on the back end.  We had three launch customers lined up, all of whom seemed to be very excited about the idea.  While we were building the MVP we had a previously scheduled meeting with a VC acquaintance.  We told him what we were working on, not really intending it to be a pitch, but just FYI.  In one of those legendary Silicon-Valley moments he got so excited about the idea that he asked us to let him invest just to get a foot in the door.  We didn&#39;t really want to take any money until after we launched, but he insisted, so we capitulated.</p>
