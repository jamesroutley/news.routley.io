We&#39;ve been listening and are excited to announce that the day has finally arrived - today marks the launch of the public alpha version of the Hoppscotch Desktop App for macOS, Windows, and Linux!</p><p>You can get started with the Hoppscotch Desktop App right away.</p><p><a href="https://hoppscotch.com/download">Download Hoppscotch Desktop App</a></p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-1.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></section><section><p>Just over a year ago, we shared our ambitious plans to develop a dedicated desktop app that would enhance your API testing and development experience. The journey from that exciting announcement to this moment has been a labor of love, dedication, and countless lines of code. Today, we are thrilled to give you the first public glimpse of our hard work.</p><p>Hoppscotch has become one of the most loved API testing clients. Hoppscotch enables developers and testers to quickly get started with API testing using our web-based API client and PWA.</p><p>Our team spent months working on the desktop app because we wanted to create the best-performing API testing client out there - a desktop app that can run on any machine, with no compromise to our values!</p><p>Hoppscotch Desktop is a major step forward in our mission to build an API development ecosystem. With its ridiculously fast performance and easy-to-use interface, Hoppscotch Desktop is the app you need for your API development.</p><h4>Game-Changer for API Testing</h4><p>The Hoppscotch Desktop app is built on the robust Tauri framework using Rust, which redefines the API client experience. With its lightning-fast load times and minimal memory footprint, the app ensures seamless API interactions without compromising your system&#39;s resources.</p><p>To test how fast Hoppscotch really is, we ran a performance benchmark on a Windows 11 machine with an ARM64 VM, comparing Postman, Insomnia, and Hoppscotch.</p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-2.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/><p>*Benchmark is done using AppTimer on Windows 11 on an arm64 VM, for 30 iterations with 2 second cooldown in between iterations. The value provided is the mean time measured over the iterations. One run is counted as the time from when the execution starts till the window becomes responsive after all the loading.</p></section><section><p>Hoppscotch is 10x faster than Postman and 6x faster than Insomnia in terms of startup time. There&#39;s a lot more optimizing to be done and we believe Hoppscotch will only get faster with time.</p><p>The Hoppscotch app is also lightweight when it comes to file size. This aligns with our founding philosophy that anyone should be able to get started with API testing on any machine. The Hoppscotch Desktop app is 20x lighter than Insomnia and 15x lighter than Postman when it comes to file size!</p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-3.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></section><section><p>Security is paramount for us, and the Hoppscotch app takes this seriously. By default, Hoppscotch is sandboxed, safeguarding your system from malware and other potential security threats, and offering a worry-free experience.</p><p>The Hoppscotch Desktop app doesn&#39;t just meet expectations, it sets new standards in performance, optimization, and security.</p><h4>Here&#39;s a Cookie</h4><p>With the desktop app, you can now have cookie support for your requests. With the new Cookie Manager, you can add a domain and specify all the cookies that are under that domain. To add a cookie, simply click on the &#34;Add cookie&#34; button and edit the pre-generated cookie string or paste an entirely new one.</p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-4.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></section><section><hr/><h4>Get Hoppscotch Desktop App now!</h4><p>For this alpha release, Hoppscotch is now available for download on macOS (Intel &amp; Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux. You can download the latest release here on our website.</p></section><section><a href="https://hoppscotch.com/download"><img src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-5.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></a></section><section><p>*The Hoppscotch Desktop App is currently in alpha. This means that it is not yet feature-complete and may contain bugs. We are actively working on improving the app and adding new features. You may encounter bugs and issues while using the app. If you do, please report them on our <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve installed the desktop app, you can use Hoppscotch with or without an account. If you don&#39;t want to create an account, all your data will be stored locally.</p><p>With an account, you can interact with our Hoppscotch Cloud instance to collaborate with your team in testing and developing APIs. In your personal workspace, you have the option to choose what you sync with our cloud server. If cloud sync is disabled, then all the data is cached on the desktop app.</p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-6.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></section><section><p>The Hoppscotch desktop app has unlocked a lot of possibilities for what we can achieve. Some potential possibilities include local file-based workspaces and making the desktop app interact with Hoppscotch Cloud as well as your own self-hosted instance of Hoppscotch.</p><p>Hoppscotch Desktop App is set to redefine how you work with APIs. We invite you to explore and experience the speed and efficiency it offers. Let&#39;s embark on this new chapter together and revolutionize the way you interact with APIs.</p><hr/><h4>A Fresh New Look and Identity</h4><p>Hoppscotch has now grown beyond being just an alternative product. Our vision today is to build an ecosystem of tools around the entire API development lifecycle, and we have already started building the foundation for this.</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce a significant milestone for Hoppscotch - the unveiling of our new brand identity. This rebranding is a reflection of the tremendous growth and evolution that our organization has experienced.</p></section><section><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-7.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://hoppscotch.com/images/blog-introducing-hoppscotch-desktop-application-8.png" width="352" height="198" alt="News 01"/></section><section><p>Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey as we introduce the Hoppscotch Desktop App as well as our new brand identity.
