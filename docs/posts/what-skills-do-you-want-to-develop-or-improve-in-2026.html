    <h1>Ask HN: What skills do you want to develop or improve in 2026?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Thread for 2025: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42509408">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42509408</a></p><p>Thread for 2024: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38782613">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38782613</a></p><p>Thread for 2023: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33873800">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33873800</a></p><p>Here are mine:</p><p>Technical skills:</p><p>- Among my last year&#39;s goals was to take on VR dev, which sadly I did not get to. Punting it to 2026. I&#39;m thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.</p><p>- Complete the &#34;UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering&#34; computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)</p><p>- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It&#39;s time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.</p><p>- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework/concept is phenomenal.</p><p>Non-technical skills:</p><p>- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!</p></div></div></div>
