    <h1>Doom, the Gallery Experience</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="community_topic_posts_355911"><div id="community_post_list_73725"><div id="post-11751267" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:7937482,&#34;id&#34;:11751267}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/jazzcorp"></a><div><p> The lone painting “ME” is by far the most visually articulate piece in the whole collection. *Sip*. Wile called “me” as if to stipulate a state of self absorption, in fact mocks this notion by portraying the individual as small and vulnerable, almost hiding in the corner of the painting. *Sip*. The vast body of water clearly shallow to suggest the lack of depth of the modern world, wile the water its self, the mass of the human experience, is clear, pure incapable of false hood. *Sip*. The individual is shown in a state of ambiguity, are they being born from this contradiction or are they submitting to death, returning to the watery womb of the human condition. *Sip*. The question the piece ask is… is there truly a difference….. **SIP**.

I find it simple, yet, *swishes glass in hand* it identifies how to hit its intent perfectly. *sips wine* In that sense one might say it is very elegant within its design aims. Excellent! *sips wine but swallows it wrong and starts coughing violently*<br/></p></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11751012" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:121925,&#34;id&#34;:11751012}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/papercookies"></a><div><p>I concur, this game really evokes the duality of man!</p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-11747247" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:6294523,&#34;id&#34;:11747247}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/philnemba"></a><div><div dir="auto"><p>The most exquisite wad I&#39;ve ever download!</p>

A simple start that works for me is to think &#34;what would cause <em>me </em>to make this decision&#34; and work backwards from there.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-11746383" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:3626005,&#34;id&#34;:11746383}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/dazmaz"></a><div><p>Truly a place of culture and elegance.</p></div></div></div><div id="post-11744257" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:7281461,&#34;id&#34;:11744257}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/theoneandonly-sosiglord"></a><div><p>it said virus detected should i be worried</p></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11747194" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:5590987,&#34;id&#34;:11747194}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/bobatealee"></a><div><p>No. Windows just shows a warning because it&#39;s an unsigned application.

<p>I know you have a GitHub for this thing, but, I suppose, it was made in Construct 3, and that soft doesn&#39;t allow you to export the project in a free version. Otherwise I&#39;d done it myself. Either way, I&#39;ve been quite hoping for something like a Node.js version...<br/></p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11740126" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:5590987,&#34;id&#34;:11740126}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/bobatealee"></a><div><div dir="auto"><p>This is primarily meant to be experienced on web as it was a student project, but I can sure offer a standalone .EXE<br/></p><p>EDIT: Should be ready to go<br/></p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11740472" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:8865883,&#34;id&#34;:11740472}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/mget"></a><div><p>can you please remove the standalone version</p></div></div></div><div id="post-11740734" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:4298274,&#34;id&#34;:11740734}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/ross-r"></a><div><div dir="auto"><p>Oh, thank you so very much.
