Perhaps you could put the mysterious gin in it?</p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11757416" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:5590987,&#34;id&#34;:11757416}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/bobatealee"></a><div><p>Leaving this secret out was a conscious decision–this was a student project made from scratch in two weeks, and I didn&#39;t have the time to figure out elevator physics.

Wile called “me” as if to stipulate a state of self absorption, in fact mocks this notion by portraying the individual as small and vulnerable, almost hiding in the corner of the painting. *Sip*. The vast body of water clearly shallow to suggest the lack of depth of the modern world, wile the water its self, the mass of the human experience, is clear, pure incapable of false hood. *Sip*. The individual is shown in a state of ambiguity, are they being born from this contradiction or are they submitting to death, returning to the watery womb of the human condition. *Sip*. The question the piece ask is… is there truly a difference….. **SIP**.

I find it simple, yet, *swishes glass in hand* it identifies how to hit its intent perfectly. *sips wine* In that sense one might say it is very elegant within its design aims. Excellent! *sips wine but swallows it wrong and starts coughing violently*<br/></p></div></div></div><div><div id="post-11751012" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:121925,&#34;id&#34;:11751012}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/papercookies"></a><div><p>I concur, this game really evokes the duality of man!</p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-11747247" data-post="{&#34;user_id&#34;:6294523,&#34;id&#34;:11747247}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/philnemba"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://itch.io/profile/philnemba">Philnemba</a></span><span title="2025-01-05 18:17:45"><a href="https://itch.io/post/11747247">1 day ago</a></span> <span>(2 edits)</span> <span><span>(+2)</span><span>(-1)</span></span></p></div><div><div dir="auto"><p>The most exquisite wad I&#39;ve ever download!</p>

<p>I know you have a GitHub for this thing, but, I suppose, it was made in Construct 3, and that soft doesn&#39;t allow you to export the project in a free version. Otherwise I&#39;d done it myself.
