Look what happened here: As productivity increased, demand initially followed. But after some time, it plateaued. </p><p>If you focus for example on the textile workers, automation dramatically reduced the cost of producing clothing. Early on, workers needed many days to produce a piece of clothing, so they were very expensive and most people couldn’t afford them. As automation reduced the human time needed to produce a piece of clothing, the cost dropped, and the price dropped too. People could suddenly buy many more articles of clothing, which they did, and the overall demand increased so much that the industry employed more workers.</p><p><span>For example, if early on it took 10 work days to make a piece, and after automation it takes only three days, the labor cost has dropped by 70%, and the overall cost might have dropped by 50%. If there’s competition, the price will follow the cost. At a 50% cheaper price, customers might buy </span><em>four</em><span> times as many pieces, spending more overall, and the number of workers needed would have increased by 20%.</span></p><p>Generalizing, this is the story: </p><ol><li><p>Automation arrives and increases productivity by eliminating some human tasks (=lower labor costs).</p></li><li><p>This reduces the cost of the product.</p></li><li><p>If there is competition, this increases quality and reduces prices. </p></li><li><p>Demand soars.</p></li><li><p><span>This increase in demand creates so much more work that</span></p><span> companies need to hire people to do the tasks that are not yet automated. </span></li><li><p>But at some point, this improvement in quality and price saturates demand. People don’t want more products. They stop buying much more.</p></li><li><p>But productivity keeps improving. More and more tasks are automated, but the volume of sales doesn’t grow as much.</p></li><li><p>Employment drops.</p></li></ol><p>This explains why lots of agricultural jobs disappeared—and the horses: People prioritize food. If you increase productivity, you’ll produce more food, and people will buy a bit more if they just couldn’t afford it before. But once their hunger is covered, they don’t want more quantity. They want more quality. This can only create so much more work. You won’t buy 30 avocados because they’re 30 times cheaper.</p><p>Meanwhile, accounting is surprisingly useful!

AI will be able to help conceive stories, iterate on the plot, come up with great concept art, create videos from sentences, edit them to look amazing on the fly, add the right AI-generated music… </p><p><em>The creator recorded the video above, added the images for style below, and RunwayML generated the video in the middle.

What will happen when people like him can create videos a hundred times more easily and cheaply?</span></p><p>The result is that even more people will create quality audiovisual content, but since demand can’t grow much—people already watch many hours a day—some audiovisual creators will increase their productivity and make amazing works, while the rest will scrape by.</p><p>This mechanism is soon going to pervade every corner of the content industry. We’re seeing it with drawings and Generative AI right now. Tech like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney is still super early, and yet many people reckon that artists are doomed.</p><blockquote><p><em>My partner, an artist, has adopted the use of Midjourney exactly as described and is churning out artwork with the AI completing the task of composition of the piece for her. However she fears that we’re months away from AI advancing to the point of ironing out the weird kinks like the extra fingers and other uncanny valley aspects.

But what does “content” mean? It’s information produced for mass consumption: books, movies, YouTube videos, songs…</p><p><span>Now, AI can do something new: </span><em>Personalize information.</em><span> This opens the door of automation to industries previously protected, like education, healthcare, or law.</span></p><p>A big chunk of education is content: curricula, learning objectives, readings, lessons, study books, testing materials, etc. It’s not a coincidence that this part of education is already better in places like YouTube or Khan Academy.</p><p>Then why hasn’t education been disrupted by automation yet? For two reasons: The core of learning, and other education services.</p><p><span>The holy grail of education is solving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem" rel="">Bloom’s Two Sigma Problem</a><span>. The best way to help students learn is with a personal tutor—it can get almost anyone to the 98th percentile in performance. But it’s impossible to give a tutor to every student.</span></p><p>Or rather, it used to be impossible.</p><p>AI is not far from allowing this. As foundation models improve, along with fine-tuning and prompt engineering, this will become possible. We’re months or years away, not decades.</p><p>Can you imagine asking your personal tutor anything about any topic, and it helps you learn everything easily, in an entertaining way, and in depth? The quality and speed of learning will explode.</p><p><span>What does this mean for education jobs? AIs will soon be much more productive than humans for the </span><em>learning component </em><span>of education; humans simply can’t compete with personalized education. The best educators will create content, improve AI products, or tutor rich children. </span></p><p>But education has more components than learning: childcare, having a human being that cares about you, certification… Some of these components will likely be automated out—like certification. Others, like childcare, still have a lot of untapped demand, and that will be hard to automate. We’ll talk about this later.</p><p>All of this means that the nature of education will change drastically, even if the number of education jobs might not shrink accordingly.</p><p>We can also break down healthcare into its components: diagnostics, tests, treatment decisions, treatment execution, patient care, pharma…</p><p>Some of these components are not made of information, like patient care or handling a human to take a blood sample. Those won’t be automated too soon. Nurses are probably safe.</p><p><span>But diagnostics and therapy plans are information, as is a chunk of pharma. We’re already witnessing how </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold" rel="">AlphaFold</a><span> is transforming the pharmaceutical industry. Meanwhile, many companies have been trying to beat humans in diagnostics. They don’t always succeed, but they’re close, and it’s very likely they will prevail: It’s impossible for a human to keep abreast of all the scientific papers in their field, calculate complex probabilities, weigh their personal experience with patients, make sure it’s not weighed more than data on papers, incorporate real-time data on local epidemics… But AIs can. It’s simply a matter of teaching them.</span></p><p><span>Paradoxically, this will likely </span><em>increase</em><span> healthcare employment in the coming years. Do you already have access to all the healthcare you ever wanted? Probably not. Today, to get a diagnosis, you need to google your symptoms, swallow a xanax to reduce your tachycardia from the cancer you’ve concluded you have, go to the doctor, pay your $500 deductible, get naked, get a piece of wood in your mouth (“</span><em>Say</em><span> </span><em>aaaaaaaah</em><span>”), lights in your eyes, a hand on your stomach, a pat on the shoulder, and an RX for Azitromicin in your hands because “</span><em>Who knows what you have, take this and if in seven days you’re still feeling bad, come back</em></p><p><em>.” </em><span>Since at this point you know this, you wait to go to the doctor when you’re about to die or have lost a limb.</span></p><p><span>Instead, if a personalized AI had years of your biometric data, all the scientific papers in the world, all their underlying data, and it was connected to the Internet to know in real time what’s happening around the world, it could tell you: “</span><em>You have a 68% chance of having a picornavirus. 93% of the time, it resolves by itself in 48h. You have a 23% chance of meningitis, which can be severe, but you can wait 48h before a diagnosis, so you can wait and see if you get better in the next 48h or go to the hospital once your temperature goes beyond 102ºF, at which point you’ll need a CAT scan or an MRI if it’s available</em></p><p><em>.</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>Today, this is not possible, so diagnostics and treatment decisions are very hard and frequently wrong. This means patients waste lots of time and money. But with this type of information, doctors will be in a much better position to make better decisions faster, which will reduce costs, make healthcare more affordable, and increase quality. As we’ve seen, improvements in costs and quality will lead to more demand, because we’re a long way from saturating healthcare demand. This increase in demand will likely create more jobs</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>Something similar will happen in law. Today, hiring a lawyer is not something you do mindlessly like opening your water tap or ordering a burrito. They’re very expensive—which is logical, since it’s very hard to become a lawyer, and each case takes a lot of work. </p><p>But what if each case did not take a lot of work?</p><p>Imagine that you could tell an AI all the details of your situation, which it can access easily through your phone and email information. It can study the laws, precedents, tell you accurately your chances of winning, what evidence you should provide, how and where to submit to claims…</p><p>Would that eliminate the need for lawyers? No, because as the system stands, we still need human lawyers to defend the case in court, sign papers personally, interact with other humans… </p><p><span>Maybe in the future we will reform the system, but today only humans can do these tasks. So AIs will eliminate the other tasks—especially the preliminary work</span></p><p><span>. I’m not sure how expensive that part is, but if it’s 80% of work, automating it out would mean lawyers could take five times more cases. If they reduce their prices by 60% due to competition, lawyers will make more than before, more people will be able to afford lawyers, the total demand would increase, and we would have more law employment. </span></p><p>Conversely, if what limits justice is not lawyer time, but rather judge time, lawyers won’t be able to get 5x more cases. They won’t be able to take any new cases. And yet costs would still go down by 80%. In that situation, prices will likely go down due to competition, but demand will still not be able to be met due to waiting times. The best lawyers will take the market, and the rest will lose their jobs. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1024,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff61b0469-f730-4226-bb01-2d9bed7897b4_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We can see the same pattern at play in all these industries of personalized information: AI will automate the information component quickly; work, costs, and prices will shrink; quality will increase, and demand with it. But these industries have other components that aren’t information and can hardly be automated. Depending on the specifics of these other tasks, the number of jobs might grow or shrink.</p><p>I received this note from a reader (slightly edited for anonymity):</p><blockquote><p><em>My oldest son works for Amazon as a distribution facility manager. He recently shared with me that he is struggling mightily to retain employees. At his facility, Amazon’s entry-level 100-day retention rate has gone from—approximately—75% to a startling 30% in the last two years. He says this is typical across the country for Amazon. Worker conditions are so repugnant and Orwellian that pay raises no longer entice. Even worse, the jobs are so mindless and repetitive that even the most dedicated worker soon loses focus and motivation. </em></p><p><em>In my son’s facility, the robots and artificial intelligence now handle the most complicated and demanding order picking jobs (flawlessly, mind you), and the human workers are sidelined with increasingly menial tasks (i.e. package A and B fall from a chute and are combined in to a single box and shoved along the conveyor.) Despite the simplicity of the tasks, every single issue that his team has to sort out in the course of the typical day can be traced back to human error. Even the most attentive human will botch one order out of a thousand.</em></p><p><em>He says that in the last year his budget for employee bonuses, incentives and motivational prizes has been slashed. Amazon seems to be making no effort to keep workers, and/or keep workers happy. My son says that Amazon received considerable multi-year tax incentives for hiring X number of employees when his facility was built—but these incentives are scheduled to phase out in the next couple years. In my opinion, once the tax incentives have expired, we will see Amazon begin to aggressively thin the entry-level employee herd, followed by many managers with no one left to manage. Obviously, Amazon wouldn’t apply this approach to a single distribution facility. I suspect that this is their plan for the bulk of their workforce in the coming years; expiring tax incentives followed by workers replaced by more reliable automation. </em></p><p><em>What is different now is that the transition has gone from something that may happen in the future, to something that is happening now—and it’s accelerating</em><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>This perfectly describes what we discussed earlier: As productivity grows early on, employment increases: Amazon automation allowed two-day delivery at no additional cost, which everybody wanted, so Amazon grew extremely fast. It didn’t know how to automate everything upfront, so it hired 1.6 million workers around the world. But now, demand is slowing down. Automation is catching up. Just a few years after hiring all these people, their numbers have already started </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1324557/quarterly-number-of-amazon-employees/" rel="">dwindling</a><span> in 2022</span></p><p><span>. We moved from the jobs growth phase to the jobs destruction phase quite fast.</span></p><p><span>A complement to fulfillment center operators is truck driving. Up to 2017, nobody thought it would ever be automated. Then, between 2017 and 2019, everybody turned around and thought automation would be imminent. Now we’ve realized it’s much easier to get to 99.99% reliability than 99.999999% reliability, and on the road you want the latter to avoid accidents. It turns out that humans are quite good at this level of reliability for this type of task, and AI is not there yet for tasks that require very high reliability. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen, as AI consistently improves. There are </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotaxi#Current_status" rel="">already</a><span> robo-taxi services in some cities, and the long haul part of truck driving will soon be standard:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>In March, a self-driving eighteen-wheeler spent more than five straight days hauling goods between Dallas and Atlanta.

We can see that industries like education, childcare, housing, or healthcare have increased in price, making them targets for automation, but also highlighting how they’ve been good at avoiding automation so far. </span><a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-or-century/" rel="">Source</a><span>.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Construction has resisted automation for over a century. </span><a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/where-are-the-robotic-bricklayers" rel="">It’s surprisingly hard to automate any part of the construction process</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But even if we did succeed, prices would only go down marginally, because the biggest driver of real estate cost is not </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Breakdown-of-construction-costs-for-each-cost-category_tbl1_263339131" rel="">human work</a><span>, but rather land, materials, financing, permitting, commissions… So improvements in construction automation wouldn’t drive prices down by much, which means demand wouldn’t increase. Employment would probably go down</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>Childcare, meanwhile, is about to get a serious productivity boost. Pre-K children are overseen by parents, family members, childcare centers, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCmjCuTUZos6Inko4u57UQ" rel="">Cocomelon</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blippi" rel="">Blippi</a><span>. None of these can provide children all the personalized attention they require—as we saw with Bloom’s Two Sigma problem</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>AI could do it: Follow children’s curiosity, answer their questions patiently, play mind-numbingly boring games for hours</span></p><p><span>, push them a little every day… This would increase childcare center productivity through the roof. But in many places, regulation limits the number of children that a childcare business can take care of. The ratio of employees to children couldn’t go down, and neither would costs. So these jobs might not disappear directly.</span></p><p><span>However, now parents who stay at home or family members would be in a much better position to oversee children while their AIs take care of the early education. This would allow parents</span></p><p><span> to work who wouldn’t otherwise be able to. They would make more money while their children get a better education. If this happened, childcare centers would have lower demand, and their jobs would disappear</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>So people might bypass this service altogether, and have children stay home—better educated and taken care of by the AI. Parents and family members might cut the need to take children to childcare, and work remotely while the AI watches the children. In any case, this is unlikely to drive an increase in employment for childcare workers</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>There’s been a recent update to the graph above, suggesting other industries that any productivity entrepreneur would try to automate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png" width="536" height="804" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:2184,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:536,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F081b55d5-bde0-4866-a93c-1a35233e7cde_2560x3840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>As </span><a href="https://mikekonczal.substack.com/p/a-better-aei-graphic-of-inflation" rel="">Mike Konczal explains</a><span>, prices have dropped in the last 20 years most in goods, and they’ve increased the most in services. </span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Goods have seen the most deflation.
