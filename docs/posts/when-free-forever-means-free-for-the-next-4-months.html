Last week, the open-core team chat platform Mattermost
<a href="https://forum.mattermost.com/t/cloud-free-deprecation/15802">announced</a> that
“Mattermost Cloud Free will no longer be offered after July 26, 2023.” This
likely came as an unpleasant surprise to users on that plan, as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329163754/https://mattermost.com/pricing/#cloud">less than a month before</a>,
Mattermost’s pricing page featured the promise that the Cloud Free plan would be
“free forever”.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/04/when-free-forever-is-4-months/content/images/2023/05/mattermost-free-forever.png" alt=""/></span></p>
<p>To be clear, nobody is entitled to free cloud hosting, and there is nothing
wrong with a business choosing not to offer it. Moreover, the 90-day grace
period Mattermost is providing for the transition is better than one often sees
when a company shuts down a product or free plan. And unlike users of fully
proprietary software, Mattermost’s customers have the option to self-host the
product as an alternative to
<a href="https://mattermost.com/pricing/#cloud">paying $10/user/month</a>, or moving to
another platform.</p>
<p>But Mattermost <em>is</em> breaking the “free forever” promise made to its customers,
and without any acknowledgement or apology. The “free forever” note was quietly
removed from Mattermost’s website in the month leading up to the announcement,
and is never mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35736391">email</a> Mattermost sent to
affected customers. Surely, one can expect better than that from a company whose
<a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">stated principles</a> include “customer
obsession” and “earn trust”.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-pretend-you-didnt-do-it-maybe-the-world-wont-notice">If you pretend you didn’t do it, maybe the world won’t notice?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, attempts to sweep changes that negatively impact customers under
the rug are commonplace, even considering just vendors of team chat products.
Last summer, Slack presented as mere “simplification” a
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/">dramatic change to its free plan</a>
that made the service untenable for many of its users.</p>
<p>This spring, open-core team chat vendor Rocket.Chat moved its read receipts
feature from the free open-source version to its enterprise offering without
warning,
<a href="https://forums.rocket.chat/t/update-6-0-0-read-receipts-complaint/16164">deeply upsetting some users</a>.
Rather than acknowledge the change, the
<a href="https://www.rocket.chat/six#Enhanced-Team-Productivity">release announcement</a>
touted it as if this
<a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android/releases/tag/v2.4.0">2018 feature</a>
were brand new.</p>
<blockquote>
“With 6.0, we empower our Enterprise Edition users with the ability to enable
read receipts for every conversation.”
</blockquote>
<h2 id="being-worthy-of-your-customers-trust">Being worthy of your customers’ trust</h2>
<p>Being a trustworthy vendor is about more than communication. It’s essential to
consider your users’ interests when making decisions, large and small. If your
product is packed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>, no communication
strategy can make your company worthy of trust.</p>
<p>Still, every business sometimes needs to share negative news with its customers
— a price increase, a feature that had been free moved to a paid plan,
information about an outage or a security incident, etc. How can companies do so
without making users feel that their trust has been betrayed?</p>
<p>Here at <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>, we have made intentional choices in an
effort to be worthy of our customers’ trust:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicating transparently.</strong> We do our best to communicate clearly with
our customers, whether the news is good or bad. When we discover a security
vulnerability, we report it via the <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE program</a>,
email impacted customers as soon as a fix is in place, and share the
information publicly <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/tag/security/">on our blog</a>. Our
product plans are described publicly in our
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>, and discussed
openly in the
<a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making commitments we are confident we can keep.</strong> We have made public
commitments on a handful of topics which are strongly aligned with our
company values, such as
<a href="https://zulip.com/values/">keeping Zulip 100% open-source</a> and
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2021/11/12/why-not-blockchain/">staying out of the crypto asset gold rush</a>.
But we have been careful <em>not</em> to make any promises that might no longer
align with the needs of our business a few years down the line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
“Don&#39;t go making all these promises you know you cannot keep </blockquote>
<p>We are also
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2021/12/17/why-zulip-will-stand-the-test-of-time/">growing our business sustainably</a>,
without venture capital funding. This allows us to live by our
<a href="https://zulip.com/values/">values</a>, without investor pressure to compromise
them when doing so might be “good business” or “what everyone does”.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-mattermosts-free-forever-plan-no-more">Why is Mattermost’s “free forever” plan no more?</h2>
<p>Mattermost could have avoided all the challenges of dropping its “free forever”
plan by continuing to offer it. So why did the company decide to drop its free
plan in the first place? As an open-source team chat company that offers our own
free and paid cloud hosting <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">plans</a>, we have some
ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offering free cloud hosting for team chat can be expensive</strong>, depending on
the technical and organizational details of how it’s managed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Hosting expenses</strong>: Zulip Cloud hosting uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy">multitenant</a> model, which makes
the baseline cost for hosting an organization very low. However, it’s
technically complex to support both multitenancy and a self-hosting option
in a single codebase. Mattermost’s cloud service instead
<a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/about/cloud-subscriptions.html#what-environments-and-rings-are-cloud-offerings-deployed-with">uses a dedicated application server</a>
(“single application layer”) for each customer. This likely makes the
baseline cost of hosting an organization non-trivial for Mattermost, as also
indicated by Mattermost’s cost-saving policy of
<a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/manage/workspace-usage.html">hibernating workspaces</a>
after just 14 days of inactivity.</li>
<li><strong>User support</strong>: Support can be a major operational cost for offering a
free plan. Zulip’s support strategy is, as much as possible, to solve the
reported problem in a way that makes it unlikely to recur. For example, we
make it a high priority to fix reported bugs, add documentation, and
publicly file feature requests
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+feature%22">in our GitHub tracker</a>.
This lets us scale our user base without hiring a large support team, but
it’s not how most companies handle their support load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Money is tight for venture-funded companies like Mattermost</strong>. Venture
capital investment has been dropping precipitously — funding for late-stage
companies like Mattermost is
<a href="https://infogram.com/global-venture-dollar-volume-q1-2023-1h7g6k0v9gmd02o">down 2.4x</a>
in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the 2021 peak. Having last raised
funding back
<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mattermost/company_financials">in June 2019</a>,
Mattermost could be under pressure to make difficult decisions in order to
improve its finances.</li>
<li><strong>Mattermost’s free cloud plan is evidently failing to drive business.</strong> Zulip
serves a <a href="https://zulip.com/use-cases/">variety of organizations</a> that benefit
from organized team chat, so
<a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">our Cloud Free offering</a> is a great way to bring in
potential customers. Mattermost is focused specifically on “technical and
operational teams”, and the motivation section of their
<a href="https://forum.mattermost.com/t/cloud-free-deprecation/15802">announcement</a>
strongly hints that, for the most part, these aren’t the kinds of customers
using their Cloud Free plan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-final-note-for-mattermosts-cloud-free-users">A final note for Mattermost’s Cloud Free users</h2>
<p>As you are considering alternatives to paying for Mattermost’s cloud hosting,
check out <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip’s Cloud Free plan</a>. To minimize
disruption, you can
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">import your Mattermost organization</a>
into Zulip, including users and message history. We fully expect to continue
offering the Zulip Cloud Free plan indefinitely, and are excited to empower
<a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">effective collaboration</a> for teams large and
small.</p>
