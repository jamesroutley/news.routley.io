    <h1>Good Reads on Risk in Late Summer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>This week I gave a joint presentation with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/annu-warikoo-7216937_back-at-isacas-las-vegas-conference-after-activity-7099509633702060032-_7Oq/" rel="">Annu Warikoo</a><span> at </span><a href="https://www.isaca.org/training-and-events/grc-conference-2023" rel="">ISACA’s Governance, Risk and Control conference</a><span> on how companies’ risk management functions can adapt to emerging risks, with a focus on AI risk. Our next talk is on the same topic in New York at the </span><a href="https://www.marcusevans.com/conferences/operationalriskmngt" rel="">GFMI Operational Risk Management for Financial Institutions conference</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>This newsletter will return to a regular Friday schedule in the coming week, since my August travels are over. In the meantime, as we enter the last week before US Labor Day, I want to say thank you for reading </span><em>Risk Musings</em><span> and share a few of my favorite reads so far this year. </span></p><p><strong> Books</strong></p><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Metrics-Jerry-Z-Muller-ebook/dp/B07K458MZG/" rel="">The Tyranny of Metrics </a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Metrics-Jerry-Z-Muller-ebook/dp/B07K458MZG/" rel="">by Jerry Z. Muller</a><span> - A must-read for companies aiming to identify, track, and take action based on metrics. A few highlights: </span></p><ol><li><p>Measure outcomes, not inputs. </p></li><li><p>Some essential goals are hard to measure; meanwhile, human judgment and deep contextual knowledge have become unfashionable but are important complements to metrics. </p></li><li><p>Metrics can work internally if designed by practitioners to improve processes and if they align with practitioner professional ethos and responsibility.</p></li><li><p>What is actually measured should be a reasonable proxy for what is intended to be measured (corollary: what can be measured is not always worth measuring). </p></li><li><p>If used for reward or compensation, metrics are more likely to be gamed/subverted and can crowd out intrinsic motivation. </p></li><li><p>Watch out for inadvertent institutionalization of metrics; it needs to be okay and expected for metrics to evolve. </p></li></ol><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LikeWar-Weaponization-P-W-Singer-ebook/dp/B0795FB3ZY/" rel="">LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LikeWar-Weaponization-P-W-Singer-ebook/dp/B0795FB3ZY/" rel=""> by P.W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking</a><span> - An eloquent and opinionated history of social media, with warnings for us as we head into an AI future. The authors explore how the internet first seemed to promote and even embody democracy, with downsides becoming apparent later as the structure of internet interactions changed and companies focused on profiting from their users en masse. Key takeaways: drama draws in more people than it repels, but joy also draws attention.</span></p><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Future-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B084FY1NXB/" rel="">The Ministry for the Future </a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Future-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B084FY1NXB/" rel="">by Kim Stanley Robinson</a><span> - I finally finished this extensive climate-change vision novel, and it read like a themed collection of Substack essays: fiction in the style of nonfiction. I kept picking it up and putting it down after the initial gripping and horrifying introduction, but I kept going, and amid the minutiae of politics and policies, a surprisingly optimistic conclusion emerged. (I was gritting my teeth, waiting for some trap to spring, but Robinson faked me out!) If you’re a policy person, you might like this book.</span></p><p><strong>Newsletters </strong></p><p><em><a href="https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/" rel="">The Algorithmic Bridge</a></em><span> - Alberto Romero’s nuanced and knowledgeable takes on AI have become must-reads for me. He stays above the fray while cutting to the heart of important issues. This is a great mix.</span></p><p><em><a href="https://theturnstone.substack.com/" rel="">The Turnstone</a><span> </span></em><span>- New Zealand-based researcher Melanie Newfield writes each week on science, with a focus on climate change but not to the exclusion of all else. Her approach is curiosity-driven and reader-friendly.</span></p><p><em><a href="https://perspectiveonrisk.substack.com/" rel="">Perspective on Risk</a><span> </span></em><span>- Former New York Fed and AIG risk leader Brian Peters offers insightful and timely perspectives on regulation and risk through an economics lens.</span></p><p>Enjoy your week, and happy reading! </p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Stephanie</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
