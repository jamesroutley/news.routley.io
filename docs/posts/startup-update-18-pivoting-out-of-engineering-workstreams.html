<h2 id="progress-update">Progress update</h2>
<p>This week is late because I spent a solid week on my consulting gig,
and only got a day or two of work on my own app.</p>
<p>The consulting gig has been pretty informative in a lot of ways. On
the technical side - I proved that I could dive into a completely
unknown codebase, getting my dev loop up and running, building out an
LLM backend + frontend chat module in a week. On the PM side - scoping
out the feature list, estimating delivery times, and actually being
dead-on with my estimate was pretty gratifying. Although… “overpromise,
precisely deliver” isn’t how that saying usually goes. On the
stakeholder side - seeing what sort of auxiliary features nontechnical
folks found valuable was eye-opening. As a one-man shop with the ability
to push new deploys within seconds, or to vibecode custom debug UIs in
an hour, I hadn’t previously appreciated LangSmith/LangFuse’s value
proposition. It very quickly becomes obvious when nontechnical folks
started to ask, “hey, can I play around with the prompt?” or “how can we
peek at users’ conversations to see how well this is working?”.</p>
<p>I also learned about and integrated some of the tracking JS tools my
client used. LogRocket is mindblowingly powerful (and extremely
invasive, let’s be honest - you can see <em>everything</em> a user does
on your website). I intend to shoulder-surf my first hundred users and
get the broad strokes of my app correctly implemented and then turn down
tracking to a statistical sample. Strangely, I also found that my filter
list for uBlock Origin didn’t actually prevent this user tracking.
Perhaps LogRocket has the resources to win the cat and mouse game with
filter list maintainers.</p>
<p>I am starting to see a trickle of traffic coming in through the USNCO
guide I wrote last week, so in between that traffic flow and the user
behavior tracking, I hope to get some stronger signal. I’m belatedly
realizing that setting up this user feedback loop is kind of like
setting up your devloop. There is only so much code you can write in
isolation before you have to actually run the thing and see whether it
works, and be able to iterate on changes to your code; similarly there
is only so much product you can create in isolation before you have to
actually ask users whether the thing is useful!</p>
<p>On the feature side, I uploaded another 10 years’ worth of USNCO
national exams, fixed broken mobile CSS, and made various other small
tweaks to the UI. Next up is Stripe integration and a “review the
solution” feature that kicks you back into an AI chat. The AI features
are the only semi-paywalled features, so driving additional demand there
will hopefully get some subset of users to start signing up.</p>
<p>I’m also starting to think about new marketing/sales channels.
Inbound marketing through a blog is one way, but I should be reaching
out to teachers, students on Discord, etc. etc. I knew at an
intellectual level that distribution was key, but I feel a bit silly
that it’s taken this long to internalize this idea.</p>
