</div><p>A new artificial intelligence-based weather model can deliver 15-day forecasts with unrivaled accuracy and speed, a Google lab said, with potentially life-saving applications as climate change ramps up.</p>


										      
																																	<p>GenCast, invented by London-based AI research laboratory Google DeepMind, &#34;showed better forecasting skill&#34; than the current world-leading model, the company said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) produces predictions for 35 countries and is considered the global benchmark for meteorological accuracy.</p>
<p>But DeepMind said GenCast surpassed the precision of the center&#39;s <a href="https://phys.org/tags/forecasts/" rel="tag">forecasts</a> in more than 97 percent of the 1,320 real-world scenarios from 2019 which they were both tested on.</p>
<p>Details of its findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9" target="_blank">were published</a> in <i>Nature</i>, a leading science journal.</p>
<p>ECMWF chief Florence Rabier told AFP the project was a &#34;first step&#34; towards integrating AI in weather forecasting but that &#34;it is indeed a leap forward.&#34;</p>
<p>At this stage it can be used to supplement their current models, she said.</p>
<p>&#34;We are progressing year by year,&#34; she added. &#34;Any new method that can enhance and accelerate this progress is extremely welcome in the context of the extreme societal pressures of climate change.&#34;</p>
<h2>Extreme weather</h2>
<p>The model was trained on four decades of temperature, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wind+speed/" rel="tag">wind speed</a> and air pressure data from 1979 to 2018 and can produce a 15-day forecast in just eight minutes—compared to the hours it currently takes.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>&#34;GenCast provides better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/extreme+events/" rel="tag">extreme events</a> than the top operational system... up to 15 days in advance,&#34; a DeepMind statement said.</p>
<p>DeepMind said GenCast &#34;consistently outperformed&#34; the current leading forecast model when predicting <a href="https://phys.org/tags/extreme+heat/" rel="tag">extreme heat</a>, extreme cold and high wind speeds.</p>
<p>&#34;More accurate forecasts of risks of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/extreme+weather/" rel="tag">extreme weather</a> can help officials safeguard more lives, avert damage, and save money,&#34; DeepMind said.</p>
<p>Extreme weather is becoming more common and more severe as a result of human caused <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag">climate change</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2023, a series of wildfires in Hawaii killed around 100 people. Authorities were criticized by locals who said they were given no warning of the impending blaze.</p>
<p>This summer, a sudden heat wave in Morocco killed at least 21 people over a 24-hour period. And in September, Hurricane Helene killed 237 people in Florida and other southeastern US states.</p>
<p>&#34;I am confident that AI-based weather forecasting systems will continue to incrementally improve in the future, including better prediction of extreme events and their intensity, for which there is a lot of need to improve upon,&#34; said David Schultz, a professor of synoptic meteorology at Manchester University, who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>But he said these forecasting systems are reliant on the weather prediction models that are already running, such as that operated by ECMWF.</p>
