But it mostly affects Palestinian women and children, said Shaer.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">It is a form of &#34;collective punishment&#34;, she added, because it infringes on the rights of an entire population based on the racist assumption that they are all prone to terrorism.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Israel captured East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. It applies different sets of rules for Jews and Palestinians under its control.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Henriette Chacar; Editing by Jonathan Oatis</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
