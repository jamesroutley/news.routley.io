    <h1>Will AI Replace Human Thinking? The Case for Writing and Coding Manually</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Learning to Think Again, and the Cost of AI Dependency.</em></p>
<p>There are so many (hype/boring) posts about AI coming out every day. It‚Äôs OK to use it, and everyone does it, but still <strong>learn your craft</strong>, and try to <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>Similar to what <a>DHH</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs also more fun to be competent in something than constantly waiting for an AI to complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>The probability that AI will make us unhappy is very high IMO. Use it, yes, but not for every task. For discovering, creating a historical overview, or creating diagrams (Canva, Figma), but a big no to <em>the</em> writing (or coding). Someone needs to add knowledge or new insights; AI cannot train itself. So articles, books, and words will be written, and writers will be more in demand as everyone relies on AI, which at some point just plateaus.</p>
<p>It will be a long-term loss; people stop thinking and learning. Time will tell. My two cents, if you are a senior in something, you know better.

<a href="https://youtu.be/zy2FjRCqBSI?si=pgsNVBXDZhkaIgjq&amp;t=1688" rel="noopener">heard</a> from <a>ThePrimeagen</a>: It depends on how far you fix into the future. Short-term autocomplete is fine, but architectural decisions are big no, no‚Äôs.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/img_Will%20AI%20replace%20Humans%20_eg%20Writing__1744275062582.webp" width="auto"/></p>
<p>If we use it for quick autocomplete or creating a well-defined algorithm function, it‚Äôs less prone to errors. In that first phase, you gain 20% productivity; in the later phases, you lose more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is like in real life, the longer I wait with making m decision, the more information I have, the better the decison will be. And is exactly what <a>Shape Up</a> preaches with maximum deciding for 6 weeks (a cycle),  don‚Äôt have roadmaps and backlogs for longer than that in the future. Similar is it with using AI, as all of it is predicted probability.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also to keep in mind what‚Äôs most imporant to your usecase like illustrated by Thomas Ptacek in

<a href="#soulless"><h2 id="soulless"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Soulless</h2></a>
<p>Nobody wants to read some <a>soulless</a> text, and what if it‚Äôs even good? Where do you get more from? I think this is a big trap that only over time people will realize. Sure, they help, and everyone needs to use them for ‚Äúcertain‚Äù tasks, but not the writing itself.</p>
<p>In the end, LLMs and AI require guidance; they‚Äôre just probabilities. See also <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/writing-manually" rel="noopener" data-src="/brain/writing-manually">Writing Manually</a>.</p>
<a href="#distraction"><h2 id="distraction"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Distraction</h2></a>
<p>I think we will be more distracted than ever. We can‚Äôt even have 2 seconds to think before Grammarly, Copilot, or Cursor suggests something. So instead of doing the thinking, we just cruise on. We are losing the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>
<p>It brings me back to the article I wrote recently about ¬´

<a href="https://ssp.sh/blog/finding-flow/" rel="noopener">Finding Flow</a>¬ª. More on <a>Don‚Äôt use AI for everything, you stop thinking-learning AI Use</a> and <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/writing-is-hard#is-ai-solving-this" rel="noopener" data-src="/brain/writing-is-hard">Writing is Hard</a>.</p>
<a href="#dont-get-me-wrong"><h2 id="dont-get-me-wrong"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Don‚Äôt Get Me Wrong</h2></a>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I use it every day, too. But more deliberately. I turned off my <a>Grammarly</a> and my Copilot (a long time ago), so I have the space to think and to learn. If you do it once or twice, that‚Äôs OK, but if you do it everywhere, you also lose the ability to learn new skills or the <a>fun</a> of it.</p>
<p>Interesting about the <a>LCI (LLM Collaborative Intelligence)</a>, and sure, there will be a lot of benefits, but I am not sure if these insights are anything that comes close to a human insight that <strong>has felt, sensed, or experienced</strong> something through hardship. So yes, but I do not have many expectations, nor do I want it to create new insights. This is the fun part of my job :)</p>
<a href="#exercising-a-skill"><h3 id="exercising-a-skill"><span arialabel="Anchor"># </span>Exercising a Skill</h3></a>
<p>It‚Äôs never always or never; it‚Äôs in between. The problem with learning is if you use it often, I‚Äôd argue that you, in fact, don‚Äôt learn much. You just copy and paste in writing or just tab tab tab in coding. The learning is gone. And do that often enough; our brain is not used to learning or, more critically, thinking anymore. Same as remembering, how good can we remember mobile phone numbers? not really, but I could very well during the early phone times because I trained it every day.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs all a matter of exercise, and I learned for myself‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt have to be true for everyone‚Äîthat I didn‚Äôt learn or think anymore. And frankly, it was also not fun anymore. That‚Äôs to be said in the stuff I know well.</p>
<p>In other areas, like creating an image (like the one I created for this article üòÜ) or updating my website‚Äôs front page with HTML/CSS, which would have taken me much longer as I don‚Äôt practice, it helped a lot. But I‚Äôd argue the fact that I didn‚Äôt learn anything new except prompting Claude Code :). It‚Äôs all tradeoffs, as always, right? :)</p>

<ul>
<li>The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write.</li>
<li>Yes, it‚Äôs bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking.</li>
<li>In fact there‚Äôs a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre thinking without writing, you only think you‚Äôre thinking.</li>

<p>The good news, and why AI won‚Äôt replace writers on <a>2024-08-31</a> by <a>Ted Gioia</a>. Some of the reasons why he thinks <a>AI Writing</a> <strong>won‚Äôt</strong> be as good:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.5 years into the AI craze, and I continue to firmly believe that if your company wasn‚Äôt already interesting/succeeding without AI, then doing ‚Äúwhatever plus AI‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to save you. For the few that seem this way (eg Cursor), I think their moat is a lot weaker than it seems. You have to play the game and the game is AI, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a defensible foundational capability. Might play out as an excellent land and grab strategy to buy you time to fill out the meat though. <a>Mitchell Hashimoto</a> on

<blockquote>
<p>Some people today are <strong>discouraging others from learning programming</strong> on the grounds AI will automate it. This advice will be seen as some of <strong>the worst career advice ever given</strong>. I disagree with the Turing Award and Nobel prize winner who wrote, ‚ÄúIt is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct [‚Ä¶] than that it will become all-powerful. More and more, computers will program themselves.‚Äù‚Äã Statements discouraging people from learning to code are harmful!</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today‚Äôs arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.</p>
<p>As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, as programming has moved from assembly language to higher-level languages like C, from desktop to cloud, from raw text editors to IDEs to AI assisted coding where sometimes one barely even looks at the generated code (which some coders recently started to call vibe coding), it is getting easier with each step.</p>
<p>I wrote previously that I see tech-savvy people coordinating AI tools to move toward being 10x professionals ‚Äî individuals who have 10 times the impact of the average person in their field. I am increasingly convinced that the best way for many people to accomplish this is not to be just consumers of AI applications, but to learn enough coding to use AI-assisted coding tools effectively.</p>
<p>When I was working on the course Generative AI for Everyone and needed to generate AI artwork for the background images, I worked with a collaborator who had studied art history and knew the language of art. He prompted Midjourney with terminology based on the historical style, palette, artist inspiration and so on ‚Äî using the language of art ‚Äî to get the result he wanted. I didn‚Äôt know this language, and my paltry attempts at prompting could not deliver as effective a result.</p>
<p>Similarly, scientists, analysts, marketers, recruiters, and people of a wide range of professions who understand the language of software through their knowledge of coding can tell an LLM or an AI-enabled IDE what they want much more precisely, and get much better results. As these tools are continuing to make coding easier, this is the best time yet to learn to code, to learn the language of software, and learn to make computers do exactly what you want them to do.</p></blockquote>

<p>This another valid insights, it‚Äôs hard to maintain code that is not made by you, it‚Äôs losing it‚Äôs fun. Therefore this will be a big part of a winning business, to have sustainable, and energy to want to maintain a product. And <strong>not ‚Äújust making it‚Äù</strong>.</p>

<p>When you outsource your writing to AI, you end up with words that lack soul or personality. Gone go your quirks and your idiosyncrasies, which are the very things that make your writing irreplaceable.

<a href="https://youtu.be/A_WCaFmQaIw?si=5keSAgoZx2Cg3Fmc" rel="noopener">great insights</a> that I very align with in terms of writing. He says that there are no shortcuts for research. When you grapple with a text or book for seven hours, it will change you. This will influence your writing, too. There‚Äôs no summary that gives you this kind of in-depth connection.</p>
<p>Also, you can‚Äôt prompt your way into it, as there‚Äôs no prompt that knows that you don‚Äôt know yet, or AI doesn‚Äôt know what you wanted to have read or what connections you would have made. On the contrary, you actually lose time reading something, and over time, we think we read lots of stuff, but we actually only read summaries. Full episode on

<p>But at the end, convition is a good word. I can focus what an AI thinks while I write, I must write. So having something to say, and trying my best to communicate that, is the best I can do.  ^ebca60</p>
