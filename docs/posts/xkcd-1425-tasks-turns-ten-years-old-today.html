<p><strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/1425/">XKCD 1425 (Tasks) turns ten years old today</a></strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1838573098523856966" title="@chrisalbon">via</a>) One of the all-time great XKCDs. It&#39;s amazing that &#34;check whether the photo is of a bird&#34; has gone from PhD-level to trivially easy to solve (with a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/vision-llms/">vision LLM</a>, or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/clip/">CLIP</a>, or <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/">ResNet+ImageNet</a> among others).</p>
<p><img alt="XKCD comic. Cueball: When a user takes a photo, the app should check whether they&#39;re in a national park... Ponytail: Sure, easy GIS lookup gimme a few hours. Cueball: ...and check whether the photo is of a bird. Ponytail: I&#39;ll need a research team and five years.

<p>The key idea still very much stands though. Understanding the difference between easy and hard challenges in software development continues to require an enormous depth of experience.</p>
<p>I&#39;d argue that LLMs have made this even worse.</p>
<p>Understanding what kind of tasks LLMs can and cannot reliably solve remains incredibly difficult and unintuitive. They&#39;re computer systems that are terrible at maths and that can&#39;t reliably lookup facts!</p>
<p>On top of that, the rise of AI-assisted programming tools means more people than ever are beginning to create their own custom software.</p>
<p>These brand new AI-assisted proto-programmers are having a crash course in this easy-v.s.-hard problem.</p>
<p>I saw someone recently complaining that they couldn&#39;t build a Claude Artifact that could analyze images, even though they knew Claude itself could do that. Understanding why that&#39;s not possible involves understanding how the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP headers</a> that are used to serve Artifacts prevent the generated code from making its own API calls out to an LLM!</p>
