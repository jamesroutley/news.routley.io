    <h1>Show HN: Novanode, Global load balancing with Caddy, no vendor lock-in</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been a long-time Cloudflare user, but sometimes I just want a global load balancer without the lock-in and with full configuration control (e.g., some Cloudflare rules require an enterprise plan).</p><p>I love Caddy for its easy configuration, and that&#39;s why I created Novnaode. It makes it easy to launch hosted Caddy instances (with Nginx coming soon) and puts you fully in control of how to manage the configurations.</p><p>No more being restricted by enterprise tiers or limited configuration options - just simple, powerful, and flexible global load balancing.</p><p>Check it out here: <a href="https://novanode.sh" rel="nofollow">https://novanode.sh</a></p></div></div></div>
