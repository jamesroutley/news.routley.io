                        </ul><p>An explosive new lawsuit claims TikTok owner ByteDance built a &#34;backdoor channel&#34; in its code that allowed Chinese Communist Party members access to user data hosted in the US.</p><p>The wrongful termination suit, which was filed on Friday in San Francisco Superior Court by Yintao Yu, alleges ByteDance granted special powers to members of a unit of the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, inside the company, referred to as the &#34;Committee.&#34; Yu is a former engineering lead for ByteDance in the US who worked at the company between 2017 and 2018.</p><p>Yu was terminated from ByteDance in November 2018, shortly after TikTok was merged with the lip-syncing app Musical.ly. TikTok had only <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">11 million monthly active users in the US</a> in January of that year versus the more than 150 million users the company said it has today.</p><p>The suit says the CCP &#34;Committee,&#34; which did not work for ByteDance, could monitor its business activities, demote content the unit viewed as unfavorable to China&#39;s interests, and even use a &#34;death switch&#34; to turn off Chinese versions of its apps.</p><p>The complaint alleges the &#34;Committee continued to have access&#34; to US user data even after ByteDance walled off access for individual engineers in China.</p><p>Specifically, the suit says Yu &#34;saw the backdoor channel in the code, which allows certain high level persons to access user data, no matter where the data is located, even if hosted by a U.S. company with servers located in the U.S. Chinese law requires the company to grant access to user data to the Chinese government.&#34;</p><p>The complaint alleges ByteDance &#34;was aware that if the Chinese government&#39;s backdoor was removed from the international/U.S. version of the app, the Chinese government would, it feared, ban the company&#39;s valuable Chinese-version apps.&#34;</p><p>TikTok has previously said it doesn&#39;t share information with the Chinese government, that US user data is stored in the US and Singapore, and that its content moderation is led by a US-based team that &#34;operates independently from China.&#34;</p><p>Since Yu&#39;s time at the company, which ended in late 2018, TikTok has invested heavily in new ways to guard US user data, including a $1.5 billion data sovereignty initiative called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-us-user-data-storage-project-texas-privacy-security-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Project Texas</a> in partnership with Oracle.</p><p>The suit alleges that Yu was fired from the company for his &#34;observation and reporting of illegal conduct.&#34; The filing was first reported on by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/technology/tiktok-bytedance-lawsuit-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>&#34;Mr. Yu observed a culture of lawlessness within the company,&#34; the suit says. &#34;This ByteDance culture focused on growth at all costs. The attitude was to violate the law first, continue to grow, and pay fines later.&#34;</p><p>The complaint also claims the internal CCP group was tasked with helping ByteDance stick to &#34;core Communist values,&#34; at times blocking content around events like the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.</p><p>TikTok has been under <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hearing-congress-interrupting-grilling-ceo-ban-sale-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">intense scrutiny</a> in Washington for months as politicians have debated whether its owner could be compelled to give the Chinese government access to US user data via its National Intelligence Law.Â </p><p>Members of Congress from both parties have proposed bills that would grant the White House powers to ban TikTok or other apps with ties to China. Montana&#39;s state legislature <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/montana-lawmakers-voted-in-favor-of-a-statewide-tiktok-ban-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">passed legislation</a> in April to ban TikTok within state borders.</p><p>ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p>
