<p>We are happy to announce that Stremio is now available for Raspberry Pi 5 and 4, installable on an SD card (of at least 8GB).</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: While the Raspberry Pi 5 is fully capable of smooth 4K playback, Raspberry Pi 4 will not be able to play 4K content due to hardware limitations.</p>



<p>This release uses <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> v21 (based on Android TV 14, custom build by <a href="https://konstakang.com/">Kostakang</a>), it does not include any Google apps or services, but it does come pre-installed with”Stremio”, “Stremio Launch on Boot” and the “Aptoide TV” app (which will handle auto-updates).</p>



<p>With Stremio OS you have full control over the Android TV OS and liberty of choice of how you want it to behave. For example, you can choose to start Stremio on boot if you so wish, and also have the possibility to disable this feature later on.</p>



<p>In order to install and use Stremio OS on Raspberry Pi, you must follow these steps:</p>



<ul><li>download the correct image for your Raspberry Pi (either 5 or 4) from our official <a href="https://www.stremio.com/downloads">downloads page</a></li><li>write the image to an SD card (at least 8GB) – if you are using “<a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Etcher</a>“, you will need to use the “Flash from file” button, otherwise if you are using “Raspberry Pi Imager”, then you will need to use the “Use custom” button</li><li><em>(optional)</em> expand the main volume – as this is a 7GB image, if written to a larger SD Card there will be unallocated disk space, you can use any partition editor app (such as “<a href="https://gparted.org/download.php">GParted</a>“) to extend the /data partition (/dev/block/mmcblk0p4)</li><li>insert the sd card into the RPI and power on the device</li><li>complete the one-time setup for Android TV</li><li><em>(optional)</em> you can also start the “Stremio Launch on Boot” app, this will make the “Stremio” app automatically start on device boot (to turn the RPI into a single purpose device, yet you can go back from the app to reach the Android TV Home screen at any time)</li><li><em>(optional)</em> you can also set the “Stremio” app as a featured app (from the “Apps” panel)</li></ul>

<p>Our team tested the Stremio OS image on an RPI5 (8GB RAM) and an RPI4 Model B (8GB RAM).</p>



<p>Be mindful that the “Stremio OS” project is still very new and considered experimental for the time being.</p>



<p>Stay tuned, as we have more surprises for our users in 2024!</p>
