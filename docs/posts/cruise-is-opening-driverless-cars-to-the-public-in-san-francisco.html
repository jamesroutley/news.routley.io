    <h1>Cruise is opening driverless cars to the public in San Francisco</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we are opening up our driverless cars in San Francisco to the public.</p><p>I’m still surprised I can even write those words — this moment really snuck up on me. I work on these cars every day, and I’ve seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Pa7xU7PW-oM"><u>every inch of progress.</u></a> Just 3 months ago I took the <a href="https://youtu.be/dmvZBiWYkFQ"><u>first-ever fully driverless ride</u></a> in a major US city, and it was incredible. When Sourdough arrived, with no one inside, and took me for a quiet ride through the streets of SF, it became clear to me that we’ve built something very special. Now it’s time for us to share it.</p><p>We’re opening a <a href="https://www.getcruise.com/"><u>sign-up page</u></a> on our site today so you can get a driverless ride soon — and free, for now! We’re starting with a small number of users and will ramp up as we make more cars available, so sign up now to lock in an early spot.</p><p>Over the past several weeks Cruise <a href="https://youtu.be/x5g_3B8ya4k"><u>employees have been taking rides</u></a> every single night. Even our <a href="https://youtu.be/2j2eLEHE-Dc"><u>friends from GM</u></a> came out and took a ride. They rode in Tostada and Disco which both performed flawlessly. Each car has a unique name, but the experience is consistent and predictable. From app to pickup to dropoff, these amazing vehicles just <i>work</i>. Check out this video of <a href="https://youtu.be/Pa6uCew5TWs"><u>some of the first public riders</u></a>. As you can see, most people experience childlike delight during the first ride, but then the ride quickly becomes boring (as it should). Brilliantly boring. One of them even fell asleep.</p><p>We have one other piece of news to share. The SoftBank Vision Fund initially invested $900 million in Cruise in 2018. They agreed to invest an additional $1.35 billion when we started operating fully driverless cars. I’m pleased to announce we’ve officially hit that milestone! This additional capital will help us expand our world-class team and quickly scale this technology across SF and into more communities. </p><p>Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, called her first driverless ride “surreal” and “a highlight of her career” as an engineer. I feel exactly the same way and can’t wait for you to try it for yourself. There’s no better place for us to start than in San Francisco, a place where thinking big is encouraged regardless of how outrageous your ideas may seem. Thank you Cruisers, and thank you San Francisco. </p></div></div></div>
