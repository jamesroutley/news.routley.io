            <p>In a world where more and more of our life, photos, and documents drift in the digital ether, it&#39;s time to reflect on the popular cloud trend and explore <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/18/the-rise-of-cloud-repatriation-why-companies-are-bringing-data-in-house/?sh=2b3cdf1b58f7&amp;ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">the cloud repatriation movement</a> of bringing data in-house.</p><p>Storing files in the cloud has been a great way of saving space on a computer for a while now, but as storage providers get bigger and bigger, they may not be as secure, cost effective, and reliable. Just last month, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">reports emerged</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive users are complaining of lost files</a>. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google acknowledged that files for some users are not available</a> at the moment. What do you when your files are basically owned by someone else? Is it time to reconsider how we store our files? Should we go back to good old fashioned files sitting right in our computers? Why moving away from cloud storage could be worth it:</p><p><strong>1. Security</strong></p><p><strong>2. Cost</strong></p><p><strong>3. Reliable Access</strong></p><p>Here&#39;s to safeguarding your digital world üåêüíæ. Until next time, keep your data safe and your tech journeys thrilling.</p><p>Curious for more?
