Since the current top <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34945086">post</a> on
Hacker News points here but this page does not describe what Magit <em>is</em> (and it
might not be obvious that the logo above serves as the “back to homepage” link),
<a href="https://magit.vc/">a prominent link</a> to the homepage is in order.  There, near the top, you
will find a short introduction, with links to a longer version, to two in depth
articles and to some videos by happy users.</p>

<p>And yes, the “vc” in magit.vc stands for “version control”, not “venture
capital”. ☺️</p>

better.  Please consider supporting my continuous work on

<p>I prefer options that come with no, or very, low fees.  Of course I like these
options because it means I get more money, but it is equally important who does
<em>not</em> get a cut when we avoid unnecessary fees.</p>

<p>In practical terms, that means that I prefer bank transfers.  Nowadays many
banks have web-pages and apps, that make it nearly as simple to transfer money
as the offerings of platforms that focus solely on money transfer.  So even
if you avoided using them in the past, it might be worth giving them another
chance.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>, since I am gaining many new supporters right now.  Choose the
payment method <strong>you</strong> <em>are most comfortable with</em>, given the time you are
willing to invest to set that up.  As we have just learned, putting too many
eggs in one basket is risky.  GitHub Sponsors dropping support for PayPal is a
major issue exactly because that was by far the most popular option.  That being
said, if you have the time, I still encourage you do go with the solution that
has the smallest fees.</p>



<p>Of course I welcome all donations!  Since most developers only accept donations
through one of the popular donation platforms, it makes sense to stick to that
for all your donations.  It is certainly better to make donations using an
expensive offering, than it is to make no donations at all because doing so
would be too time consuming.</p>

<p>Currently only a tiny fractions of the donations that I receive are done using
bank transfers, so don’t feel bad if you don’t do that either.  Still, it might
be worth investing some time, making sure a greater part of your donations reach
the intended recipients.</p>



<p>Of course! Just ask me for one in an email.</p>

<p>By the way, while your employer may not have a budget for donations to
free software, they might have one to <strong>buy</strong> any software or support.
I would be happy to send them such a bill.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://magit.vc/donate/ach.html">ACH</a> direct deposit if you have an US bank account.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://magit.vc/donate/iban.html">IBAN</a> if you have a European account.  This might
also work for other non-US bank account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Compared to (at least European) banks these charge higher fees.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://magit.vc/donate/stripe.html">Stripe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://magit.vc/donate/paypal.html">Paypal</a></li>
</ul>




<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius/">Github Sponsors</a></p>

    <p>This is by far the most popular option among my backers.  They currently do
not charge any fees themselves, but the fees of Stripe and your credit card
company still apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/tarsius/">Patreon</a></p>

    <p>This is the second most popular option among my backers.  They charge very
high fees, including some hidden fees.  Please avoid them going forward; if
all the people you back on there also accept donations elsewhere, then you
might even want to move away from this platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://opencollective.com/magit/">Opencollective</a></p>

    <p>Not popular among my backers.  Because I have opted to use no “fiscal host”
they charge no additional fees.  As a consequence, they do however ask you
to also donate to them when you are donating to me (but you can decline).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://liberapay.com/magit/">Liberapay</a></p>

    <p>Not popular, but they have only the best intentions and they charge no
additional fees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
