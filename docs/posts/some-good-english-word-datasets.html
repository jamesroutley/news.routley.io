    <h1>Some good English word datasets</h1>

  <p><strong>Monday, February  2, 2026</strong></p>

  <div><p>I&#39;m working on a silly word game right now, which means I need a list of words for it. I can&#39;t rely on the system word list, since this is for a web project. I&#39;d also like, ideally, multiple lists of words with different criteria: most common words, all words, some subsets.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not really clear <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq-how-many-english-words">how many words there are</a>, because what is a word<sup id="fr-apple-tree-1"><a href="#fn-apple-tree">[1]</a></sup>? And how do you find what words are in use? Or decide that something&#39;s used enough that it merits being put in a list, rather than just being a misspelling or something used once or twice? You probably don&#39;t want every mashing of keys that someone&#39;s done in there, or adjklfalkjsdfaklsd and variations are going to take up some considerable space. So that results in a lot of different word lists being available!</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are the two best word list sources I found and some of their properties.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WordNet</strong>: a while back, researchers at Princeton put together WordNet, a database of relations between words. This includes definitions and synonyms and things like that. It&#39;s no longer maintained by Princeton, but was <a href="https://github.com/globalwordnet/english-wordnet">forked and maintained</a> with a release 1 month ago. There are <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=wordnet">libraries to load it</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Wortschatz Leipzig frequency lists</strong>: A project under Leipzig University, this is a collection of word frequency lists from various sources. The <a href="https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/eng">English downloads page</a> has datasets drawn from news, the web, or Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are two honorable mentions, which I want to call some attention to. These are useful, but not useful for <em>this</em> project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>/usr/share/dict/words</code></strong>: Unix systems come with word lists installed, which is handy for things like spellcheckers. On my system, this file contains about 480k words. This is accessible through <a href="https://crates.io/crates/words">various libraries</a>, too. Mine does contain things like &#34;1080&#34;, so I want something a little cleaner. It&#39;s nice to have available! Licensing isn&#39;t super clear to me, but it can be figured out and the word list could (with appropriate licensing) then be distributed with the application.</li>
<li><strong>Wikitionary</strong>: It&#39;s available under permissive license terms! There&#39;s a page documenting different <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/English">frequency word lists</a>, which can be used to get the top words from different contexts, like the most common words on wikipedia, in TV scripts, or in contemporary poetry! It doesn&#39;t make the cut for me since the data is prepared for human consumption rather than being machine readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The WordNet data and Leipzig frequency lists both need to be loaded and processed, but the formats are documented and can be implemented pretty easily, especially if you have a specific subset of the data you need. I&#39;ll be using the Leipzig data most likely for my silly little word game. I might combine it with WordNet to be able to pull up definitions, but we&#39;ll see!</p>
<p>Someday I&#39;d like to pull some of the Wikitionary data, because it&#39;s really cool and has a lot of different frequency lists. Like the one with the 2000 most common <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Contemporary_poetry">words in contemporary English poetry</a>. That might not make the cut for <em>this</em> project, but that&#39;s just crying to be used for something else.</p>

<li id="fn-apple-tree">
<p>For example, I maintain that &#34;apple tree&#34; is a word. &#34;Tall tree&#34; is two: &#34;tall&#34; is an adjective that&#39;s used to modify &#34;tree&#34; which is a noun. But that&#39;s not true with &#34;apple tree&#34; since, &#34;apple&#34; isn&#39;t an adjective, it&#39;s another noun. We use &#34;apple tree&#34; as one singular word, and it has its own <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apple">dictionary entry</a>. I&#39;m only slightly joking. <a href="#fr-apple-tree-1">↩</a></p>
