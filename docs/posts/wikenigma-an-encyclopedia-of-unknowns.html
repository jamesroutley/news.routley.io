    <h1>Wikenigma – an Encyclopedia of Unknowns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<em>Wikenigma</em> is a unique wiki-based resource specifically dedicated to <strong>documenting fundamental gaps in human knowledge</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Listing scientific and academic questions to which no-one, anywhere, has yet been able to provide a definitive answer. [ 1142 so far ]
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s to say, a compendium of so-called <strong>&#39;Known Unknowns&#39;.</strong>
</p>

<p>
All articles are open for registered users to contribute and edit. <img src="https://wikenigma.org.uk/_media/openacceslogosmallgreen.png?w=90&amp;tok=9c3ef2" loading="lazy" alt="" width="90"/>

<blockquote><div>
<p><em>Real knowledge is to know the extent of one&#39;s ignorance.&#34;</em></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p><em>If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must leave the door to the unknown ajar.&#34;</em></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p><em>Not ignorance, but ignorance of ignorance, is the death of knowledge.&#34;</em></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p><em>[…] it is the unknown that drives us as scientists. If we knew it all, science would ossify.&#34;</em></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p><em>If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn&#39;t be called research would it?&#34;</em></p></div></blockquote>

<p>
The idea is to inspire and promote interest in scientific and academic research by highlighting  opportunities to investigate problems which no-one has yet been able to solve.
