<p>Orthic shorthand is a faster way to write.
Simply replacing the usual English alphabet with its optimized alphabet will let you write 2–3x your usual handwriting speed.
This one change will let you write at 60–90 words per minute!</p>

<p>Orthic replaces the multi-step letters of your preschool alphabet with a Cambridge University-minted alphabet tuned for rapid yet legible writing.
It’s quick, compact, and still readable over a century later.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the hang of that <strong>fully-written style,</strong> Orthic’s got extra shortcuts to boost your writing speed.
The <strong>ordinary style</strong> adds abbreviations for common words and endings as well as shortcuts that imply letters without having to write them.
It’s designed so you could send a snapshot of your writing to another Orthic writer, or to yourself in ten years, and have no trouble reading what you wrote.</p>


<p>To go even faster, you’ll need to master the extreme shortcuts of the <strong>reporting style.</strong>
This style is not intended to be easily read by anyone other than the original writer:
it trades universal comprehensibility for maximal compactness and expressiveness.
The top recorded speed was 190 words per minute.</p>
