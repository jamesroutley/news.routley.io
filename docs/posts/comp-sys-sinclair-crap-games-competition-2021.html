<h2>THE ALL-IMPORTANT COMPETITION ENTRIES</h2>

<p>
This is the meat of the competition. Everything else is just fluff around the edges. Click the links to read the reviews, see more screenshots, and - most importantly - download the games so you can marvel at how little can be achieved when you put your mind to it - or not, as the case may be. <!-- Each link leads to the relevant page on a Wordpress blog I've set up to keep track of the competition - it's easier than cramming the webspace full of individual pages. (It wasn't.) Plus, if this site ever dies, it'll stay there for longer than this one. -->

With the competition now closed, you can download the <a href="https://www.rickdangerous.co.uk/csscgc2021/entries/csscgc2021completecollectorsedition.zip" target="_blank"><b>Complete Collectors&#39; Edition</b></a> of all 62 entries, two bonuses and all the extraneous documentation that some of them came with. The ZIP is 5.52 MB in total, more than enough to defeat a PC200.
