    <h1>Nokia and Airbus elected as judges at the UPC, an unheard corruption of Justice</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
		
<p><strong>Brussels, 16th November 2022 — Nokia and Airbus got their patent lawyers elected as part-time technical judges at the forthcoming Unified Patent Court (UPC). Europe is witnessing corporate capture of its Justice system. Being ‘judges’ in the morning and ‘ patent lawyers’ in the afternoon.  The Unified Patent Court is way worse than the appointment of judges in Poland.</strong></p>



<p>Technical judges are part-time judges (half judge, half employee of a private company) without a law degree, and are usually patent attorneys working for law firms, or inside patent departments of large corporations (Nokia, Airbus, 3M, Orange, Agfa, etc…). </p>



<p>Benjamin Henrion, president of FFII, call for their immediate removal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Nokia as part time judge at the Unified Patent Court, this is a joke right? Europe is witnessing corporate capture of its Justice system. This is a frontal attack on the independence of the judge, and </em>judges should not receive any side salary<em>. This is worse than the case of Polish judges.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nokia has been very active a patent troll company, and is eager to influence the Unified Patent Court validating software patents in Europe, without any possible involvement of the European Court of Justice.</p>



<p>In the history of the project, there were rules forbidding this corporate capture of Judges in the failed European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) project in 2004, banning any side remunerated activity:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>CHAPTER I JUDGES – Article 6 Incompatibility of other functions</em></p>




<cite>— Draft Statute of the European Patent Court, Working Party on Litigation, 16.2.2004 <a href="https://www.uaipit.com/uploads/legislacion/files/1259753423_3_EPLA-20040216-Draft_Statute_of_EPCourt.pdf">https://www.uaipit.com/uploads/legislacion/files/1259753423_3_EPLA-20040216-Draft_Statute_of_EPCourt.pdf</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>There is also jurisprudence (Grosam Vs Czech Republic) at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg on violation of Art6(1) with <strong>side remuneration of judges</strong>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>(iii) The existence of guarantees against outside pressure</em></p>



<p><em>134. As concerns the existence of guarantees against outside pressure, the Court observes that two-thirds of the chamber’s members, the lay assessors, worked and <strong>received their salaries outside</strong>, which inevitably involved their material, hierarchical and administrative dependence on their primary employers and thereby <strong>could endangered both their independence and impartiality</strong> (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 113).</em></p>
<cite>— Grosam Vs Czech Republic, European Court of Human Rights, 2022 <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-217806%22]}">https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-217806%22]}</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Countries participating in the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA) seem to wilfully ignore those rules, and some politicians want the Agreement to enter into force at any cost. </p>
