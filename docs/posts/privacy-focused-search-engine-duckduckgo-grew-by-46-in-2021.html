<p>The privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo continues to grow rapidly, with the company now averaging over 100 million daily search queries and growing by almost 47% in 2021.</p>
<p>Unlike other search engines, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DuckDuckGo</a> says they do not track your searches or your behavior on other sites. Instead of building user profiles used to display interest-based ads, DuckDuckGo search pages display contextual advertisements based on the searched keywords.</p>
<p>This means that if you search on DuckDuckGo for a television, that search query will not be used to display television ads at every other site you visit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to build their search index, the search engine uses the <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/duckduckbot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DuckDuckBot</a> spider to crawl sites and receive data from partners, such as Wikipedia and Bing. However, they do not build their index using data from Google.</p>
<h2>DuckDuckGo shows rapid growth</h2>
<p>While Google remains the dominant search platform, DuckDuckGo has seen impressive year-over-year growth.</p>
<p>In 2020, DuckDuckGo received 23.6 billion total search queries and achieved a daily average of 79 million search queries by the end of December.</p>
<p>In 2021, DuckDuckGo received 34.6 billion total search queries so far and currently has an average of 100 million search queries per day, showing a 46.4% growth for the year.</p>

<p>While DuckDuckGo&#39;s growth is considerable, it still only has 2.53% of the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">total market share</a>, with Yahoo at 3.3%, Bing at 6.43%, and Google holding a dominant share of 87.33% of search engine traffic in the USA.</p>
<p>However, as people continue to become frustrated with how their data is being used by tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple, we will likely see more people switch to privacy-focused search engines.</p>
<p>To further help users protect their privacy, DuckDuckGo released an email forwarding service in 2021 called &#39;<a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Email Protection</a>&#39; that strips email trackers and allows you to protect your actual email address.</p>
<p>They also introduced &#39;<a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">App Tracking Protection for Android</a>,&#39; which blocks third-party trackers from Google and Facebook found in apps.</p>
<p>More recently, DuckDuckGo announced they are releasing a DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser for Desktop that will not be based on Chromium and will be built from scratch.</p>
<p>&#34;No complicated settings, no misleading warnings, no &#34;levels&#34; of privacy protection – just robust privacy protection that works by default, across search, browsing, email, and more,&#34; explains a recent <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> about the new browser.</p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s not a &#34;privacy browser&#34;; it&#39;s an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy because there&#39;s never a bad time to stop companies from spying on your search and browsing history.&#34;</p>
<p>For those looking to take back control of their data and add more privacy to their search behavior, DuckDuckGo may be the search engine for you.</p>
