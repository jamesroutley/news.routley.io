    <h1>Analyzing database trends through 1.8M Hacker News headlines</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2>How the analysis was done</h2>
<p>I used camelAI with a ClickHouse database of every HN story to do all analysis. You can use it for free with no login <a href="https://camelai.com/hackernews/">here</a> to explore the data interactively yourself.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>18 years • 1.8 million headlines • 13 database engines</h2>
<p>Hacker News is a real-time barometer of developer excitement. I mined every story title from February 2007 to June 2025 and asked three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has headline volume for each database changed over time?</li>
<li>Which engines are accelerating the fastest right now?</li>
<li>Which ones are losing steam?</li>
</ul>
<h2>1 · Raw popularity through time</h2>
<p>The chart below shows monthly headline counts for the eight most-talked-about engines, plus DuckDB (small base, big growth).</p>
<p><em>Click on the individual database names to toggle their visibility. Double click to isolate a single database.</em></p>


<p>PostgreSQL’s curve is a near-monotonic climb; by 2020 it dwarfs every other line.
MySQL dominates the pre-2012 era, then flat-lines.
MongoDB peaks around 2013, then slips as SQL engines add JSON support.
ClickHouse (2016) and DuckDB (2020) rocket up in the analytics renaissance.
Redis &amp; SQLite are steady, underscoring their “invisible infrastructure” roles.</p>
<h2>2 · Who’s gaining the fastest?</h2>
<p>I compared the last 12 months (Jul 2024 – Jun 2025) with the previous 12 months, then fit a linear regression over the last 36 months to capture trajectory.</p>

<p>DuckDB tops the growth chart: half of its lifetime headlines appeared this year.
ClickHouse maintains double-digit gains on a larger base, buoyed by vector search &amp; managed services.
Supabase benefits from the “Firebase, but OSS” narrative.
PostgreSQL’s YoY dip merely reflects an all-time-high 2023; its 3-yr slope (+1.22) is the steepest of all.
Cloud-native SaaS engines (DynamoDB, BigQuery, Redshift) are down sharply in share of conversation.</p>
<h2>3 · Engines in decline</h2>
<p>Headline counts aren’t everything, but they do reveal mind-share:</p>

<p>Why?
Maturity – less novelty, fewer “Show HN” launches.
OSS competition – Postgres extensions + parquet/iceberg lakehouses replace single-purpose stores.
Discussion shift – Cost, lock-in, and serverless topics often omit the product name.</p>
<h2>4 · Engagement-Weighted View of Hacker News Database Stories</h2>
<p><em>(July 2024 – June 2025)</em></p>
<p>Beyond raw headline counts, weighting stories by Hacker News points and comments reveals how intensely developers engage with each database.</p>

<p><em>Aggregate story count, points, and comments for each database in the last 12 months.</em></p>
<h3>Insights when weighting by points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> dominates raw engagement—no surprise given its sheer volume of stories.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQLite</strong> punches far above its weight:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one-third the story count of Postgres but two-thirds the total points.</p>
</li>
<li>Highest average score per story (40 pts) among mainstream engines.</li>
<li><strong>Redis</strong> consistently sparks high-interest conversations, ranking highly in average points per story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insights when weighting by comments:</h3>
<ul>
<li>High-comment threads often involve operational war stories or novel deployments (e.g., “SQLite in production at the edge”).</li>
<li><strong>BigQuery</strong> and <strong>DynamoDB</strong> receive respectable per-story points (17 and 7, respectively) yet generate fewer comments, hinting at passive interest rather than debate.</li>
<li><strong>TimescaleDB</strong> and <strong>Redshift</strong> barely move the needle, confirming their sliding community mind-share.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What the weighted lens adds:</h3>
<p>Raw mention counts reveal frequency; weighting by points and comments captures intensity of community reaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SQLite’s</strong> high per-story engagement reinforces its status as a beloved workhorse.</li>
<li><strong>DuckDB</strong> garners solid points but fewer comments, typical for emerging tools still new to many readers.</li>
<li><strong>ClickHouse</strong> stories show moderate engagement, suggesting interest but perhaps less day-to-day usage among the broader HN audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, frequency and engagement metrics offer a richer, more nuanced perspective on developer sentiment.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>Both raw popularity and weighted engagement metrics show clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open‑source engines drive most new discussion.</li>
<li>Analytics‑focused stores (DuckDB, ClickHouse) gain as work moves from batch to interactive.</li>
<li>Slow, steady improvement (PostgreSQL) beats hype cycles.</li>
<li>Proprietary cloud databases draw fewer submissions over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further analysis</h2>
<p>Questions you can run next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which databases appear most in headlines containing &#34;alternative to&#34; or &#34;replacing&#34;?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the ratio of positive (launched, shipped) vs negative (outage, breach) headlines?</li>
<li>How do vector database mentions (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) compare to traditional databases?</li>
<li>Which lesser-known databases are on exponential growth curves?</li>
