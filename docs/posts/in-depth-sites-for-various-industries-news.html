    <h1>Ask HN: In-depth sites for various industries&#39; news?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>During the ship-stuck-in-the-canal days, I was introduced to freightwaves.com, and another HN post along the line introduced me to mining.com.  What are some interesting, in-depth sites similar to those but for other industries? Like for solar, wind, and nuclear, for instance? I can google them, but I like hearing recommendations from people that are in the industry!</p></td></div></div>
