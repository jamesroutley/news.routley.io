		<h2>
			Who&#39;s making it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The same people that made the first one!
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_Boy">2DBOY</a> has teamed up with
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Corporation">Tomorrow Corporation</a>,
			along with a squad of talented friends. This is the biggest game we&#39;ve ever made.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Do you have the social media?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Social media didn&#39;t exist back when the original came out, but you&#39;re in luck -
			we plugged in our dial-up modem and made these. Only 3 of the 5 are multi-billion dollar tech companies:
			</p><ul>

				<li>
					
					<a href="https://twitter.com/TomorrowCorp">twirter</a>
					for hot takes that we&#39;ll regret later
				</li>

				<li>
					
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/World-of-Goo/100072293071879/">facebuk</a>
					for general surveillance of the project</li>

		<h2>
			How did you fit so much goo into this game?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Computers have come a long way in the last 15 years!
		</p>

		<h2>
			Help! I installed something I found on the internet called
			worldofg002-&amp;@%-realgame.exe and now my computer is on fire?
		</h2>
		<p>
			World of Goo 2 has not yet been released. It will come out soon, in 2024.
		</p>

		<h2>
			I used to play the original World of Goo when I was a kid.
			Will this make me feel like a kid again?
		</h2>
		<p>
			You might be able to visit for a while.
		</p>

		<h2>
			What platforms or consoles will it be on? Can I play it on my-
		</h2>
		<p>
			Dandy Wheeler, PR specialist: Yes, let&#39;s enjoy this moment, right now, where anything is possible.
			Can you play it on your 2004 Discman? Maybe. Let&#39;s just let the vast expanse of uncertainty
			fill our hearts with wonder, while we fill our bank accounts with exclusive distributon contracts.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Can I be on the soundtrack? I play djembe, bass clarinet, theramin, and cardboard boxes?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We&#39;ve always wanted to assemble a soundtrack with performances from
			lots of different musicians. Do you play an instrument and have the ability to record yourself?
			<a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/about">Contact us here</a>
			if you&#39;d like to try this out with us. Tell us which instrument(s) you play, and bonus points
			if you can link to audio or video of you playing something.
		</p>

		<h2>
			I speak one of Earth&#39;s many languages. Do you need help translating the game?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Bonjour! All our games have been community-translated, and we&#39;d love to continue the tradition with World of Goo 2.
			<a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/about">Contact us here</a>
			if this sounds like a project for you!
		</p>

		<h2>
			I missed you, World of Goo!
		</h2>
		<p>
			We hope you will love it as much as we&#39;ve loved building and discovering this new world so far!
