								<h2>How it works</h2>

								<p>This program is designed for developers who host mini apps and games, which are experiences that are built using web technologies like HTML5 or JavaScript and distributed within a larger, native app. Participating apps are required to support certain App Store technologies, including the Declared Age Range API and the Advanced Commerce API in order to provide a safe and seamless experience for customers. As a result, program members earn 85% of <a href="#qualifying-in-app-purchase">qualifying In‑App Purchase</a> sales within <a href="#qualifying-mini-app">qualifying mini apps</a>.</p>

								<h3>Implement host app requirements</h3>

								<p>To be eligible for the Mini Apps Partner Program:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Your app must be available on iOS and iPadOS on the App Store.</li>
									<li>You must ensure all hosted mini apps comply with applicable requirements from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/">Apple Developer Program License Agreement</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines">App Review Guidelines</a>, including the specific requirements listed in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software">guideline 4.7</a> — Mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators — and have provided a manifest required by guideline 4.7.4 that’s approved by Apple and includes hosted mini app metadata.</li>
									<li>You must provide metadata that follows the outlined guidance in order to identify all mini app in-app purchases (including non-qualifying) and the digital goods and services sold. This allows customers to clearly understand what purchases they’re making within your qualifying mini apps, as well as helps Apple identify qualifying In‑App Purchases and apply appropriate commission rate.</li>
									<li>Your app must support the following technologies: 
										<ul>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/">Advanced Commerce API</a> and supporting technologies</strong> to properly merchandise qualifying mini apps and any associated purchases.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange">Declared Age Rating API<span></span></a></strong> to help provide age-appropriate content and experiences within your app.</li>
											<li><strong>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/">In‑App Purchase</a> system</strong> to provide users with a familiar and trusted way to make purchases and easily check their purchase history, view, modify, or cancel subscriptions, as well as access customer support, like requesting a refund.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/send_consumption_information"> Send Consumption Information<span></span></a></strong> endpoint in the App Store Server API to send information about a user’s In‑App Purchase to Apple when they request a refund. This information also helps to inform and improve the refund request process.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

								<h4 id="mini-app">What’s a mini app?</h4>
								<p>Mini apps are software packages, scripts, or game content that are added after app installation and executed on the device, provided such code is written in HTML5 or JavaScript, or another language approved by Apple. All such code must comply with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/#apis-functionality">Section 3.3.1(B)</a> of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.</p>

								<h4 id="qualifying-mini-app">What’s a qualifying mini app?</h4>
								<p>A qualifying mini app within the Mini Apps Partner Program is one that’s put out by a person or entity that’s not directly or indirectly controlled by you, nor under common control with you. “Control” for the purposes of this definition means that an entity or person possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of the other entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, an interest in registered capital, by contract, or otherwise.</p>

								<h4 id="qualifying-in-app-purchase">What’s a qualifying mini app In‑App Purchase?</h4>
								<p>A qualifying In‑App Purchase is the sale of any digital goods and services within a qualifying mini app, including consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions. These purchases are facilitated by the Advanced Commerce API. For example:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Consumables, such as currency, lives, or items, that are purchased and used immediately within a single qualifying mini app. Keep in mind that in order to qualify as eligible mini app In‑App Purchases, these purchases cannot be shared or consumed across mini apps.</li>
									<li>An auto-renewing subscription that’s purchased and accessed within a single qualifying mini app.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Am I eligible for the Mini Apps Partner Program if I’m already a participant in other Apple programs?</h4>
								<p>Yes. If approved, your app may participate in the Mini Apps Partner Program while also participating in Apple programs such as the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/video-partner/">Apple Video Partner Program<span></span></a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-news/program/">News Partner Program<span></span></a>, or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App Store Small Business Program</a>.</p>

								<h4>Can I apply for the program if I haven’t been approved for the Advanced Commerce API? </h4>
								<p>Yes. If you don’t currently have access to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/">Advanced Commerce API</a>, we recommend applying for Advanced Commerce API access and the Mini Apps Partner Program at the same time. In order to be approved for the Mini Apps Partner Program, you will need to have been approved for and support the Advanced Commerce API.
								</p>

								<h4>Can I use App Store Connect to manage In‑App Purchases within my hosted mini apps?</h4>
								<p>No. In order to participate in the economic benefits of the Mini Apps Partner Program, you’re required to use the Advanced Commerce API to manage any In‑App Purchases within your hosted mini apps.
