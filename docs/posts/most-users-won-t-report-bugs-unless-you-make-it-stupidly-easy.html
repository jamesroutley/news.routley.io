    <h1>Show HN: Most users won&#39;t report bugs unless you make it stupidly easy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Most feedback tools are built like people actually want to report bugs. They don’t. Unless you make it dead-simple, or better yet - a little fun.</p><p>After shipping a few SaaS products, I noticed a pattern: Bugs? Yes. Bug reports? No.</p><p>Not because users didn’t care but because reporting bugs is usually a terrible experience.</p><p>Most tools want users to:</p><p>* Fill out a long form</p><p>* Enter their email</p><p>* Describe a bug they barely understand</p><p>* Maybe sign in or create an account</p><p>* Then maybe submit it</p><p>Let’s be real: no one’s doing that. Especially not someone just trying to use your product.</p><p>So I built Bugdrop.app - It’s a little draggable bug icon that users can drop right on the issue, type a quick note, and they’re done. No logins. No forms. Just context-rich feedback that your team can actually use — with screenshots, browser info, even console logs if they hit an error.</p><p>And weirdly? People actually use it. Even non-technical users click it just because &#34;the little bug looked fun.&#34;</p><p>I didn’t want to build another &#34;feedback suite&#34;. I just wanted something lightweight, fast, and so stupidly simple that people actually report stuff. If you&#39;ve ever had a user say “something’s broken” and then ghost you forever, you probably get where I’m coming from.</p><p>What I’m most proud of? People are actually using it. And their users? They’re actually reporting stuff. Even non-technical ones.</p><p>Would love to hear if you’ve faced similar problems, and if this feels like something that would’ve helped in your own projects. Not trying to sell you anything — just sharing something I built to scratch my own itch.</p></div></div></div>
