    <p>Every company says they &#34;care about your privacy.&#34; It&#39;s in every privacy policy, every marketing page, every investor deck. But if I can reset your password via email, I know who you are. If I log your IP, I know where you are. If I require phone verification, I have leverage over you.</p>
    <p><strong>That&#39;s not privacy. That&#39;s performance art.</strong></p>

<section>
    <p>In 2025, &#34;privacy&#34; has become the most abused word in tech. It&#39;s slapped on products that require government IDs, services that log everything, and platforms that couldn&#39;t protect user data if they tried.</p>

    <p>Real anonymity isn&#39;t a marketing claim. It&#39;s an architectural decision that makes it <em>impossible</em> to compromise users, even if you wanted to. Even if someone put a gun to your head. Even if a three-letter agency showed up with a warrant.</p>

    <p>Let me show you the difference.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Privacy Theater Playbook</h2>
    
    <p>Here&#39;s how the average &#34;privacy-focused&#34; service actually works:</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code>User Journey:
1. Enter email address
2. Verify email (now we have your email)
3. Create password (now we can reset it via email)
4. Add phone for &#34;security&#34; (now we have your phone)
5. Confirm identity for &#34;fraud prevention&#34; (now we have your ID)
6. Enable 2FA (more identity vectors)

Privacy Policy:
&#34;We care deeply about your privacy and only collect 
necessary information to provide our services...&#34;

Translation:
We have everything. We log everything. 
We just promise to be careful with it.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The problem isn&#39;t malice. Most services genuinely try to protect user data. But protection implies possession. And possession is the vulnerability.</p>

    <p><strong>You can&#39;t leak what you don&#39;t have. You can&#39;t be forced to hand over what doesn&#39;t exist.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Mullvad Moment</h2>
    
    <p>In 2023, Swedish police raided Mullvad VPN&#39;s offices with a search warrant. They wanted user data. Customer information. Connection logs. Anything.</p>

    <p>They left empty-handed.</p>

    <p>Not because Mullvad refused to cooperate. Not because they hid the data. But because <em>there was no data to give</em>. Mullvad&#39;s entire identity system is a randomly generated account number. No email. No name. No records.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://servury.com/assets/img/blog/mullvad-account.png" alt="Mullvad VPN account number - just 16 random digits"/>
        <figcaption>Mullvad&#39;s entire authentication system: 16 random digits. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the whole identity.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When the police realized this, they couldn&#39;t even argue. The architecture made compliance impossible. Not difficult. <strong>Impossible</strong>.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s what real anonymity looks like.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How We Built The Same Thing</h2>
    
    <p>When we designed Servury, we asked ourselves: what&#39;s the minimum information needed to run a cloud hosting platform?</p>

    <p>Turns out, not much:</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code>// What we DON&#39;T collect:
- Email address (no recovery, no marketing, no leaks)
- Name (we don&#39;t care who you are)
- IP addresses (not logged, not stored, not tracked)
- Payment information (handled by processors, not us)
- Usage patterns (no analytics, no telemetry, nothing)
- Device fingerprints (your browser, your business)
- Geographic data (beyond what&#39;s needed for server selection)

// What we DO store:
- 32-character credential (random alphanumeric string)
- Account balance (need to know if you can deploy)
- Active services (servers and proxies you&#39;re running)

That&#39;s it. Three data points.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>No &#34;forgot password&#34; link. No email verification. No phone number for &#34;account security.&#34; Because every one of those features requires storing identity, and identity is the attack surface.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Trade-Off Nobody Talks About</h2>

    <p>Here&#39;s the part where other &#34;privacy&#34; companies quietly change the subject: <strong>lose your credential, you&#39;re done.</strong></p>

    <p>No recovery process. No support ticket that can restore access. No &#34;verify your identity&#34; workflow. If that 32-character string disappears, so does your account.</p>

    <p>And you know what? That&#39;s <em>exactly the point</em>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Traditional service: &#34;We can help you recover your account by verifying your identity&#34;</li>
        
        <li>Servury: &#34;We literally cannot help you recover your account&#34;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The inconvenience of memorizing (or securely storing) a random string is the <em>cost</em> of anonymity. Anyone who tells you that you can have both perfect anonymity AND easy account recovery is lying or doesn&#39;t understand the threat model.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What This Actually Means In Practice</h2>

    <p>Let&#39;s walk through a real scenario:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&#34;Hi Servury support, I lost access to my account. Can you help me recover it?&#34;</p>
        <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we have no way to verify account ownership. If you don&#39;t have your credential, the account is inaccessible to everyone, including us.&#34;</p>
        <p>&#34;But I can prove it&#39;s me! Here&#39;s my payment receipt, my IP address, the exact time I signed up—&#34;</p>
        <p>&#34;We don&#39;t store any of that information. There&#39;s nothing to match against.&#34;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Is this frustrating for users who lose their credentials? Absolutely. Is it a feature? <strong>Absolutely.</strong></p>

    <p>Because on the flip side:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Law enforcement can&#39;t social engineer your account access</li>
        <li>Hackers can&#39;t phish or reset your credentials via email</li>
        <li>We can&#39;t accidentally leak your personal information (because we don&#39;t have it)</li>
        <li>No government can force us to reveal who you are (because we genuinely don&#39;t know)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Email Trap</h2>

    <p>Email addresses are the original sin of modern internet identity. They seem harmless. Universal. Convenient. And they completely destroy anonymity.</p>

    <div>
        <pre><code>Why email kills anonymity:

1. Email IS identity
   - Tied to phone numbers
   - Tied to payment methods  
   - Tied to other services
   - Recovery mechanisms expose you

2. Email IS trackable
   - Read receipts
   - Link tracking
   - Metadata analysis
   - Cross-service correlation

3. Email IS persistent
   - Exists beyond single service
   - Archived forever
   - Subpoenaed retroactively
   - Leaked in breaches

4. Email IS social engineering
   - Phishing vector
   - Password reset vulnerability
   - Support ticket exploitation
   - Impersonation risk</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The moment you require an email address, you&#39;re not building for anonymity. You&#39;re building for accountability. And sometimes that&#39;s fine! Banks should know who you are. Government services should verify identity. But cloud infrastructure? VPNs? Proxy services?</p>

    <p><strong>We shouldn&#39;t need to know a damn thing about you.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Crypto Payments: Not Just For Criminals</h2>

    <p>We accept cryptocurrency not because we&#39;re trying to hide from authorities. We accept it because traditional payment systems are surveillance infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Every credit card transaction creates a permanent record linking your identity to your purchase. Your bank knows. The payment processor knows. The merchant knows. And they all store it. Forever.</p>

    <p>Cryptocurrency breaks that chain. Not perfectly—blockchain analysis is a thing—but enough to decouple payment from persistent identity. Especially when combined with no-email registration.</p>

    <p>And for those who need traditional payments? We support Stripe. Because pragmatism matters. But we don&#39;t pretend that credit card payments are anonymous. We&#39;re honest about the trade-offs.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What Anonymity Isn&#39;t</h2>

    <p>Let&#39;s be crystal clear about what we&#39;re NOT claiming:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymity ≠ Impunity</strong></li>
        
        <li><strong>Anonymity ≠ Security</strong></li>
        
        <li><strong>Anonymity ≠ Invisibility</strong></li>
        
        <li><strong>Anonymity ≠ Zero Trust Required</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Anonymity is about limiting the damage when trust fails. It&#39;s about architecture that can&#39;t betray you even if the humans running it wanted to.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>The internet is splitting into two worlds: the authenticated web and the anonymous web.</p>

    <p>The authenticated web is where governments and corporations want you. Real names. Verified identities. Traceable payments. Every action logged and analyzed. It&#39;s convenient. It&#39;s personalized. It&#39;s surveilled.</p>

    <p>The anonymous web is where privacy still exists. Where you can explore, experiment, and communicate without building a permanent record. Where your data can&#39;t be weaponized against you because it was never collected.</p>

    <p>Every service that requires real identity for no technical reason is pushing you toward the authenticated web. Every credential-based, no-email, crypto-accepting service is keeping the anonymous web alive.</p>

    <p><strong>This isn&#39;t about having something to hide. It&#39;s about refusing to live under constant surveillance as the default.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Privacy is when they promise to protect your data.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&#39;s the difference, that&#39;s what we built, that&#39;s real anonymity.</p>

    <p>A 32-character string. No email. No identity. No bullshit.</p>

    <p>Everything else is just marketing.</p>
