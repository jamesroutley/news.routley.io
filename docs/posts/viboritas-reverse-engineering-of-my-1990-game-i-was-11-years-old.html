    <h1>Viboritas: Reverse engineering of my 1990 game (I was 11 years old)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/viboritas_screenshot.png" width="30%" alt="Viboritas updated in action"/></p><p>I had completely forgotten about this game, but fortunately I made backups of my floppy disks for historical record. Recently, I looked at the floppy disk backup index, and I found things as old as 1989, and a name caught my attention: Viboritas (Spanish for little snakes).</p>
<p>
This game was coded around 1990, printed, and later saved onto a 5 1/4&#34; floppy disk, then copied again onto a 3 1/2&#34; floppy disk by 1992 when these became mainstream (the image I found), and finally, it was back up around 2011. These backups survived by luck several hard drive crashes till we reach 2024.</p>
<p>
I opened the file, extracted the 2K binary, and memories started coming slowly. I even caught a 34 year-old bug.</p>
<h2>The history</h2>
<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/viboritas_computer.jpg" width="40%" alt="1990 homebrew computer for students"/></p><p>
After doing my <a href="https://nanochess.org/notebook.html">first game in Z80 assembler in 1988</a>, I got a lot of confidence in my abilities and went to do several other Z80 programs. However, I lacked access to a proper assembler program, and instead, I coded directly into machine code using a monitor-style program just like shown in the picture at the right, you can even see the Z80 code being typed!
</p>
<p>
A monitor program was a small application in the ROM of the computer where you had some basic commands like memory listing, writing to memory, and executing your program. Some extras were exit points for your program to show the contents of the Z80 registers and flags.
</p>
<p>
My father gave again a lecture about computer building in 1990, and I showcased <a href="https://nanochess.org/notebook.html">my Karateka game</a>, but I wanted to do something better. I was 11 years old, about to become a teen, and I had a great imagination about impressive games.</p>
<p>
My development environment for this game was a homebrew computer for students with a keyboard, a TV for display, and a set of sheets from Zilog with the Z80 mnemonics and respective machine code.
</p>
<p>
The specifications for this homebrew computer were a Zilog Z80 CPU, 2K of EPROM, 2K of RAM, a TMS9118 VDP, and a Commodore keyboard. You could plug in an expansion board with an AY-3-8910 sound chip that fed from the Z80 clock. The VDP chip, AY chip, and keyboard were readily available because of the 1984 crash.
</p>

<h2>Into the binary</h2>
<p>
At the time, I was very inspired by my favorite magazine: Input MSX, in this case issue 12, containing screenshots of a game called Future Knight, and I was in awe imagining how great was it by the <a href="https://archive.org/details/InputMSX/Input%20MSX%2012/page/n45/mode/2up">screenshots and cover art</a> (later I discovered it is a pretty boring game). In the same issue, there was a BASIC language game called &#34;<a href="https://archive.org/details/InputMSX/Input%20MSX%2012/page/n39/mode/2up">El Castillo Embrujado</a>&#34; that I already had ported to the BASIC language available in another homebrew computer built by my father.
</p>
<p>
For this project, I wanted to do a science fiction game in 2K, where the player would use ladders, avoid enemies, and... I had no more. But I was inspired by the ton of ladders in Future Knight. I didn&#39;t know what size coding was, but I put the 2K limit in my mind, and the other objective was that the game should be coded directly into the student&#39;s computer, now most known as coding in the real hardware.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t envision a final for the game, nor a history, or even a gameplay. After all, I only wanted to have fun developing games, and of course, showcase my game to the students. Notice that having fun developing games isn&#39;t the same as developing fun games.
</p>
<p>
    I think that this is my 3rd game in machine code for Z80 processors. The binary came from a 1992 demo disk for students, but it was originally coded in 1990. I only extracted the 2K of the game from the 720K disk image.
</p>
<p>
The binary of the game looks like this:
</p>
<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/viboritas_bin.png" width="80%" alt="Part of the original binary of Viboritas"/>
</p>
<p>
Given the lack of information about it, I will have to reverse-engineer my own game! The first pass was to fully disassemble it. It sized up to just over one thousand lines of Z80 assembler code but more easily read looking like this:
</p>
<pre><small>
            ORG $8000

        FNAME &#34;viboritas.bin&#34;

L04CC:      EQU $04CC
L0100:      EQU $0100
L0169:      EQU $0169
L0447:      EQU $0447

L8000:      CALL L04CC
            CALL L801B
            CALL L81BA
L8009:      CALL L8217
L800C:      CALL L8324
            CALL L8504
            JR NC,L800C
L8014:      LD HL,L87FC
            INC (HL)
            JP L8009
</small></pre>
<p>
I separated the ROM calls, and I don&#39;t remember if I have a copy of this computer ROM, but I still remember the function of each call (these are the same as in my first Z80 game). L0100 sets a VDP address (for VRAM or VDP registers), L0169 reads ahead to send data to VRAM, L04CC cleans the screen, and L0447 reads the keyboard. A thing that changed between 1988 and 1990 computers was the port numbers for the VDP.
</p>
<p>
I made sure the disassembled listing assembles the same binary as the original. Then I started separately the adaptation for the MSX computers and Colecovision consoles, both having the same video processor, so you can play the game. Just don&#39;t expect too much from a kid.
</p>
<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>
For starters, I&#39;ll reuse the translation layer I made for <a href="https://nanochess.org/notebook.html">my Karateka game in Z80 assembler</a>. It will help us to play this old game on an MSX or Colecovision.

<p>
We now start analyzing the code, trying to discover how it works. We&#39;ll go forward and backward on the 2K memory map and as I coded directly in machine code, there are no names for labels except for their corresponding address in the original binary.

<p>
The first call is pretty obvious, it simply clears the screen. Notice the original game assumed the VDP was already initialized, but we already took care of it with <i>CALL setup_vdp</i>.
</p>
<p>
The next call L801B apparently does graphics set up.
</p>
<pre><small>
L801B:      LD HL,$0400	; VRAM bitmap data $80 character.
            LD DE,L806A
            LD BC,$00C8
            CALL L805D
            LD HL,$2400	; VRAM color data $80 character (1st).
            LD DE,L8112
            LD BC,$001B
            CALL L8148
            LD HL,$2C00	; VRAM color data $80 character (2nd).
            LD DE,L8112
            LD BC,$001B
            CALL L8148
            LD HL,$3400	; VRAM color data $80 character (3rd).
            LD DE,L8112
            LD BC,$001B
            CALL L8148
            LD HL,$3800	; VRAM sprite bitmaps.
            LD DE,L8404
            LD BC,$0100
            CALL L805D
            LD HL,$4400	; Obviously a patch.
            JP L83FB

L83FB:      CALL L0100
            LD HL,$41C2
            JP L0100
</small></pre>
<p>
The target address for VRAM is in the register HL, while the source address is in DE, and the byte count is in BC. That&#39;s completely reversed from the standard Z80 definitions for LDIR, or the MSX LDIRVM BIOS subroutine.
</p>
<p>
As I was coding in machine code, any mistake was a pain to correct, especially if you needed to insert additional instructions! As you can see the jump to $83FB continues setting register 4 of VDP to zero, and then proceeds to set up register 1 of VDP for 16x16 sprites.
</p>
<p>
The VDP in high-resolution mode needs to have separate bitmap definitions for three 64-pixel-high areas for a total of 192 vertical rows. Setting the VDP register 4 is a trick for the VDP to repeat the top bitmap into the other two screen areas. I found this trick months ago experimenting different values for VDP registers.
</p>
<p>
So we mark L801B as &#34;Setup graphics&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Then we have the L805D subroutine that simply copies data from the memory to VRAM.
</p>
<pre><small>
L805D:      CALL L0100
L8060:      LD A,(DE)
            OUT (VDP),A
            INC DE
            DEC BC
            LD A,B
            OR C
            JR NZ,L8060
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
Now I can see why I did it that way as the L0100 subroutine uses HL as VDP address then it was easier for me to have the source data pointed by the register DE. I&#39;ve replaced the original port $B0 (VDP write) and $c0 (VDP read) with the VDP definition for the current console (MSX or Colecovision).

And that&#39;s right, the kid was smart enough to create a decompressor that reads a count of bytes and a byte to replicate. So 73 bytes replace 200 bytes of color.

Do you remember I mentioned &#34;El Castillo Embrujado&#34; from Input MSX? At age 11 I wasn&#39;t very confident in my graphical design abilities, so for my game I reused the sprite graphics for the player and the snakes. Many years later I discovered these graphics from &#34;El Castillo Embrujado&#34; were in fact a copy from another game, the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR_y7iYNqzA">Abu-Simbel Profanation</a> for ZX Spectrum.
</p>
<p>
However, for this article I&#39;ll help my younger myself designing all-new graphics. If you are curious about it you can see the previous graphics set in the viboritas_orig.asm file.

<p>
Ok, it increments a byte at L87FA, and when it reaches the value 8 it is reset to zero and proceeds to increment L87F9 until it reaches 48 when it is reset to 1. Of course! L87F9 is the index number in the song table, and L87FA is the counter of note duration.
</p>
<p>
Then it uses the index to get the note to play from L8744. Here is a machine code trick that isn&#39;t useful when converting to assembler mnemonics: You know the data is fixed at the address, so there is no handling for carry to the higher address byte.
</p>
<p>
Now we have another patch, this time calling L8197 to get the note frequency to play, and then it writes to the AY-3-8910 sound chip. The $00 port address sets the AY-3-8910 index register, and the $80 port address sets the AY-3-8910 data register. It even sets the register 7 of PSG to $38 to disable white noise, and this value can burn for real some MSX1 computers. Let us replace the sound code:
</p>

<p>
Also at first glance, I thought this routine was written first, but then I realized it occupies the space of an uncompressed color table! When I optimized the color table definition to use compression, I added the song player in the freed space!
</p>
<p>
This means the first version of my game didn&#39;t have any music, and there&#39;s a chance that somewhere in my files exists a printout. And I just remembered a thing: I coded the game without music, and a student had a background in music, and he handed me some musical notes that I implemented terribly because I didn&#39;t know anything about music timing.
</p>
<p>
The music is a rendition of a boogie-woogie. The music player still goes on, and there is a very weird patch jumping at L8398. But we&#39;ll see it later, as it looks like the keyboard code.
</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>
Now we go to the next unexplored code at L81BA:
</p>
<pre><small>
L81BA:      XOR A
            LD (L87F3),A
            LD (L87F4),A
            LD (L87F7),A
            LD (L87F8),A
            LD A,$F0
            LD (L87F5),A
            LD A,$01

            LD (L8787),A
            LD HL,$0000
            LD (L87F9),HL
            LD A,$02
            LD (L87FB),A
            CALL L04CC
            LD HL,$3EE9
            CALL L0100
            CALL L0169
            db &#34;(C) OTEK 1990&#34;,0
            LD HL,$3EAC
            CALL L0100
            CALL L0169
            db &#34;VIDAS:0&#34;,0
            LD A,$01
            JP L82A5
</small></pre>
<p>
This is looking like an initialization code (let us add a note to L81BA as game initialization).
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll discover the function of each variable soon. So far it cleans again the screen, sets up the VDP to the last row of the screen, and shows the copyright message. OTEK comes from my father&#39;s initials (Oscar Toledo Esteva) which we used as a kind of company name.
</p>
<p>
Also, it shows the number of remaining lives (VIDAS in Spanish), and... another patch jumps to L82A5.
</p>
<pre><small>
L82A5:      LD (L87FC),A
            XOR A
            LD (L87FE),A
            LD (L87FF),A
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
It is simply some more variable initialization.
</p>
<h2>Screen drawing</h2>
<p>
Now another routine L8217 that is called immediately after in L8009:

<p>
It starts by getting a variable from L87FC, multiplying by 4, adding $7c, and saving the result at L87FD.  L87FC is initialized to one. This starts at $80, it sounds like the character number for level definition. It draws in sequence 160 walls (3 characters) + columns (one character), then it draws over 4 floors starting at row 4 ($3c80), each one 32 characters wide, using the character in L87FD offset by 2.
</p>
<p>
It sets the border to black ($4701), and then the base charset ($00-$7f characters) for the three zones of the screen is set to black (three calls to L8277)

<p>
The L8288 patch adds the &#34;drain&#34; character $94 at the bottom right of the screen. I still don&#39;t understand why I didn&#39;t just draw a 2x2 door, but probably I felt like there were space constraints (defining the graphics and drawing the tiles).
</p>
<p>
At the end, it calls 3 times the L82B0 subroutine with different screen rows as the base:
</p>
<pre><small>

<p>
¡Mystery solved! L830F draws a ladder on the screen. Each ladder is 5 rows high, and it is drawn using the level base character offset by 3. In the first level it will draw 5 ladders on each floor, while in the fifth level, it will draw only one ladder for each floor. That&#39;s an attempt to make more difficult levels.
</p>
<p>
With all this code analyzed we can mark safely L8217 as the level drawing code.

Now we have the first routine called from the main loop and it is L8324:

<p>
It loads HL with $1b00, pointing to the Sprite Attribute Table. The VRAM place where sprites are positioned on the screen. And it starts reading variables and writing to VRAM using L8390 (pretty similar to WRTVRM of MSX)
</p>
<p>
L8786 is the Y-coordinate for the player, L8787 is the X-coordinate for the player, L87FE is the sprite frame for the player. The player color is white.
</p>
<p>
It is easily deduced next that the enemies are placed at fixed vertical positions on the screen ($38, $60, and $88) using a generic routine L86C5. Notice also that it chain links to the L815B subroutine for playing the background music, which in turn chain links to the keyboard decode subroutine (L8398).

<p>
The first byte pointed by DE is used for the X-coordinate of the enemy. And the next byte signals the movement direction to select the sprite frame for the enemy. It also switches frames using L8788 to get alternate movement frames (along with B set to base frame $18 or $20). Then it does something really weird, copying the memory area L8704 into VRAM address $390c. Oh, I see, it defines two sprites very late in the game (the two sprite frames for snakes moving to the right), it is kind of obvious that I didn&#39;t foresee all the required sprites for the game.
</p>
<p>
For this updated version of the game, I&#39;ll modify slightly the code:
</p>
<pre><small>
            LD HL,$3900	; Define frame sprites $20 and $24
            LD DE,L8700	; Data for snake going to right.
            LD BC,$0040	; Length of data.
            CALL L805D	; Copy to VRAM.
</small></pre>
<p>
It would not have fit by 8 bytes, or I would have to move a significant portion of code to make space. In this case my option could have been moving the portion of code at $8504-$8533 (the complex enemy movement code), but I didn&#39;t have a MOVE command in the monitor program. I had to copy manually the machine code at the new position.
</p>
<pre><small>

<h2>Player movement</h2>
<p>
The music player chain links to the keyboard code:
</p>
<pre><small>
L8398:      CALL L0447
            CP $10
            JP Z,L83DD

            JP Z,L8684
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
Now this code is looking every moment more like spaghetti code, and it also needs to be rewritten for portable joystick handling:
</p>
<pre><small>
L8398:      CALL GTSTCK
            CP $07		; Going left?

            JP Z,L85B5
            CP $05		; Going down?
            JP Z,L8567
	    CALL GTTRIG
            CP $ff		; Button pressed?
            JP Z,L8684
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
The first joystick subroutine is L83B5:
</p>
<pre><small>
L83B5:      LD HL,L8787
            INC (HL)
            INC (HL)
            NOP
            LD A,(HL)
            CP $00
            JR NZ,L83C2
            LD (HL),$FE
L83C2:      LD A,(L87FE)
            CP $04
            JR NZ,L83CD
            LD A,$00
            JR L83CF

L83CD:      LD A,$04
L83CF:      LD (L87FE),A
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
At this point, we know that L8787 is the X-coordinate of the player (based on the Sprite Attribute Table writes), and the double increment makes clear that the player moves to the right. If the X-coordinate becomes 0, it is rewritten with limit $fe (254 pixels). It also animates the player switching between sprite frames $00 and $04.
</p>
<pre><small>
L83DD:      LD HL,L8787
            DEC (HL)
            DEC (HL)
            NOP
            LD A,(HL)
            CP $FE
            JR NZ,L83EA
            LD (HL),$00
L83EA:      LD A,(L87FE)
            CP $0C
            JR NZ,L83F5
            LD A,$08
            JR L83F7

L83F5:      LD A,$0C
L83F7:      LD (L87FE),A
            RET
</small></pre>
<p>
The next subroutine is the opposite: Moving the player to the left by two pixels. It also checks for exceeding the left border and sets the X-coordinate to zero. It animates the player switching between sprite frames $08 and $0c.
</p>
<p>
The NOP instruction after the two decrements makes me think that I considered moving horizontally the player at a speed of three pixels.
</p>
<h2>Using ladders</h2>
<p>
The code to allow the player to go up and down over the ladders is heavily patched, so probably it took me a lot of effort and experiments.

The innocent kid reads from VRAM the coordinates of the player, but why on Earth? These variables were already available in RAM. 
</p>

It first reads from VRAM $1b00 the Y-coordinate of the player into register D converted to a screen row coordinate, and it also reads the X-coordinate into register E and adjusts it to a screen column coordinate. It finally takes both numbers to create a pointer to the VRAM screen.

The code for moving the player upwards is pretty similar, and somehow I did the right thing in this code using the existing coordinates in RAM. This means I was reaching my limits, and having 2K of machine code in the head isn&#39;t so easy!
</p>
<p>
There are a few differences more like the different offset on the screen ($3c20 versus $3c40), and the fact it calls L8605 to do a comparison with the ladder character. If it isn&#39;t a ladder, it aligns the player vertically (again using a patch), and using POP HL it returns to the main loop instead of the original caller. If it is a ladder, it moves the player two pixels upwards.
</p>
<p>
Now for the great embarrassing moment: the player can walk over the air. Because the code for handling left and right never checks if the player is over a floor. As the floors are always in the same vertical position, it would be simply a matter of checking if the player is over one of the valid Y-coordinates, but I can remember vaguely I was afraid of moving the code again. Lazy kid!

The subroutine first checks for the Y-coordinate to be $87, and the X-coordinate is between $e8 and $f7 (good tolerance) and if the conditions are met it resets the stack pointer, sets the player again at the top-left of the screen, and if the level number isn&#39;t 5 then it jumps to L8014 to increase the level number else it shows a message &#34;HAS GANADO&#34; (Spanish for you win) on the screen.

The L878A routine does a big delay so the &#34;HAS GANADO !&#34; message stays on the screen, and then resets the game, and sends the player back to level 1.

<p>
The second subroutine called by the main loop of the game is L8504, it shows heavy patches.
</p>
<pre><small>
L8504:      CALL L850A
            JP L83D3
</small></pre>
<p>
It calls L850A and then L83D3. L83D3 is more akin to a loop to make the game run slower (I still didn&#39;t know the VDP interrupt line, nor did I have the line connected to the Z80 processor). After setting BC to $1000, it also updates the current number of lives on the screen.

<p>
It uses L8517 each time with a pointer to one of the enemies (L87F3, L87F5, and L87F7). For each enemy, it checks the current direction and selects an X-displacement (-3 or +3 pixels) in the B register. If it reaches a certain coordinate it switches the movement direction.
</p>
<p>
Once this has been done, another patch calls to L855B to make HL point exactly to the X-coordinate of the enemy (this code is dependent on the memory address of the enemy coordinates). It reads the current X-coordinate into the B register and jumps to another patch in L8738, where it reads the X-coordinate of the player in A, makes a copy of B in C, subtracting 3 from B, and adds 4 to C.
</p>
<p>
When it has created a collision width (minimum is B, maximum is C) it does a comparison of A (player X-coordinate) with B and returns if it is less than, and a comparison against C and returns if it is equal or greater than.
</p>
<p>
As the enemy state doesn&#39;t contain its Y-coordinate, it determines the sprite from the enemy data address, reads the Sprite Attribute Table from VRAM to get the Y-coordinate and does a comparison with the player Y-coordinate (L8786), and returns if both aren&#39;t equal, else it jumps to L8613 to kill the player.
</p>
<p><i>There is a bug in this code and the player can die accidentally while walking. In an amazing example of how bugs can perdure for years, I couldn&#39;t find this accidental kill bug for years until today (Feb/06/2024) I finally used debuging tools of BlueMSX. It is pretty easy once found, when a snake is aligned with the player it returns correctly because the player isn&#39;t in the same floor as the snake, but it <b>loses</b> the value of the register HL because the VRAM read, and the next snake X-coordinate will be read from ROM creating a fixed invisible snake in the next floor. It will fail randomly in a position dependant of the platform. Do you want to correct it? Just replace my &#34;smart&#34; optimization in L850A to load each time the full value of HL with the address of the enemy data instead of only the L register.</i> Case closed, it only took me 34 years.

<p>
It is pretty embarrassing this chain-linking of code, but let us go in parts.
</p>
<p>
The first line of code at L8613 calls L837A, the ultimate purpose is loading HL with L87FB to point to the number of lives of the player and decrement it.
</p>
<p>
But L837A also creates a sound effect (a first!) then jumps to L8774 for a small delay, and then jumps to L866F to turn off the volume, does another delay, loads HL with a pointer to the number of lives, and resets the music player&#39;s variables.
</p>
<p>
After it decrements the number of lives, it sets the carry flag but obviously, I got lost in this path because it is never used. The stack pointer is reset, the player is set again to the start point in L8637, and if there are still lives it jumps to L8009 to continue the game, or else it displays a message &#34;FIN DE JUEGO&#34; (game over in Spanish), it waits a longer time, and it resets completely the game jumping to L8000.
</p>
<p>
We need to patch the L837A and L866F sound routines with this:
</p>
<pre><small>
L837A:
	if COLECO
	    ld a,$8E
	    out (PSG),a
	    ld a,$2a
	    out (PSG),a
	else
	    ld e,$ae
	    ld a,$00
	    call WRTPSG
	    ld e,$06
	    ld a,$01
	    call WRTPSG
	endif
            JP L8774

L866F:
	if COLECO
	    ld a,$9f
	    out (PSG),a
	else
	    ld e,$00
	    ld a,$08
	    call WRTPSG
	endif
            LD BC,$0000
L8679:      DEC BC
</small></pre>
<h2>The used variables</h2>

The final list of variables inside the code are:
</p>

<p>
The stack pointer used to be at $87F0 for 2K RAM student computers in 1990. Later moved to $fff0 for 32K RAM (1992).
</p>
<p>
You can download the ROM for the game ready to be played on a Colecovision or MSX. I&#39;ve also included the commented source code. The only difference between this and my 1990 game is the redesigned graphics and adjustments to level colors to enhance visibility. The original colors blended badly on modern emulators (in 1990 I could adjust contrast in the Sony Trinitron TV).

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>
A lot of bytes could be saved in this game by refactoring some parts like using an extra byte to preserve the vertical position of enemies, moving some initialization code out of the main loop (lives update and snake sprite definition), using data available on RAM instead of reading VRAM, and compacting the music player code.
</p>
<p>
On the other side, it reflects my abilities at the time. I could have almost 2K of machine code on my head, there wasn&#39;t a plan ahead (denoted by the ton of patches). I was still learning how to code a platform game, and I wasn&#39;t too able to draw graphics.
</p>
<p>
Writing games or other code directly in machine code isn&#39;t practical. Although at first glance you can have everything on your head, you&#39;ll forget completely after a few years, and also unless you have some paper documentation there aren&#39;t any helpful comments!
</p>
<p>
I would have used an assembler program if these were readily available, but I had none until I wrote mine some years after. The software stores in Mexico were scarce, also I never could find something so esoteric as a Z80 assembler program when the IBM PC was already the dominant machine.
</p>
<p>
However, my objective of developing a game in 2K RAM was met. Students were surprised a real game could work on their computer. I think I distributed a few copies as printed sheets with the binary and another few copies in floppies.
</p>
<p>
I learned as I developed the game, and I didn&#39;t make again the mistake of allowing the player to walk into the void. But still for many years, I kept coding in machine code and doing spaghetti code when I needed to insert code, but that is a history for another day.
