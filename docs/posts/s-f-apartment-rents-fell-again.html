            <p><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/">San Francisco</a> and the rest of <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/">the Bay Area</a> saw apartment rents fall in January at a higher rate than the national average, another sign of a slowing Bay Area economy that could be hurt further by <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/tech-layoffs/">mass tech layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data">according to data from Apartment List.</a></p>
        <!-- Missed: ad -->
            <p>San Francisco median rents fell 1.1% to $2,174 per month compared to December, one of the biggest drops in the country. Metro area rents are down 5% compared to March 2020 when the pandemic started, making San Francisco and San Jose the only two metro areas with more than 1 million people that have rents that are below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
    <div id="paywall">            <p>San Jose’s median price fell 0.4% to $2,370 per month compared to December. Prices are 2% lower than March 2020. Oakland saw a 0.9% monthly decline to a $1,613 monthly median rent.</p>

<!-- e hearst/article/content/embed.tpl -->            <p>National rents fell for the fifth straight month, with prices down 0.3% compared to December. Prices are still up 3.3% compared to January 2022, but growth has slowed in the past two years. Two thirds of the 100 largest U.S. cities saw rents down month over month.</p>
                <p>A wave of layoffs in tech is expected to reduce demand for apartments the Bay Area. “Softness in the tech industry is likely to prevent a strong rebound in Bay Area rents,” Apartment List said.</p>
