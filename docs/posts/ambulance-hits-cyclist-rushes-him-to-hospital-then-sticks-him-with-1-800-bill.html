That’s among about $47,000 in medical expenses that Hoesch has racked up so far and another $50,000 of medical costs he expects in the future, the suit states.</p><p id="YS6MURNLSFCEFEI5YJA7YHWQ6Y">Columbia River Fire &amp; Rescue declined to comment. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment. The suit claims that Hoesch’s uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is obligated to cover any damages that Columbia River Fire &amp; Rescue is unable to.</p><p id="JFQ7ZLUOSJB43CPPMTKZWKOO6Q">According to the lawsuit, Hoesch was pedaling through the small town of Rainier in Columbia County in October 2022 when he and the ambulance were traveling the same direction on a street that’s a mix of homes and businesses. The ambulance attempted to make a right turn onto another street, crashing into Hoesch and destroying his bicycle, according to the suit, which was filed Oct. 24.</p><figure><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/YY6OPTXF3FFWDJJLMKHZWWLCLY.png?auth=a93e30d356b048a96c0755886a54acf18a5d5463a2c5b04d7879f768661ecaf1&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90 500w"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/YY6OPTXF3FFWDJJLMKHZWWLCLY.png?auth=a93e30d356b048a96c0755886a54acf18a5d5463a2c5b04d7879f768661ecaf1&amp;width=800&amp;quality=90 800w"/><source srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/YY6OPTXF3FFWDJJLMKHZWWLCLY.png?auth=a93e30d356b048a96c0755886a54acf18a5d5463a2c5b04d7879f768661ecaf1&amp;width=1280&amp;quality=90 1280w"/><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/YY6OPTXF3FFWDJJLMKHZWWLCLY.png?auth=a93e30d356b048a96c0755886a54acf18a5d5463a2c5b04d7879f768661ecaf1&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" alt="A man with gray hair is covered in a jacket and sweatshirt that are draped over his body.

Hoesch estimated to police that he was going 5 mph to 10 mph and said he didn’t think the ambulance was going to turn in front of him. His bicycle was crushed under the ambulance wheel.</p><p id="DVGLGLYO7FH75KH4WCTBCQ6GLU">Hoesch’s lawsuit also seeks $900,000 for pain and suffering, stating he suffered decreased range of motion, reduced grip strength and other symptoms.</p><figure><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/Q7K3BXUW3JHERIHWCJGXD7OQIQ.png?auth=6696f7baca4dec2c4ee3a10419763f2ae5d3421b23088081b47bf9722fa1fbfb&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90 500w"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/Q7K3BXUW3JHERIHWCJGXD7OQIQ.png?auth=6696f7baca4dec2c4ee3a10419763f2ae5d3421b23088081b47bf9722fa1fbfb&amp;width=800&amp;quality=90 800w"/><source srcset="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/Q7K3BXUW3JHERIHWCJGXD7OQIQ.png?auth=6696f7baca4dec2c4ee3a10419763f2ae5d3421b23088081b47bf9722fa1fbfb&amp;width=1280&amp;quality=90 1280w"/><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/Q7K3BXUW3JHERIHWCJGXD7OQIQ.png?auth=6696f7baca4dec2c4ee3a10419763f2ae5d3421b23088081b47bf9722fa1fbfb&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" alt="A photograph in a Rainier Police Department report shows William Hoesch&#39;s bicycle under the wheel of a Columbia River Fire &amp; Rescue ambulance in October 2022." decoding="async" height="600" width="300"/></picture><figcaption><p>A Rainier Police Department report included this photo of the crash scene involving William Hoesch and a Columbia River Fire &amp; Rescue ambulance.<span>Rainier Police Department</span></p></figcaption></div></figure><p id="BDOCBSQW4VFP7HYJS4Z2Q2MSV4">Ambulance crashes involving cars, cyclists or pedestrians are rare but not unheard of in Oregon.
