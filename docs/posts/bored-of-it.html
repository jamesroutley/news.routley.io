<flow-content>
  <p>I’m bored of it.</p>
<p>The pervasive, all encompassing nature of it.</p>
<p>The inevitable, dehumanising consequence of it.</p>
<p>That there’s a ‘there’ there to it.</p>
<p>Rubbish in and rubbish out of it.</p>
<p>Nobody asked for it, and nobody wants it.</p>
<p>The best minds of my generation thinking about how to make people use it.</p>
<p>That you should just accept it.</p>
<p>A thousand no’s, but ‘yes’ when shareholders start clamouring for it.</p>
<p>Policy-makers pandering to it.</p>
<p>A decommissioned nuclear power station required to power it.</p>
<p>Not to mention millions of gallons of water required to cool it.</p>
<p>Every article glorifying it.</p>
<p>Every article vilifying it.</p>
<p>Every pub conversation winding up talking about it.</p>
<p>People incessantly telling you how <em>they</em> use it.</p>
<p>I feel dirty using it.</p>
<p>You know what I’m talking about, even though I’ve not mentioned it.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m bored of it.</p>
