  <p>Tried a plugin for Markdown task lists. Wasn&#39;t satisfied with output accessibility. Discussed alternative outputs.</p>
<h2>Today&#39;s Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Done</strong> Enable markdown checkbox lists in eleventy (haha, that went <strong>long</strong>)</li>
<li>Write up daily log script</li>
<li>Go over what else I want to do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Markdown Checkboxes</h2>
<p>I would like to be able to keep track of which tasks in my past Task Ideas have been completed. I think a good way to do this would be to use a markdown task list and add a link to the daily log entry of the day when I completed the task.</p>
<p>Eleventy&#39;s default markdown is strict to the <a href="https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/">original markdown standard</a>, so I need to modify it in order to use the task list feature. I&#39;m going to try this tutorial on <a href="https://craigofnz.github.io/posts/2023/extending-eleventy-markdown/">extending eleventy markdown</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting an error that markdownIt is not defined. It looks like the author of that blog didn&#39;t include the definition of that varibale. From the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/#optional-set-your-own-library-instance">official eleventy markdown doc page</a>, it looks like I have to require the <code>markdown-it</code> library and set it to that variable.</p>
<h3>Plugin Output</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, it is now working properly. Here is the output:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul class=&#34;contains-task-list&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;task-list-item&#34;&gt;
    &lt;input class=&#34;task-list-item-checkbox&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt;
    This is a task.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>

   This is a task.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not like this. It seems semantically mismatched to use an input field for a checked-off task. Even if it were properly accessible today (which I&#39;m skeptical of), it wouldn&#39;t be very future-proof. Designers of tomorrow will not be thinking about clever edge cases when maintaining backwards compatability.</p>
<h3>Unicode Instead</h3>
<p>I want something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ‚úì This is a task.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not sure about how robust the checkmark unicode symbol would be with a screen reader. Emojis and unicode can have inintended problems on screen readers. For an example, see the &#34;Screen Readers Do Not See What You See&#34; section of <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/blaming-screen-readers-red-flag.html">Blaming Screen Readers üö© x5</a> by Adrian Roselli, which shows some examples of cryptic, annoying social media memes that use unicode symbols for decoration.</p>
<p>Most relevant to my decision making today is that the emoji üö© is not read as &#34;red flag emoji&#34;, but as &#34;triangular flag on post&#34;. <strong>When unicode symbols are used in a way that doesn&#39;t match their semantic meaning, screen readers may say something completely irrelevant.</strong></p>
<p>This has motivated me to use the &#34;check mark&#34; unicode symbol ‚úì instead of the &#34;ballot box check&#34; ‚òë. After trying it, I do think that it&#39;s nicer looking to use unboxed checkmarks on completed tasks, and nothing on uncompleted tasks. There&#39;s less visual clutter.</p>
<h3>Unicode with Aria</h3>
<p>If I really wanted the ballot box check, there are options to try. I&#39;ve seen some workarounds including the example from this <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/special-characters-emojis-line-breaks-more-tricks-for-optimizing-your-emails-for-screen-readers">article on accessible emoji in email</a>:</p>
<pre><code>We &lt;span role=&#34;img&#34; aria-label=&#34;love&#34;&gt;‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/span&gt; email!
</code></pre>
<p>which makes the heart say &#34;love&#34; as intended, instead of &#34;red heart&#34;.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to completely hide the ballot box check from the screen reader using <code>aria-hidden</code>. The article mentioned above about emails has a great example of this:</p>
<pre><code>We &lt;span aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;üëè&lt;/span&gt;
love &lt;span aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;üëè&lt;/span&gt;
email! &lt;span aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;üëè&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Adding Redundancy with Plain Text</h3>
<p>If applying this to my task list application, I would try something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul class=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;checked&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&amp;check;&lt;/span&gt;
    This is a task.
    &lt;a href=2023-10-31&gt;Completed 2023-10-31&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    This is a task I didn&#39;t finish.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span aria-hidden="true">‚úì</span> This is a task. <a href="https://quintenkonyn.recurse.com/log/2023-10-31/2023-10-31">Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn&#39;t finish.
  </li>
</ul>
The checkmark will not be read aloud. However I have added a link &#34;Completed 2023-10-31&#34;. This achieves three things:
<ol>
<li>Reads clearly on a screen reader, so the unicode checkmark does not need to communicate the information.</li>
<li>Could remove ambiguity for sighted readers. This is especially important for readers with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">cognitive or learning disabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Is an opportunity to add additional helpful information for everyone. Having a date and a link to the post where I discuss completing the task could be very helpful for someone who wants to know how I solved a problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to keep the checkmark because it helps with skimming.</p>
<h3>Keeping HTML Clean with CSS <code>::before</code></h3>
<p>Using the CSS pseudo-object <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before">::before</a>, it&#39;s possible to keep the checkmark entirely out of the HTML. It can be drawn before every object that has the &#34;checked&#34; class.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul class=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;checked&#34;&gt;
    This is a task.
    &lt;a href=2023-10-31&gt;Completed 2023-10-31&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    This is a task I didn&#39;t finish.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>CSS:</p>
<pre><code>.checked::before {
  content: &#34;‚úì&#34;;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    This is a task.
    <a href="https://quintenkonyn.recurse.com/log/2023-10-31/2023-10-31">Completed 2023-10-31</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a task I didn&#39;t finish.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I like this solution. It is much easier to modify how I signify a completed task down the line than if I had the checkmark in the HTML.</p>
<p>Now I just have to figure out how to turn Markdown into this specific HTML... maybe I could modify the existing plugin? I wish I didn&#39;t have to learn how to do that, I&#39;m busy!</p>
<h2>Task Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have some sort of auto-check so that my daily log entries don&#39;t get published without an excerpt.</li>
<li>Explore other <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin">markdown-it plugins</a> (slowly; I need to makes sure they don&#39;t break accessibility)</li>
<li>Add word wrap to code blocks?</li>
</ul>
