<p>Someone did a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/set/originals/meat/description.html">radio play</a> of this... 
</p></blockquote>


<p>&#34;They&#39;re made out of meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Meat?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Meat. They&#39;re made out of meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Meat?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They&#39;re completely meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;That&#39;s impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don&#39;t come from them. The signals come from machines.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;So who made the machines? That&#39;s who we want to contact.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;They made the machines. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You&#39;re asking me to believe in sentient meat.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking you, I&#39;m telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they&#39;re made out of meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Maybe they&#39;re like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Nope. They&#39;re born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn&#39;t take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Spare me. Okay, maybe they&#39;re only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They&#39;re meat all the way through.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;No brain?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Oh, there is a brain all right. It&#39;s just that the brain is made out of meat!&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;So... what does the thinking?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;You&#39;re not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Thinking meat! You&#39;re asking me to believe in thinking meat!&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Omigod. You&#39;re serious then. They&#39;re made out of meat.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they&#39;ve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;So what does the meat have in mind.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;We&#39;re supposed to talk to meat?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s the idea. That&#39;s the message they&#39;re sending out by radio. &#39;Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?&#39; That sort of thing.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;I thought you just told me they used radio.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Officially or unofficially?&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Both.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;I was hoping you would say that.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;I agree one hundred percent. What&#39;s there to say?&#34; `Hello, meat. How&#39;s it going?&#39; But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can&#39;t live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;So we just pretend there&#39;s no one home in the universe.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;That&#39;s it.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You&#39;re sure they won&#39;t remember?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;They&#39;ll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we&#39;re just a dream to them.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat&#39;s dream.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;And we can marked this sector unoccupied.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again.&#34;

</p><p>  &#34;They always come around.&#34;

</p><p>&#34;And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone.&#34;
