    <h1>Doublespeed hacked, revealing what its AI-generated accounts are promoting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of  more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company. </p><p>The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company’s backend, including the phone farm itself. Doublespeed did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
