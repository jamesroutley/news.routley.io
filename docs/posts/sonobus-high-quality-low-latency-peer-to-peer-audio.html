                <h4> FLEXIBLE </h4>
                <p>
                    Connects multiple users together to send and receive audio
                    among all in a group, with fine-grained control over
                    latency, quality and overall mix. Includes optional input
                    compression, noise gate, and EQ effects, along with a
                    master reverb. All settings are
                    dynamic, network statistics are clearly visible.
                </p>

                <h4> MULTIPLE
                    PLATFORMS</h4>
                <p>Works
                    as a standalone application on macOS, Windows, iOS,
                    and GNU/Linux, and as an audio plugin (AU, VST, and AAX) on macOS
                    and Windows. Use it on your desktop
                    or in your DAW, or on your mobile device.

                <h4>SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL </h4>
                <p>Easy to setup and use, yet still
                    provides all the details that audio nerds want to
                    see. Audio quality can be instantly adjusted from full
                    uncompressed PCM (16, 24, or 32 bit) or with various compressed bitrates
                    (16-256 kbps per channel) using the low-latency Opus codec.</p>
