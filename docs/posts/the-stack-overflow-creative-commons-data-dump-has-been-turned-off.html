    <h1>The Stack Overflow Creative Commons Data Dump has been turned off</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I was recently impacted by <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/389060">the Company&#39;s layoff</a>. I am going to carefully respond in a way that ensures I don&#39;t reveal anything the Company may feel is confidential--particularly with regard to strategy, or future plans. Any knowledge I have on strategy or future plans is both dated and confidential, and thus it would be irresponsible for me to say more. As a result, this answer may feel incomplete. I suspect that the CM team is rather busy this week with other topics. I&#39;m offering what I can to uphold the Company&#39;s values of Transparency &amp; being Community-centric.</em></p>

<h2>The upload to the Internet Archive has been disabled.</h2>
<p>The job that uploads the data dump to Archive.org was disabled on 28 March, and marked to not be re-enabled without approval of senior leadership. Had it run as scheduled, it would have completed on the first Monday after the first Sunday in June.</p>
<p>I mention the timing, as this change long pre-dated the current moderator strike and related policy changes. Some comments have suggested otherwise, so I thought it an important detail.</p>
<h2>Is it going to stay that way?</h2>
<p>Hopefully the Company will provide an answer that includes this.</p>
<p><em>Edit: The following is an excerpt from <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390040/314146">a different answer</a> provided by <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/1196463/jody-bailey">Jody Bailey, CTO</a> of Stack Overflow:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for ways to gate access to the Dump, APIs, and SEDE, that will allow individuals access to the data while preventing misuse by organizations looking to profit from the work of our community. We are working to design and implement appropriate safeguards and still sorting out the details and timelines. We will provide regular updates on our progress to this group.</p>

<h2>How can I access that data?</h2>
<p><a href="https://data.stackexchange.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a> (aka SEDE) contains a subset of all data for all sites, with PII removed. The same data available in the data dump is also available on SEDE.</p>
<p>SEDE is updated via a weekly full refresh (every weekend). The Data Dump that is uploaded to Archive.org is a dump of the SEDE databases. The weekly SEDE refresh runs, then the data is dumped to XML &amp; 7zipped, then the 7z files are uploaded to the Archive.</p>
<p>SEDE can&#39;t address all the use cases of the Data Dump, nor vice versa. However, there is overlap, and the data is at least queryable.</p>

Hopefully any questions around &#34;why&#34; or &#34;what&#39;s next&#34; will be addressed by an official response.
