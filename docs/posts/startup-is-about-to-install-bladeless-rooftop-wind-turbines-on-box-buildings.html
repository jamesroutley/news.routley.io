<p><a href="https://aerominetechnologies.com/">Aeromine Technologies</a> just closed a $9 million funding round, and it’s ready to scale up production of its bladeless rooftop wind turbines. </p>



<p>Energy research, investing, and strategy firm Veriten is the lead investor in Aeromine Technologies’ Series A funding round. </p>

<p>Aeromine, launched in 2022, makes compact 50 kW or larger “wind harvesting platforms” that it mounts on the edge of a building’s roof. The rooftop wind units, which have no external moving parts or blades, capture wind flowing up and over the building and convert it into onsite electricity. Its generator system is a rotor-stator system with a highly efficient 5 kW permanent magnet generator. (<a href="https://26011849.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26011849/Aeromine%20Website/downloads/Aeromine%20cut%20sheet%20231004.pdf">Specs are here</a>.) </p>



<p>The noiseless technology leverages aerodynamics like airfoils on a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow to generate energy. Aeromine says its systems typically consist of 20-40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction.</p>



<p>Each 1,000-pound unit can withstand winds of between 120 and 158 mph depending on specification.</p>



<p>Aeromine’s units can operate independently or be integrated with existing rooftop solar arrays. Onsite power generation eliminates grid supply disruptions.</p>



<p>Maynard Holt, founder &amp; CEO of Veriten, said: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe that distributed power innovation will play a vital role in helping companies fulfill their need for reliable, reasonably priced electricity and desire for low-impact power. We’re excited to partner with Aeromine, as its ability to quickly and affordably help a wide variety of companies meet their energy needs with wind resources is unique among distributed energy solutions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The bladeless wind turbines are designed to power apartment buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, offices, hospitals, retail centers – basically any big box building with a flat, unobstructed roof. </p>




	<p>The company says it has 400 qualified projects in its pipeline and expects to roll out commercially in Europe and North America in 2025. </p>
