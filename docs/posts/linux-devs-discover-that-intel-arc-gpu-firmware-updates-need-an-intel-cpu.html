<p>In our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/intel-a770-a750-review-strong-gpu-alternatives-that-we-very-nearly-recommend/">review of Intel&#39;s Arc GPU</a>s, we were generally impressed by their performance for the price, especially as a first-generation product. But buyers have plenty of potential caveats to consider, including unstable drivers, inconsistent performance, and a couple of weird problems that you need to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/high-idle-power-use-on-intel-arc-gpus-requires-fiddling-with-bios-settings/">dig around in your computer&#39;s BIOS settings</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>Linux developers working on Arc support appear to have uncovered another oddity about the cards. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/hughsient/status/1588462034840084487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">developer Richard Hughes</a> (as reported by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-GSC-Firmware-Needs-ME">Phoronix</a>), updating the firmware on Arc GPUs <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/tree/main/plugins/intel-gsc">appears to be handled by</a> the Intel Management Engine, a small microcontroller that is only included in PCs with Intel processors. Hughes ran into the problem specifically in the context of IBM&#39;s POWER CPU architecture, but it seems to make firmware updates impossible on any non-Intel platform, including those based on AMD or Arm CPUs.</p>

<p>Luckily, these kinds of GPU firmware updates don&#39;t happen all that often, and when they <em>do</em> happen, it&#39;s usually to fix a specific obscure problem or add minor features—using a GPU with outdated firmware isn&#39;t the end of the world. On the other hand, if ever a GPU was going to <em>need</em> important firmware updates somewhere down the line, it would be this first generation of Arc cards, which are Intel&#39;s first widely released dedicated GPUs and have already proven to be exceptionally rough around the edges in a bunch of other ways.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve contacted Intel to ask whether it plans to change how Arc firmware updates are installed, and we&#39;ll update this article if we receive a response.</p>
