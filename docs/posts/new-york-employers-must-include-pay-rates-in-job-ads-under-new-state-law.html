    <h1>New York employers must include pay rates in job ads under new state law</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>Help-wanted advertisements in New York will have to disclose proposed pay rates after a statewide salary transparency law goes into effect on Sunday, part of growing state and city efforts to give women and people of color a tool to advocate for equal pay for equal work.</p><p>Employers with at least four workers will be required to<a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2023-07-08/new-minimum-pay-rates-for-nyc-app-based-food-delivery-workers-are-delayed.html" target="_blank"> disclose salary ranges </a>for any job advertised externally to the public or internally to workers interested in a promotion or transfer.</p><p>Pay transparency, supporters say, will prevent employers from offering some job candidates less or more money based on age, gender, race or other factors not related to their skills.</p><p>Advocates believe the change also could help underpaid workers realize they make less than people doing the same job.</p><p>A similar pay transparency ordinance has been in effect in New York City since 2022. Now, the rest of the state joins a handful of others with similar laws, including California and Colorado.</p><p>“There is a trend, not just in legislatures but among workers, to know how much they can expect going into a job. There’s a demand from workers to know of the pay range,” said Da Hae Kim, a state policy senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center.</p><p>The law, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2022, also will apply to remote employees who work outside of New York but report to a supervisor, office or worksite based in the state. The law would not apply to government agencies or temporary help firms.</p><p>Compliance will be a challenge, said Frank Kerbein, director of human resources at the New York Business Council, which has criticized the law for putting an additional administrative burden on employers.</p><p>“We have small employers who don’t even know about the law,” said Kerbein, who predicted there would be “a lot of unintentional noncompliance.”</p><p>To avoid trouble when setting a salary range, an employer should examine pay for current employees, said Allen Shoikhetbrod, who practices employment law at Tully Rinckley, a private law firm.</p><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos, a Democrat representing parts of Queens, said the law is a win for <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2023-09-01/rising-tensions-between-employers-and-employees-have-put-the-labor-back-in-this-years-labor-day.html" target="_blank">labor rights groups.</a></p><p>“This is something that, organically, workers are asking for,” she said. “Particularly with young people entering the workforce, they’ll have a greater understanding about how their work is valued.”</p><p><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>Sign up</i></a><i> for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>
