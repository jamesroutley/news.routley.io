    <h1>OpenAI staff threaten to quit unless board resigns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><span>OpenAI was in</span> open revolt on Monday with more than 700 employees signing an open letter threatening to leave unless the board resigns and reinstates Sam Altman as CEO, along with cofounder and former president Greg Brockman. Altman was controversially <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-bizarre-structure-4-people-the-power-to-fire-sam-altman/">fired by the board on Friday</a>.</p><p>“The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company,” the letter reads. “Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.”</p><p>Remarkably, the letter’s signees include Ilya Sutskever, the company’s chief scientist and a member of its board, who has been blamed for coordinating the boardroom coup against Altman in the first place.</p><p>Shortly before the letter was released, Sutskever <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028&#34;}" href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">posted on X</a>: “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we’ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.”</p><p>The letter’s release follows an extraordinary, head-spinning weekend in Silicon Valley. OpenAI’s board removed Altman from his position on Friday, claiming “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.”</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><div data-testid="ContentCardEmbedWrapper"><p><span><picture><img alt="Sam Altman" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/655a7dfc3c92a0d005c79cf8/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/OpenAI-Unusual-Structure-Fires-Sam-Altman-1258550659.jpg" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/655a7dfc3c92a0d005c79cf8/master/w_120,c_limit/OpenAI-Unusual-Structure-Fires-Sam-Altman-1258550659.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/655a7dfc3c92a0d005c79cf8/master/w_240,c_limit/OpenAI-Unusual-Structure-Fires-Sam-Altman-1258550659.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/655a7dfc3c92a0d005c79cf8/master/w_320,c_limit/OpenAI-Unusual-Structure-Fires-Sam-Altman-1258550659.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/655a7dfc3c92a0d005c79cf8/master/w_640,c_limit/OpenAI-Unusual-Structure-Fires-Sam-Altman-1258550659.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></span></p><div><p>Chaos at OpenAI has its root in an unusual corporate structure designed to protect humanity against rogue AI—some investors had expressed fears it could weaken the company.</p></div></div></div><p>Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, was appointed as interim CEO.</p><p>After blowback from investors, including Microsoft, OpenAI’s board seemed open to having Altman return to lead the company. Altman posted a photo of himself wearing a visitors’ badge at the company’s headquarters on Sunday. But last night, the board told staff that Altman would not be returning to the company.</p><p>Hours later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-emerges-as-the-winner-in-openai-chaos/">announced</a> that Altman and Brockman would be joining the tech giant to head a new advanced AI research unit.</p><p>Nadella appeared to leave the door open to any OpenAI employees eager to jump ship, adding of Altman’s new Microsoft subsidiary: “We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success.”</p><p>Nadella also said on X that the new venture would be “setting a new pace for innovation,” suggesting a more aggressive approach than the OpenAI board was apparently comfortable with.</p><p>In another rapid-fire reshuffle, OpenAI’s board chose to remove Murati and appoint another interim CEO, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-return-fails-ceo-twitch-emmett-shear/">Emmett Shear</a>, the former CEO of Twitch, the video game streaming site.</p></div></div></div></div>
