<blockquote>Herzog reads voraciously; he says that all the good directors do. It doesn’t even have to be great literature. His friend, the documentary maker Errol Morris, recently recommended that he read a real piece of crap. “It was a bad book by a failed lion tamer. His arm was bitten off by a lion. He wrote with the other arm. And it’s a wonderful book to read because you have to comb the content against the texture and it gives you fabulous insights into human nature. <b>It is the same with trash movies, trash TV. WrestleMania. The Kardashians.</b> I’m fascinated by it. So I don’t say read Tolstoy and nothing else. Read everything. See everything. The poet must not avert his eyes.” —Source: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/19/werner-herzog-im-fascinated-by-trash-tv-the-poet-must-not-avert-his-eyes" target="_blank">The Guardian Article by Xan Brooks</a></blockquote><p>What is trash TV? Are there really differences in TV shows, or do they all follow the same formula? Can we compare other modes of communication, like books, scripts, and sentences?</p>
