<p>
On April 21, a group of anonymous authors and non-anonymous signatories published
<a href="https://save-nix-together.org/">a lengthy open letter</a> to the
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
Nix</a> community
and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project. They
claimed ongoing problems with the project&#39;s leadership, primarily focusing on the
way his actions have allegedly
undermined people nominally empowered to perform various
moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has gained
more than 100 signatures.
</p>

<h4>Decision-making authority</h4>

<p>
The Nix project is governed by the
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation">
NixOS Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization
that handles the project&#39;s finances and legal responsibilities. The foundation
itself is headed by a board with five voting members, chaired by Dolstra.
There are no term limits, and the board selects its own membership and chair.
According to <a href="https://nixos.org/community/teams/foundation-board/">
the board&#39;s team page</a>, its responsibilities include handling
&#34;<q>administrative, legal, and financial tasks</q>&#34;, sponsorships and donations,
funding for &#34;<q>community events and efforts</q>&#34;, and acting as an arbiter in
case of conflicts in the community. Notably, the board &#34;<q>is not responsible
for technical leadership, decisions, or direction</q>&#34;, nor is it expected to
handle all decision making. The board is responsible for
providing &#34;<q>a framework for teams
to self-organize</q>&#34;, including a duty to &#34;<q>[h]and out the credentials and
permissions required for the teams&#39; work</q>&#34;.
</p>

<p>
The open letter has several related complaints, but the most central one is that
they allege Dolstra has repeatedly strong-armed the board and members of
other community teams to overrule their decisions:
</p>

<blockquote>
For example, after months of discussion on sponsorship policy in the board, with
consensus having been formed on a policy that allows community veto of NixCon
sponsors, Eelco (and Graham [Christensen], at the same time) appeared at the
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/open-board-call-2024-03-20/41898/">
open board call
over 45 minutes in</a>, and began re-litigating the issue of whether we need to
limit sponsorship to begin with, which had already been agreed upon by everyone
but him.
</blockquote>

<p>
Christensen is Dolstra&#39;s co-founder at
<a href="https://determinate.systems/">Determinate
Systems</a>.
The letter lists other examples, such as Dolstra blocking longtime
contributors from becoming code reviewers or blocking a build-system change that
had made it through the RFC process.
The letter
concludes that Dolstra is essentially
leveraging social power from being the founder of the project to overrule
decisions that are nominally supposed to be made collaboratively.
In short, Dolstra is acting as &#34;<q>the effective Benevolent Dictator for Life
(BDFL)</q>&#34; of the
project, even though the NixOS Foundation&#39;s charter doesn&#39;t grant anyone that
authority.
The letter
says this leads to &#34;<q>a culture of responsibility without authority</q>&#34; that
erodes contributors&#39; desire to continue working on the project. It specifically
mentions the moderation team as an example of this, saying that its members are
&#34;<q>in fear of
their authority being undermined directly by Eelco or indirectly through the
Foundation</q>&#34;.
</p>

<p>
When asked to comment on the concerns raised in the letter, members of the NixOS
moderation team responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Overall we think that the letter describes the situation of the
moderation team fairly well. We have been operating in an emergency
mode most of the time for over half a year now. Our team retention is
at an all time low, and we are barely able to keep up with recruiting
new members as old ones quit. Right now the moderation team is down to
four people, including two who desire to leave as soon as a replacement
is found, not counting another moderator who left last week.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that the moderation team feels disempowered, this is
mostly because of heavy antagonism from some community members or risks
of destabilizing the community, and not because of an actual lack of
power. Most of that is a reflection of a deeper cultural conflict
within the community and not directly related to the foundation board.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite slightly disagreeing with the source of the issue,
they went on to acknowledge that Dolstra had impeded several attempts to improve
the situation, and said that they understood many community members&#39; complaints.
The team also
called the situation itself &#34;a deep structural and cultural issue involving
many people&#34;.
</p>

<p>
Pierre Bourdon, a long-time contributor to Nix,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310645064859357">
posted on Mastodon</a> about his experience working on NixOS,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310661634038271">
stating</a> that while
he disagrees with the tone and approach of the open letter, the factual
statements about Dolstra&#39;s leadership match his own experience.
</p>

<h4>Conflicts of interest</h4>

<p>
The letter also alleges several conflicts of interest, primarily concerning
Dolstra&#39;s employer, Determinate Systems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries">
Anduril</a>, a military contractor that uses NixOS, has repeatedly
attempted to become a sponsor of NixCon, which did not go over well with the
community, as reflected in the minutes of
the board meeting on March 20. The letter says Dolstra pushed
strongly for the inclusion of Anduril as a sponsor even after it became clear
that many core contributors disagreed. Anduril was eventually dropped as a sponsor
for <s>both</s> <a href="https://2023.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2023</a>
<s>and <a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2024</a> after community
pressure</s>.
[Thanks to Martin Weinelt for pointing out that
<a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/#sponsors">Anduril did end up sponsoring NixCon
2024</a>.]
</p>

<p>
On April 10, Théophane Hufschmitt, the secretary of the board, shared
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-event-sponsorship-policy/43110">
an update</a> on the board&#39;s
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/blob/bb7af14ae242ab87c8312bb4122b2a3cd184462d/policies/sponsorship_policy.md">
new sponsorship policy</a>. Hufschmitt expressed the board&#39;s apologies for the
way the situation was handled, and promised that &#34;<q>we will prioritize
transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in our decision-making
processes</q>.&#34;
</p>

<p>
That same day, Samuel Dionne-Riel
<a href="https://twitter.com/samueldr/status/1778259760707448853">
stated</a> that Dolstra had refused to clarify
whether he had a relationship with Anduril and
asked
Christensen, a co-founder of Determinate Systems: &#34;<q>Does DetSys have or had
relationships with Anduril?</q>&#34; Christensen
<a href="https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1778386025007460682">replied</a>:
&#34;<q>Did you know this
category of question is pretty much impossible to answer because NDAs are a
thing?</q>&#34;
</p>

<p>
This isn&#39;t the only time Dolstra has appeared to avoid disclosing potential
conflicts of interest; the letter alleges that
he kept his status as a founder of Determinate Systems secret for
some months (a claim Dolstra later denied), and that
this is especially worrying in light of some of the technical
promises that Determinate Systems makes to customers. The company produces its
own installer for Nix that the company promises will provide stable support for some
Nix features. The letter states: &#34;<q>This is fine, however, it is questionably
acceptable to do that while employing <em>the lead developer of CppNix</em>
[the main Nix implementation] and saying
nothing about how this will interact with the team&#39;s [decision-making]
autonomy.</q>&#34;
The concerns are not entirely theoretical, either;
the main Nix installer has been
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/10109">
broken in various ways</a> since version 2.18 in September 2023.
</p>

<h4>Call to action</h4>

<p>
The final section of the letter calls
for Dolstra&#39;s resignation from the board, suggesting that he should also
completely disengage from the project for at least six months, to give the rest
of the board time to reform the project&#39;s governance.
</p>

<blockquote>
This document should be seen as the canary in the coal mine for what <em>many</em> people
have been feeling for years and does not exhaustively cover absolutely all
problems in the community, but we hope it is enough to justify action.
</blockquote>

<p>
The letter ends by suggesting that if Dolstra doesn&#39;t resign, the signatories
would switch to and support a fork of the project.
I contacted several of the
signatories to ask whether they&#39;d be willing to provide additional commentary on
why they believed a letter like this to be a necessary step.
Haydon Welsh responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
I signed the letter because it was clear that every other team member was
sick and tired of Eelco, and so I saw it only right if that&#39;s their only
hope to regain enthusiasm for the project. No open-source project should
die or be hard-forked because of one person, that destroys a lot of the
purpose for being open-source.
</blockquote>

<p>
Kiara Grouwstra had stronger feelings on the matter:
</p>

<blockquote>
While I want a full rotation of members on the NixOS board, as well as
changes to its goal and structure so as to better incorporate the
community including marginalized perspectives, my friend convinced me
the polemic response would not sit well with the moderators, and shared
with me the draft open letter about Eelco&#39;s role, which I opted to
settle for as the lower-hanging fruit right now.
</blockquote>

<p>
On April 27, Xe Iaso wrote <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/much-ado-about-nothing/">
a blog post</a> about xer perspective on the matter, stating that at this point
a fork is both inevitable and doomed.
Even if the actions called for in the letter do come about, the difficult
situation is already having an impact on the Nix community. On April 21, Nixpgs
contributor Kamila Borowska
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/305826">resigned from the project</a>.
On April 25, Mario Rodas, who had contributed more than 250 packages,
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/306702">
followed suit</a>. In total, 24 maintainers
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=label%3A%228.has%3A+maintainer+removal%22">
have left</a>.
</p>

<h4>Dolstra&#39;s response</h4>

<p>
On April 26, Dolstra posted
<a href="https://determinate.systems/posts/on-community-in-nix/">
a response</a> to the letter.
He states that the role of the board is to handle the
financial and legal work, not to run the Nix community.
He also claims that he has had &#34;<q>very little involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS
in recent years</q>&#34;.
Dolstra goes on to state: &#34;<q>I am just one member of the five-member Nix team
and hold no more formal authority than the others in determining the direction
of the team.</q>&#34;
While this is true, it does not directly refute the
letter&#39;s claims that Dolstra exceeds the formal authority granted to him.
</p>

<p>
Dolstra also reiterated his position that NixCon should not refuse Anduril&#39;s
sponsorship, stating: &#34;<q>It is my opinion that it is not for us, as open source
software developers, to decide whose views are valid and whose are not, and to
allow or disallow project or conference participation as a result.</q>&#34;
Dolstra does, however, explicitly refute the claim that his involvement in
Determinate Systems was at all secret: &#34;<q>My role,
participation, and focus on the good work being done at Determinate Systems have
been public knowledge since the company&#39;s inception</q>&#34;. He goes on to say that
the claim that Determinate Systems seeks to have an outsized influence on the
community is &#34;<q>patently false</q>&#34;.
</p>

<p>
He ends his response by inviting community members who feel unwelcome in
the Nix community to work for Determinate Systems instead:
</p>

<blockquote>
I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard, and
valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this important
work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have not been heard
or feels displaced to join the Determinate Systems community as we continue
working to make Nix as easy to use and as impactful as possible.
</blockquote>

<p>
It is difficult to predict where the Nix community will go from here, and
what the eventual fate of any forks will be. For
now, Dolstra remains the chair of the board — a position he seems unlikely to
give up under pressure from the letter&#39;s signatories.
