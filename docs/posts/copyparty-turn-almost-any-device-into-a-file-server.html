<p>2025-07-23</p>

<p>I have started doing another self-study music course from <a href="https://audiblegenius.com/">Audible Genius</a>, the people behind <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/tags/syntorial.html">Syntorial</a>.
In this post I will reflect on how I like it so far.</p>

<h2>What is Building Blocks?</h2>

<p><a href="https://audiblegenius.com/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a> is an online self-study course about composition and music theory using a sequencer. It is geared towards electronic pop music. It consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>video lectures with quizzes</li>
<li>composition recreation exercises</li>
<li>blind (&#34;deaf&#34;?) recreation exercises</li>
<li>composition assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>By &#34;recreation exercise&#34; I mean that you get an example piece of music and a blank canvas, and you have to recreate the example on the blank canvas. Sometimes the canvas isn&#39;t entirely blank and you only have to fill in one instrument. The instruments on the blank canvas have been pre-selected to match the example so if you do things right it is possible to get a 100% identical recreation.</p>

<p>The &#34;blind&#34; variant (called &#34;Mind&#39;s Ear&#34;) is also about recreating an example, but with the added difficulty of not hearing your own version. You can only see the notation of your recreation. You have to &#34;visualize&#34; (auralize?) what it sounds like and compare that to the sound of the example.</p>

<p>It is the same concept as <a href="https://blog.jacobvosmaer.nl/tags/syntorial.html">Syntorial</a> except  applied to sequencing rather than synthesizer sound design. Guided ear training in a controlled environment with a computer program grading your work.</p>

<h2>You were very enthusiastic about Syntorial, what took you so long to pick up Building Blocks?</h2>

<p>I had some of the same resistance to Building Blocks that I had to Syntorial at first:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do a beginner course about something that I have been doing for a long time?</li>
<li>I don&#39;t like making music on the computer</li>
<li>I don&#39;t make mainstream music, why take a course full of boring pop music stuff?</li>
<li>I am not good at skill X (sound design, sequencing) but I like what I create by accident. I don&#39;t want to ruin what&#39;s special about my music.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these objections hold up to scrutiny. I am self-taught in making electronic music so I have skill gaps; a beginner course is the best way to cover all the gaps. The computer is just a study tool and the skills I learn transfer to my preferred (computer-free) music making environment. The sum of my musical influences won&#39;t get erased by 1 or 2 courses with mainstream pop music in it. And just because I rely on &#34;happy accidents&#34; in my creative work that does not mean that having a better command of my tools is not helpful.</p>

<h2>What do you like about Building Blocks so far?</h2>

<p>I really like that it is a self-study course where I can set my own pace. I like this in general and in this case, with a subject that I first started learning over 25 years ago, it is good that I don&#39;t have to adapt to the pace of a classroom of people around me. I can slow down and speed up exactly where I want to.</p>

<p>There is no leaderboard or any kind of social excitement going on in this course. I like this because I can get competitive which is not helpful for my learning.</p>

<p>As with Syntorial, I think it&#39;s great that the controlled environment allows you to create a 100% identical copy of the example when you are doing an exercise. This never happens &#34;in real life&#34; if you have to recreate something but for learning / training I find it very helpful.</p>

<h2>Anything you don&#39;t like?</h2>

<p>The browser based learning environment can be a bit janky at times. If I do some lessons, take a break and come back, I sometimes have to restart my browser to get the audio working again. There are also occasional glitches that you would not expect in  &#34;real&#34; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW software</a>. But they don&#39;t happen in the middle of a lesson and I don&#39;t loose work so I can manage.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t like writing music by clicking with a mouse on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll#In_digital_audio_workstations">piano roll</a>. But I understand why the course is built around this mechanism and I can go back to my regular way of working when I&#39;m not studying.</p>

<p>So far I&#39;m progressing through the course much faster than I did with Syntorial. I don&#39;t know if that is because I&#39;m still too far ahead as a student or if there is just less material in this course. I&#39;m not bored and I am learning things.  I&#39;ll probably slow down when the course gets more difficult further ahead.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&#39;m glad I got over myself and started doing this course. It feels good to work on my skill gaps. I look forward to reporting back here when I&#39;m further along in the curriculum.</p>
