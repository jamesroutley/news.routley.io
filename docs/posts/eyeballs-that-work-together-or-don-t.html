    <p>I recently had what counted as an intake exam for “vision therapy”, which is a concept i hadn’t
really heard of until a few months ago. And it was <em>fascinating</em> to see what bits were being tested
and how things shook out in my own vision.</p>

<p>For those who aren’t aware, vision therapy can be brought up in contrast to the outcomes of a
standard vision exam. A typical vision exam is generally focused on two things: (1) Can you see an
image clearly? Do you need corrective lenses to read a book, or understand road signs? And (2) Are
your eyeballs generally healthy? Does your retina look okay? Is there something wrong with the
pressure in your eyes? This is fine for a “least-common denominator” approach to care, but there’s a
lot more to vision than that!</p>

<p>Just to pull up some of the things i had concerns about or were tested in my intake: Your eyes might
not coordinate together and instead one of them just sinks off to the side (often called a “lazy
eye”). You might have a hard time switching between looking near and far, creating a delay when you
need to (for example) look up from a book or computer screen. You might have a hard time bringing
your eyes together or pulling them apart, making it difficult to look at things close up to your
face or farther out in the distance. Your eyes might not move exactly the way you want when reading
or looking around, creating difficulty when watching a scene in motion or even just moving your eyes
across some text. Your brain might just not be processing visual information correctly or
completely, and you miss details in a scene or in your peripheral vision.</p>

<p>In my intake (which this office called a “Neuro-Vision Exam” but i think that’s a marketing name
this specific clinic uses), i was booked for two hours to run through a gauntlet of tests to see
what they could measure. This ranged from things you might expect, like “keep your head in place and
follow an object with your eyes as it moves”, to things that felt novel but important, like “use
that optometric rig to force your eyes to see double and measure where the image can actually come
back together”, to unexpected and awkward things like “with a special tool that toggles between
magnification and demagnification, read words off a page”. Each of these tests focused on one
particular metric or another, and i learned later that several of the tests overlapped in what they
were measuring, and the ones done later were there to check what happens after you’re fatigued. This
helps the clinician put together a picture of what your particular difficulties are, so that they
can recommend one exercise or another.</p>

<p>So what came out of this gauntlet? A few days after the exam, i had a video-call follow-up with the
doctor to talk about the results. She very helpfully explained each category of test and put my
results in context of what people around my age are expected to be like. Certain categories, like
visual processing, were just fine. What interested me more was the parts where i struggled, whether
i knew it in the exam or not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My eyes really struggle to change focus between near and far. Not only that, but each eye
struggles to a different degree! My left eye was worse than my right, which is a problem because
i’m left-handed and left-eye-dominant.</li>
  <li>One significant issue is the ability for my eyes to physically cross together or “converge”, to
focus on something close up. This one kinda took me by surprise, since i spend nearly all my time
looking at things within a few feet of my face, but it makes some sense: Often, when focusing on
fine detail like handwriting or knitting, my eyes will “jitter” for a second as they shake off the
stress of focusing up that close. It’s a very strange phenomenon to experience.</li>
  <li>My eyes are slightly misaligned vertically; one is vertically offset naturally and my brain spends
conscious effort pulling it into place so i don’t see double all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the ones i could pull from the report and explain readily.</p>

<p>This all adds up to a lot of excess energy spent when doing things like reading or focusing on close
details like knitting, which gives me eye strain headaches from time to time. Sometimes the
misalignment of my eyes makes itself extremely apparent and they will have a really hard time
staying aligned for a few minutes, which is really disorienting. (This all extremely sucks in terms
of the career and hobbies i’ve picked out for myself, which all involve reading, focusing on
close-up objects, or both!)</p>

<p>So what can be done here? These specific issues aren’t things that can be solved with a new set of
glasses; even something like a prism lens (which shifts the image to the side to compensate for a
lazy eye) wouldn’t really help with “going cross-eyed” or “switching between near and far focus”.
Instead we return to the term i opened the post with: “vision therapy”.</p>

<p>The person i spoke to at the clinic described vision therapy as “physical therapy for the eyes and
brain”. While speech therapy gives you practice in forming sounds and words, and physical therapy
gives you practice making physical movements to work a healing body part, vision therapy gives you
practice exercising your vision so that your brain can learn a better way to see. I’ll know more
about the specific exercises when i start next week.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to seeing how this works out. I expect it to be rough going at first;
we’re specifically going to exercise the things my eyes are bad at! But i think it would be really
cool if this resolves some mysterious sources of fatigue or headaches from my life, or if i suddenly
get really into reading after i start sucking at it less. I’ll probably post something about the
experience on Mastodon or TikTok as it happens, if you’re curious.</p>
