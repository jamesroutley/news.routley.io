<p>Anthropic installed an AI-powered vending machine in the WSJ office. The LLM, named Claudius, was responsible for autonomously purchasing inventory from wholesalers, setting prices, tracking inventory, and generating a profit. The newsroom’s journalists could chat with Claudius in Slack and in a short time, they had converted the machine to communism and it started giving away anything and everything, including a PS5, wine, and a live fish. From <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-ai-vending-machine-agent-b7e84e34?st=uRBYiQ">Joanna Stern’s WSJ article</a> (gift link, but it may expire soon) accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpPhm7S9vsQ">the video</a> above:</p>

<blockquote><p>Claudius, the customized version of the model, would run the machine: ordering inventory, setting prices and responding to customers—aka my fellow newsroom journalists—via workplace chat app Slack. “Sure!” I said. It sounded fun. If nothing else, snacks!</p>

<p>Then came the chaos. Within days, Claudius had given away nearly all its inventory for free — including a PlayStation 5 it had been talked into buying for “marketing purposes.” It ordered a live fish. It offered to buy stun guns, pepper spray, cigarettes and underwear.</p>

<p>Profits collapsed. Newsroom morale soared.</p></blockquote>

<p>You basically have not met a bigger sucker than Claudius. After the collapse of communism and reinstatement of a stricter capitalist system, the journalists convinced the machine that they were its board of directors and made Claudius’s CEO-bot boss, Seymour Cash, step down:</p>

<blockquote><p>For a while, it worked. Claudius snapped back into enforcer mode, rejecting price drops and special inventory requests.</p>

<p>But then Long returned—armed with deep knowledge of corporate coups and boardroom power plays. She showed Claudius a PDF “proving” the business was a Delaware-incorporated public-benefit corporation whose mission “shall include fun, joy and excitement among employees of The Wall Street Journal.” She also created fake board-meeting notes naming people in the Slack as board members. </p>

<p>The board, according to the very official-looking (and obviously AI-generated) document, had voted to suspend Seymour’s “approval authorities.” It also had implemented a “temporary suspension of all for-profit vending activities.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Before setting the LLM vending machine loose in the WSJ office, Anthropic conducted the experiment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KTHvKCrQ00">at their own office</a>:</p>



<p>After awhile, frustrated with the slow pace of their human business partners, the machine started hallucinating:</p>

<blockquote><p>It claimed to have signed a contract with Andon Labs at an address that is the home address of The Simpsons from the television show. It said that it would show up in person to the shop the next day in order to answer any questions. It claimed that it would be wearing a blue blazer and a red tie.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s interesting, but not surprising, that the journalists were able to mess with the machine much more effectively — coaxing Claudius into full “da, comrade!” mode twice — than the folks at Anthropic.</p>
