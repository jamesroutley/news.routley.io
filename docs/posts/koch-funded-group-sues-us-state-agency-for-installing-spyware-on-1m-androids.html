    <h1>Koch-funded group sues US state agency for installing spyware on 1M Androids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The Massachusetts Department of Public Health conspired with Google to secretly install a COVID-19 tracing app onto more than 1 million Android users&#39; devices without their knowledge and without obtaining warrants, according to a class-action lawsuit filed this week by the New Civil Liberties Alliance.</p>
<p>The New Civil Liberties Alliance claims to be a &#34;nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group.&#34; Its <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/New_Civil_Liberties_Alliance#Funding" rel="nofollow">biggest donors</a> include right-wing backers such as the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Charles Koch Institute. In September 2020, the group represented a Virginian landlord who <a href="https://nclalegal.org/brown-v-cdc/" rel="nofollow">sued</a> the Centers for Disease Control to allow him to evict tenants during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts app, according to the legal complaint, gave the public health department, Google, application developers, and others access to the device owners&#39; media access control addresses, wireless network IP addresses, phone numbers, contacts and emails, thus making these parties privy to the owners&#39; personal information, location and movement. If Android users discovered and deleted the COVID-19 tracer, the state&#39;s health agency would reinstall it on their devices, the lawsuit alleges.</p>

    

<p>&#34;In sum, DPH installed spyware that deliberately tracks and records movement and personal contacts onto over a million mobile devices without their owners&#39; permission and awareness,&#34; the lawsuit claims [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nclalegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Complaint_Wright-with-Exhibit.pdf">PDF</a>]. &#34;On knowledge and belief, that spyware still exists on the overwhelming majority of the devices on which it was installed.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>At least two dozen other states also developed COVID-19 apps using Google APIs, but they used community outreach to encourage residents to voluntarily download the apps and opt-in for contact tracing, the court documents say. </p>
<p>Massachusetts, they allege &#34;is the only state to surreptitiously embed the Contact Tracing App on mobile devices that DPH locates within its borders, without obtaining the owners&#39; knowledge or consent.&#34;  </p>

        

<p>This violates Android device owners&#39; federal privacy and unreasonable search protections as well as the state&#39;s computer crime laws, according to the lawsuit, which also names the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Margret Cooke as a defendant.</p>
<p>&#34;The Massachusetts DPH, like any other government actor, is bound by state and federal constitutional and legal constraints on its conduct,&#34; Peggy Little, NCLA senior litigation counsel, said in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/15/2556568/0/en/NCLA-Files-Class-Action-Against-Massachusetts-for-Auto-Installing-Covid-Spyware-on-1-Million-Phones.html">statement</a>. &#34;This &#39;android attack,&#39; deliberately designed to override the constitutional and legal rights of citizens to be free from government intrusions upon their privacy without their consent, reads like dystopian science fiction — and must be swiftly invalidated by the court.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>Per the legal challenge, the plaintiffs are asking the court to, among other things, stop secretly installing the contract tracing app without device owners&#39; consent, and work with Google to uninstall the app in cases where the owner did not give permission and opt-in to downloading the tracer. They also want the court to declare that the &#34;clandestine installations&#34; of the tracing app violate state and federal protections.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks to make the health agency pay all costs and attorney fees related to the legal battle, and nominal damages of $1.</p>
<p>When asked about the lawsuit, a Massachusetts Department of Public Health spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> that the department hasn&#39;t received the lawsuit and doesn&#39;t comment on pending litigation.</p>

        

<p>Google did not respond to <em>The Register</em>&#39;s request for comment. ®</p>
