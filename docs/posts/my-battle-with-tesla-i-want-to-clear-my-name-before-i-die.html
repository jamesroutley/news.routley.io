    <h1>My battle with Tesla: I want to clear my name before I die</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><b>A Tesla whistleblower who has battled Elon Musk and his company through the courts for a decade tells BBC News she is still seeking a public apology. </b></p><p>No other interview about a tech giant has made me cry.</p><p>But towards the end of our Zoom call, when former Tesla engineer Cristina Balan dramatically removes her wig and tearfully tells me she has just finished breast-cancer treatment - and is now fighting, as a single mother, for both her life and her reputation, it&#39;s impossible not to feel her emotion.</p><p>&#34;I want to clear my name. I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise,&#34; is her message to the company’s billionaire boss.</p><p>Ms Balan has been waiting a long time.</p><p>Until 2014, she was a rising star within the electric-car company in the US.</p><p>In tribute to her engineering expertise, Ms Balan&#39;s initials were engraved into all early Tesla Model S batteries. And she proudly shows off a battery shell on camera. </p><p>Ms Balan recalls chatting to Mr Musk in the lunch queue at the staff canteen and says she was happy and successful – living her dream, after growing up in Romania with a lifelong passion for cars.</p><p>But after raising concerns about the safety of braking in Tesla vehicles, in 2014, she lost her job.</p><p>Ms Balan won a wrongful-dismissal case, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-03-22/former-tesla-engineer-cant-sue-for-defamation-in-public-trial-appeals-court-says">reported in the US press<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>.</p><p>But then, in a long media statement, Tesla claimed she had used company time and resources for a secret personal project, which it said was embezzlement - a crime in the US.</p><p>It is something Ms Balan strongly denies. </p><p>Tesla has never provided any details about the alleged incident, either to her or in public, she says. </p><p>The company also failed to respond to a BBC News request for information about it.</p><p>Ms Balan accuses Tesla of defamation.</p><p>And while she is currently in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, her biggest worry is she may not live to see her final day in court. </p><p>Ultimately, Ms Balan says, she has doggedly pursued the case for so long because she wants to prove her innocence to her son.</p><p>“I’m his hero,&#34; she says.</p><p>&#34;I’m the mommy who does airplanes and cars.” </p><p>And she does not want him to grow up believing his mother was a thief.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Ms Balan shared with BBC News various communications between herself and Tesla from her time working there.</p><p>&#34;Everything went south when I realised that they were hiding some critical safety issues,&#34; she claims.</p><p>Ms Balan was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals – a simple but potentially lethal design flaw - and said customers had complained.</p><p>&#34;If you cannot push the brake, someone else, outside of a Tesla, can get injured,&#34; she says.</p><p>&#34;They just had to say, ‘We realise the carpets are bad - just take them out of the cars.’&#34;</p><p>But managers rebuffed her concerns and became hostile, Ms Balan claims.</p><p>So she emailed Mr Musk, who had directly encouraged employees to come to him personally with any worries that could affect Tesla’s reputation.</p><p>&#34;I emailed him two emails,&#34; Ms Balan says.</p><p>&#34;I sent him one before I was out [of Tesla], telling him that we are all threatened.</p><p>&#34;I was thinking in my head, &#39;He still wants to do what’s right for Tesla.&#39;&#34;</p><p>But it failed – and Ms Balan went on to lose her job.</p><p>BBC News put her claims to Tesla but received no response. </p><p>The company&#39;s website says: &#34;Safety is the most important part of every Tesla. </p><p>&#34;We design our vehicles to exceed safety standards&#34;. </p><p>Another Tesla whistleblower,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311"> Lukasz Krupski</a>, recounted a similar, unrelated experience after emailing Mr Musk over concerns about working conditions at Tesla’s Norway headquarters. </p><p>And Ms Balan says other Tesla staff may be “afraid to speak up”.</p><p>Her case will eventually be heard in the California Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal - but there is no date for it yet. </p><p>It is her only chance of professional vindication, Ms Balan says.</p><p>&#34;I don’t want to give up my career,&#34; she says.</p><p>&#34;And I know that if I’m not winning this, it doesn’t matter how good I am. </p><p>“Everybody will look at what Tesla say about [me], so my career is gone. </p><p>&#34;I do not want that.”</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Mr Musk&#39;s leadership style is notoriously unconventional - but some of those to have worked for him say he gets results.</p><p>Dolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013,  previously told BBC News he was an &#34;incredible leader&#34;.</p><p>&#34;If that wasn&#39;t the case, he wouldn&#39;t be accomplishing the things that he is,&#34; she said, in 2022.</p><p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s exhausting to work for Elon. </p><p>&#34;But I think it&#39;s a proving ground like nothing else.&#34;</p><p>US lawyer Gordon Schnell, from the firm Constantine Cannon, says a rising number of technology-sector workers are becoming whistleblowers.</p><p>The stakes are so high because tech products have &#34;such a wide impact on the world,&#34; he says.</p><p>&#34;It really touches all of our lives,&#34; he says.</p><p>But the advice of Mr Schnell, who specialises in representing whistleblowers, is to explore every possible option before going public with any claims.</p><p>&#34;There are so many protected channels in so many different industries that a whistleblower can take, where they can get confidential concerns to the proper government agencies that are best suited to address those concerns,&#34; he says.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Philippa Wain</i></p></div></div></div>
