The Mathematical Fiction Homepage is my attempt to collect information
about all significant references to mathematics in fiction.  You can see
the <a href="https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/all.php">entire list</a> (sorted by author, title or publication
date).  You can <a href="https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/browse.php">browse</a> through the database to find your
favorite genre, topic, motif or medium.  If you&#39;ve got more specific
criteria in mind, try our <a href="https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/search.php">search page</a>.   If you&#39;ve
been here before and just want to see what&#39;s been added recently, look at
our listing of <a href="https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/new.php">new/recently modified</a> entries.  Finally, if you want some advice, you can check out <a href="https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/readinglists.php">my personal recommendations</a>.
