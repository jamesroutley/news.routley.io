For <a href="https://kevinboone.me/cpm40.html">reasons I&#39;ve discussed elsewhere</a>, I&#39;ve
recently become interested in using, and programming, CP/M again,
after an interval of 40 years. I&#39;ve even bought a real,
Z80-based, CP/M machine to experiment with. There&#39;s a small, but
growing, market for these machines among retrocomputing enthusiasts. 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve implemented a number of new utilities for CP/M in C --
see, for example, <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/KCalc-CPM">KCalc-CPM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cpmbox">cpmbox</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/cpmlife">cpmlife</a>.
</p>
<p>
<code>cpmlife</code> was implemented using a modern Z80 cross-compiler,
but I feel that somehow this is cheating. If I&#39;m going to develop for
CP/M, I really ought to use CP/M tools. I might not do all the development
or testing on CP/M -- because it&#39;s rather time-consuming -- but
I like to know that it would be <i>possible</i> to maintain my code
entirely under CP/M. 
</p>
<p>
This article is about developing in C for CP/M, using a 40-year-old
C compiler, and how this differs from modern C development.
The compiler I&#39;m using is the 1982 release of Manx Software Systems&#39;
&#34;Aztec C&#34;. The compiler is freely, and legally, available from
<a href="https://www.aztecmuseum.ca/compilers.htm#cpm">the Aztec Museum</a>.
A lot of CP/M software falls into the broad category of &#34;abandonware&#34; 
-- software that is notionally still protected by intellectual
propery law, but whose owners have no interest in it, or cannot even
be identified. In the case of Aztec, however, the owners of the
intellectual property, whose claim is not in dispute,
 have stated that they are happy for it to be
distributed and used.
</p>

<h2>About Aztec</h2>
<p>
The Aztec C compiler would have originally be distributed on floppy
disks, and is very small by moden standards. The compiler, assembler,
and linker are each about 20kB in size. The C library and the math 
library are a little larger. 
</p>
<p>
The compiler outputs assembly code, which has to be assembled separately.
Modern C compilers typically can generate assembly code, but this is
usually an internal operation, not visible to the user. The Aztec
C compiler for CP/M actually generates 8080, not Z80, assembly instructions,
so it will work on both CPUs -- the Z80&#39;s instruction set is a super-set
of the 8080&#39;s. This does mean, however, that the more sophisticated
features of the Z80 instruction set don&#39;t get used. There appears to be
a z80-specific compiler in later Aztec releases, but I have never been
able to get it to work. 
</p>
<p>
After the compiler has produced an assembly language &#34;.asm&#34; file, the assembler
converts this to a binary object file. Object files play exactly the
same role here as they do in modern C development, but they are not in any
recognizably modern format. The linker than combines the object
files with the standard library to create an executable.
</p>
<p>
So the sequence of operations for compiling <code>hello.c</code> 
to an executable is:
</p>
<pre>A&gt; cc hello.c
A&gt; as hello.asm
A&gt; ln hello.o c.lib
</pre>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b></blockquote>

<p>
Unless told otherwise, the linker will produce a binary with the
same name as the first of its arguments; in this case, 
<code>hello.com</code>.
</p>

<p>
The Aztec compiler pre-dates ANSI C, and follows the archaic
Kernigan &amp; Ritchie syntax. The most obvious difference from modern
practice is in function declarations:
</p>

<pre><SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_function</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>a<SPAN color="#990000">,</SPAN> b<SPAN color="#990000">)</SPAN>
<SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> a<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> <SPAN color="#009900">char</SPAN> <SPAN color="#990000">*</SPAN>b<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#FF0000">{</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN> body <SPAN color="#008080">of</SPAN> function <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#FF0000">}</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
Modern C compilers will accept this syntax, which can be useful if you
want to check part of a CP/M C program using modern tools -- more
on this later.
</p>

<p>
Variables must be strictly declared at the start of a block, which
means that each opening brace &#34;{&#34; is typically followed by a slew
of declarations. Modern practice favours putting declarations closer
to where the variables are used. This is particular relevant for
trivial loop control variables. You can&#39;t write this:
</p>

<pre><b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">10</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">++)...</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
You have to write this:
</p>

<pre><SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN>
<SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
<SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
<b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>i <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">10</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">++)...</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
This is undeniably a nuisance, but not a huge problem in most cases.
</p>

<p>
A bigger problem is the lack of any <code>const</code> modifier,
either to indicate constant quantities or constant pointers.
This makes compile-time error checking less thorough. I&#39;ve found that
a lot of mistakes that would be spotted at compile time by a modern
compiler don&#39;t get picked up by the CP/M compiler. Of course, this
annoyance has to be considered alongside the fact that the entire 
compiler is only 20kB in size.
</p>

<h2>Function prototypes</h2>
<p>
The Aztec compiler does not support full function prototypes, and trying
to declare them will fail. You <i>must</i> declare the return
value of a function if it is not <code>int</code> and not in the
same file, but you can&#39;t declare the arguments. So 
</p>

<pre><SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> x<SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN> <i><SPAN color="#9A1900">/* no */</SPAN></i>
<SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b><SPAN color="#990000">();</SPAN> <i><SPAN color="#9A1900">/* yes */</SPAN></i>
</pre>

<p>
Because the arguments can&#39;t be declared, you must use the correct
data type in the function call. So 
</p>

<pre><SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> x <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">10</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN> <i><SPAN color="#9A1900">/* no */</SPAN></i>
<SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> x <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">10.0</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN> <i><SPAN color="#9A1900">/* yes */</SPAN></i>
</pre>

<p>
The problem is that, lacking a prototype, the compiler does not know
to treat the literal &#34;10&#34; as the double &#34;10.0&#34;. Modern compilers
don&#39;t usually have this kind of problem.
</p>

<p>
Becuse I like to be able to test my code with a modern compiler
as well as run it on CP/M, I usually write function prototypes
both ways, with a compiler switch to select which to use:
</p>

<pre><b><SPAN color="#000080">#ifdef</SPAN></b> CPM
<SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b><SPAN color="#990000">();</SPAN> 
<b><SPAN color="#000080">#else</SPAN></b>
<SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">my_func</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#009900">double</SPAN> x<SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN> 
<b><SPAN color="#000080">#endif</SPAN></b>
</pre>

<h2>Data type sizes</h2>
<p>
CP/M C compilers generally offer integer data types with smaller ranges
than modern compilers. For example, the Aztec compiler takes an
<code>int</code> to be 16 bits, so its range will be 0-65535 if
unsigned and -32768 to 32768 if signed. 16 bits is a good choice for
the fundamental unit of calculation, as the Z80 CPU has 16-bit
registers that can take part in arithmetic. Still, modern compilers, designed
for contemporary CPUs, usually
take an <code>int</code> to be 32 or 64 bits, and getting used to
the smaller range can be a nuisance.  
</p>
<p>
Because an 8-bit microcomputer typically has a 16-bit address bus,
an <code>int</code> is large enough to store a pointer. Pointer types
are also 16-bit quantities.
</p>
<p>
The Aztec compiler supports a <code>long</code> data type which is
32 bits in size. However, the Z80 CPU has no built-in arithmetic
operations on data types of that size, so 32-bit operations will be
comparatively slow.
</p>
<p>
The compiler has <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> types
which are 32-bit and 64-bit respectively. Double-precision
arithmetic gives about 12 significant figures in practice. Both
types need to be used with care, because all the floating-point
calculations are done by the CPU, and are not particular speedy.
</p>

<h2>Standard library limitations</h2>
<p>
The Aztec standard C library is minimal by modern standards. Most of
the basic file and console I/O functions are present, and a good
set of math functions. We shouldn&#39;t expect networking functions, or
selectors, or thread management -- all things that
make no sense in the CP/M world. However, you&#39;ll find yourself implementing
your own versions of very basic functions like <code>strdup</code> and
<code>memcpy</code>. These are the kinds of functions that are easy
to implement in very inefficient ways, which wouldn&#39;t be noticed with
a modern CPU. You&#39;d likely get away with writing this kind of thing
in a modern C: 
</p>

<pre><b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">strlen</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>str<SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">++)</SPAN> <SPAN color="#FF0000">{</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN><SPAN color="#FF0000">}</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
This is bad code, of course, because the <code>strlen()</code> function
will be executed on the same string repeatedly. A modern compiler
will optimize this redundancy away and, even if it can&#39;t, modern CPUs
are so fast that it might not even matter. On a Z80, <i>it matters</i>.
All coding requires paying attention to efficiency, but functions that
get called many times are particularly significant.
</p>


<h2>Command line arguments</h2>
<p>
CP/M, in general, is a system in which uppercase and lowercase 
characters are not strongly distinguished. The Aztec C compiler
presents the program with the conventional <code>argc</code> and
<code>argv</code> arguments that represent the command line
-- but they will all be in uppercase, whatever the user actually
enters. That isn&#39;t the fault of the compiler -- it&#39;s the way the
command line is delivered by the CP/M CCP. Among other things, you
need to be careful about processing command-line switches -- there&#39;s
no point using a mixture of upper- and lowercase switches, for example.
</p>
<p>
Unix/Linux programmers will be used to getting command-line
arguments that are &#34;globbed&#34;. That is, any filename wild-card characters
on the command line will already have been expanded into a list
of matching files. On CP/M, if you want to be able to handle
arguments like <code>*.txt</code>, you&#39;ll have to expand
them yourself. 
</p>
<p>
MSDOS and Windows programmers will be used to doing this, because
their command-line processors follow the CP/M model. Forcing the
program to expand wild-cards allows CP/M to devote only a small
amount of RAM to storing the command line. This was very important
in the days when many desktop computers had memory sizes measured
in kilobytes.
</p>

<h2>Redirection</h2>

<p>
Another way in which programming command-line applications in CP/M 
is different from Unix is that CP/M provides no file redirection facilities.
If the user has to be able to direct program output to a file, e.g., by
running

</p><pre>A&gt; myprog &gt; myfiile.out
</pre>

<p>
then the programmer needs to make this happen. 
</p>
<p>
This task is made easier because the Aztec C library has built-in
support for redirection. When the program starts, the initialization
code parses any redirection tokens on the command line, and sets up
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code> 
accordingly. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, this library-based redirection only applies if you do
input and output using the C library features. If you call
BIOS or BDOS functions directly, the redirection won&#39;t apply. That&#39;s
the same in Unix, though -- even if output is redirected, you can still
output to the console by writing to <code>/dev/tty</code>, for example.
</p>

<h2>Device I/O</h2>

<p>
This will be relatively familiar to Windows programmers, I think, and
certainly to those us who programmed for MSDOS. At the C level, 
you&#39;d communicate with a device by opening it&#39;s pseudo-file. So
to send data to the printer, you&#39;d start with:
</p>

<pre><SPAN color="#008080">FILE</SPAN> <SPAN color="#990000">*</SPAN>f <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <b><SPAN color="#000000">fopen</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#FF0000">&#34;PRN:&#34;</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">,</SPAN> <SPAN color="#FF0000">&#34;w&#34;</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN>
<b><SPAN color="#000000">fprintf</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>f<SPAN color="#990000">,</SPAN> <SPAN color="#FF0000">&#34;Something to print...&#34;</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">);</SPAN>
<SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
You can even write to the paper punch device by opening <code>PUN:</code>
although, since few (if any) CP/M machines ever had a paper punch, I
doubt it will have much effect. Amazingly, <code>PUN:</code> remains
a valid device identifier on Windows. 
</p>

<h2>System interface</h2>

<p>
Although the C compiler&#39;s standard library has a good selection of
basic file I/O functions, there&#39;s still a lot of functionality missing,
compared to what we&#39;d expect in a modern C library. For example,
there are no built-in functions for enumerating files on a drive.
Aztec C provides functions for calling BDOS and BIOS entry points
directly, which can used in situations like this. To use them,
you do need a good working knowledge of CP/M internals. 
</p>
<p>
For example, here is some code to enumerate all the files on drive
<code>A:</code>. 
</p>

<pre><b><SPAN color="#000080">  #define</SPAN></b> BDOS_DFIRST <SPAN color="#993399">17</SPAN>

</pre>

<p>To make sense of this code, you need to understand the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
BDOS file functions work on a <i>file control block</i> (FCB), of which
the programmer typically fills in only the first two fields. 
<code>FCB</code> is a constant that represents the CP/M default
FCB, which is at memory address 0x5C in low memory. The first 
byte in the FCB is the drive number, starting at 1; the next 11
(8 + 3) are the filename, padded with spaces. The drive enumeration
functions will match a pattern; to list all files, we have to supply
the pattern &#34;????????&#34;. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
BDOS function 17 reads the first directory entry for the drive, and
returns either 0xFF (error) or a small integer. The small integer
is an offset into the DMA buffer area of memory, starting at 
address 0x80. This is where the results have been written.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The result is another file control block, whose filename field
(starting at byte 1) is the filename from the directory. This
is also padded with spaces. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
BUT... CP/M uses some of the filename characters to indicate
other properties, such as whether the file is read-only. These 
properties are set in bit 7 of the filename bytes, so thist
top bit has to be masked off.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If you want a filename in a non padded format (e.g., <code>foo.txt</code>
rather than <code>FOO     TXT</code>, you&#39;ll have to implement that.
It&#39;s surprisingly time-consuming to do this kind of data manipulation
on a list of files with a 4MHz CPU.
</p></li>
<li><p>
BDOS function 18 selects the next entry in the directory. Note that
there&#39;s no infallible way to distinguish between reaching the end
of the directory, and an error condition. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I mention all this not just to fill space, but to point out that 
using C rather than assembly language doesn&#39;t necessarily take away 
the need to understand CP/M internals fairly well. Happily, you can
bury all this complexity in a library once you&#39;ve got it working.
</p>



<h2>Calling convention</h2>
<p>
The Aztec compiler uses traditional C argument passing to functions:
the caller places the arguments on the stack, and then takes them
off afterwards. Any return value is returned in the A register,
for an 8-bit value, or the HL register pair for a 16-bit value.
Modern practice favours passing parameters in registers where possible.
This is much, much faster than stack-based argument passing, but 
works better when there are many registers available. The 8080 CPU
only has a total of 7 bytes of register capacity, so not many
arguments could be passed that way. 
</p>
<p>
Using the stack to pass arguments should allow for more, or larger,
arguments. In practice, I&#39;ve found that passing more than three
<code>long</code> arguments is problematic. I don&#39;t know what the
maximum stack size on CP/M -- I would have thought it would be limited
only be available memory. However, I&#39;ve noticed other indications
of limited stack size. For example, &#34;automatic&#34; (local) variables, 
which are usually stored on the stack, behave badly when they are
more than a few tens of bytes in size.
</p>
<p>
I do not know if this is a defect, or whether there is some specific
setting that has to be used to set the stack size. If it&#39;s a defect,
it&#39;s highly unlikely to be fixed at this stage. Bear in mind that 
a <code>double</code> value is 8 bytes in size, so I doubt it will be
possible to pass many of these as parameters (but two is definitely OK).
</p>

<h2>Memory management</h2>
<p>
Aztec C provides the usual <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>
functions, and they work as expected. It&#39;s almost certainly faster to
allocate a large amount of memory and then manage it internally, than
it is to make many small allocations. This is largely true with
modern compilers as well. However, it&#39;s often convenient to allocate
memory or an as-needed basis and, just as with a modern compiler, the
developer has to work out an acceptable compromise.
</p>
<p>
Conventionally, the program checks the return value from a 
<code>malloc()</code> call to ensure the allocation succeeded. Many
programmers, including myself, have gotten out of the habit of doing
this on modern systems like Linux, because a <code>malloc()</code>
call always succeeds, regardless how much memory is available.
When working on a Z80, though, we need to be much more careful about
this kind of thing.
</p>

<h2>Paging and overlays</h2>
<p>
CP/M systems rarely had more than 64Mb of RAM, and CP/M 2.2
had no concept of paging or virtual memory. As a programmer you
could implement software that required more than the available
RAM by breaking it into segments, but the operating system gave little
help with this. 
</p>
<p>
The Aztec C compiler supports a simple paging mechanism based on a 
technology known in the CP/M world as &#34;overlays&#34;. A program consists
of a &#34;base&#34; or &#34;core&#34; segment that remains in memory all the time,
and a number of &#34;overlays&#34; that are loaded from disk as required. 
</p>
<p>
The tooling for compiling and using overlays is built into the 
compiler and C library so, for the programmer, it&#39;s pretty straightforward.
Of course, there are subtle problems, like passing data from one
overlay to another, so things aren&#39;t trivial. And,
of course, with genuine 80s hardware, reading the overlays from 
disk is fairly slow, so it&#39;s a technique that has to be used with care.
</p>

<h2>Building and testing</h2>
<p>
While I think that using modern cross-compilers for CP/M development
is cheating, I have no objection to use real CP/M tools on a modern
CP/M emulator. This is usually much faster, and more convenient, than
working on real 80s technology. But are these approaches really different?
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that, if we&#39;re interested in keeping these old technologies
alive and thriving, we should actually be using them. Using a CP/M 
compiler on a CP/M emulator satisfies that objective -- at least to
some extent -- while using modern tools that could never run on CP/M 
does not. At least, that&#39;s how it seems to me.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, I&#39;m quite keen that the CP/M software I write is at
least capable of being compiled and linked on 80s hardware. I might not
actually do this very often, but I always check that it&#39;s possible
to do so.
</p>
<p>
In any case, you&#39;ll need to test the software on real hardware, even
if you build it using an emulator. A modern emulator will run CP/M
applications hundreds of times faster than a real CP/M machine does
natively. As a result, it&#39;s all too easy to write very inefficient
code, that seems to work perfectly well on an emulator, but struggles
on real hardware.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s an example. It&#39;s often often convenient, and expressive, to
work with two-dimensional arrays. In that case, you might find yourself
enumerating the complete array like this:
</p>

<pre>  <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> elems<SPAN color="#990000">[</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">5</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">][</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">300</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">];</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">,</SPAN> j<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN>
  <b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>i <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> m<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">++)</SPAN>
    <SPAN color="#FF0000">{</SPAN>
    <b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>j <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> j <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> n<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> j<SPAN color="#990000">++)</SPAN>
      <SPAN color="#FF0000">{</SPAN>
      <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> elem <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> elems<SPAN color="#990000">[</SPAN>i<SPAN color="#990000">][</SPAN>j<SPAN color="#990000">];</SPAN>
      <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN> process <SPAN color="#008080">the</SPAN> value <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
      <SPAN color="#FF0000">}</SPAN>
    <SPAN color="#FF0000">}</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with this code structurally and, if you only 
test it on an emulator, most likely it will work fine. The problem
is the amount of math required to determine the value of 
<code>elems[i][j]</code>. This will require a 16-bit multiplication --
for which there is no hardware support -- and an addition, followed
by an index into memory. This whole process will be repeated 1500 times. 
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hugely faster to consider the array as a single block of data,
and enumerate it by maintaining a single index which gets 
incremented, like this: 
</p>

<pre>  <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> elems<SPAN color="#990000">[</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">5</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">][</SPAN><SPAN color="#993399">300</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">];</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> <SPAN color="#990000">*</SPAN>_elems <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN><SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> <SPAN color="#990000">*)</SPAN>elems<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN>
  <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN>
  <b><SPAN color="#0000FF">for</SPAN></b> <SPAN color="#990000">(</SPAN>i <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">0</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i <SPAN color="#990000">&lt;</SPAN> <SPAN color="#993399">1500</SPAN><SPAN color="#990000">;</SPAN> i<SPAN color="#990000">++)</SPAN> 
    <SPAN color="#FF0000">{</SPAN>
    <SPAN color="#009900">int</SPAN> elem <SPAN color="#990000">=</SPAN> _elems<SPAN color="#990000">[</SPAN>i<SPAN color="#990000">];</SPAN>
    <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN> process <SPAN color="#008080">the</SPAN> value <SPAN color="#990000">...</SPAN>
    <SPAN color="#FF0000">}</SPAN>
</pre>

<p>
This strategy is less readable, but it completely eliminates the
need to perform 1500 16-bit multiplications. Of course, this saving
can be made only because we happen to be reading the array
sequentially; sometimes this isn&#39;t practicable. However, there&#39;s
<i>always</i> a need, when programming for 40-year-old hardware, to think
very carefully about efficiency. We&#39;ve mostly gotten out of
the habit, because modern compilers can do this sort of optimization
implicitly, and our CPUs are thousands of times faster.
</p>
<p>
This is why testing as often as possible on original hardware is 
so important -- it&#39;s just too easy to write inefficient code if you
work too much on an emulator.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s very helpful to be able to
build and run code destined for CP/M on a modern Linux system. I suppose
it would be equally straightforward -- or not -- to run it on Windows.
Modern compilers can do much more extensive compile-time checking and,
at runtime, we can use tools like <code>valgrind</code> to check
for invalid memory references and careless memory management. None of
this is possible under CP/M. I&#39;ve found that GCC will compile
K&amp;R-style C perfectly well, and anything that Aztec C can compile
can also be compiled by GCC. It might not work, of course -- nothing&#39;s
ever that simple. 
</p>
<p>
In practice, you&#39;ll probably only be able to unit-test certain parts
of the program on a modern platform, because all the I/O will be
different. Still, even that is an improvement over the testing
it&#39;s practicable to do natively on a Z80 system.
</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>
If you want to write really efficient code for 80s hardware, using an 
80s C compiler is really only one step up from writing assembly language.
The C language is minimal, as is the C library. You&#39;ll have to
do all the optimisation yourself, that would be automatic with a modern
compiler. Compile-time error checking is minimal, and you&#39;ll still need
to be familiar with the internals of the platform. 
</p>
<p>
But if it were easy, it wouldn&#39;t be fun.
