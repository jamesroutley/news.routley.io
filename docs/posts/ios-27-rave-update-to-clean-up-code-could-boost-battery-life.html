    <h1>iOS 27 &#39;Rave&#39; Update to Clean Up Code, Could Boost Battery Life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2026/02/16/apple-plans-snow-leopard-cleanup-ios-27/"><p>Apple&#39;s iOS 27 update will prioritize cleaning up the operating system&#39;s internals, with engineers making changes that could result in better battery life, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27"><em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman</a>.</p>

<p>The result should hopefully be a &#34;snappier, more responsive&#34; OS, says Gurman. Apple is also reportedly planning some interface tweaks, but nothing as dramatic as the Liquid Glass overhaul introduced with iOS 26, which will likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/macos-tahoe-finder-bug-slipping-ui-polish/">comfort some users</a>.</p>
<p>Code-named &#34;Rave&#34; internally, iOS 27 will also include efficiency improvements that Apple hopes will translate into tangible battery gains for users, says Gurman. However, it&#39;s unclear whether Apple would market those improvements or simply let users discover them on their own.</p>
<p>Gurman says getting the software into good shape is especially important as Apple prepares to launch new device categories, including a touchscreen MacBook Pro and its first foldable iPhone, both of which are expected in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The cleanup effort comes alongside Apple&#39;s other major iOS 27 priority of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/siri-ios-26-launch-confirmed-apple/">improving its AI capabilities</a>. The revamped, chatbot-style Siri that Apple announced in June 2024 has been repeatedly delayed, and some of its features are now expected to arrive in iOS 27 rather than iOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">reports Gurman</a>.</p>
