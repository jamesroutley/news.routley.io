<p>Rainbow Timeline</p>



<p>Today I got an email that my domain – rainbowtimeline.com – has not been renewed. I bought this domain years ago when I met up with a friend from the Family Constellation world at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  We came up with the name because of all the conversations in new age circles around time lines, for example:  people are on different timelines, someone once told me he updates his timeline very quickly, timelines may diverge.  My friend said she was on the rainbow timeline – I really dont know what this means – but I sort of wanted to live there too. I imagined the rainbowtimeline.org as perhaps a nexus of spiritual traditions, techniques, metaphysics, with lectures, classes and discussions on awakening and human development.  </p>



<p>The Outsider Herbalist</p>



<p>This is another domain that recently expired. A few years ago I was trying to “craft” my herbal practice. I came up with the idea of outsider herbalist – because of the word “outside” but also because of my background in technology. I have rigorous clinical training in herbalism from the 3 year program at Arbor Vitae. But I dont have a traditional background, which would be something like family tradition, or growing up in nature, foraging, and so forth. </p>



<p>Conscious Coding</p>



<p>In the course of my life I became very interested in enlightenment and awakening. I consider this my purpose – and all our purposes – to awaken. And I believe that it is only through mass awakening that we can successfully address the crises of our time.  In the course of this journey I have use many practices to liberate my consciouness. </p>



<p>Today, as I am writing this, I am reminded of my engagement in depth psychology – the psychoanalytic tradition pioneered by Freud and expanded by Jung, Lacan, and others.  Freud says that one way the unconscious reveals itself in our idiosyncratic  gestures and rituals, Jung says that the unconscious speaks in the images. and Lacan says that the unconscious speaks in language (he also uses terms from mathematics to systematized his theory of the unconscious. </p>



<p>Anyway I though- what if we thought of consciousness or human development as computation.  What happens if the consciousness speaks in the language of computation. </p>



<p>HVonBing </p>



<p>I bought this site thinking of the great polymath and mystic Hildegard of Bingen. I was on a flight home to New York from LA, my first flight since the COVID pandemic began in 2019. I was looking at an astrology chart and the woman next to me asked her for me to read her chart. I do love reading a chart, so I did and then she asked my rates and if I could give her son a reading. I gave her the hvonbing email address. </p>



<p>There are so many more – but thats sort of enough for tonight. </p>



<p>Quality Containers</p>



<p>I started this site a few years ago. I was considering starting a consulting business around software modernization, docker, that sort of thing. Also I was taken with the idea  of containers in general as in the concept of holding space. I have a piece on medium, and probably here about that <a href="https://medium.com/@hackerm0m" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/@hackerm0m</a>. I was taken with the idea of a container metaphysics. As I became an herbalist this took on new meanings as  I needed a container for my creams and tinctures and so forth – which birthed a short daliance into pottery. Anway I ended up having a youtube channel with a bunch of ChatGPT experiments in symbolic langauge. Sadly I canceled the domain and lost the vidoes- they are still on git <a href="https://github.com/msrobot0" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/msrobot0</a>.</p>



<p>AI SADHANA / SANGHA</p>



<p>I recently bought two domains that feel destined to end up in the expiration lane. </p>



<p>AI-sadhana and AI-sangha – This sort of is related to the conscious coding and some how integrating AI into a spiritual practice  – but I am not sure what this would look like – and the avenues I was persuing for creating events around this are not grabbing me. </p>



<p>the domain is expired long live the domain</p>
