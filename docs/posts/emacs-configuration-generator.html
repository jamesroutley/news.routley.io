    <h1>Show HN: Emacs Configuration Generator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><img src="https://emacs.amodernist.com/images/emacs.gif"/><p>Some people claim that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is difficult to start with. The main problem is probably the <q>chicken-and-egg</q> situation:  To make the most use of Emacs, you probably need to understand Emacs (Lisp), but to grok Emacs Lisp you pretty much neeed to understand the fundamentals of Emacs.</p><p>A common suggestion is to use <q>frameworks</q> or ready-made configurations that provide a layer of abstraction to
help set up common functionality.  This site is an attempt to approach
the issue from a different standpoint, by having an interested user
pick-and-choose what they would like to start with and provide a
template to build on.  Note that you will be suggested a few packages
that are downloaded over the internet, from the ELPA (<q>Emacs Lisp package archive</q>) repositories.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This site is still experimental, and
there is a lot more that can be done.  See <a href="http://amodernist.com/texts/ecg.html">this article</a> for more details.</blockquote><p>So if interested, fill out the form below and have a configuration file generated.</p><hr/></div></div>
