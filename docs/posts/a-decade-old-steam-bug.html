    <h1>A decade-old Steam bug</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has shown to occasionally not act on community feedback and bug reports. A story about a decade old bug. <a href="https://pixel.freudenjmp.com/no-user-logon.png"><img src="https://pixel.freudenjmp.com/no-user-logon.png" alt="" width="1" height="1" loading="lazy"/></a></p><h4 id="tldr"><span>tl;dr</span><a href="#tldr"><i></i></a></h4><p>To fix the infamous <code>No user logon</code> issue in Counter-Strike that exists for over a decade, here are a few popular mitigations that do absolutely jack shit to fix the root cause. If you found this article via Google: STOP, DO NOT DO THIS!</p><ul><li>Reinstall the game</li><li>Validate the game files</li><li>Restart Steam</li><li>Restart your computer</li><li>Disable WiFi</li></ul><p>To learn what to do instead, read this article.</p><h2 id="introduction"><span>Introduction</span><a href="#introduction"><i></i></a></h2><p><em>(You can skip to <a href="#no-user-logon">No user logon</a> if you don’t care about the history.)</em></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/">Counter-Strike</a> is a famous game developed by <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a>. Recently, Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) has been published and <em>replaced</em> (!) its predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Some people tend to not consider CS2 a game but one big bug. While this is maybe a bit harsh, it’s not far from the truth:</p><ul><li>You could <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/5484883079143170845?l=english">teleport yourself to any location on the map</a></li><li>You could <a href="https://youtu.be/j9g6F5IopJc">overcome physical limitations</a></li><li>You could <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/valve-quietly-fixes-major-cs2-security-exploit-but-disables-useful-feature-in-the-process">abuse a bug to inject code to other players</a></li><li>You could be banned by <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1712875606776729832">specific settings in your AMD graphics driver</a> or by <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/valve-appears-to-undo-false-vac-bans-for-windows-7-cs2-players">playing on Windows 7</a></li><li>Countless <a href="https://notes.thour.cz">other bugs</a> that are small in itself but are causing bad gaming experience when combined</li></ul><p>Be prepared for new bugs appearing, as Valve didn’t manage to include CS2 in <a href="https://hackerone.com/valve">Valves HackerOne bug bounty program</a>. <code>cs2.exe</code> is not in scope and the only (outdated) mention of CS2 is inside their description. This means that Valve is not paying for bug reports related to CS2.</p><blockquote><p>Effective 6/14/2023 10 AM PDT, CS:GO is out-of-scope for new reports. Reports for CS2 Limited Test are currently out-of-scope.</p></blockquote><p>However, this of course didn’t stop us from reporting bugs to Valve via e-mail. I hope you are not surprised to learn that these bugs haven’t been fixed nor did they bother to reply. We have at least one critical zero-day that compromises the competitive integrity of the game which is yet under the <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">industry-standard 90-day responsible disclosure time frame</a>.</p><p>Notable is that CS2 <em>replaced</em> CS:GO on September 27, 2023, which is a novum. This means CS:GO can’t be played anymore by the average user. Such a hard cutoff date is a new level of “<em>forcing things on the community they maybe don’t like</em>”. Gamers and platforms such as my employer <a href="https://esportal.com">Esportal</a> were suddenly forced to use CS2.</p><p>It’s not as if I never worked around bugs or needed to fix them on my own in CS:S or CS:GO. It is fine to a degree and expected as no software is bug free. But the amount of bugs in CS2 sets a new standard in a negative way. Especially bugs that are only relevant to community servers which Valve cares even less about.</p><p>Since middle of 2023, when CS2 release was apparent and we started to prepare support for it on Esportal, my working days look like this:</p><pre><code>journey

One of these bugs is the infamous <code>No user logon</code> disconnection happening randomly while you are happily playing:</p><p><a href="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/no-user-logon.jpg"><img src="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/no-user-logon.jpg" alt="No user logon" loading="lazy"/></a> <em>The infamous “No user logon” disconnection mid-game</em></p><p>For years (<a href="https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/counter-strike-source-no-steam-logon-error.214386/">2008</a>, <a href="https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/counter-strike/1264745-no-steam-logon.html">2011</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1fct7v/no_steam_logon_problem_need_help/">2013</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/21auhx/kicked_for_no_steam_logon/">2014</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/143387886726485073/">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/79i69y/no_user_logon/">2017</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/1727575977593194982/">2018</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/4809273833195803820/">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FACEITcom/comments/nz3lmq/no_user_logon_problem_how_to_fix/">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/16k7ioj/no_user_logon/">2023</a>) people around the world have been reporting this issue in multiple forums including the official support forum from Valve. Note that from a technical perspective <code>No user logon</code> and the sometimes mentioned <code>No steam logon</code> are likely just different names for the same root cause. I can’t know for sure but it would make sense.</p><p>There are countless <em>proposed fixes</em> to the issue:</p><ul><li><a href="https://appuals.com/no-user-logon-csgo/">Fix: “No user logon” Error in CSGO using these 5 Solutions</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thelotusgeek.com/csgo-no-user-logon-error-fix/">Fix CSGO No User Logon Error- 9 Fixes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAivlWrnEwM">CSGO No user logon error fix</a></li><li><a href="https://thedroidguy.com/csgo-no-user-logon-error-1241127">How To Fix CSGO No User Logon Error [Updated 2023]</a></li></ul><p>Spoiler: None of these <em>proposed fixes</em> actually fix the issue.

</code></pre><h3 id="esportal-specific"><span>Esportal specific</span><a href="#esportal-specific"><i></i></a></h3><p>We were facing this issue on Esportal as well throughout the years. While the problem was not significant usually it was a constant companion that cost us several days to debug and mitigate it if one counts all the efforts made in the past. Yet we never really fixed the problem and only were able to mitigate so it does not happen often.</p><ul><li>CS:GO: <em>(all times CET)</em><ul><li>First occurrence: 2019-11-15 19:15:32 (start of data information)</li><li>Last occurrence: 2023-09-26 21:38:01 (the day before the CS:GO got replaced by CS2)</li></ul></li></ul><p>In CS2 we were quite happy as apparently the issues was gone. We didn’t see any reports from our users and we didn’t see any occurrences in our logs. We were happy until the first week of January 2024 when we observed an increase of user reports related to this issue compared to all reports:</p><pre><code>xychart-beta

</code></pre><p>This is significant, I started to investigate. Coincidentally, these are the time of the day when we received the reports:</p><ul><li>CS2: <em>(all times CET)</em><ul><li>First occurrence: 2023-12-30 19:45:15 (and the only one that day)</li><li>2023-12-31: no reports</li><li>2024-01-01: no reports</li><li>2024-01-02: no reports</li><li>2024-01-03: 15:19:30 - 15:38:26</li><li>2024-01-04: 14:27:12 - 15:57:24</li><li>2024-01-05: 14:00:57 - 17:13:36</li><li>2024-01-06: 13:01:55 - 17:35:12</li><li>2024-01-07: 12:56:30 - 17:44:09</li><li>2024-01-08: 14:15:06 - 16:41:57</li></ul></li></ul><p>My colleague connected the dots and wrote in Slack:</p><blockquote><p>~13-17 PM CET is 04-08 AM in Washington (where Valve is operating from), maybe they are running some kind of routine during their night </p></blockquote><p>Previously the reported issues were evenly distributed throughout the day. Now they are concentrated in a specific time frame.</p><p>We could confirm that players world wide are facing the issue outside of Esportal and thought it indeed is caused by some maintenance in the middle of the night in Washington.</p><p>Though I was thinking “I looked into this bug a hundred times already without a meaningful result” we were now incentivized to fix it once and for all given the significance of the problem and the volume of tickets.</p><h2 id="the-symptoms"><span>The symptoms</span><a href="#the-symptoms"><i></i></a></h2><p>The observed <code>No user logon</code> errors happened 2-3 minutes after the player connected to the game. It was interesting to know, as this time span was pretty constant.</p><p>Luckily, a colleague mentioned, without knowing what important information they were sitting on at that time:</p><blockquote><p>I don’t see my skins in CS2 until some minutes into the game.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/190s7am/gaben_stole_our_usps/">players outside of Esportal reported missing skins</a> as well.</p><p><a href="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/inception.jpg"><img src="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/inception.jpg" alt="Leonardo DiCaprio" width="314" height="314" loading="lazy"/></a> <em>My colleague incepting an idea into my head without them knowing.</em></p><p>Boom! Was this the missing piece of the puzzle? The one information that was required to connect the dots which wasn’t apparent for years? I felt like I was in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a> and my colleague being <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> incepting an idea into my head.</p><p>It is well-known that Valve is sensitive when it comes to skins in their games. They make substantial amount of money with skins. So what if individual skins are not shown until maybe, just maybe, the player owning the skin has been properly authorized by Steam? This would make sure people can’t spoof their identity on the gameserver and use skins they don’t own.</p><h2 id="validation-of-the-hypothesis"><span>Validation of the hypothesis</span><a href="#validation-of-the-hypothesis"><i></i></a></h2><p>I picked a random match where a report came in. Matches are played 5vs5, so 10 players connect to a gameserver in total. Looking at the gameserver logs and applying proper filtering I was able to immediately see something that supports the hypothesis: <code>STEAM USERID validated</code> for a given user who didn’t have issues with <code>No user logon</code> appeared roughly 1min20s after the user connected. Example with user <code>Alice</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>16:39:55: &#34;Alice&lt;1&gt;&lt;&gt;&#34; connected
16:41:14: &#34;Alice&lt;1&gt;&lt;&gt;&#34; STEAM USERID validated
17:17:32: &#34;Alice&lt;1&gt;&lt;CT&gt;&#34; disconnected (reason &#34;NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER&#34;)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>In older logs before 3rd of January the Steam validation always finished within 2-3 seconds after connection instead.</p><p>I tested myself and indeed: missing skins were only a thing during night time in Washington. I was able to reproduce the issue by connecting to a gameserver at 5 AM Washington time. I was not able to reproduce the issue during the Washington daytime.</p><blockquote><p>Hypothesis that <code>No user logon</code> and no skins are connected is now confirmed.</p></blockquote><h2 id="network_disconnect_steam_logon"><span>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</span><a href="#network_disconnect_steam_logon"><i></i></a></h2><p>Now it is apparent this issue has something to do with Steam validation. But what exactly is the bug? Coming back to the logs of the match I picked I now looked at user <code>Bob</code> who reported <code>No user logon</code> issues:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>It is apparent it took 9 minutes for this user to get into the match until they received <code>STEAM USERID validated</code>.</p><p>After the match ended, the disconnect reason is <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING</code>. It’s an internal identifiers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_2">Source 2 engine</a> which CS2 is using. The prefix <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_</code> is used to separate these identifiers from others in the engine.</p><p><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING</code> is a valid disconnect reason tells us the user closed their CS2 game while being connected to the gameserver. Another natural reason would be <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER</code> which means the user disconnected from the gameserver by themselves without closing their CS2 game.</p><p>Looking at the events before the Steam validation was successful, four disconnections are apparent with two different reasons:</p><ul><li><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code></li><li><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code></li></ul><p>I can reasonably assume the message <code>No user logon</code> is the human translation of the identifier <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code>, so I started looking into this first. Interesting is that <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code> is an immediate consequence of <code>STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8</code>. What does it mean though? To find out, I searched for the string <code>STEAMAUTH:</code> in the binary file that is providing the core of the Source 2 engine, <code>libengine2.so</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>$ grep -a &#34;STEAMAUTH:&#34; engine2.so
-insecure-insecure_forced_by_launchersystem/networkSTEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>The last part of the match is interesting: <code>STEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d</code>. As I confirmed this string is in <code>libengine2.dll</code>, I opened the file in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a> tool, searched for the same string again and found the function which is referencing the string. This helps me to understand the context of the string and what it is used for.</p><p>A little trick that comes handy when looking at Counter-Strike is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-counter-strike-source-code-leak-no-danger">CS:GO source code leak</a>. The same string appears in the file <a href="https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/f82112a2388b841d72cb62ca48ab1846dfcc11c8/engine/sv_steamauth.cpp#L792">sv_steamauth.cpp on line 792</a>. Utilizing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler">decompiler</a> I was able to get pseudo C code that reflects what the function is doing in CS2. Combining the information from the source code leak and the reverse engineering tool I was able to understand the context of the string and what it is used for. The functions look nearly identical in both versions of Counter-Strike, but not 100%. Here is what the properly readable code for CS2 looks like:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

It happens when something called <code>CSteamServer3</code> tells us that the <code>eAuthSessionResponse</code> is one of:</p><ul><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseUserNotConnectedToSteam</code> (maps to <code>1</code>)</li><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalidAlreadyUsed</code> (maps to <code>7</code>)</li><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid</code> (maps to <code>8</code>)</li></ul><h2 id="steam3-validation"><span>Steam3 validation:</span><a href="#steam3-validation"><i></i></a></h2><p>So… what is <code>CSteamServer3</code>?

</code></pre><p>Steam3 server is likely responsible for authenticating users. It is not the same as the Steam client that you are using to play games. It is also not the same as the Steam servers that are responsible for matchmaking and other things. It is a separate thing. Think: it makes sure to proof that you are who you are claiming to be and that you own the game you are trying to play.</p><p>When connecting to a gameserver, your game (<code>CS2.exe</code>) tells the gameserver what your Steam ID is. As you could be a bad person, you could modify the game and tell the gameserver that your Steam ID is <code>STEAM_0:0:0</code> instead. That would be the Steam ID of the first Steam account ever created. The gameserver has no way to know at this point whether your information is correct or not. This is where the Steam3 server comes into play. The gameserver asks the Steam3 server if the Steam ID is valid and whether you own the game.</p><p>Note that while the gameserver is waiting for the response, you can continually playing normally on the gameserver, but without skins.</p><p>If the Steam3 server says <code>yes</code>, the gameserver starts trusting that information. It can now do interesting stuff with it, like starting to assign your personal skins to you. This would be the moment where you and others can see your skins.</p><p>And now we know what is likely happening in Washington at night between 4 and 8 AM: the Steam3 server is doing maintenance or is very slow to respond for other reasons. As we learned, that “slowness” is currently roughly 1min20s.</p><p>If the Steam3 server says <code>no</code> instead, the gameserver knows that you (or your game) is lying and disconnects you with <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code>. Looking at the logs from the match, the disconnect happens 2min50s seconds after the user connected to the gameserver. This is why users report the <code>No user logon</code> message appears after 2-3 minutes. This is a reasonable timeframe because in networks it’s always a good idea to have enough leeway for possible issues. It’s better to wait a bit longer than to disconnect too early.</p><h2 id="making-it-trustable"><span>Making it trustable</span><a href="#making-it-trustable"><i></i></a></h2><p>The above scenario is not fully complete, though. It imposes one problem: it only guarantees that the Steam ID told to the gameserver is valid and owns the game. It does <em>not</em> proof that the instance of <code>CS2.exe</code> that connected to the gameserver is actually the one belonging to the signed in Steam account running on the same machine via <code>Steam.exe</code>. So what is needed is a way to proof that <code>CS2.exe</code> is actually trustable.</p><p>This can be achieved by ensuring that <code>CS2.exe</code> can initiate a connection to Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code> running on the same machine. As <code>Steam.exe</code> as the Steam client knows the account which is currently signed in, it compares the Steam ID sent by <code>CS2.exe</code> to it. If they match, <code>Steam.exe</code> tells the Steam3 server that the Steam ID is valid for <code>CS2.exe</code>. If it can’t match them, it doesn’t tell the Steam3 server about it.</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram

</code></pre><blockquote><p>Learning: In reality though, the answer <code>no</code> is too simple. Deducing from above, it can be reasonably assumed that the answer <code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid</code> (which maps to <code>8</code>) is the one we see in the logs for a failed Steam3 validation: <code>STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Reasons why Steam3 server could answer <code>no</code> are for example:</p><ol><li>Steam3 is broken and answers wrong things: unlikely, even Valve can be trusted to get this right</li><li>Steam3 server is under maintenance: unlikely, as other users can connect</li><li>The Steam ID is not valid: unlikely, usually our players are trustworthy</li><li>The Steam ID is valid but the instance of <code>CS2.exe</code> is not trustable: likely</li><li>Steam3 server doesn’t know about the Steam ID for this <code>CS2.exe</code> instance: likely</li></ol><p>Aha! The last two points are likely candidates for the issue. But why do some users have problems with untrusted <code>CS2.exe</code> instances while other users are fine?

When <code>CS2.exe</code> starts, it is started with an active loop. A loop processes things in the background, waits until they are finished and once they are finished, invokes the next loop. A loop can run for a very long time, for example the <code>game</code> loop runs as long as you are playing. A loop can be shutdown in case something goes wrong.</p><p>In this example, a the <code>levelload_loop</code> is executed until the level, materials and physics engine are loaded. Once they are loaded, the <code>levelload_loop</code> is considered finished and it executes the <code>game_loop</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

It is <em>the</em> loop that is running as long as the game is fully loaded and/or you are playing.</p><p>As <code>game</code> is the final loop it can’t be the one which is shutdown and so it can’t be the one initiating the disconnection with <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code> as otherwise the game would end. To find out which loops are executed before the <code>game</code> loop, I decided to look at the output of the game console of <code>CS2.exe</code> which can be enabled in the game settings.</p><p>Among a lot of other things, the following can be observed:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

In the end, that loop wants to transition to the <code>game</code> loop. And <em>directly</em> before that transition it says <code>AuthStatus (steamid:&lt;redacted&gt;): OK (OK)</code>. So the last thing that happens before the <code>game</code> loop is started is that the Steam ID validation is initiated.</p><p>It all makes sense: <code>levelload</code> is called on startup of <code>CS2.exe</code>. While it’s not loading an actual map you are playing on, the initial screen you see in CS2 is likely considered a level too and initializing things like the intro video and the main menu. And while that initial screen is loaded in <code>levelload</code> it tries to initiate the validation with Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code>.</p><blockquote><p>Learning: <code>levelload</code> is an important initialization loop and is, among other things, responsible to initiate the validation with Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code> from <code>CS2.exe</code> as the <strong>last thing</strong> this loop does.</p></blockquote><p>The updated diagram with these learnings looks a bit different now. Note that <code>CS2.exe</code> is only considered the “initiator” of the <code>levelload</code> and all the game logic that was previously assigned to <code>CS2.exe</code> is taken over by the <code>game</code> loop:</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram
