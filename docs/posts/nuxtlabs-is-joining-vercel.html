    <h1>NuxtLabs is joining Vercel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><!--[--><span>NuxtLabs is joining Vercel</span><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->From the start, our mission at NuxtLabs has been to create the best possible developer experience for building fast, beautiful applications. We built Nuxt as an open source framework under the MIT license because we believed that great tools should be accessible, transparent, and community-driven.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We‚Äôve spent years pouring our time, energy, and resources into Nuxt. And through that, we‚Äôve built not just a product, but also a community. <strong><!--[-->One I‚Äôm proud of every single day.<!--]--></strong><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->But sustaining open source at this level is hard. With Vercel‚Äôs support, we no longer have to split our focus between maintaining Nuxt and funding its future. <strong><!--[-->Now, we can go all in on what we love: building in the open.<!--]--></strong><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Vercel has a strong history of supporting open source projects and creators: Next.js, Turborepo, Svelte, shadcn, AI SDK, and more. They understand what it means to invest in the web as a shared platform. We‚Äôre joining a company that shares our values and is helping us go further without compromising on what makes Nuxt special.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Our open source team is coming along, and <strong><!--[-->we‚Äôll continue working on Nuxt and Nitro with the same focus and care.<!--]--></strong> The project stays MIT-licensed. The roadmap stays public. The community stays at the center.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->With this, we‚Äôre making some changes to how we handle sponsorships. All sponsorship funding will be moved to Open Collective for full transparency and to ensure it goes directly to Nuxt core and community contributors.<!--]--></p><p><!--[--><strong><!--[-->What does this mean for you?<!--]--></strong><!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Expect to see more open source from us, in the coming months, we will:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->Release Nuxt UI v4 with all Nuxt UI Pro components available for free to everyone, as well as our Figma Kit.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Open source a self-hostable version of Nuxt Studio, designed to integrate directly with your Nuxt Content site as an admin to edit your website.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Make NuxtHub agnostic to support other providers, integrating with Vercel‚Äôs <!--[--><a href="https://vercel.com/marketplace" rel="nofollow"><!--[--><!--[--><!--[-->Marketplace<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></a><!--]--> offerings like Postgres and Redis will become seamless.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->Looking ahead, AI will be a new area of focus for us. We‚Äôre exploring how to bring AI into the Nuxt developer experience. Helping you ship ideas faster. We‚Äôre also working closely with Vercel‚Äôs AI teams, including v0, and continuing to experiment with local tooling like MCP.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs supported Nuxt along the way. Every contribution, bug report, pull request, and kind word has brought us here.
