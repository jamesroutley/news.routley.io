    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

    

<p>A passenger without any flight experience managed to safely land a plane in Florida Tuesday after the pilot suffered a possible medical emergency, the FAA said.</p><p>Dramatic audio between the passenger and air traffic controllers revealed the tense moments before the single-engine Cessna 208  landed at Palm Beach International Airport.</p><p>In the audio obtained by CBS News, the unidentified passenger can be heard saying: &#34;I&#39;ve got a serious situation here. My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane.&#34;</p>    
<p>&#34;Roger. What&#39;s your position?&#34; a controller responds. </p><p>&#34;I have no idea. I can see the coast of Florida in front of me. And I have no idea,&#34; the passenger says.</p>

    

<p>The controller can be heard instructing the passenger to &#34;maintain wings level&#34; and to &#34;just try to follow the coast, either north or southbound.&#34; </p><p>Minutes later, air traffic controllers were able to locate the plane on radar and walk the passenger through how to land the small plane.</p><p>&#34;The aircraft landed safely and one patient was transported to a local hospital,&#34; Palm Beach County Fire Rescue said in a statement.</p><p>There was no word on the name or condition of the pilot. They were the only two people aboard the plane.</p>

    
    

<p>The FAA said it will investigate the incident.</p>
