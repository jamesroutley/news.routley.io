    <h1>Launch HN: SSOReady (YC W24) â€“ Making SAML SSO painless and open source</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m Ulysse, CTO at SSOReady (<a href="https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready">https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready</a>).</p><p>SSOReady is an open-source (MIT) service that lets you implement SAML single sign-on without ever touching SAML yourself. You just need to implement two API endpoints: one to initiate SAML logins and another to receive incoming SAML messages. And then you&#39;re pretty much done.</p><p>Here&#39;s me setting up SAML single sign-on in under a minute: (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HVtFkW8xCI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HVtFkW8xCI</a>).</p><p>You can use our service with whatever tech stack or programming language you prefer.</p><p>Earlier in my career, I worked on SAML authentication at Segment. I&#39;ve been pretty obsessed with SAML since then. In the depths of the COVID pandemic, I even wrote an implementation of SAML in Go to entertain myself (<a href="https://github.com/ucarion/saml">https://github.com/ucarion/saml</a>).</p><p>Over the years, I&#39;ve gotten really itchy to build better SAML tooling. There just aren&#39;t a lot of great options out there. Almost no one seems interested in making SAML easy for developers. Almost no one seems interested in writing clear documentation.</p><p>We&#39;re hoping to change that with SSOReady. We&#39;ve open-sourced our codebase on an MIT license. You can do pretty much whatever you want with the code. Fork us. Self-host us.</p><p>We&#39;ve also made the product entirely free.</p><p>Why free and open source? We&#39;re focused solitarily on becoming developers&#39; first choice for SAML SSO. If it makes developers&#39; lives easier, it works for us. We expect to monetize in the future by building extra features that serve large companies with complex needs. We don&#39;t see any point to being secretive or squeezing dollars out of small companies.</p><p>I&#39;d be thrilled if you gave the product a try, and I&#39;d be really grateful for any feedback on your experience.</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns, my cofounder Ned and I will stay active on this thread throughout the day. You can also reach us directly at founders@ssoready.com. (We really mean this! We want to hear from you!)</p></div></div></div>
