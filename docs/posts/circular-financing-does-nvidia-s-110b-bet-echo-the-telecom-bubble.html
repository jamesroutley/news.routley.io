                <p>When Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment commitment to OpenAI<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in September 2025 , analysts immediately drew comparisons to the telecom bubble. The concern : is this vendor financing , where a supplier lends money to customers so they can buy the supplier’s products , a harbinger of another spectacular collapse?</p>
<p>American tech companies will spend <strong>$300-400 billion</strong> on AI infrastructure in 2025<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> , exceeding any prior single-year corporate infrastructure investment in nominal dollars.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> David Cahn estimates the revenue gap has grown to <strong>$600 billion</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>Lucent’s revenue peaked at $37.92B in 1999 , crashed 69% to $11.80B by 2002 , never recovered. Merged with Alcatel in 2006.</em></p>
<p>In 1999 , Lucent Technologies reached $37.92 billion in revenue at the peak of the dot-com bubble. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Lucent was the #1 North American telecommunications equipment manufacturer with 157,000 employees &amp; dominated markets alongside Nortel Networks (combined 53% optical transport market share). <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Behind the scenes , equipment makers extended billions in vendor financing to telecom customers. Lucent committed <strong>$8.1B</strong><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> , Nortel extended $3.1B with $1.4B outstanding , &amp; Cisco promised $2.4B in customer loans.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The strategy seemed brilliant : lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins—until the merry-go-round stops.</p>
<p>When the bubble burst :</p>
<ul>
<li>47 Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs) bankrupted 2000-2003 , including Covad , Focal Communications , McLeod , Northpoint , Winstar <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>

</ul>
<h2 id="nvidias-playbook">Nvidia’s Playbook</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2025. Nvidia’s vendor financing strategy totals <strong>$110 billion in direct investments</strong> plus another <strong>$15+ billion in GPU-backed debt</strong>. The largest commitment is $100B to OpenAI (September 2025)<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> , structured as 10 tranches of $10B each tied to infrastructure deployment milestones. The first $10B was valued at a $500B OpenAI valuation , with subsequent tranches priced at prevailing valuations. Payment comes via lease arrangements , not upfront GPU purchases. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar confirmed : “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia”<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond OpenAI , Nvidia holds a $3B stake in CoreWeave<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> , a company that has spent $7.5B on Nvidia GPUs , &amp; $3.7B in other AI startup investments<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> through NVentures.</p>
<p>The GPU-backed debt market adds another layer. CoreWeave alone carries $10.45B in debt using GPUs as collateral<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. An additional $10B+ in GPU-backed debt has emerged for “Neoclouds” including Lambda Labs ($500M GPU-backed loan)<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Lucent in 1999-2000 had vendor financing commitments of $8.1B (20% of $41.4B revenue). Nvidia’s direct investments total 85% of annual revenue ($110B against $130B). Nvidia’s exposure is 4x larger relative to revenue than Lucent’s official outstanding loans , though Lucent’s off-balance-sheet guarantees masked the true exposure.</p>

<p>Amazon’s 2025 reversal (6 → 5 years) is the first major pullback.</p>
<p>CPUs historically have 5-10 years of useful life , while GPUs in AI datacenters last 1-3 years in practice , despite 6-year accounting assumptions.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Evidence from Google architects shows GPUs at 60-70% utilization survive 1-2 years , with 3 years maximum.<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Meta’s Llama 3 training experienced 9% annual GPU failure rates , suggesting 27% failure over 3 years.<sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Cerno Capital raises the question : “Are these policies a reflection of genuine economic &amp; technological realities? Or are these policies a lever by which hyperscalers are enhancing the optics of their investment programs amid rising investor concerns?”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="4-the-use-of-spvs">4. The Use of SPVs</h3>
<p>Tech companies use Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to finance AI datacenter construction. A hyperscaler like Meta partners with a private equity firm like Apollo , contributing capital to a separate legal entity that builds &amp; owns the datacenter.</p>
<p>As investor Paul Kedrosky explains : “I have a stake in it as Meta. Some giant private debt provider has a stake in it. The datacenter is under my control. But I don’t own it, so you don’t get to roll it back into my balance sheet.”<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>*</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Entity Creation</strong> : Hyperscaler &amp; PE firm form separate legal entity (SPV)</li>
<li><strong>Capital Structure</strong> : Typically 10-30% equity, 70-90% debt from private credit markets</li>
<li><strong>Lease Agreement</strong> : SPV leases capacity back to hyperscaler</li>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet Treatment</strong> : SPV debt doesn’t appear on hyperscaler’s balance sheet</li>
</ol>
<p>The hyperscaler maintains operational control through long-term lease agreements. Because it doesn’t directly own the SPV , the debt remains off its balance sheet under current accounting standards.</p>
<p>The appeal is straightforward. “I don’t want the credit rating agencies to look at what I’m spending. I don’t want investors to roll it up into my income statement.”<sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>*</p>
<p><strong>Market Scale</strong></p>
<p>American tech companies are projected to spend $300-400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Hyperscaler capital expenditures have reached approximately 50% of operating income<sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, levels historically associated with government infrastructure buildouts rather than technology companies.</p>
<p><strong>Where the Risk Sits</strong></p>
<p>Datacenter assets now represent 10-22% of major REIT portfolios<sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> , up from near zero two years ago. The thin equity layer (10-30%) means if datacenter utilization falls short of projections or if GPUs depreciate faster than projected , equity holders face losses before debt holders experience impairment.</p>
<p><em>*Quotes lightly edited for clarity &amp; brevity</em></p>
<h3 id="5-custom-silicon-threat">5. Custom Silicon Threat</h3>
<p>Hyperscalers are building their own AI accelerators to reduce Nvidia dependence. Microsoft aims to use “mainly Microsoft silicon” , specifically Maia accelerators , in datacenters.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Google deploys <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">TPUs</a> , Amazon builds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/">Trainium</a> &amp; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/">Inferentia</a> chips , &amp; Meta develops <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/next-generation-meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/">MTIA</a> processors. If customers shift to in-house silicon , CoreWeave’s GPU collateral value &amp; Nvidia’s vendor financing become exposure to customers building competitive alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-watching">What I’m Watching</h2>
<p>Is AI demand real (like cloud computing) or speculative (like dot-com fiber)?</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m watching :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GPU utilization rates</strong> : Are data centers actually using the chips or just stockpiling?</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI’s monetization</strong> : Can they generate enough revenue to justify the buildout?</li>
<li><strong>Debt defaults</strong> : Any cracks in the $15B GPU-backed debt market?</li>
<li><strong>AR trends</strong> : AR improved from 68% (FY24) to 30% (Q2 FY26) , but still watch for deterioration</li>
<li><strong>Customer adds</strong> : Are new customers emerging , or is Nvidia dependent on the same 2-4 hyperscalers?</li>
<li><strong>Custom silicon threat</strong> : Microsoft developing Maia accelerators , aiming to use “mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center.”<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> If hyperscalers shift to in-house chips , Nvidia’s vendor financing becomes exposure to customers building competitive alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor consolidation</strong> : Many companies are in a period of experimentation trying 2-3 competing vendors. Those experimental budgets may thin with time , reducing overall spend.</li>
</ol>
<p>AI is already broadly deployed—40% of US employees used AI at work by September 2025 , double the 20% rate in 2023.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Questions persist about effectiveness : the oft cited MIT study found 95% of AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact , primarily due to poor integration rather than technical failures.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet the pace of improvement is tremendous. Labor market data shows wages rising twice as fast in AI-exposed industries , &amp; workers using AI boost performance up to 40%.<sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Many of Nvidia’s customers are profitable &amp; sophisticated hyperscalers—Microsoft , Google , Amazon , Meta—generating $451B in operating cash flow in 2024 , with tremendous pull from their own enterprise customers demanding AI. OpenAI is not profitable , reporting a $4.7B loss in H1 2025 on $4.3B revenue , though nearly half the loss is stock-based compensation.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike the telecom bubble , where demand was speculative &amp; customers burned cash , this merry-go-round has paying riders.</p>

<h2 id="coda--lucents-accounting-fraud">Coda : Lucent’s Accounting Fraud</h2>
<p>Behind the vendor financing disaster was systematic accounting fraud. The SEC charged Lucent with manipulating $1.148 billion in revenue &amp; $470 million in pre-tax income during fiscal year 2000. <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The fraud involved multiple schemes :</p>
<p>Channel Stuffing : Lucent sent $452 million in equipment to distributors but counted it as revenue before the distributors sold to end customers.<sup id="fnref3:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This created phantom sales.</p>
<p>Side Agreements : Lucent executives entered secret agreements with distributors granting them return rights &amp; privileges beyond their distribution contracts , making it improper to recognize revenue.<sup id="fnref4:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> These side deals were hidden from auditors.</p>
<p>Reserve Manipulation : Lucent improperly established &amp; maintained excess reserves to smooth earnings , violating GAAP.<sup id="fnref5:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The SEC charged 10 Lucent executives with securities fraud.<sup id="fnref6:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The company paid a $25 million fine—the largest ever for failing to cooperate with an SEC investigation.<sup id="fnref7:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The accounting manipulation masked deteriorating fundamentals until too late.</p>
<p>The WinStar Collapse : Lucent committed $2 billion in vendor financing to WinStar Communications , a CLEC. When WinStar struggled , Lucent refused a final $90 million loan extension. WinStar filed bankruptcy. Lucent wrote off $700 million in bad debts.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> This pattern repeated across customer defaults : Lucent made provisions for bad debts of $2.2 billion (2001) &amp; $1.3 billion (2002)—a total of $3.5 billion in customer loan losses.<sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>
