prescription stuff, but that only worked for a short while before it

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h5>What is different about your program
versus another sleep program?
</h5>
<p>
Our sleep program was designed in collaboration with top sleep
experts and is based off the latest research on CBT-I. CBT-I is
clinically proven to be effective for insomnia, and our program is
also personalized and tailored to your sleep data.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>What is CBT-I?</h5>
<p>
Short for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia. CBT-I is
effective with many types of insomnia, even showing potential
benefits for patients who don’t meet the clinical criteria for
insomnia. CBT-I is 3x to 5x more effective than sleeping pills in
improving sleep. In fact, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
recommends that all adult patients receive CBT-I as a first-line
approach.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>How long is the program?</h5>
<p>You&#39;ll receive a personalized program based on your sleep needs. Most
of our users start seeing results in 2 weeks, and no longer
experience insomnia within 4-6 weeks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>How old do I have to be to start your
program?</h5>
 <p>The recommended minimum age for participation in the Slumber One
program is 18.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h5>Are there any side effects to your
program?</h5>
<p>CBT-I uses sleep restriction and consolidation, which may cause
daytime sleepiness until sleep has been regulated. In general, CBT-I
is safe for most people. However, CBT-I is not recommended if you
have
the following conditions or disorder:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Any psychiatric disorders worsened by sleep restriction (e.g.
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, other psychotic spectrum
disorders)
</li>
<li>Epilepsy</li>
<li>Untreated obstructive sleep apnea
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone in a profession where they need to be alert or cautious to
avoid serious accidents (e.g. long-haul truck drivers, long-distance
bus drivers, air traffic controllers, operators of heavy machinery)
should also consult with their health care provider before starting
the program.
