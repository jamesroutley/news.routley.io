      <p>Thousands of happy users</p>
      <p>I&#39;ve been looking a long time for a program like LosslessCut</p>
      <p>You just saved my butt and kept me from missing a pretty important deadline over a stupid mistake. THANK YOU.</p>
      <p>Before using this I had just spent 45 minutes exporting 1.5 seconds of video using my usual video editor, this did the whole thing in less than a second.</p>
      <p>I use your program LosslessCut frequently and am amazed by how fast and simple it works, especially that everything really works without loss.</p>
      <p>Thanks for your work on LosslessCut. I have years of personal video to cut through, and this is going to be a huge timesaver.</p>
      <p>Great work! LosslessCut saves me a lot of time due to usability and good performance.</p>
      <p>LosslessCut saved my day from endless FFmpeg trim commands, thank you and keep up the good work!</p>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Why is it not free on the App Stores but free on GitHub?
      </p>
      <p>
        I initially only released LosslessCut as a direct download from GitHub, as an unsigned/untrusted exe/binary file download. People were complaining that it&#39;s hard to download/install the unsigned exe file, as they need to go through these dialogs saying that this file is a threat to your computer, and anti-virus complaining about executables downloaded from the internet. Some wanted a way to automatically update the app when new versions are out. This can both be achieved by downloading through the MS and Apple App Store. Microsoft charges money for signing binaries and a yearly fee for publishing to the Microsoft Store. Therefore I decided I can sell it in the MS Store for those who want to support my continued work and want to have the benefits it gives, while at the same time providing more experimental unsigned downloads as usual. Of course anyone is also free to build LosslessCut from source code.
