    <h1>Tell HN: DuckDuckGo&#39;s privacy extension is adding an inline popup to web forms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I didn&#39;t really believe my eyes when I saw it the first time, I thought it had to be some ad specific to the website.</p><p>But it appears every form accepting an email on any website I visit now gets a small duck icon next to it that pops up a big bold-print message box to &#34;Protect your inbox &#34; complete with a cheeky prompt to either &#34;get email protection&#34; or &#34;maybe later.&#34; Refusal is not even an option. This is definitely new for me as of today.[0]</p><p>I found DuckDuckGo via Hackernews and have generally been a happy user of both the search engine and the privacy extension. Why could they possibly be doing this? It seems like a self-destructive act from a branding standpoint, I can&#39;t imagine their target customer demographic is amicable to this kind of thing.</p><p>[0]<a href="https://i.redd.it/p1tcoikka0ka1.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.redd.it/p1tcoikka0ka1.png</a></p><p>Edit: It&#39;s even on Hackernews! I genuinely can&#39;t recall a browser extension acting like this since the mid-00s adware toolbar days. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vYjZAUK.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/vYjZAUK.png</a></p><p>Edit again: This post originally just said &#34;injecting ads into web forms,&#34; I edited the title to clarify - apologies if that was misleading.</p></div></div></div>
