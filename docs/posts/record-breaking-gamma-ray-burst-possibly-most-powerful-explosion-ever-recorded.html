</div><p>In the early-morning hours of today, 14 October 2022, astronomers using the Gemini South telescope in Chile operated by NSF&#39;s NOIRLab observed the unprecedented aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded, Gamma-Ray Burst GRB221009A. This record-shattering event, which was first detected on 9 October 2022 by orbiting X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes, occurred 2.4 billion light-years from Earth and was likely triggered by a supernova explosion giving birth to a black hole.

                                         
                                                  </p><section>

      </section>
                                        
                                                                                    <p>A titanic cosmic explosion triggered a burst of activity from astronomers around the world as they raced to study the aftermath from what is one of the nearest and possibly the most-energetic gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed. Just-released observations by two independent teams using the Gemini South <a href="https://phys.org/tags/telescope/" rel="tag">telescope</a> in Chile—one of the twin telescopes of the International Gemini Observatory operated by NSF&#39;s NOIRLab—targeted the bright, glowing remains of the explosion, which likely heralded a supernova giving birth to a black hole.</p>
<p>The GRB, identified as GRB 221009A, occurred approximately 2.4 billion light-years away in the direction of the constellation Sagitta. It was first detected the morning of 9 October by X-ray and gamma-ray space telescopes, including NASA&#39;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and the Wind spacecraft. </p>
<p>As word of this detection quickly spread, two teams of astronomers worked closely with staff at the Gemini South to obtain the earliest-possible observations of the afterglow of this historic explosion. </p>
<p>In the early-morning hours of Friday, 14 October, two Rapid Target of Opportunity imaging  observations were conducted by two independent teams of observers led by graduate students Brendan O&#39;Connor (University of Maryland/George Washington University) and Jillian Rastinejad (Northwestern University). The observations occurred mere minutes apart. The first observation used the FLAMINGOS-2 instrument, a near-infrared imaging spectrograph. The other observation used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). </p>
<p>The teams now have access to both datasets for their analyses of this energetic and evolving event. </p>
<p>&#34;The exceptionally long GRB 221009A is the brightest GRB ever recorded and its afterglow is smashing all records at all wavelengths,&#34; said O&#39;Connor. &#34;Because this burst is so bright and also nearby, we think this is a once-in-a-century opportunity to address some of the most fundamental questions regarding these explosions, from the formation of black holes to tests of dark matter models.&#34; </p>
<p>Thanks to the fast reaction of observers and staff, combined with the use of Gemini Director&#39;s Discretionary Time and efficient data-reduction software like Gemini&#39;s <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/observing/phase-iii/understanding-and-processing-data/data-processing-software">DRAGONS &#34;FIRE&#34;</a> (Fast Initial Reduction Engine), this image was quickly produced soon after the observations.  </p>

                                                                                                
                                            
                                            
<p>&#34;The agility and responsiveness of Gemini&#39;s infrastructure and staff are hallmarks of our observatory and have made our telescopes go-to resources for astronomers studying transient events,&#34; said Gemini Chief Scientist Janice Lee.</p>
<p>Already communications have gone out to fellow astronomers through the NASA Gamma-ray Coordinates Network, the archive of which is now filling up with <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3_archive.html">reports </a>from around the world. Astronomers think it represents the collapse of a star many times the mass of our Sun, which in turn launches an extremely powerful supernova and gives  birth to a black hole 2.4 billion light-years from Earth. </p>
<p>&#34;In our research group, we&#39;ve been referring to this burst as the &#39;BOAT&#39;, or Brightest Of All Time, because when you look at the thousands of bursts gamma-ray telescopes have been detecting since the 1990s, this one stands apart,&#34; said Rastinejad. &#34;Gemini&#39;s sensitivity and diverse instrument suite will help us to observe GRB221009A&#39;s  optical counterparts to much later times than most ground-based telescopes can observe. This will help us understand what made this <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gamma-ray+burst/" rel="tag">gamma-ray burst</a> so uniquely bright and energetic.&#34;</p>
<p>When <a href="https://phys.org/tags/black+holes/" rel="tag">black holes</a> form, they drive powerful jets of particles that are accelerated to nearly the speed of light. These jets then piece through what remains of the progenitor star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays as they stream into space. If these jets are pointed in the general direction of Earth, they are observed as bright flashes of X-rays and gamma rays. </p>
<p>Another <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gamma-ray/" rel="tag">gamma-ray</a> burst this bright may not appear for decades or even centuries and the case is still evolving. Of note are other extraordinary reports of <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/32744.gcn3">disturbances in the Earth&#39;s ionosphere</a> affecting long wave radio transmissions from the energetic radiation from the GRB221009A event. Scientists are also wondering how very-high-energy 18 TeV (tera-electron-volt) photons <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06338">observed with the Chinese Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory</a> could defy our standard understanding of physics and survive their 2.4 billion year journey to Earth. </p>
<p>This event, because of its relative proximity to Earth, is also a unique opportunity to better understand the origin of the elements heavier than iron and whether they all come <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101">solely from neutron-star mergers</a> or also from collapsing stars that trigger GRBs. </p>
<p>&#34;The Gemini observations will allow us to utilize this nearby event to the fullest and seek out the signatures of heavy elements formed and ejected in the massive star collapse,&#34; said O&#39;Connor.
