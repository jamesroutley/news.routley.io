He also said that cloud companies were focusing more on securing graphics processors for AI instead of Intel&#39;s central processors. </p><p>Intel CFO David Zinsner said in a statement that part of the reason that Intel&#39;s report was stronger than expected was because of the progress it has made towards slashing $3 billion in costs this year. Earlier this year, Intel slashed its dividend and announced plans to save $10 billion per year by 2025, including through layoffs. </p><p>&#34;We have now exited nine lines of business since Pat rejoined the company, with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion,&#34; said Zinsner. </p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Here&#39;s how Intel&#39;s business units performed:</h2><div><ul><li>Intel&#39;s Client Computing group, which includes the company&#39;s laptop and desktop processor shipments, fell 12% annually to $6.8 billion.The overall PC market has been slumping for over a year.</li><li>Intel&#39;s server chip division, which is reported as Data Center and AI, declined 15% to $4.0 billion in sales.</li><li>Intel&#39;s Network and Edge division, which sells networking products for telecommunications, declined 38% to $1.4 billion. </li><li>Mobileye, a publicly-traded Intel subsidiary focusing on self-driving cars, saw sales down 1% on an annual basis to $454 million. </li><li>It reported $232 million in revenue for its foundry business, Intel Foundry Services, that makes chips for other companies. </li></ul></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107278174"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107278174" data-vilynx-id="7000309851" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107278175-16904906801690490676-30499568030-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1690491114&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Intel jumps 6% after-hours as earnings return to profitability after two quarters of losses"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Intel&#39;s gross margin was nearly 40% on an adjusted basis, which beat the company&#39;s previous forecast of 37.5%.
