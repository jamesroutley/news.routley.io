Earlier this year, Intel slashed its dividend and announced plans to save $10 billion per year by 2025, including through layoffs.</p><p>&#34;We have now exited nine lines of business since [Gelsinger] rejoined the company, with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion,&#34; said Zinsner.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Here&#39;s how Intel&#39;s business units performed:</h2><div><ul><li>Revenue in Intel&#39;s Client Computing group, which includes the company&#39;s laptop and desktop processor shipments, fell 12% to $6.8 billion.
