    <h1>Shoe prints lead FBI to suspect couple involved in multiple New Mexico wildfires</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A federal search for a pair of Vans sneakers revealed a man and his girlfriend&#39;s may have been involved in at least six New Mexico wildfires, including the Salt Fire that burned <a href="https://nmfireinfo.com/2024/07/04/south-fork-and-salt-fire-update-7-4/" target="_blank">nearly 8,000</a> acres of land, according to a court document.</p><p>In a recently unsealed search warrant affidavit, an FBI agent detailed an investigation into 16 suspicious fires on the Mescalero Apache Reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico. The FBI began the investigation in early May, and several other federal agencies joined last month after the Salt Fire had burned more than 7,000 acres of the reservation&#39;s forests.</p><p>Investigators determined all 16 fires to be &#34;human-caused.&#34; The fires occurred from May 3 to June 18 in a 25-square-mile area.</p><p>The Salt Fire was the most destructive of the 16, and investigators noted that it had diverted resources away from the South Fork Fire, a naturally caused fire that burned over 1,400 structures and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2nd-death-reported-new-mexico-wildfires-blazes-predicted-grow-rcna157971" target="_blank">killed t</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2nd-death-reported-new-mexico-wildfires-blazes-predicted-grow-rcna157971" target="_blank">wo people</a>. The Salt Fire started about 2 hours after the South Fork was reported.</p><p>After having spoken with witnesses and searching the areas of each fire, investigators found two things that led them to the couple: a Jeep and a pair of Vans sneakers.</p><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-07/240722-vans-evidence-vl-458p-b2d05a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-vans-evidence-vl-458p-b2d05a.jpg 1x"/><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-07/240722-vans-evidence-vl-458p-b2d05a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-vans-evidence-vl-458p-b2d05a.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-vans-evidence-vl-458p-b2d05a.jpg" alt="A top and bottom view of Vans&#39; sneakers." height="641" width="1740"/></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">Top and bottom views of the found Vans sneakers.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">United States District Court</span></figcaption></figure><p>Witnesses reported seeing two people drive away from one of the fires in a Jeep Grand Cherokee, which was later seen fleeing two other fires. Investigators also found the impression of a Vans-branded shoe in the dirt near two of the fires.</p><p>Less than a mile from where the Salt Fire started, an agent from the Bureau of Indian Affairs&#39; Office of Justice Services conducted a traffic stop of the suspected Jeep, with a man and his girlfriend inside.</p><p>The Jeepâ€™s tire tread patterns closely matched those near the fires, authorities said. A shoe print of the woman&#39;s Vans also matched the previously found impression, and the woman voluntarily gave her shoes to the FBI, it said.</p><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-07/240722-salt-fire-footprint-vl-413p-ae7e4d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-salt-fire-footprint-vl-413p-ae7e4d.jpg 1x"/><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-07/240722-salt-fire-footprint-vl-413p-ae7e4d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-salt-fire-footprint-vl-413p-ae7e4d.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-salt-fire-footprint-vl-413p-ae7e4d.jpg" alt="A foam shoeprint capture." height="1600" width="2109"/></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">A foam shoe print capture of the Vans branded shoe.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">United States District Court</span></figcaption></figure><p>The man in the Jeep had reported the first fire that occurred on May 3, claiming to be a wildland firefighter who tried to put it out, authorities said. Investigators said they observed, however, a stark contrast in his reaction to the Salt Fire; he didn&#39;t attempt to report or extinguish it, even though he claimed in an interview that it was visible from his house.</p><p>The FBI would not comment, citing the ongoing investigation, and pointed to a<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/news/media-alert" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/news/media-alert" target="_blank">news </a><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/news/media-alert" target="_blank">release</a><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/news/media-alert" target="_blank"> last month</a> asking for public assistance in identifying the fires.</p><p>According to the National Park Service, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank">nearly 8</a><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank">%</a> of wildland fires in the U.S. are caused by human activities, such as unattended campfires, debris burning, equipment malfunctions and arson.
