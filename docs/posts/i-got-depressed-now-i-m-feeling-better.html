<p>I left the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> &amp; Brooklyn 30 days ago and can finally begin to unpack. It&#39;s been over two months since my last post and the truth is...</p>
<h2 id="i-got-depressed">I got depressed</h2><p>One day in early November, I lost my fizz and my soul-soda went flat. For about two months, I struggled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up. Some days I laid in bed until I got too bored and hungry. I strongly preferred not to be awake.</li>
<li>Imagine the future. A fog covered my brain when thinking about the next week and beyond. I was disinterested at best, hopeless at worst.</li>
<li>Empathize with others. I felt trapped in my own head and couldn&#39;t sense what others were feeling. I got lonely because of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it be like that. Not my first rodeo with depression, but this was the first time I felt it without an obvious reason like the death of a family member, covid, a breakup, etc. which made it harder to identify and name. I was still working out, writing code, socializing, and technically functional, but dissociated.</p>
<p>With enough hindsight, I think it may have been a combination of all the factors below hitting all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long distance relationships are hard. I was missing the regular love and physical connection I have when I&#39;m home.</li>
<li>My really exciting and important project, <a href="https://github.com/flavius-popan/charlie" target="_blank">Charlie</a>, was falling flat on it&#39;s face. I worked on it day and night for months and it wasn’t working as expected. Expectations hit reality and I felt deflated for putting so much time and energy into it for so little payoff.</li>
<li>I got less sunlight; Daylight Savings Time and Seasonal Affective Disorder go hand in hand.</li>
<li>I was coming to the end of my sabbatical and would have to re-enter the job market soon.</li>
<li>Saying farewell to the Recurse Center and all my friends. Goodbyes during the holidays are much heavier.</li>
<li>I wasn&#39;t isolated from all the news of happenings across the US, all the headlines hit me too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-baseline">Back to baseline</h2><p>Now that I&#39;m home with my loved ones, I&#39;ve got more headroom to rise &amp; fall without going under. I still feel the weight of all the above; but now I can carry it, and most importantly, <em>want</em> to carry it. As I&#39;m writing this in a private notepad, I&#39;m feeling resistance to posting it because there&#39;s a good chance my struggles seem downright pedantic compared to yours. But the world I want to live in includes people being honest about where they&#39;re at and where they&#39;ve been.</p>
<p>I got depressed, now I&#39;m feeling better.</p>
<p>How are you doing?</p>
