    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>&#34;site: medium.com&#34;</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy advertisements, <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/national/90-year-old-man-spends-10k-on-ads-to-tell-att-ceo-about-his-slow-internet-service/">especially in legacy media</a></li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research or data
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">Appendix</a>, <a href="https://blog.alexa.com/sites-for-market-research/">here</a>, or <a href="https://web.jinfo.com/go/blog/73431">here</a></li>
<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone just as an excuse to make yourself complete a project
<ul>
<li>Sure you could proofread your own document.  But if you hire a proofreader, you have to actually deliver them something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Say “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion” when you don’t</li>
<li>Not tell white lies
<ul>
<li>You can be nice and tell the truth at the same time.</li>
<li>Especially to kids when they annoy you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t drink (alcohol), even when you’re expected to</li>
<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>
<li>It’s not weird unless you make it weird</li>
<li>Everyone knows some starving artists and needs to buy holiday gifts</li>
<li>Doesn’t apply to every service obviously: don’t take out loans from your friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travel to friends just to visit them</li>
<li>Move close to friends</li>
<li>Live in multiple places with multiple people
<ul>
<li>Rent spare rooms or couches part-time in multiple homes</li>
<li>Arrange your own timeshare system with friends
<ul>
<li>E.g. a group of nine friends can rent three three-bedroom apartments in three cities</li>
<li>This also gives you flexibility over which jurisdiction you’re taxed in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be a nomad</li>
<li>Ask your acquaintances, “Hey, I want to leave my house more, are there any cool events you’re going to soon?” (HT Sasha Chapin)</li>

<li>Hire a matchmaker</li>
<li>Buy premium versions of dating apps</li>

<li>You really can, to the best of our knowledge, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas">save someone’s (statistical) life</a> with not that much money.
This is a big deal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-and-accountability">Support and accountability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a coach
<ul>
<li>For your professional area
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/personal-best">An Atul Gawande article on the subject</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-the-most-of-your-resources">Making the most of your resources</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Laundry service</li>
<li>Nannies over daycare</li>
<li>Write on a post-it note affixed to a greeting card rather than on the greeting card itself, so the recipient can throw away the post-it and reuse your card
<ul>
<li>Employ similar logic for any disposable/consumable item</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask for free upgrades or coupons
<ul>
<li>At checkout you can just ask “Do you have any coupons I can apply to this?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Treat fines like payments
<ul>
<li>E.g. park illegally and let yourself think of the (expected value of the) fine as a parking fee</li>
<li>Obviously don’t break rules that matter like blocking a fire exit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://donotpay.com/">Contest unjust fines</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t pay, or renegotiate, bills

<ul>
<li><a href="https://getmagic.com/">Magic</a>, <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a>, <a href="https://www.fancyhands.com/">Fancy Hands</a>, and similar services can approximate many of these.

<li>Hotels where you can sleep comfortably</li>
<li>Non-public transportation, especially when traveling</li>
<li>Buying comfortable mattress, shoes, etc.</li>
<li>Buying clothes for appearance or comfort instead of just the lowest price</li>
<li>Bottled water when you’re thirsty
<ul>
<li>And in general fulfilling any bodily need for &lt; $5 (restrooms, buying a hat when you forgot yours, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy your way out of advertising on e.g. Spotify or YouTube</li>
<li>Actually turn the heat/AC on
<ul>
<li>And in general, <a href="https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2018/01/29/hammertime-day-1-bug-hunt/">being willing to spend a few minutes to fix small annoyances</a>
<ul>
<li>You could even get someone to observe you to help figure this out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seriously, just put WD-40 on that squeaky hinge already</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="professional">Professional</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ignore what’s on the jobs page and directly pitch someone at a company on hiring you
<ul>
<li>The jobs page is always out-of-date anyway</li>
<li>Figure out what their needs are before you make your pitch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Negotiate for better terms in your job offer
<ul>
<li>Easier than asking for a raise - you have more leverage</li>
<li>You can ask for a signing bonus equal to the cost of exercising all your options, which shows commitment to the company</li>
<li>Propose a longer vesting schedule to demonstrate commitment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask for a raise</li>
<li>Ask to waive admission or graduation requirements</li>

<ul>
<li>Or go on leave from your job/school until they kick you out. They often won’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Live off your savings while trying something new</li>
<li>If you can’t live off your savings, get a grant

<li><a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/apply-for-an-acx-grant">ACX Grants</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Work for yourself
<ul>
<li>Coaching, contracting, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/#cold-emails-and-twitter">Cold contact people</a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, even famous people. Just make sure you have something to say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://guzey.com/follow-up/">Follow up many times</a>
<ul>
<li>You won’t make people mad if you’re polite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approach a person or group you admire and ask whether they want to cofound something with you
<ul>
<li>“Here’s my story, my goal is to build a company/nonprofit/whatever in this space, maybe I can help you with X role.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Propose that a person, group, or company contract-to-hire you
<ul>
<li>Even if you want a cofounder role, this can be done well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn how professionals email by <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails">reading leaked emails</a>.</li>
<li>Use contract-to-hire
<ul>
<li>Even for CEO-level roles, this can be done well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As mentioned above, buy <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">research or data</a>, e.g. for compensation</li>
<li>Merge with your competitors, a la PayPal</li>
<li>Work in public
<ul>
<li>Or mostly in public, a la SpaceX who livestreams everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sell to unusual markets
<ul>
<li>ZetrOZ was building a medical device, but started by selling to olympic horse teams, then olympic human athletes</li>
<li>Some biotech companies start in pets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Charge more</li>
<li>Write interviews with yourself and send them to journalists</li>
<li>Fly to people for in-person meetings/visits to demonstrate seriousness</li>
<li>In general, just ask for things, even if you’ve never heard someone ask for them
<ul>
<li>It’s okay if the things are crazy.  You can always mollify afterward by saying “I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.”</li>
