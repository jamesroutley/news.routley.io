    <h1>Ask HN: Freelance website builders/maintainers, what&#39;s in your 2024 toolkit?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am returning to freelance website work after the end of a lengthy contract in an unrelated field. I am completely disconnected from current best practices on platforms &amp; tools to build and maintain websites.</p><p>I have some local and national clients who have requested website overhauls, some from the ground up with a respectable budget (mostly national) and others under the single-page basic web presence umbrella with less money available (mostly local).</p><p>If you&#39;re a freelancer working with building &amp; maintaining websites, I would like to know more about how you build and maintain them. What&#39;s in your toolkit? Server-side, front-side, desktop appsâ€¦anything goes.</p><p>Thank you.</p></div></div></div>
