    <h1>JSR Is Not Another Package Manager</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past years, new package managers like yarn and pnpm have emerged,
enhancing how packages are downloaded. However, the npm package registry, a
cornerstone of the JavaScript ecosystem, has barely evolved. Its last notable
update was a “files” tab added years ago. The JavaScript language, known for its
vibrant evolution, seems paradoxically mired in a distribution model that hasn’t
kept pace.</p>
<p>Back when I created Node, there was no standard module system for JavaScript. As
a result, the npm registry and Node defaulted to CommonJS (<code>require</code>), a system
with fundamental flaws that made it unworkable in browsers. So, almost a decade
ago, in 2015, the language adopted syntax for ES modules (<code>import</code>). Today, most
JavaScript is written using ES modules, yet the pathways for distributing these
modules remain convoluted, especially when TypeScript is involved. This clear
gap in the ecosystem prompted the creation of <a href="https://jsr.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR</a>, not as
another package manager but as a transformative registry designed to
revolutionize how JavaScript and TypeScript are shared across server-side
runtimes, browsers, and various tools.</p>
<p>JSR fundamentally improves the code distribution process by streamlining
complexities that have long plagued developers. By being ESM-only and
TypeScript-first, JSR eradicates the frustrating juggling of <code>package.json</code>
configurations and the labyrinthine tsconfig compiler options. Through
<a href="https://jsr.io/docs/scoring" rel="noopener noreferrer">a package scoring system</a>, JSR motivates best
practices in code distribution—higher scores are awarded to packages that
include comprehensive JSDoc documentation on each exported symbol, akin to what
the Dart community has in <a href="http://pub.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer">pub.dev</a>. As seen in other modern
programming ecosystems like Go and Rust, JSR provides automatic documentation
generation right out of the box.</p>
<p>JSR is a registry, not another client for the npm registry. But that doesn’t
mean you need to give up everything from npm, or make a hard switch to a
disjoint ecosystem of JavaScript modules.
<a href="https://jsr.io/docs/npm-compatibility" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR is designed to complement the npm registry</a>,
not replace it. JSR packages are allowed to depend on npm packages -
<a href="https://jsr.io/@moductor/libintl@1.5.0/dependencies" rel="noopener noreferrer">see, for example, this package</a>.
Moreover, JSR packages can be used in existing npm-first software because JSR
itself acts as an npm registry (accessible at npm.jsr.io) that distributes
npm-compatible tarballs. This allows JSR packages to be included in any software
using npm, yarn, or pnpm, as well as to integrate with
<a href="https://jsr.io/docs/private-registries" rel="noopener noreferrer">private registries</a>. The npm tarballs
that JSR distributes are optimal.</p>
<p>At Deno, we prioritize security as a paramount concern in JavaScript
development. While no registry can comprehensively police all published code,
JSR provides transparency about its publishers and secures the publishing
process. By integrating OIDC tokens with GitHub Actions, JSR creates advanced,
verifiable provenance attestations using the
<a href="https://slsa.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a> and stores them
in <a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigstore</a>. This not only ensures the authenticity
of the code but also establishes trust and accountability in what developers are
implementing.</p>
<p>JavaScript is the common language of many programmers, making it both universal
and accessible. The language merits a central hub—a town square—where developers
can share their work without undue complexity. We believe JavaScript will remain
central to software development for many years, and JSR aims to support this
enduring relevance. While JSR is not a package manager, it offers a new approach
to how we manage and secure code, aspiring to be a stable, forward-looking
platform that enhances and safeguards JavaScript development. In this way, JSR
represents not just another tool in the ecosystem but a fundamental shift in how
we think about distributing JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>
