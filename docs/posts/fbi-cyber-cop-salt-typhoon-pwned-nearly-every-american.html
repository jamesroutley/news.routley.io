    <h1>FBI cyber cop: Salt Typhoon pwned &#39;nearly every American&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>China&#39;s Salt Typhoon cyberspies hoovered up information belonging to millions of people in the United States over the course of the years-long intrusion into telecommunications networks, according to a top FBI cyber official.</p>
<p>&#34;There&#39;s a good chance this espionage campaign has stolen information from nearly every American,&#34; Michael Machtinger, deputy assistant director for the FBI&#39;s cyber division, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>&#34;There&#39;s a thought among the public that if you don&#39;t work in a sensitive area that the PRC might be interested in for its traditional espionage activities, then you are safe, they will not target you,&#34; he said, during a Thursday interview with <i>The Register</i>. &#34;As we have seen from Salt Typhoon, this is no longer an assumption that anyone can afford to make.&#34;</p>

    

<p>The Beijing-backed spying campaign began at least in 2019 but wasn&#39;t <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/salt_typhoon_hacked_multiple_telecom/">uncovered by US authorities</a> until last fall. On Wednesday, US law enforcement and intelligence agencies along with those from 12 other countries warned the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/28/china_salt_typhoon_alert/">ongoing espionage activity</a> expanded far beyond <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/06/charter_consolidated_windstream_salt_typhoon/">nine American telcos</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/salt_typhoon_us_govt_networks/">government networks</a>. According to Machtinger, at least 80 countries were hit by the digital intrusions.</p>

        


        

<p>Around 200 American organizations were compromised by the espionage activity, Machtinger said, including the previously disclosed telecommunications firms such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/30/att_verizon_confirm_salt_typhoon_breach/">Verizon and AT&amp;T</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#39;s joint security alert also pointed the allies&#39; collective finger at three China-based entities affiliated with Salt Typhoon: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/17/fcc_telcos_calea/">Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology</a>, Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology, and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology. These companies, and likely others, provide cyber products and services to China&#39;s Ministry of State Security and People&#39;s Liberation Army, the governments said.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What the PRC is doing through these proxy actors is really reckless and unbounded, in a way that is significantly outside of the norms of what we see in the espionage space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;This is one of the most consequential cyber espionage breaches that we&#39;ve ever seen in the United States,&#34; Machtinger said.</p>
<p>&#34;What this really underscores is that what the PRC is doing through these proxy actors is really reckless and unbounded, in a way that is significantly outside of the norms of what we see in the espionage space,&#34; he added. &#34;And that should really set off alarm bells for us — not only in the United States. The scale of indiscriminate targeting is unlike what we&#39;ve seen in the past.&#34;</p>

        

<p>This indiscriminate targeting, as the FBI and White House security officials have previously noted, allowed Beijing’s snoops to geo-locate millions of mobile phone users, monitor their internet traffic, and, in some cases, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/09/white_house_salt_typhoon/">record their phone calls</a>. Victims <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/25/china_hacked_gop_emails/">reportedly</a> included President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</p>
<p>Machtinger declined to confirm whether Trump and Vance were among those surveilled, but did say that victims included more than 100 current and former presidential administration officials.</p>
<p>&#34;As we look at the impact on the different sets of victims,&#34; he said, Salt Typhoon collected &#34;bulk information from millions of Americans.&#34;</p>

        

<p>For the more targeted group of individuals, &#34;most of whom are very high-profile, current and former presidential administration officials, and campaign appointees from both major political parties,&#34; the data collection went much deeper, Machtinger added. &#34;Down to intercepting actual content.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to Salt Typhoon, the feds over the past year have issued warnings about other Chinese cyber operations. These include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/30/fbi_china_volt/">Volt Typhoon intruders</a>, who infected hundreds of outdated routers to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/31/volt_typhoon_botnet/">build a botnet</a> and break into US critical infrastructure facilities. The Beijing-backed crew, we would later learn, was prepositioning itself and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/07/us_chinas_volt_typhoon_attacks/">readying destructive cyberattacks</a>.</p>
<p>Another China-linked crew, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/06/fbi_china_pays_75k_per/">Silk Typhoon</a> has spent more than a decade compromising IT and cloud providers to steal sensitive data from their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/05/china_silk_typhoon_update/">government, technology</a>, education, and legal and professional services customers.</p>
<p>China is not the only source of threats, Machtinger noted. Russia, Iran, North Korea, plus along with home-grown and international cybercriminals and ransomware crooks, assault computers and networks of both individuals and organizations, every day.</p>
<p>&#34;These actors are going to continue their efforts, and they&#39;re going to get more sophisticated,&#34; Machtinger said. &#34;We need to make sure that we, a nation, are taking cybersecurity seriously, updating systems, removing end-of-life devices, and making it as hard and costly as possible for the myriad of actors that are out there to successfully compromise.&#34; ®</p>
