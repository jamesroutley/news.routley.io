    <h1>Show HN: All desktop software calculators are wrong, so I had to build my own</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>A new calculator software cannot really bring attention (<a href="https://chachatelier.fr/chalk/" rel="nofollow">https://chachatelier.fr/chalk/</a>)<p>However, I wrote a full article explaining why I had to build something &#34;new&#34; that does not behave like usual desktop calculator softwares :</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://chachatelier.fr/chalk/article/chalk.html" rel="nofollow">https://chachatelier.fr/chalk/article/chalk.html</a>&gt;</p><p>TL;DR
All &#34;small&#34; calculator softwares I know share the same design flaws. And the GUI is not the only stumbling block in their poor efficiency. Handling correctly numerical approximations - expected or not - is crucial to trust the results. It is usually not done in lightweight tools. It should. So I prove that if I could do it, OS manufacturers could as well.</p></div></div>
