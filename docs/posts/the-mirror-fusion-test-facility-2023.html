            <p>A decade-long effort to build a machine to unlock the promise of nuclear fusion fell victim to budget constraints and competing science, and was shut down the day it was dedicated. It was never turned on.</p>

After final diagnostic tests, the &#34;Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B&#34; (MFTF-B) completion was celebrated, and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23726030-fiscal_year_1987_department_of_energy_au?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com#document/p11/a2233498">a letter</a> from John Herrington, Ronald Regan&#39;s Secretary of Energy was presented to program director T. Kenneth Fowler extending his congratulations on a job well done. </p><p>On the very same day after nearly a decade of development and nearly a billion dollars* of funding, the project was shut down, the massive machine having never been turned on.</p><p>&#34;I want all of you to know how much I regret the fact that, just as you complete this remarkable new facility, the budget pressures dictate that we must put it into standby and not operate it as you might have hoped. This is frustrating, and perhaps not the best use of our national talent and resources, but we must bring the deficit under control,&#34; wrote Herrington in the letter to Fowler.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/5795112854_e1dc61ba81.jpg" width="1192" height="900" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/5795112854_e1dc61ba81.jpg 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/5795112854_e1dc61ba81.jpg 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/5795112854_e1dc61ba81.jpg 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/5795119904_18d88d585d-1.jpg" width="2000" height="2685" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/5795119904_18d88d585d-1.jpg 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/5795119904_18d88d585d-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/5795119904_18d88d585d-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/5795119904_18d88d585d-1.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption>Photos of the 400-ton &#34;yin-yang&#34; magnet mirrors used in the MFTF-B.

Thirty miles of copper and niobium-titanium wire were wound over the course of a year to make the magnet’s conductor. The magnet was capable of generating magnetic fields 150,000 times that of Earth’s that could contain the 500-million Kelvin degree plasma generated by the fusion device.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/5794563833_fee376ced1.jpg" alt="A photo of the massive building sized magnet in the MFTF-B under construction.

Kenneth Fowler’s 1997 book, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fusion_Quest.html?id=odPaAAAAMAAJ&amp;ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">The Fusion Quest</a>”. Fowler continued, “Today, irresistibly drawn to the challenge of bringing fusion energy down to Earth from the stars, scientists tempt Zeus still.” The promise of mastering this elemental force is a clean, safe and near limitless energy source, which could literally save the planet. </p><p>While the more widely known process of nuclear fission has been producing energy at commercial scale in power plants since the 1950’s, harnessing nuclear fusion – which Fowler’s poetic description accurately captures as the same reaction taking place in the heart of the Sun – has been the subject of an international race for decades. </p><p>Only in December of 2022 did scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announce that they had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/fusion-energy-biden-climate/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">achieved the first recorded</a> fusion reaction with a net energy gain – meaning that it released more energy than was put in, which was a crucial milestone for the whole field, though it could be decades before this is put into practical use.</p><p>The energy crisis of the 1970s motivated the U.S. government to throw lots of money at alternative energy sources, and fusion was one of the big areas of interest. </p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsnuclear-fusion-reactions?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com#:~:text=Nuclear%20Fusion%20reactions%20power%20the,The%20leftover%20mass%20becomes%20energy.">Department of Energy</a>, the basic principle of nuclear fusion is the fusion of two lighter nuclei (such as the commonly used combo of deuterium and tritium) to form a heavier one (helium) which releases energy (and subatomic particles, such as neutrons). To do this, super-hot plasma is created in a vacuum to create the fusion reaction, and either lasers or powerful magnets are used to control and contain the plasma. </p><p>During this period of frenzied investment in the 70’s, two major directions for fusion research emerged: the torus or donut shaped “Tokamak” design utilized by Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and MFTF-B&#39;s “magnetic mirror” based approach, with a linear vessel housing the superheated plasma bouncing the plasma off two opposing magnetic “mirrors” at either end of the chamber.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/Princeton_Large_Torus_1975-1.jpg" alt="A photo of a tokamak fusion reactor." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1438" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/Princeton_Large_Torus_1975-1.jpg 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/Princeton_Large_Torus_1975-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/Princeton_Large_Torus_1975-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/Princeton_Large_Torus_1975-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>1975 photo of the Princeton Large Torus at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, which is an example of a &#34;tokamak&#34; fusion reactor design.

The fact that other major labs were going all in on the tokamak approach, left an opening for hedging the big fusion bet on this potential alternate path. The question of whether there was enough sound evidence to ramp up to the scale of the MFTF-B was subject to debate at the time, and the final decision seemed to partly come down to ideology and gut instinct. </p><p>In a really thorough 1987 Science magazine <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.238.4824.152?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">story on the MFTF-B</a> Edwin Kintner, who was the associate director of the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Research at the time said as much. Looking back on the decision to go all in on the MFTF-B, Kintner is quoted as saying “Everybody was concentrating on tokamaks. I thought it was necessary for these tokamak guys to have to look over their shoulders.” </p><p>In the same article, MFTF-B program director Fowler is quoted as saying, “You could debate the decision, but it wasn’t illogical. Building big machines is a mixture of lead times, resources, prudence and gambling.”</p><hr/><p><em>Below: &#34;Mirror Fusion Test Facility magnet system— Final design report. Sept. 3, 1980.

Lawmakers tried to fight for extra funds to throw a lifeline to the program or to salvage parts of the project to perform some science in a more limited scope. The money and time spent on the project was weighing heavy in the comments recorded in hearings held by the House Subcommittee on Energy Research and Production in February of 1986.   </p><p>Congressman Fortney (&#34;Pete&#34;) Stark of California <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23726030-fiscal_year_1987_department_of_energy_au?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com#document/p65">made a particularly impassioned plea</a> to extend the life of the project. Citing the Reagan Administration&#39;s proposed budget, Stark wrote &#34;This proposal would mothball the just-completed and never-used Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B (MFTF-B) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.&#34; Stark continued, &#34;A lot of hard work and money has been invested in the world&#39;s largest superconducting, tandem mirror fusion experiment. For close to 8 years some of the finest scientists and engineers in America have dedicated their time and energy to the project. $350 million dollars have been invested in MFTF-B.&#34;</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/The_Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility_During_Construction.jpg" alt="A crew stands before the partially installed magnet as part of the MFTF-B." loading="lazy" width="800" height="587" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/The_Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility_During_Construction.jpg 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/03/The_Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility_During_Construction.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The MFTF-B under construction in 1983.
