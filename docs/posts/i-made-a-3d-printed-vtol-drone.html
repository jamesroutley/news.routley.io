I had only </span><a href="https://www.tsungxu.com/p/first-vtol-design-build-and-flight" rel="">built and flown one VTOL before</a><span>. My CAD skills were restricted to extrusions of basic sketches. My Bambu A1 3D printer was only one month old, and I had never tried printing foaming PLA. I had never used any aerodynamic modeling tools to simulate lift-to-drag ratios or stability curves like Cm-alpha.</span></p><p>This video edit ended up shorter than I planned. Being my first Youtube video with significant post production effort, I underestimated the work required to make a longer in-depth video with voiceover, edited footage, etc.</p><p>Because of that, I did not discuss dozens of project challenges like how I chose the design parameters, learnt airframe CAD design, sourced components, improved foaming PLA print quality, in-depth power loss troubleshooting, and many more challenges this project faced.</p><p>If you want more details on my design and build process, let me know!</p><p><em><span>P.S.

Today, you just need the right toolchainâ€¦</em></p></blockquote><p>Incredibly humbling! </p></div></div></div>
