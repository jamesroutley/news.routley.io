<p>In a world where millions of people carry a 1990s-grade supercomputer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">in their pockets</a>, it&#39;s fun to revisit tech from a time when a 1 megahertz machine on a desktop represented a significant leap forward. Recently, a collector named Brian Green <a href="https://twitter.com/particlesbbs/status/1634214071791747072?s=20">showed off his vintage computer collection</a> on Twitter, and we thought it would be fun to ask him about why and how he set up his at-home computer lab.</p>

<p>By day, Green works as a senior systems engineer based in Arkansas. But in his off hours, &#34;Ice Breaker&#34; (as he&#39;s often known online) focuses his passion on a vintage computer collection that he has been building for decades—and a bulletin board system (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/my-secret-life-as-an-11-year-old-bbs-sysop/">BBS</a>) called &#34;Particles&#34; he has been running since 1992.</p>
<p>Green&#39;s interest in computers dates back to 1980, when he first used an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/i-pulled-an-apple-ii-plus-out-of-my-parents-attic-now-what/">Apple II+</a> at elementary school. &#34;My older sister brought home a printout from a BASIC program she was working on, and I was fascinated that you could tell a computer what to do using something that resembled English,&#34; recalls Green. &#34;Once I realized you could code games, I was hooked.&#34;</p>

<p>Despite his early encounters with the Apple II, 1982&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/three-decades-of-the-commodore-64/">Commodore 64</a> truly won his heart. As his first computer with a disk drive, it came at a dear price for a kid, so he spent an entire summer saving money from his paper route to buy one. &#34;Most of my friends had one at the time,&#34; he says.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Today, Green&#39;s vintage computer collection spans a wide range of machines, with the rarest one being a <a href="https://oldcomputers.net/b128.html">Commodore B128-80</a> from 1982. As part of the failed Commodore B Series of computers, the model barely made it out of the door before the plug was pulled, according to Green. &#34;Of the B-Series, this one is the most common, with about 10,000 made,&#34; says Green. &#34;Whereas other models had as few as just a few hundred.&#34;</p>
<p>We asked him which computer was the hardest to track down, and he pointed to the ill-fated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_III">Apple III</a>, which Apple launched in 1980 as a business-capable follow-up of its more famous prequel: &#34;I probably hunted for an Apple III the longest. Most computers are obtainable if you&#39;re willing to spend the money on eBay, but that&#39;s not as fun as picking something up at a show or a flea market. I found a working Apple III at the last <a href="https://vcfmw.org/">Vintage Computer Festival Midwest</a> for a good price and have it displayed proudly.&#34;</p>

<p>From these pictures, it&#39;s clear that Green&#39;s home computer lab is an exercise in weapons-grade tech nostalgia. His goal is to re-create the computing experience of the 1980s, when he grew up reading magazines like Family Computing.</p>
<p>&#34;Every month, there was a new computer being announced or reviewed,&#34; he says. &#34;I was a kid then and couldn&#39;t afford any of these computers, but I was always fascinated by all the different hardware. I wanted to try them all! I try to use as much &#39;period correct&#39; hardware as I can, though there is a smattering of newer hardware in these machines, too.&#34;</p>
