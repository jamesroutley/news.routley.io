<hr/>

<p>About two months ago, I wound down my startup and started a job
search. After ~15 companies and ~100 conversations with recruiters and
interviewers, I am pretty happy to have found a great team at Jane
Street working on agents. I’ll be in the NYC area and quite busy with
onboarding/relocation for the first few months of 2026, but please reach
out!</p>
<p>This is by far the most exhaustive – and exhausting – interview
process I’ve done, so I wanted to go over some of the more surprising
things that happened.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>My next job would ideally be an staff-level role at the cutting edge
of AI developments. Criteria for the job included AI work, company
culture, team fit, talent density, and comp. Boston/Remote would be
preferable but NYC okay if the comp difference with Boston was large
enough.</p>
<p>I started casually asking around mid-October, and in <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/cartesian_tutor_turndown/">early November I made the
decision to switch full time to job-hunting</a>. Interviewing really
kicked into high gear during November; during the 3.5 weeks leading up
to Thanksgiving, I averaged 4 interviews a day. I’d been somewhat afraid
that my coding muscles had atrophied after 6 months of Claude Code, but
it all came back quite quickly at this pace of interviewing. Offers
rolled in starting around Thanksgiving, with the last offer coming in
mid-December.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.moderndescartes.com/static/interview_timeline.png" title="Interview timeline"/></p>
<p>15 companies was admittedly somewhat insane. In my defense, I was
essentially running two job searches at once – Boston/remote-friendly,
and NYC-area – and didn’t expect to get to onsites for so many
companies!</p>
<h2 id="sf-nyc-boston-for-ai">SF &gt; NYC &gt;&gt; Boston for AI</h2>
<p>My search criteria led to a variety of companies building
“Agents/Claude Code for X”, where X = SRE, customer service, trading,
scientific research, and more. I also threw in a frontier lab and some
startups for flavor. The vast majority of these jobs were in SF/Bay
Area, with the remainder in NYC. I couldn’t find anything <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal">Tier 2/3</a>
AI + staff level in the Boston area – even Google came up empty, and I
ended up talking with some of their AI teams in NYC. Meta had no
response; Amazon in Boston had a position, but they took 2 months to get
back to me after referral. I eventually found a handful of
remote-friendly companies that I would have enjoyed working at, but
after all the offers came in, it wasn’t even close. I’d anticipated a
difficult conversation with my wife about whether we should uproot our
family, but she needed no convincing.</p>
<h2 id="networking-is-king">Networking is king</h2>
<p>I primarily worked with the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse
Center</a> to match with companies, but also found my own way to a
number of other companies I found interesting. Throughout my search, I
received a number of third party recruiters, and engaged with two or
three of them, but found them useless - or even worse than useless, as
they blindly resume-stuffed companies where I would later network my way
in. In this regard, not much has changed compared to pre-AI: walking
through the front door is for chumps, and third-party recruiter spam
sucks.</p>
<p>While networking, I found that my blog had a pretty significant
reach. I got many inbound solicitations, and when reaching out and/or
during the interviews, I found that maybe 5% of my interviewers already
knew of me due to the blog. Pretty insane to think about, actually.</p>
<h2 id="finance-vs-tech">Finance vs tech</h2>
<p>A significant number of my interviews this time were with quant
trading firms this time - Jane Street, Jump, and Two Sigma. HRT should
have made the list too, but I was so overwhelmed with interviews in
November that I never got around to starting that process.</p>
<p>This switchup reflects a number of different trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t see them as unethically as I did 10-15 years ago, and tech
has simultaneously gotten far more unethical in the past 5-10
years.</li>
<li>Tech has an increasingly corporate feel to it, which doesn’t really
suit me anymore.</li>
<li>Tech is in the middle of cutting costs by devaluing talent. Only a
small number of scale-ups (Databricks, Anthropic, OpenAI) are willing to
actually compete for talent; the rest are happy to prey on the huddled,
laid-off masses. Finance, on the other hand, has always valued talent,
because trading is a zero-sum game<span>\(^†\)</span> and small edges in talent directly
affect profitability.</li>
<li>Finance is shifting from trader-dominated to systems-dominated. A
small handful of quant trading firms are capable of seeing engineers as
profit centers rather than cost centers, and those firms are
disproportionately growing in profits compared to the <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/p/pod-shop/">pod-shop</a> model.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>\(^†\)</span> My understanding here is that
while trading is a mostly zero-sum game for the buyer and seller, more
accurate pricing information is the positive externality of trading
activity.</p>
<h2 id="ai-hasnt-changed-the-interview-process">AI hasn’t changed the
interview process</h2>
<p>All of my interviews were video-on or in-person, with plenty of
talking through the code/design as I worked through the problem. There
were never any suspicions of cheating, nor can I really imagine how a
cheater would be able to sneak by an attentive interviewer. The set of
interview questions I got had changed in composition - a lot more
project deep dives, a lot more career deep dives, a lot <em>fewer</em>
“tell me about a time” interviews. This probably reflects my leveling
more than it reflects any changes due to AI. Coding/DS/ML questions were
basically what I expected them to be.</p>
<p>It probably helps that I have a blog and lots of breadcrumbs all over
the internet - zero chance of me being a <a href="https://www.iddataweb.com/shadow-workers/">North Korean
spy</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote up some extended notes on the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/ml_eng_interviewing">ML engineer interview loop</a> based
on my experiences.</p>
<h2 id="culture-and-two-way-interviews">Culture and two-way
interviews</h2>
<p>Throughout all of the interviews, I was surprised at how clearly each
company’s culture showed through their processes. For each of my
negative experiences, I thought that perhaps it was a lazy recruiter or
bad interviewer, but as I talked with each company’s engineers about
company culture, it became pretty obvious that the interview experience
was just the tip of a culture iceberg. Recruiters often went above and
beyond, but were constrained by their bad systems.</p>
<p>One company consistently took a week to even decide whether to move
to the next stage, and then later turned out to have various
bureaucratic hurdles around team matching, with one part of the company
not accepting other parts’ interview results, or headcount being slotted
by precise levels.</p>
<p>Another company couldn’t set up calendar invites or zoom links
properly, interview scheduling dragged on for weeks, and I got no
information on, e.g. who I was talking to or even what sort of interview
it would be. My onsite interviews opened with “So, uh, what kind of
conversation is this?” or “When is my lunch break? Oh, you’re my lunch
break conversation?” or in one case, an interviewer standing outside the
room for 15 minutes while my interview mosied along to the hour mark,
because a nonstandard 45-minute interview had been scheduled without any
callout. As I chatted with the engineers, it became clear that the
company itself ran this way, with an environment that selected for
people who could navigate the lack of structure.</p>
<p>On the positive side: some companies really impressed me with the
level of preparation and detail in their interviews, and the strength of
the interviewers who I chatted with. I was happy whenever my first or
second call was directly with the hiring manager, and especially happy
when they had read my blog and were excited to chat about places I could
be a good fit at the company. I’ll make a shout out to Runway, who did
all of these things and also had some of the sanest, most functional
relationships between product and research orgs that I’d ever seen.</p>
<p>Jane Street, of course, impressed me in many ways: first, with the
most thoroughly rigorous interview process and smartest interviewers by
far; second, with the highest quality <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/ml_eng_interviewing#data-modeling">data modeling
problems</a> by far; and third, by being incredibly flexible and
responsive to my asks.</p>
<h2 id="overall-thoughts">Overall thoughts</h2>
<p>The job market today is absolutely wild. The set of job offers I got
spanned nearly an order of magnitude in total compensation. Everyone
says that they want AI talent, but I found that only some companies are
willing to compete for it.</p>
<p>The high cost of living in cities has always driven a strong
selection pressure for hungry/desperate/ambitious people (whatever you
want to call this component of personality), which dovetails with this
explosive growth in demand for talent. I foresee a lot of migration back
to a small number of hubs - mostly SF, Bay Area, NYC, and London. I’m a
bit sad that Boston isn’t on this list, but at the same time - excited
to meet friends, both old and new, in NYC.</p>
<p>If you’re in the area - let me know! I’ll probably be settled in and
ready to hang out in March or April as the weather improves.</p>
