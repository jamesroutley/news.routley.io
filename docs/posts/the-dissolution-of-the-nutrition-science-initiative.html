    <h1>The Dissolution of the Nutrition Science Initiative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Today, December 31, 2021, marks the official dissolution of the Nutrition Science Initiative (NuSI.org). </strong> </p>



<p>Founded in 2011 with support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, the Nutrition Science Initiative funded four projects — three in full and one in part — on the relationship between nutrition, obesity and metabolic diseases. Three of these studies were randomized clinical trials; the fourth was a non-randomized pilot trial. All four resulted in primary publications in top-tier journals (two in <em>JAMA</em> and one each in <em>AJCN</em> and <em>BMJ</em>), all with significant media attention. Three of these papers are now designated “highly cited papers” by the Clarivate <em>Web of Science</em>.  These four trials also spawned two dozen ancillary studies, secondary analyses and commentaries, and those, too, generated a fair share of attention from the media. The latest of these  — <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/150996/pdf">on the effect of dietary sugar on hepatic de novo lipogenesis in pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</a> – was published just two weeks ago in <em>The Journal of Clinical Investigation.</em>  </p>



<p>We’d like to think that NuSI’s research, funding, and general pot-stirring helped move the needle, not just on nutrition research in obesity and metabolic disease but on the thinking about etiology and dietary means of treatment and prevention. </p>



<p>We’ll leave it to the
historians to determine whether and to what degree that’s the case.</p>



<p>For those interested in the four
NuSI studies, references and summaries are below, listed in order of the very
first publication date.  <strong></strong></p>

<p>Studies in
free-living individuals are crucial to determine the effectiveness of dietary
strategies to prevent or treat obesity and related metabolic conditions under
real-world conditions. Such studies can provide tests of hypotheses about the
cause of these disorders; however rigorous testing of these hypotheses requires
greater control over the diets of study subjects than free-living studies
permit. In practical terms, this means housing study participants in a facility
where their diet is precisely defined, their food intake measured accurately,
and their physical activity better controlled and monitored.</p>



<p>As a first step
toward a rigorous test of the energy balance hypothesis of obesity – that foods
influence fat accumulation only through the amount, but not type, of calories
consumed – NuSI organized and funded a consortium of investigators to conduct a
small preliminary or “pilot” study using participants confined to metabolic
wards. The consortium researchers deemed it unlikely that they could reliably
detect meaningful changes in body weight or fat content in an 8-week trial and
instead chose to use energy expenditure as the primary outcome of the study.</p>



<p>To test the
question of whether the amount or type of calories consumed is critical,
participants were fed an equal number of calories from diets differing
dramatically in fat and carbohydrate content. In addition to generating useful
preliminary data that might address the hypothesis and help determine the
number of subjects required for a full-scale study, the goals of this pilot
study were operational and methodological: optimize the logistics required for
a multi-site study, including, importantly, the assessment and fine-tuning of
the precision and sensitivity of techniques for measuring energy expenditure.</p>



<p>A total of 17 male participants, overweight or obese, were housed in metabolic wards at four study sites. For 4 weeks they were fed a basal diet based on a standard American diet (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein by calories) providing a number of calories intended to maintain them in energy balance as reflected by a stable body weight. Participants were then switched to a “ketogenic” diet of identical caloric content, but radically different macronutrient composition (5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, and 15% protein by calories). Energy expenditure was measured two ways: (i) by respirometry in which participants were housed in small room-sized metabolic chambers for two consecutive days each week throughout the study, and (ii) over the last 2 weeks of each diet period, by a technique known as doubly labeled water that does not require chamber confinement.</p>



<p>If, according to the energy balance hypothesis, fat accumulation depended only on the amount of available energy in the foods consumed – if a calorie of carbohydrate is equally fattening as a calorie of fat – no difference would be expected in energy expenditure under the two diet conditions. However, because the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet would minimize secretion of insulin, a hormone that promotes the synthesis and storage of fat, an alternative hypothesis (known as the <em>carbohydrate-insulin model</em> or the <em>hormonal/regulatory model</em> of obesity) predicts that energy expenditure will increase during the ketogenic diet period as stored fat is mobilized from stored body fat and burned for fuel along with fat from the diet.</p>



<p>The results showed that energy expenditure measured in the metabolic chambers increased transiently during the first two weeks after the switch to the ketogenic diet by 60 to 100 kcal/day, depending on how expenditures were calculated relative to body weight or composition. As measured by doubly labeled water, energy expenditure increased during the last two weeks of the ketogenic diet period by 150 kcal/day, an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the energy balance, calorie-is-a-calorie perspective.</p>



<p>Interpretation of
the results is confounded by limitations of this small pilot study:</p>



<ul><li>Because the order in which diets were fed to participants were not randomized, no causal inference can be made about the role of diet composition as a cause of any change in energy expenditure. Strictly speaking, the results can be interpreted only in terms of before and after the diet switch and not necessarily because of the switch.</li><li>Although the study plan was to have subjects in energy balance during the end of the four-week basal diet period, this was not achieved. The subjects lost weight throughout the study. This unintentional weight loss complicates interpretation of the magnitude of the increase in energy expenditure because weight loss is typically associated with reduced expenditures, which could mitigate any increase caused by the diet switch.</li></ul>



<p>Despite these limitations, the results suggest that a well-controlled, full-scale study using appropriate methodologies is warranted to definitively address the question of whether fat accumulation is influenced by the macronutrient composition of the diet or only by the available energy content of the foods consumed.</p>

<p><strong>II. DIETFITS Trial</strong></p>

<p>This trial was
prompted by an earlier studyled by Christopher Gardner (“The A
to Z Study”), which compared four diets varying in macronutrient (fat and
carbohydrate) content and found that participants assigned the diet that
resulted in the lowest carbohydrate and highest fat intake lost the most
weight.</p>



<p>The Diet
Intervention Examining the Factors Interacting with Treatment Success<strong> (</strong>DIETFITS)
trial extended this work by comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate and
low-fat diets on body weight when both diets restrict processed foods and
sugars. By supplementing a major grant from the National Institutes of Health,
NuSI funding for the DIETFITS trial substantially increased the number of study
participants and helped support ancillary studies using study participants and
secondary analyses based on trial data.</p>



<p>Understanding the
role of diet composition in human health and disease over periods of time
longer than a few months requires that participants be “free-living;” that they
select and eat their own food, live in their own homes, and go about their
lives as usual. The longer the study lasts and the greater the number of
participants, the more researchers can learn about the health risks and
effectiveness of a diet in the “real world,” but the less control they retain
over what and how much the participants actually eat.</p>



<p>Participants in
the DIETFITS trial were free-living. Consequently, the researchers implemented
an intensive program of counseling and monitoring to optimize participant
retention and adherence to assigned diets throughout the year-long trial.
Nearly 80% of those enrolled completed the 12-month trial, which is notable for
a long-term study in free-living participants.</p>



<p>Over a 2-year period, 609 participants in five cohorts were enrolled in the trial and were randomized to one of the two diets. Participants were given no explicit instructions to reduce calorie intake, but were instructed to eat “healthy” diets, which, among other features, maximized vegetable intake, minimized intake of added sugars and refined flours, and focused on minimally processed foods that were prepared at home. The two groups prescribed the “healthy low-fat“or “healthy low-carbohydrate” diets showed significant differences in their carbohydrate and fat intakes. However, despite these differences, the low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet groups lost similar amounts of body weight during the trial.</p>



<p>This result of the DIETFITS trial differed from that of the A to Z Study in which participants eating the low-carbohydrate diet lost more than twice the weight as those consuming the low-fat diet, a discrepancy that may be attributed to differences in the composition of the diets in the two studies. The differences between total carbohydrate and fat intake were much greater in the A to Z Study than they were in the DIETFITS trial perhaps because in the DIETFITS trial, unlike the A to Z Study, subjects in both groups were counseled to avoid added sugar and refined flour. Participants consuming the low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets in both studies reduced calorie intake to the same extent. Additional research is needed to determine whether there is a threshold of dietary carbohydrate and/or fat content that results in weight loss greater than would be predicted from a reduction in calorie intake alone.</p>

<p><strong>III. Framingham State Food Study</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Principal Investigators: David Ludwig and Cara
Ebbeling (Boston Children’s Hospital; Harvard Medical School)</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Ebbeling,
C. B., Feldman, H. A., Klein, G. L., Wong, J. M. W., Bielak, L., Steltz, S. K.,
Luoto, P. K., Wolfe, R. R., Wong, W. W., &amp; Ludwig, D. S. (2018). Effects of
a low carbohydrate diet on energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance:
Randomized trial. <em>BMJ</em>, k4583. </strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k4583"><strong>https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k4583</strong></a><strong></strong></p>



<p>Weight loss is the first challenge in treating obesity. The second challenge is maintaining that loss. Only sustained weight reduction can prevent the negative health consequences associated with obesity. However, maintaining significant weight loss indefinitely is notoriously difficult, making the development of strategies that facilitate maintenance of a reduced body weight critical for the effective long-term treatment of obesity.</p>



<p>An earlier study, led by Drs. David Ludwig and Cara Ebbeling, of 24 subjects suggested that eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet over a 30-day period increased energy expenditure after weight loss more than did eating a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. This finding challenged the conventional thinking that obesity is an energy balance disorder in which the amount of available calories in the foods consumed, independent of the source of those calories (i.e., carbohydrates and fat), is the critical factor in fat accumulation.</p>



<p>NuSI funded the Framingham State Food Study, or (FS)<sup>2</sup>, a larger, longer, and more robust trial, to more rigorously address the question of whether the amount or type of calories eaten is the determining factor for preventing fat accumulation after weight reduction.</p>



<p>(FS)<sup>2 </sup>was
a “feeding study,” meaning that the researchers supplied participants with all
of their food throughout the study in order to control the amount and
composition of food eaten and monitor the amount consumed. In the first phase
of the trial, the total food intake (carbohydrates, fats, and protein) of these
overweight and obese participants was restricted to produce, on average, a 12%
loss in body weight. At the start of the second phase of the study, the 164
participants who achieved this weight loss goal were randomly assigned to
either a low-, moderate-, or high-carbohydrate diet containing (by calories)
20% protein and, respectively, either 20% carbohydrate and 60% fat, 40%
carbohydrate and 40% fat, or 60% carbohydrate and 20% fat. For the next 20
weeks, the number of calories of each diet provided to each participant was
adjusted to maintain their reduced body weight.</p>



<p>Total daily
energy expenditure, the primary outcome for the trial, was measured before and
after participants were randomly assigned to the different diets. If only the
amount of calories consumed was important for weight maintenance, then energy
expenditure should be the same for all three groups. This was not the case.
Instead, energy expenditure increased to a greater extent in participants
eating the low- or moderate-carbohydrate diets compared with those consuming
the high-carbohydrate diet. Those eating the low-carbohydrate diet showed the
largest increase.</p>



<p>Limiting calorie
intake and increasing expenditure through physical activity is the standard
prescription for both losing weight and preventing weight gain. However, weight
loss due to restriction of calorie intake typically results in a decrease in
total bodily energy expenditure. This drop in expenditure restrains continuing
weight loss and may contribute to weight regain unless calorie intake is even
further restricted. Maintaining energy expenditure during weight loss, or
increasing it after weight reduction, as observed in the (FS)<sup>2</sup> trial
in association with the lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat diets, would therefore
be expected to facilitate further weight loss and prevent weight regain.</p>



<p>The results also suggest that the type or mix of calories (i.e., carbohydrate or fat) is a critical factor for maintaining a healthy body weight. These findings, while not supportive of an energy balance model of obesity, are consistent with an alternative hypothesis that emphasizes the different effects of carbohydrates and fats on the hormonal regulation of fat accumulation (known as the <em>carbohydrate-insulin model</em> or the <em>hormonal/regulatory model</em> of obesity).</p>

<p>Nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by an excess of fat in the liver, is
the most common form of liver disease.  NAFLD can progress to a more
serious inflammatory condition, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can
lead to liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and death. NAFLD also
increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, liver cancer, and cardiovascular
disease. NAFLD is typically associated with obesity, but also develops in lean
individuals, who appear to have a poorer prognosis than those who are obese.</p>



<p>NAFLD is a global
problem, affecting about 20% of the world’s population. In the US, 64 million
people have NAFLD according to recent estimates.  This includes about 7
million children, which is particularly troubling as the likelihood that NAFLD
will progress to NASH increases with time.</p>



<p>There is
currently no approved drug treatment for NAFLD. Liver transplant is an
option for those with more advanced disease, but with the prevalence and
incidence of NAFLD and NASH growing rapidly, the demand for transplantable
livers will easily overwhelm the limited supply. In short, NAFLD represents a
staggering medical and public health challenge, made worse by the fact that few
people have even heard of it.</p>



<p>With no
established pharmaceutical solution and the impracticality of liver transplant
for such a prevalent disease, treatment guidelines for NAFLD emphasize
lifestyle modifications for weight loss, including exercise and diet. However,
no consensus exists on what type of diet would be best to prevent or reverse
NAFLD.</p>



<p>In this context,
NuSI convened two meetings of leading physicians and researchers with interest
and expertise in adult and pediatric NAFLD to discuss and design possible
studies to identify potential dietary triggers and treatment of the disease. In
particular, metabolic and epidemiologic data implicated dietary sugar in the
occurrence and progression of NAFLD, but no controlled clinical trial data
existed to support an evidence-based recommendation for patients to limit sugar
intake.</p>



<p>As a result, with
an eye toward impacting clinical practice, the group recommended conducting a
preliminary, but well-controlled trial on the effects of reducing sugar intake
in children. NuSI responded by funding a study led by Drs. Jeffrey Schwimmer
and Miriam Vos that examined the effect of a diet low in free sugars (i.e., low
in sugar or high fructose corn syrup, either added to food and beverages or
from fruit juices) on liver fat content in children with NAFLD.</p>



<p>A total of 40 boys, 11 – 16 years old, with diagnosed and active NAFLD were randomly assigned to either a low free sugar diet (intervention diet) group or a usual diet group for 8 weeks. Before the intervention diet was instituted, study staff replaced all sugars or sugar-containing products in the intervention group’s households with no or low-sugar substitutes. For the duration of the study, families of the participants in the intervention group were then provided with all their food or food ingredients, tailored to their preferences and the participant’s habitual diet, but containing less than 3% free sugars. In addition to instructing participants in the intervention group to avoid sugar-containing foods and beverages, study staff contacted their families twice-weekly to assess satisfaction with the diet and address dietary issues regarding special events and holidays. Families of participants in the usual diet group were instructed to eat their usual diet and were given a weekly stipend with which to purchase food and beverages of their choice.</p>



<p>Liver fat content
of participants was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the
beginning and end of the 8-week trial. Liver fat content decreased more and was
significantly lower after 8 weeks in the diet intervention group compared with
the usual diet group.  These effects of the low free-sugar diet were
observed after controlling for differences in body weight or body mass index
(BMI) between the two groups, suggesting that the reduction in sugar intake,
not weight or weight loss, was primarily responsible for the improvement in
liver fat content. Blood concentration of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), a
marker for liver function indicative of the degree of damage associated with
NAFLD and NASH, also improved more in the diet intervention group.</p>



<p>These findings
suggest that limiting sugar intake can be beneficial for children with NAFLD
and therefore constitute evidence implicating excessive intake of sugars in the
etiology of NAFLD. However, additional research is needed to establish a causal
role for dietary sugars in NAFLD and to buttress a strategy of limiting intake
of sugars in its prevention and treatment. In particular, it will be important
to conduct longer duration controlled trials in a larger and more diverse
population of patients, including with participants of both genders and a range
of ethnicities, and under more realistic conditions in which participants and
their families are responsible for selecting their own diets.</p>
