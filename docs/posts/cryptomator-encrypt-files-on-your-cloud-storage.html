        <h2>Take the security of your data into your own hands</h2>
        <p>Cryptomator is a simple tool for digital self-defense. It allows you to protect your cloud data by yourself and independently.</p>
        <div>
          
          <p><span>Most cloud providers encrypt data only during transmission or they keep the keys for decryption for themselves. These keys can be stolen, copied, or misused. Thanks to Cryptomator, only you have the key to your data in your hand.</span>
        </p></div>
        <div>
          
          <p><span>Cryptomator allows you to access your files from all your devices. It&#39;s easy to use and integrates seamlessly between your data and the cloud.</span>

        <h2>How does Cryptomator protect your data?</h2>
        <p>Cryptomator&#39;s technology meets the latest standards and encrypts both files and filenames with AES and 256 bit key length.</p>
        <div>
          
          <p><span>To start with Cryptomator, you assign a password for a folder - we call it a vault - within your cloud. That is all. No complicated key creation, no registration, no configuration!</span>
        </p></div>
        <div>
          
          <p><span>To access the vault, simply enter the password again. You will be provided with a virtual encrypted drive to which you can move your data - just like a USB flash drive. Every time you store something on this drive, Cryptomator encrypts the data automatically. Pretty simple, right?</span>
        </p></div>
        <div>
          
          <p><span>The technology behind this is state-of-the-art and encrypts both files and filenames with AES and 256 bit key length. This means: if someone looks into the folder in your cloud, they cannot draw any conclusions about your data.</span>

            <img data-src="/img/home/3rdparty/tnw-logo.png" alt="TNW Logo"/>
          </a></p><p>Cryptomator is a &#39;pay what you want&#39; proposition. I&#39;ve been using it for quite some time, and while it creates another layer between your files and cloud storage, it&#39;s a handy tool if you&#39;re serious about keeping your files safe from prying eyes.</p>

            <img data-src="/img/home/3rdparty/cardrates-logo.png" alt="CardRates Logo"/>
          </a></p><p>Cryptomator is more accessible than other solutions because its desktop version is free, and it only charges a small fee for using its mobile app. And even if a hacker accesses a user&#39;s vault, Cryptomator&#39;s encrypted files are useless without the proper key to decode them.</p>
