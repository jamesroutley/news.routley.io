<p>Former NBA player and TV sportscaster Bill Walton died on Monday at the age of 71. He was a quirky dude and as someone who’s been known to veer off onto seemingly unrelated tangents, I appreciated his oddball broadcasting style. Basketball was good for Walton but it also ruined his body. In response, <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a30984993/nba-legend-bill-walton-cycling/">he turned to biking</a> to keep active and to get around.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am the luckiest guy in the world because I am alive and I can ride my bike. It is the ultimate celebration of life when you go out there and are able to do what you can do. I have not been able to play basketball for 34 years. I have not been able to walk for enjoyment or pleasure or exercise in 41 years, but I can ride my bike.</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7fJ_InOOOd/?igsh=cThkcHQ3ZG9qNG5r">a brief clip</a> of a talk Walton gave (at the University of Arizona, I believe, the custodian of <a href="https://biosphere2.org/about/about-biosphere-2">Biosphere 2</a>), he elaborated on how important his bicycle was to him:</p>

<blockquote><p>I love my bike. My bike is everything to me. My bike is my gym, my church, and my wheelchair. My bike is everything that I believe in going on in the Biosphere. It’s science, it’s technology, it’s the future, engineering, metallurgy - you name it, it’s right there in my bike. My bike is the most important and valuable thing that I have.</p></blockquote>

<p>Walton knew: the bicycle is low-key <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2024-03-30/the-hidden-potential-of-bicycles/">one of humankind’s greatest inventions</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>By contrast, a person on a bicycle can go three or four times faster than a pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer of flat road at an expense of only 0.15 calories. The bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man’s metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion. Equipped with this tool, a person outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>As one of the commenters on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7fJ_InOOOd/">this post</a> said, “Tailwinds and smooth asphalt forever, buddy.”</p>
