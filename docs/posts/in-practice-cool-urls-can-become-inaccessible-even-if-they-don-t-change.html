	<p><small>June 30, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>The idea that &#34;cool URLs don&#39;t change&#34; has been an article of faith
for <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">a very long time</a>. Of
course this is false in practice; decades of experience have shown
us that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool URLs do change</a> for all sorts of
reasons (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/GabonCountryDNSEvaporation">for example, forced changes in your domain name</a>). Recently, we&#39;ve seen at least
two examples where cool URLs may not change as such, but they do
become broadly inaccessible.</p>

<p>The first case is Reddit, where people&#39;s protests against recent
corporate moves have caused a significant number of communities to
become &#39;private&#39; (for the moment), which makes them inaccessible
to both the general Internet and most logged in Reddit users. This
is a relatively extreme case because it&#39;s pretty close to a soft
deletion of the content. A second and more illustrative case is
that within the past day or so, Twitter has stopped letting you see
anything (tweets, profiles, etc) unless you&#39;re a logged in user of
the site. It&#39;s possible that this is temporary and the situation
will change back to the relatively open access that it used to be,
but it&#39;s also possible that going forward, Twitter&#39;s &#39;content&#39; will
only be accessible to registered, logged in (and allowed) users of
Twitter.</p>

<p>Of course, partially or completely restricting access to &#39;content&#39;
so that you have to be a registered, logged in user is something
that has a long history on the web. Some websites have always been
that way, with the goal of increasing the number of registered users
they have. Others have started out open to attract people and then
closed down access later to drive registration and often &#39;monetization&#39;.
Twitter (and Reddit) are mostly notable for how long they&#39;ve been open
access, and thus how many casual references to things they host are
out there on the Internet.</p>

<p>(I have plenty of entries with links to tweets, all of which are now
relatively inaccessible (if they still exist; many probably don&#39;t).)</p>

<p>I&#39;m using &#39;cool URL&#39; in a somewhat loose sense here, because Reddit
and Twitter never promised that these URLs would be eternal. But
almost no one does, almost everyone tries to preserve URLs, and
these URLs have been stable for what is often a very long time.  In
practice, &#39;open&#39; websites like the old Reddit and Twitter generally
have an incentive to keep their URLs cool and unchanged, because it
encourages people to link to them, which drives traffic. If you
couldn&#39;t link to or embed tweets, Twitter might have been much less
pervasive than it became for a while.</p>

<p>PS: There are various reasons to not register on a website merely to see
things on the website, including that registering usually requires you
to agree to their terms of service, which often contain things ranging
from bad to terrible.</p>
