            <p>A <em>CRITICAL</em> benchmark for image generation models</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>This was <a href="https://x.com/generativist/status/1713011492310950273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally inspired by the horse riding astronaut meme</a> way back in 2023. But I think Simon&#39;s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/25/pelicans-on-a-bicycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pelican benchmark</a> is what keeps the idea alive for me, even though they are testing different modalities. Burritos are obviously more important than both pelicans and equestrian absurdism.</p>
            <p>Also, I was initially surprised that it couldn&#39;t replicate the image well because I assumed there would be plenty of similar examples in the training data (unlike said equestrian absurdity). But I think it&#39;s a bit of a weird concept because all the ingredients get smushed and smashed and congealed.</p>
            <p>All images generated using fal defaults. Obviously you can probably prompt it better, but that&#39;s HIL effort, and feels like cheating.</p>

                A partially eaten burrito with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, salsa, pinto beans, and chicken.
