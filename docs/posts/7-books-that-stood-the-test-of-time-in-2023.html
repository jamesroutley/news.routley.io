    <h1>7 books that stood the test of time in 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year: when people proudly announce how many books they have read in the past 12 months. 10 books, 20 books, 57 books! Worry not—I know you don’t care, and besides, I have no idea how many books I read this year.</p>

<p>In lieu of that, here’s a short list of <strong>some favorite books I read <em>before</em> 2023 that have stuck with me this year</strong> and changed the way I think. Seven masterpieces on AI, cooking, art, houses, product design, computational media, and trees:</p>

<h3 id="the-most-human-human-by-brian-christian">The Most Human Human, by Brian Christian</h3>

<p>A book about humanity, disguised as a book about AI. It taught me how to have deeper conversations and find more meaning in my work. Amid a sea of spilled ink on AI, Brian Christian has simply asked more interesting questions. Notably, this book was written in 2011, before the current wave—yet it’s still remarkably relevant.</p>

<h3 id="an-everlasting-meal-by-tamar-adler">An Everlasting Meal, by Tamar Adler</h3>

<p>This book changed the way I cook. It teaches the correct way to think about home cooking – not as a chore, an “obstacle”, or an optimized process… but as a simple, natural act of creativity. One of the wisest books I know.</p>

<h3 id="art-fear-by-david-bayles-and-ted-orland">Art &amp; Fear, by David Bayles and Ted Orland</h3>

<p>A slim little manual about how to overcome the fear and keep creating. Subtle tips on the role of talent, managing the vision-execution gap, quantity vs quality. I might not have kept going with research if I hadn’t read this book.</p>

<h3 id="the-production-of-houses-by-christopher-alexander-et-al">The Production of Houses, by Christopher Alexander et al.</h3>

<p>Christopher Alexander thought people could design their own homes. His most famous books, The Timeless Way of Building and A Pattern Language, are brilliant but can be a bit abstract. The Production of Houses shows what actually happened, concretely, when he and his team helped some people do the thing and design their own homes.</p>

<p>The result: some great successes, some strange contradictions to ponder.</p>

<h3 id="creative-selection-by-ken-kocienda">Creative Selection, by Ken Kocienda</h3>

<p>This book shows that most product design is a dead end. It describes, in great detail, the Apple way—hard to achieve, but worth striving towards. I’m constantly remembering stories from this book in my own work. “Pick one keyboard!”</p>

<h3 id="changing-minds-by-andy-disessa">Changing Minds, by Andy diSessa</h3>

<p>A foundational text for my research. I am always amazed how many people have not even heard of it. If you care about “future of computing”, Bret Victor’s work, “computational literacy”… go read this book! I promise it will change your mind. I reference diSessa’s <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1153373693713817600">“nightmare bicycle</a> concept all the time.</p>

<h3 id="the-overstory-by-richard-powers">The Overstory, by Richard Powers</h3>

<p>To the extent that it’s possible to see the world from the perspective of trees, this novel got me to that place. Every time I’m in a forest now, I think about the trees: how long they’ve been there, what they’re communicating to one another.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Look, I could write so much more about any one of these books (and I’m happy to answer any questions!) but honestly, it feels hard to do them justice.</p>

<p>They’re all 5 stars, on both substance and prose. Well worth your time, and could be a great gift to the right person. I hope you have a great holidays!</p>
