    <h1>A Curried Composition Puzzle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body">




<p>In this short post, I&#39;d just like to share a little puzzle that I assigned as an exericse while TAing for a functional programming class last spring. It&#39;s a cute problem, but it haunts me. It&#39;s the kind of problem that still keeps me up at night, months after I&#39;ve solved it.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the puzzle, stated in four different languages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lambda calculus</strong>: Can you write the function $\lambda hgfx. ~ h(g(f(x)))$ purely in terms of $c = \lambda gfx. ~ g(f(x))$? That is, can you define three-fold composition purely in terms of two-fold composition?</p>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong>: Given the function <code>c = \g f x -&gt; g (f x)</code>, can you write an expression using only the symbol <code>c</code> and open- and close-parens (and whitespace) that evaluates to a function with the same behavior as <code>\h g f x -&gt; h (g (f x))</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Scheme</strong>: Given the function <code>c = (lambda (g) (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (g (f x)))))</code>, can you write an expression using only the symbol <code>c</code> and open- and close-parens (and whitespace) that evaluates to a function with the same behavior as <code>(lambda (h) (lambda (g) (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (h (g (f x)))))))</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Javascript</strong>: Given the function <code>c = (g) =&gt; (f) =&gt; (x) =&gt; g(f(x))</code>, can you write an expression using only the symbol <code>c</code> and open- and close-parens (and whitespace) that evaluates to a function with the same behavior as <code>(h) =&gt; (g) =&gt; (f) =&gt; (x) =&gt; h(g(f(x)))</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is a more thorough explanation.</p>
<p>In Javascript, the following function can be used to compose two functions:</p>
<div><pre><code>function compose2(g, f) {
    return function (x) {
        return g(f(x))
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>or, if you prefer, using anonymous functon notation:</p>
<div><pre><code>compose2 = (g, f) =&gt; (x) =&gt; g(f(x))
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, for instance, if $g,f$ were the functions defined by $f(x) = x+1$ and $g(x)=3x$, then $\texttt{compose2}(g,f)$ would be the function mapping its argument $x$ to $3x+3$.</p>
<p>But we can also define a curried version of the composition function, like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>curried_compose2 = (g) =&gt; (f) =&gt; (x) =&gt; g(f(x))
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, if $g,f$ were as in the previous example, then $\texttt{curried-compose2}(g)$ would itself be a function, which accepts a function as its argument and returns that function composed with $g$. This function, when evaluated at $f$, yields the function mapping $x\mapsto 3x+3$. You can read more about currying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">here.</a></p>
<p>We can similarly write a function for composing <em>three</em> functions rather than just two:</p>
<div><pre><code>function compose3(h, g, f) {
    return function (x) {
        return h(g(f(x)))
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>and in a similar vein, a curried variation of this triple-composition function:</p>
<div><pre><code>curried_compose3 = (h) =&gt; (g) =&gt; (f) =&gt; (x) =&gt; h(g(f(x)))
</code></pre></div>

<p>The puzzle is as follows: to write <code>curried_compose3</code> purely in terms of <code>curried_compose2</code>. To be precise, can you write an expression built entirely from <code>curried_compose2</code>, open parentheses <code>(</code> and close parentheses <code>)</code> that acts the same as the <code>curried_compose3</code> function?</p>
<p>If you want to give the puzzle a try, you can use the little Javascript REPL embedded below. The two-function-compose has already been defined with the single-character name <code>c</code>. You can try out the little example from earlier by letting <code>h = c((x) =&gt; 3*x)((x) =&gt; x+1)</code>, and checking that this function behaves just like <code>(x) =&gt; 3*x+3</code>. See if you can write an expression using only the three characters <code>c</code>, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> that evaluates to a function with the same behavior as <code>curried_compose3</code>.</p>

<p>The way of reframing this problem that finally cracked it open for me was to think of expressions involving function evaluations as trees. Specifically, the expression <code>f(x)</code> would correspond to a tree with two leaves, with $f$ at the leaf on the left and $x$ at the leaf on the right:</p>

</center>
<p>We can then think of the composition function <code>c</code> as just a special kind of node that permits a specific kind of &#34;tree rewriting&#34;:</p>
<center>
<img alt="Fig 2" src="https://franklin.dyer.me/img/2023-12-15-Fig2.png"/>
</center>
<p>And given only this, we are tasked with constructing a tree <code>c3</code> &#34;built from&#34; <code>c</code>, that is, a tree whose nodes contain <code>c</code>, that permits the following transformation:</p>
<center>
<img alt="Fig 3" src="https://franklin.dyer.me/img/2023-12-15-Fig3.png"/>
</center>
<p>Once I had reformulated the problem in these terms, it didn&#39;t take long for me to find a solution. It&#39;s hard to say what exactly about this paradigm made the problem so much easier for me to solve. Maybe it&#39;s just because drawing trees is more convenient than keeping track of a bunch of nested parentheses. In any case, I arrived at the following solution:</p>
<center>
<img alt="Fig 4" src="https://franklin.dyer.me/img/2023-12-15-Fig4.png"/>
</center>
<p>And we can check that it works correctly by repeatedly rewriting the tree for <code>c3(h)(g)(f)(x)</code> until we have eliminated all of the leaf nodes containing a <code>c</code>.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Fig 5" src="https://franklin.dyer.me/img/2023-12-15-Fig5.png"/>
</center>
<p>So, to sum up, here are the four solutions to the four different ways that we originally phrased the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lambda calculus:</strong> $(c(cc))c$</li>
<li><strong>Haskell:</strong> <code>(c (c c)) c</code></li>
<li><strong>Scheme:</strong> <code>((c (c c)) c)</code></li>
<li><strong>Javascript:</strong> <code>c(c(c))(c)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This solution still perplexes me. The strangest thing is that when I discarded all of my intuition about functions and composition, and turned this into a purely algebraic problem about rearranging binary trees according to a mechnical rewriting rule, it suddenly became much more manageable. The above solution is still pretty unintuitive to me, in the sense that I haven&#39;t found a way of ascribing meaning to it on a deeper level than &#34;the algebra just works out&#34;. It&#39;s almost as if wanting a meaningful, intuitive solution prevented me from solving the problem. But maybe if I keep revisiting this problem, I&#39;ll eventually come up with an insight that completely unravels it, leaving the solution plain and transparent.</p>
<p>With that, I&#39;d like to leave you with two more puzzles. First, can you generalize this to an n-fold composition function? That is, can you find a way of combining copies of the <code>c</code> function to form a function that accepts $n$ functions as (curried) arguments, and returns their composition? Secondly, can you convince yourself that the function <code>(f) =&gt; (g) =&gt; (h) =&gt; (x) =&gt; h(g(f(x)))</code>, which composes three functions <em>in reverse order</em>, is impossible to write purely in terms of <code>c</code>?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another Javascript REPL in case you&#39;d like to mess around some more.</p>
