    <h1>A new documentary about the history of forced psychiatric treatment in Spain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;My parents reported me to the authorities,&#34; Mariona told them. &#34;They put me in a reformatory when I was 17.&#34;</p><p>Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime&#39;s Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who&#39;d been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.</p><p>Marina and her cousins were stunned.</p><p>They couldn&#39;t comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.</p><p>Mariona&#39;s memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric &#34;treatment&#34; she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn&#39;t forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother&#39;s story.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i><b>Warning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressing</b></i></p><p>Mariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn&#39;t even let Mariona wear trousers.</p><p>But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.</p><p>Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she&#39;d never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.</p><p>Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on &#34;raids&#34;: a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.</p><p>On May Day 1969, one of Mariona&#39;s friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn&#39;t go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.</p><p>Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.</p><p>&#34;For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family,&#34; she says. &#34;After that, they wouldn&#39;t let me out.&#34;</p><p>By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.</p><p>They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>At the port in Barcelona her parents met her.</p><p>They didn&#39;t take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn&#39;t given any explanation - she only remembers her parents&#39; rage.</p><p>Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain&#39;s Ministry of Justice.</p><p>She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.</p><p>Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for &#34;the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women&#34;.</p><p>The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren&#39;t criminals - they were females deemed in need of &#34;re-education&#34;.  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.</p><p>&#34;They didn&#39;t let us talk.  It&#39;s quite incredible,&#34; she says. &#34;And you wonder, how did they manage it?&#34;</p><p>The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing &#34;bad&#34; girls influencing others.</p><p>&#34;What you couldn&#39;t do was really get to know another girl,&#34;  says Mariona. &#34;Because then they&#39;d separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution.&#34;</p><p>She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.</p><p>&#34;There was indoctrination,&#34; recalls Mariona. &#34;So that you should understand you&#39;d behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you&#39;d ask for forgiveness and confess.&#34;</p><p>Mariona never confessed.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn&#39;t permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn&#39;t remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.</p><p>&#34;We arrived back at the convent at dusk,&#34; she recalls. &#34;I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside.&#34;</p><p>Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.</p><p>Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called &#34;insulin coma therapy&#34;.</p><p>Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow &#34;re-set&#34; a patient&#39;s brain. </p><p>It was a &#34;therapy&#34; that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.</p><p>Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she&#39;d be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.</p><p>&#34;Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, &#39;I hurt my parents,&#39;&#34; she says.</p><p>&#34;I entered this process of submission and acceptance.&#34;</p><p>Mariona believes the forced, intravenous &#34;treatment&#34; with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina&#39;s documentary about her mother&#39;s experience.</p><p>Doctors believed the &#34;treatment&#34; would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn&#39;t happening. </p><p>&#34;One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate.&#34;</p><p>Mariona&#39;s despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she&#39;d be released from the clinic.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Mariona succeeded. In 1972, once she&#39;d grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.</p><p>Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.</p><p>These were the final years of Franco&#39;s dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.</p><p>At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she&#39;d been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: &#34;We made a mistake.&#34;</p><p>Mariona&#39;s father is in his 90s now. </p><p>&#34;We suffered a lot too,&#34; he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.</p><p>For Marina, learning more about her mother&#39;s story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.</p><p>&#34;I can&#39;t force myself to love someone who&#39;s caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly.&#34;</p><p>The short documentary Marina produced about her mother&#39;s experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for &#34;the spaces&#34; - a reference to the blanks in Mariona&#39;s memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Fifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain&#39;s dictatorship. Spain&#39;s Minister for Democratic Memory, Ángel Víctor Torres, said his government was open to looking at the case of the Patronato survivors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marina and Mariona are on tour with the film, taking it to community screenings.</p><p>&#34;Women come and tell their stories – it&#39;s like a door opened to something unknown, and that&#39;s very powerful,&#34; says Marina. &#34;People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident. We try to say: this history isn&#39;t individual, it was systematic.&#34;</p><p>Her mother Mariona still doubts her memory sometimes.</p><p>But, she says, &#34;seeing it all reflected in the film, that gives it the weight of truth.&#34;</p></div></div></div></div>
