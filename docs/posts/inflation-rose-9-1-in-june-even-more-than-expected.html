    <h1>Inflation rose 9.1% in June, even more than expected</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-5-2"><div><p>Shoppers paid sharply higher prices for a variety of goods in June as inflation kept its hold on a slowing U.S. economy, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</a> Wednesday.</p><p>The consumer price index, a broad measure of everyday goods and services, soared 9.1% from a year ago, above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. That marked another month of the fastest pace for inflation going back to December 1981.</p><p>Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI increased 5.9%, compared with the 5.7% estimate.</p><p>On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose 1.3% and core CPI was up 0.7%, compared to respective estimates of 1.1% and 0.5%.</p><p>Taken together, the numbers seemed to counter the narrative that inflation may be peaking, as the gains were based across a variety of categories.</p><p>&#34;CPI delivered another shock, and as painful as June&#39;s higher number is, equally as bad is the broadening sources of inflation,&#34; said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. &#34;Though CPI&#39;s spike is led by energy and food prices, which are largely global problems, prices continue to mount for domestic goods and services, from shelter to autos to apparel.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Up across the board</h2><div><p>Energy prices surged 7.5% on the month and were up 41.6% on a 12-month basis. The food index increased 1%, while shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI rose 0.6% for the month and were up 5.6% annually. This was the sixth straight month that food at home rose at least 1%.</p><p>Rental costs rose 0.8% in June, the largest monthly increase since April 1986, according to the BLS.</p><p>Stock market futures slumped following the data while government bond yields surged.</p><p>Much of inflation rise came from gasoline prices, which increased 11.2% on the month and just shy of 60% for the 12-month period. Electricity costs rose 1.7% and 13.7%, respectively. New and used vehicle prices posted respective gains of 0.7% and 1.6%.</p><p>Medical care costs increased 0.7% on the month, propelled by a 1.9% increase in dental services, the largest monthly change ever recorded for that sector in data that goes back to 1995.</p><p>Airline fares were one of the few areas seeing a decline, falling 1.8% in June though still up 34.1% from a year ago. The meat, poultry, fish and eggs category also fell 0.4% for the month but is up 11.7% on an annual basis.</p><p>The increases marked another tough month for consumers, who have been suffering through soaring prices for everything from airline tickets to used cars to bacon and eggs.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Real incomes fall further</h2><div><p>For workers, the numbers meant another hit to the wallet, as inflation-adjusted incomes, based on average hourly earnings, fell 1% for the month and are down 3.6% from a year ago, according to a separate BLS release.</p><p>Policymakers have struggled to come up with answer to a situation that is rooted in multiple factors, including clogged supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and trillions of dollars in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/">Covid</a>-related stimulus spending that has made consumers both flush with cash and confronted with the highest prices since the early days of the Reagan administration.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials have instituted a series of interest rate increases that have taken benchmark short-term borrowing costs up by 1.5 percentage points. The central bank is expected to continue hiking until inflation comes closer to its 2% longer-run target rate.</p><p>The inflation reading could push the Fed into an even more aggressive position.</p><p>Traders upped their bets on the pace of interest rate increases ahead. While a 0.75 percentage point hike is still considered most likely at the July 26-27 meeting, a full percentage point move now has a 37% chance of happening, according to the CME Group&#39;s FedWatch tool.</p><p>White House officials have blamed the uptick in prices on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html">Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine</a>, though inflation was already moving aggressively higher before that attack in February. President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a> has called on gas station owners to lower prices.</p><p>The administration and leading Democrats also have blamed what they call greedy corporations for using the pandemic as an excuse to raise prices. Corporate profits, however, have increased just 1.3% in aggregate since the second quarter of 2021, when inflation took hold.</p><p>However, there is some reason to think the July inflation numbers will cool.</p><p>Gasoline prices have come down from their June peak, with a gallon of regular falling to $4.64, a 4.7% drop for the month, according to Energy Information Administration data.</p><p>The S&amp;P GSCI commodities index, a broad-based measure of prices for multiple goods, has fallen 7.3% in July, though it remains up 17.2% for the year. That has come as wheat futures have fallen 8% since July 1, while soybeans are down 6% and corn is off 6.6% during the same period.</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>View from the trucking industry</h2><div><p>&#34;I see a light at the end of the tunnel,&#34; said Brian Antonellis, senior vice president of fleet operations for Fleet Advantage, a leasing and asset management company for the trucking industry based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p><p>Antonellis expects production capacity to ramp up gradually, helping to create a more competitive environment for an industry that has felt the strain of rising fuel prices, a historically tight labor market and the supply chain issues that have hampered the ability to get products to shelves.</p><p>&#34;For probably 10 to 15 years before the pandemic, the industry fell into a stable routine where costs up across the board somewhere between 1 to 3 percent a year. It was easy to budget, it was easy to forecast, it was easy to build into rates,&#34; he said. &#34;The challenge we face today is it&#39;s not that 1-3 percent anymore, it&#39;s 10 to 20 percent depending on what cost bucket you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p><p>Still, he said trucking companies are managing to get through with pricing power and creative financing.</p><p>&#34;I do think people honestly are not trying to overcharge the customer,&#34; Antonellis said. &#34;They&#39;re not being predatory about it. But they are trying to find that fine line. What do we pass forward? How do we look at the costs coming in?&#34;</p><p>With the U.S. economic picture getting increasingly cloudy, he acknowledged that the industry is not &#34;recession-proof.&#34;</p><p>&#34;There are going to be challenges,&#34; Antonellis said. &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all negative. I do think there will be challenges for the next six months. But I do think we&#39;re on an upswing.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
