    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><SPAN face="ARIAL"><b>

There is very little doubt that in almost all circumstances the correct number of <a href="https://www.partsgeek.com/parts/wheel.html">wheels for a car</a> is <i>four</i>. That has of course not stopped keen inventors from trying either more or less, and here you see some of the results.
<p>
This page confines itself to the unconventional. Goods <a href="http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/abs/1402.1843">vehicles</a> with six or more wheels are of course very common. Tracks are not counted as wheels; this matters because there are various vehicles with a mixture of wheels and tracks.

ONE WHEEL
</p></a><p><a name="1">
I don&#39;t think there is any rational way you could call a vehicle with one wheel a car. The Museum has an extensive collection of </a><a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/motorwhl/motorwhl.htm">monowheels</a>, but very few of them have any form of bodywork and the majority can only carry one person. A possible candidate might be the <a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/motorwhl/motorwhl3.htm#tank">monowheel tank</a> (preferably as the civilian version).

<p>
This design&#39;s claim to be a one-wheeled car is somewhat undermined by the two hefty stabiliser wheels at the back. It appears however that these can be raised by a lever once you&#39;ve got up speed. Other objections are that the steering is by handlebars rather than a steering-wheel, and that it seems to be strictly a one-seater.
</p><p>
Anyhow, that&#39;s the best I can do for the moment, but I suspect that a trawl through the covers of Popular Science and similiar journals would soon throw up something that could claim more plausibly to be a one-wheeled car.
</p><p>
This is an artist&#39;s impression and it is extremely unlikely that it was ever built.

I hope we can all agree that this a one-wheeled vehicle, and it is certainly not a monowheel. There may be an excellent agricultural reason for this configuration, but I have no idea what it is. Can anyone help?
</p><p>
I am also unsure of the advantage of steering with the little track; it does not appear to be powered.
</p><p>
Googling &#34;Killen-Strait tractor&#34; gets you a lot on the Killen-Strait Armoured Tractor, built in Britain in 1915, which is often considered to be the first armoured tracked vehicle, rather than this one-wheel farming tractor. The Killen-Strait Armoured Tractor was all-track (including a little one at the front for steering, again) and it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killen-Strait_armoured_tractor">Wikipedia</a> page.

This is taken from a photograph, and is clearly the source of the drawing above. I have so far found no other images or info on what is a most interesting machine.
</p><p>
This picture shows a helpful direction arrow on the top of the steerable track. This presumably means that the front track was not visible from the driving position. Steering was by worm and pinion, and so multi-turn; that may have had something to do with it. Research suggests it was a guide to the driver keeping the front track in its furrow.
</p><p>
I wonder if it had that one wheel to save money? Tracks are complicated and expensive to make.

Now, the nwheel vehicle game (Mornington Crescent!) depends on what rules you decide to follow. If you don&#39;t count tracks as wheels, then:

Ignoring the tracks, this is clearly a one-wheel vehicle. This means of steering (one wonders how effective it was) was adopted to avoid the difficulties of steering with just the tracks, which as any tank designer can tell you, involves complicated clutches and differentials.

<p>
Like the Holt Midget-18 above, this tractor had twin tracks riding on two rows of large steel balls, instead of pins and rollers. The water-cooled engine ran on petrol (or somewhat heavier &#39;distillate&#39;) and had magneto ignition with Newton Automatic spark advance. &#39;12-20&#39; meant a 20 HP engine with 12 HP available at the drawbar.
</p><p>
You can read the instruction manual <a href="https://californiarevealed.org/islandora/object/cavpp%3A47497">here</a>. It gives no clue what &#39;Ball Tread&#39; refers to, but it seems to mean just the use of ball bearings in the tracks, which is emphasised in the manual. Manufacture of the Yuba ceased in 1921, and by 1931 production of ball-tread tractors ceased completely.
</p><p>
The Ball Tread Co. began building tracked tractors in Detroit in 1912. The tractor shown here is believed to have been the company’s first product.  The company also produced an 18-35 model. In 1914, the Yuba Construction Co. of Marysville, California bought out the Ball Tread company and relocated operations to California.

This machine had the very unusual set-up of just one track running underneath the vehicle.

I am suspicious and am searching for other photographs.

The Bean Trackpull also had a single central track. You can see the advantage; if you can make it work you&#39;ve immediately eliminated dozens of track parts. There are two steering-wheels; the top on does the actual steering by swivelling the rear wheel assembly (how effective was that?) The lower wheel apparently operated the clutch. The engine was rated at 6 to 10 HP. According to their adverts, Bean claimed this machine was the equivalent of six horses. </p><p>
On the basis of we-don&#39;t-count-tracks-here this is a two-wheeled vehicle, but I want to keep it next to the central-tracked Beltrail Model-B.

The A C Sociable was a very successful early three-wheeler. It adopted what is usually considered to be the most stable configuration- two wheels in front and one at the back, like the <a href="#morg">Morgan</a>. Driver and passenger sat side-by-side, making conversation easier, and so this was called the &#39;sociable&#39; configuration. The original name was Auto Carriers Ltd.
</p><p>
It had a 5.5 HP 631 cc air-cooled side-valve single-cylinder engine, and a two-speed epicyclic gearbox, with no reverse gear; final drive was by chain to the rear wheel. The front axle was solid with semi-elliptic leaf springs, while the single rear wheel had dual quarter-elliptic leaf springs. Brakes operated on the transmission and the rear wheel. The wheelbase was 70 inches.

GERMAN PHANOMOBIL THREE-WHEELER: 1910

This beautiful image was sent to me by one of my correspondents. Three Japanese ladies sit in a remarkable three-wheeled vehicle, now identified as a German Phanomobil. A few thousand of these vehicles were produced between 1907 and 1927. There is an excellent site describing the reconstruction of a Phanomobil <a href="http://phanomobil.co.uk/">here</a>.
</p><p>
The engine is mounted over the front wheel and drives it by a chain. Clearly the whole thing is swivelled by the tiller, which must have been hard work. Given the distance between the tiller and the pivot the turning circle must have been rather large. The cylinder on top of the tiller looks as if it is a telescopic sight for accurately aiming the vehicle, but it is actually a lubricating oil tank.

There appear to be two exhaust pipes leading to a cylindrical silencer under the headlight, and on top there are two tall pillars that appear to have springs around them; they are probably automatic inlet valves. This suggested a two-cylinder in-line engine, and it is now confirmed that it was a 1290 cc twin in-line unit.
</a></p><p><a name="frt">
There are two pipes to the right of the engine that look as if they are for water-cooling, but the engine barrel is finned for air-cooling. There is a rod on the left side of the engine that looks as if it connects to a magneto (on its side) and probably controlled the ignition advance/retard.

There are considerable differences in the engine installation; note the two fans, more shrouding of the drive-chain, and a sideways-firing exhaust that must have annoyed people, not least because the exhaust from the cylinders appears to go straight into it without any form of silencer. There are two spark plugs per cylinder, driven by the magneto sitting just above the exhaust pipe.

<p>
This early machine was the forerunner of the Cyklonette described below. It was designed by Franz Louis Hüttel; (1862-??) he went on to design both the Cyklonette and the Phänomobil. (also below) The front wheel is driven by a leather-covered rope; this can be slackened by a lever on the right side of the handle bars to act as a clutch. Somehow leather-covered rope doesn&#39;t sound as if it would be free from slipping.
</p><p>
The 4-stroke engine has an automatic inlet valve. The carburettor is of the surface type; the induction stroke pulls air out of the top of the fuel tank, through an elegantly curved pipe leading to a brass drum with 2 handles; presumably a throttle, and a mixture control which admitted extra air. <a href="http://earlymotor.com/leon/misc/html/surface.htm">Surface carburettors</a> relied on simple evaporation, rather than atomising nozzles, and were not very effective; they were essentially extinct by 1904. Ignition is powered by a battery in the box below the seat and behind the fuel tank. Another curved pipe leads down to the top of the engine cylinder, the automatic inlet valve being inside it. There is pedal drive to the rear wheels by a block chain.

This car has now been identified by Paul Dunlop as a three-wheeler made by Robert Reynold Jackson &amp; Co Ltd in Notting Hill, London. Fifty of these cars were ordered for use in Costa Rica, where the unmade roads were so deeply rutted it was impossible to steer a car as the front wheels could not swivel. The idea was that the front wheel would travel on the ground between the two ruts and so be able to steer. It has not yet been confirmed that the cars were successfully delivered.
</p><p>
The vehicle was considered unusual enough to attract some attention in British and German periodicals in 1910. Normally Jackson made conventional four-wheel cars, often with parts imported from De Dion in France.

The signboard in the background carries the address &#39;26 High St, Notting Hill Gate&#39;, presumably close to the location of the Jackson factory.

The Tsar tank was probably the biggest three-wheeler ever built. It was prototyped by Imperial Russia, but proved wholly impractical.
</p><p>
This image (I am not sure if it is a model or a rendering) gives a much clearer view of the Tsar-tank&#39;s construction than the few photographs that exist. There was a circular turret on top of the main body; it appears to have four guns at 90-degree spacing, so presumably did not traverse. The turret is too small to hold a decent-sized gun, and the field of fire is restricted as the turret is below the top of the front wheels. There is also a turret with at least one gun underneath the main body, with an even more restricted field of fire, and two further guns mounted in sponsons on each side.
</p><p>
The rear wheel, or roller, looks as if it may be divided in three, so technically you could call it a five-wheel vehicle. I think it&#39;s clear however, that this is basically a three-wheeler.

Starting was accomplished by a pull-up lever on the left hand side of the driver, which could be operated from a sitting position. This lever also functioned as a ratchet hand brake.

3 WHEELS: THE SCOTT SOCIABLE: 1921-25
</p><p>
The Scott Sociable was a very odd sort of three-wheeled car manufactured from 1921 to 1925 by the Scott Autocar Company of Bradford, Yorkshire. This was an offshoot of the well-known and respected Scott Motorcycle Company.
</p><p>
In the course of World War I Alfred Scott developed sidecar machine gun carriers. They were not very successful. After the war he tried a similiar configuration for civilian transport. There emerged a highly asymmetrical three-wheel car with two wheels in line, with a third wheel out to the side and slightly behind the other rear wheel. (Overcoming the puncture drawback noted just above), though that was not the reason)The configuration resembled that of a motorcycle and sidecar combination, but looked very wrong. It looked just like a car with a wheel missing, and apparently handled like one. It was originally announced  in 1916 as the Sociable, but production was postponed until 1921. About 200 were made before production stopped in 1924. The cost of a complete Sociable was £273 in 1921, falling to £135 by 1924.
</p><p>
Driver and passenger sat side-by-side; and this was called the &#39;sociable&#39; configuration.

<p>
This picture demonstrates all too clearly that the Scott Sociable just <i>looked wrong</i>, as if it was poised on the point of falling on its nose.
</p><p>
The Sociable had a triangulated tubular steel frame, and a proper steering wheel acting by rack and pinion on the front wheel. It was powered  the Scott Company&#39;s own water-cooled 578 cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine driving through a three-speed gearbox to the offside rear wheel only, by shaft; there was no differential, and no reverse gear. It has been recorded that turning was dangerous at speed; I&#39;ll bet it was.
</p><p>
There are many, many, three-wheeled vehicles in the world. This may be the oddest.

This unique motorcycle is powered by a 499cc De Dion engine. The radiator is the round thing with the vertical pipes. The actual cylinder is on the other side of it. The first stage of the drive is a chain, and the second stage is another chain on the hidden side of the machine. It has a surface carburettor and coil ignition. It has no clutch and no gearbox, which must have compromised the performance. Apparently it could reach 35 mph in 1901.
</p><p>
The exact meaning of &#39;compensated steering&#39; is opaque, but there is a link from the front fork of the bicycle to the front fork of the mini-motorbike assembly. Note that the mini-motorbike swivels freely with respect to the bicycle, and is directed by steering the front wheel.
</p><p>
The machine was built in 1901, by W. (Billy) Slinger, an electrical engineer from Settle, Yorkshire. It took six years to build; and no others were constructed. Just what Mr Slinger was aiming at is unclear. The man in this picture is J P Smith, who owned the machine in 1949.

The Brough Superior Austin Four was a limited-production motorcycle designed and manufactured by Brough Superior of Nottingham, Britain; it was built from 1932 to 1934. Only ten were built, of which nine survive. Unusually, it was powered by a proven Austin 4-cylinder sidevalve, water-cooled motor of 747cc. Brough increased the Austin engine displacement to 797 cc and replaced the cylinder head with a light alloy version which gave more horsepower, presumably by increasing the compression ratio. The rear wheels were shaft driven from a standard Austin 7 three-speed gearbox, (plus reverse) with a crown wheel and pinion mounted between the two rear wheels. You might think that twin rear wheels would make the handling tricky, but the Museum Staff have not so far found any evidence for this.
</p><p>
The twin rear wheels make it a three-wheeled vehicle, though legally it was still classed as a motorcycle because the rear wheel centres were less than 24 inches apart. The machine was primarily intended for sidecar work, which would presumably yield a four-wheel vehicle.

The front wheels were driven by the tank sprocket-wheels engaging with internal teeth on the inside of the wheel; these can just be seen on the wheel at the extreme left. The star-shaped teeth on a shafts engaging with the metal tread were for clearing the wheels of debris, incuding explosive debris. There is another such shaft for the rear roller. I originally said they were for propulsion; many thanks to Bill Todd for pointing out this infelicity.
</p><p>
The prototype was reconfigured to use the tank&#39;s internal engine, and the underside was reinforced with 25mm steel plate. The M4A2 had 55 inches of ground clearance. The total width of the cleared path was 153 inches. (the front wheels had a width of 36.5 inches each) The tank could only reach 3 km/h when mine clearing, but on the road it could make 10 km/h. In June 1944 the T10 was tested, but it became clear that it was just too heavy to be practical.

Three-wheeled cars are not considered very unusual in Great Britain at least, though they are now becoming rare.

The Reliant Robin had a water-cooled engine (originally only 750cc) under the hatch at the front, driving the back axle via a conventional propshaft and differential.

This car was the first produced by the famous Sunbeam company. They bought in a design from a certain Maxwell Mabley-Smith, whose day job was designing ornamental ironwork. There is variation in the spelling, with Mabberley and Maberley both about on the Web. Mabley is the correct version.
</p><p>
The Sunbeam had one wheel at the front, one at each side, and one at the rear; this is often described as a diamond configuration, but in fact the front and back wheels were not in line. The layout was similiar to that of Starley&#39;s Coventry Rotary <a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/quadcycle/quadcycle.htm#cov">quadracycle</a>. The car was powered by a single-cylinder 2.75 HP De Dion engine mounted next to the front wheel, but it did not drive this wheel at all. A belt from the engine ran backwards to a 2-speed gearbox and differential; chain drives ran from this to the two unsprung side wheels.
</p><p>
The seating was as unorthodox as the wheel placement. Two people sat close together on the front seat, facing the side of the road; the driver sat behind them, steering with a tiller and facing the opposite side of the road. This all sounds very unnatural; the natural tendency would be to twist round to look in the direction in which you are going. This is especially a good idea if you are the driver. Note that extra seat backs have been added at the corners of this version to make the twisting a bit less uncomfortable.

A small-diameter exhaust pipe goes round in an elegant semi-circle, then heads toward the rear. In the previous update I said &#39;Note the red-lined petrol tank mounted on the far side of the car&#39; but it now appears it is a radiator header tank. Looking at the fins on the cylinder I assumed that the engine was air-cooled, but closer investigation shows that the cylinder head only is water-cooled and there is a four-row gilled-tube radiator mounted just above the engine. The petrol tank was somehow fitted in between the driver and the passsengers; for the time being the exact location remains enigmatic, but it must be reasonably high up for gravity feed to the carburettor.

This is another Sunbeam-Mabley; the engine here appears to be wholly water-cooled. This machine was sold by auction at Sotheby&#39;s on 23rd October 1969.
</p><p>
The auctioneer&#39;s blurb states that the engine is partly air-cooled and partly water-cooled, but this does not square with the appearance of the engine, which looks to be wholly water-jacketed.
</p><p>
The blurb states that the engine power was 2.75 HP, from a 74mm bore and 76mm stroke; the capacity was 327cc and the inlet valve was automatic. It also states that ignition was by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembler_coil">trembler coil</a>, but that looks like a magneto on the front to me. Its price when new was stated as £130.

The engine here seems to have a water-cooled head and a finned cylinder barrel for air cooling. No radiator header tank is visible, and the radiator has six rows instead of four. No magneto is visible; I suspect the writer of the auctioneer&#39;s blurb mentioned above was working from this picture.
</p><p>
Remarkably the Sunbeam-Mabley had some success; several hundred were sold in 1901 and 1902 at £130 each. It was still in the Sunbeam catalogue in early 1904, offering a single cylinder 327 cc engine 74 x 76 mm to run at 1,800 rpm. Weight 4½ cwt. (which is very light) The price then was £120.

<p>
Shown here with the wheels down.
</p><p>
This remarkable vehicle certainly has four wheels, but it also has a pair of caterpillar tracks. It also has a complicated history.
</p><p>
The vehicle was designed and constructed by the German engineer <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Vollmer">Joseph Vollmer</a>, who was at the time co-owner of the German Automobile Construction Company (DAC). The manufacture of tanks was forbidden in the German Reich due to the Treaty of Versailles. To evade this, the  the GHH (Gute Hoffnungs-Hütte) steelworks group, based in Oberhausen had acquired the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_Landsverk">Landsverk company</a> in Landskrona, Sweden. Vehicles and engines were designed and then sold as complete factory drawings against future royalty payments.
</p><p>
The FM30 had a 150 HP engine, weighed 11.5 tons and could exceed 45 mph (75 km/h) on the road using its wheels, and 20 mph (35 km/h) across country using its tracks. To convert to tracked operation, both sets of wheels were raised until the top of them were level with the tank deck. The transition to wheeled mode took about 30 seconds and could be done on the move. The armour was proof only against small-arms fire.

The armament was a Bofors 37mm gun (122 rounds carried) and 6.5mm machine-gun. (4000 rounds carried) For some reason the machine-gun was mounted in a short fat cylinder. Note the hatch on each side of the turret.
</p><p>
Perhaps predictably, the dual-drive system was complex to manufacture and too fragile for military use. Tests took place in 1935-36, but the single example was relegated to training until 1940. It has been preserved and can be seen in the Swedish Arsenalen Museum in Strängnäs. Their website is <a href="https://arsenalen.se/en/">here</a>.

This Swedish armoured car design resembled the German one just below in that it had four wheels in normal use, plus two spare wheels which were mounted so they contacted the ground in rough country and prevent the vehicle getting stuck; it&#39;s another case of &#39;is this a 4 or 6-wheeled vehicle&#39;?. The four main wheels were driven and steered at each end.
</p><p>
The wheels in the picture are hidden behind the pentagonal armour plates. The rear of the vehicle is towards the camera, and tyres contacting the road can be seen at each end- but the middle pentagonal plate has no tyre visible under it. The phrase &#39;rear of the vehicle&#39; is a bit of a doubtful one in this case: the FM29 had a driver and controls at each end, allowing for some spectacularly rapid retreats.
</p><p>
You may be worried that this armoured car appears to be equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes. In fact the two circular hatches cover the headlights; the headlights at the &#39;rear of the vehicle&#39;.

The Austrian ADMK Mulus was a light machine-gun carrier vehicle that, like the <a href="#strid">Stridsvagn FM/30</a> above, could proceed either on its tracks or on its four wheels. It does not qualify as a tankette because it had no armour at all.
</p><p>
The front wheels could be swung upward on their gear-driven suspension arms. They could then be removed and put into brackets at the rear of the vehicle. The rear wheels could also be removed, but this was a more complicated process that required driving the tracks up onto blocks.
</p><p>
It has been written that a unique feature was that the front arms acted as a framework for the driver&#39;s seat, but so far no information on how this worked has been found.
</p><p>
It was first produced in prototype quantities in 1935, and continued in production until 1938. Total production was 334 units; 302 of them in 1936. The Mulus was taken over by the German army after the 1938 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss">Anschluss</a>, but does not seem to have had much use, probably because it was underpowered, only having a 20 HP engine to move a 1.5 ton vehicle.

The Pininfarina-X project showcased its low-drag body design, with a drag coefficient of only 0.23, far superior to the ordinary cars of the time. Batista Pininfarina worked with aerodynamics expert Professor Alberto Morelli. To achieve such low drag the front of the car had to be narrow, leading to this unorthodox layout with one wheel in front, two at the side, and one at the rear. The front wheel did the steering and the rear wheel all the driving.
</p><p>
A 1089cc Fiat engine was installed at an angle in the rear of the car. This odd arrangement was made necessary by the rear three wheels being close together. This must have made for an assymetrical weight distribution and one wonders if that affected the handlng.
</p><p>
The project was a successful technology demonstrator up to a point, but a single front wheel was never going to be acceptable in mainstream motoring. The car was eventually bought by a collector and still exists.

5 WHEELS: THE PENTACYCLE

<p>
The Pentacycle was designed for delivering the post; it was patented by architect Edward Burstow (1821-91) in 1882. He is otherwise unknown to the Internet. It underwent trials with postmen in Horsham, England, and they apparently liked it, but apparently other areas were less enthusiatic and it was not adopted. Edward Burstow is buried in Denne Road Cemetery, Horsham. He was also responsible for designing the Corn Exchange, West Street, Horsham.
</p><p>
The thinking behind the design is obscure. The use of a large driving wheel avoided using gears or a chain to get up a decent speed, as in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing">penny-farthing</a>, but at that date gearing was starting to be adopted. The use of what are essentially four stabiliser wheels to protect the health of the postman (going head-first over the front of a penny-farthing could easily be fatal) is laudable, but since there is no suspension, it would seem that it would be impossible to keep all five wheels on the ground, especially given the state of the roads at that time. If the centre wheel failed to grip the road you would go nowhere.
</p><p>
The machine steers on both the front and rear little wheels; otherwise it would probably have never got round corners at all. Note the lever to the right and below the pedals that changes the direction of the steering action so that the small-wheel axles steer in opposite directions.
</p><p>
The Pentacycle was often described as the &#39;hen and chickens&#39; machine because it allegedly resembled a hen surrounded by four chicks.

5 WHEELS: THE PHELPS TRACTOR

<p>
The Phelps Tractor was an ingenious idea that failed to become popular. The steam-powered propelling section was a three-wheeled unit controlled by steering rods from behind. Presumably this was to reassure potential purchasers who were more used to driving horses and wanted no truck with new-fangled notions like steering wheels.
</p><p>
The propelling unit could be coupled to a carriage (Combination 2) or a parcel wagon (Combination 3, with extra storage over the engine compartment) or any other suitable trailer unit. This included sledges.
</p><p>
The advert at left describes how to steer, start, stop, and reverse, with the useful feature that the engine stops if the rods or reins are dropped or otherwise released entirely.
</p><p>
It think the top version has a reasonable claim to be a 5-wheeled car; you couldn&#39;t drive the tractor unit around by itself. The claim of the lower version to be a 7-wheeled car is more dubious, as the trailer is essentially a separate vehicle.
</p><p>
There seems to be much doubt as to whether this machine was actually built- there appear to be no photographs. I have grave doubts as to the practicality of fitting a 10-HP steam engine, complete with fuel and water tanks, in an enclosure the size of that shown in the top picture. Significantly, no chimney is shown to carry away the boiler exhaust gases, and there is no sign of an air-cooled condenser, which would be a sizable item.

While there could be argument about some of the vehicles in this section, this is I think beyond dispute a true five-wheeled car. Details are sadly lacking but it appears that the amount of load taken by the fifth wheel could be adjusted as the vehicle moved along.
</p><p>
The inventor claims &#34;the elimination of compensating gears and complicated mechanism&#34;. I suspect &#39;compensating gears&#39; means a differential on the driving axle; close examination of the photograph shows there is a chain drive to the fifth wheel, but no chains going to the rear axle. It therefore appears that the fifth wheel was the sole means of propulsion, which might be expected to cause problems with traction. It is not easy to see what good having a variable load on this wheel would do; using a block-and-tackle in the mechanism suggests a certain lack of mechanical sophistication. In all, it does not appear to me to be a good idea.

The Phelps Tractor was not unique in its rein-control. The Detroit Tractor (which judging by these photographs really was built) had a more practical internal-combustion engine. It is not clear why the towing pole was so long- it may have been something to do with using unmodified horse-drawn ploughs, etc.
</p><p>
I appreciate that neither of these configurations qualify as a 5-wheeled car, though they might as 6-wheeled and 4-wheeled. But I thought it best to show them here for comparison with the Phelps tractor just above.

The Detroit Tractor Company was an overshoot of Baker &amp; Baker of Royal Oak, Michigan. It was set up in March 1913 to build Baker tractors, but a few years later moved to Lafayette, Indiana where this machine was built. It was described as &#39;a line-drive tractor of the universal frame design&#39;. Presumably &#39;line-drive&#39; refers to the rein-control system, but I don&#39;t understand about the &#39;universal frame design&#39;.

Nonetheless, I feel obliged to point an obvious snag. The fifth wheel is clearly hinged to the back of the vehicle, to allow it follow irregularities in the road. Thus only the weight of engine and one wheel is available for adhesion. The traction abilities must have diabolical.

It is often cited as the cheapest car ever sold, but that means stretching the definition of &#39;car&#39; to breaking point. It was no competition for the Model-T Ford, which could be had for a few hundred dollars more.

This shows the conventional application of the Smith Motor Wheel; you bolted it to the side of your bicycle converting it into a sort of tricycle. The Smith Motor Wheel first appeared in 1914.
</p><p>
The Smith Motor Wheel was an ingenious design. The disc wheel was driven directly from the cam-shaft, which was geared down 8:1 to give a suitable drive ratio. However the camshaft of a 4-stroke engine must rotate at half engine-speed; Smith got round this by having four lobes rather than one on each cam. This ingenious idea was borrowed from the Wall Motor Wheel, invented in England in 1910, of which Smith had bought the US manufacturing rights. The Wall Motor Wheel used a 4:1 reduction ratio and a two-lobed exhaust cam; the inlet valve was automatic.

<p>
The huge barge-like cars produced in the USA in the 50&#39;s were hard to park in spaces of limited size. Here is one attempted solution; a fifth wheel that lefts the normal rear wheels off the road and allows the back of the car to go sideways. It could be argued that the car was a three-wheeler during this operation, as only three wheels were actually touching the road. A hydraulic cylinder lowered the fifth wheel, which was then rotated by a friction roller driven from the rear axle.
</p><p>
For a long time nothing was currently known beyond the existence of this photograph. It can now be revealed that this Cadillac is using the Park-Car concept invented by Brooks Walker in the 1930s. US patent 2,139,341 was applied for in 1932 but only granted in 1938.
</p><p>
Now you may object to carrying around the weight of an extra wheel just to help with parking. But the beauty of the concept is that it doubles as the spare wheel, and the only extra weight is that of the raise/lower mechanism.

The fifth wheel 22 swings down on a radius arm 25, actuated by the hydraulic cylinder 31. The big spring 38 looks as if it is intended to retract the fifth wheel if the hydraulics fail.

The fifth wheel is driven by friction roller held against its tread; this is driven by the chain 45, from the shaft 43. This shaft is driven by another friction roller 41 bearing on the rear tyre 40.
</p><p>
I have my doubts about this drive system:
</p><ul>
<li>There are two friction rollers here that need to have a good grip on their respective tyres. How well is that going to work in the wet?</li><li>The friction roller 41 bears not on the tread of its tyre but on its sidewall. Tyre sidewalls are not designed for that sort of duty and would quickly wear and become dangerous- on the inside sidewall which is hard to inspect.</li><li>Finally, what about the differential? Once both rear wheels are of the ground, trying to apply power through tyre 40 is just going to make the opposite rear wheel spin uselessly.

This pentacycle was designed with one specific application in mind; it was to ride along the abandoned track of the French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9rotrain">Aerotrain</a> project. It does look as if this is a unique case where five wheels really are required. Two of the balloon-like wheels support the rear of the pentacycle on the ground, while the single wheel at the front supports it on top of the big concrete rail. The two wheels on vertical axles guide the pentacycle laterally.

Here&#39;s one way to arrange six wheels on a car. This wheel configuration is very rare, and was thought to be unique until the Lorraine Dietrich car (below) was discovered. When the middle wheels encountered a high spot in the road, the car had an unhappy tendency to rock back and forwards.
</p><p>
The Pullman car was not a success. It crashed into a telegraph pole within a year of its construction, very probably due to instability in the steering behaviour. Its parts were used in more conventional cars. The year of building is usually given as 1903, which seems to indicate it was prototype built before Pullman went into mass production in 1905.

&#34;The wheels are mounted on lengthwise members, which are pivoted to the rear springs in each side. By this mode of support much less shock is transmitted to the body of the car than is ordinarily the case, since inequalities in the road, causing a rise or depression of one of the four wheels, will raise or depress the body spring by only half that amount, provided the other wheel on the same side remains on the level.&#34;

Pratt told the press that he built the car only for his own use, but nontheless he took out two patents: US 842,245 - (Running Gear for Automobiles) in January 1907, and US 888,737 - (Automobile Running-Gear) in May 1908.
</a></p><p><a name="art">
Unlike the Sextoauto, this six-wheeler apparently used both forward and centre axles for steering and the rear axle for propulsion. Since the &#39;centre&#39; wheel is well towards the back this does not sound like a very practical proposition, but that is what is shown in US 842,245.

<p>
This six-wheeled car was produced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine-Dietrich">Socièté Lorraine Dietrich</a> apparently in 1908, though one source states 1903/4. The makers described it as an &#39;omnibus&#39;. The rear section was stated to be a <i>fourgon</i> or baggage-van. 
</p><p>
It had a 40 HP engine and a maximum speed of 55 to 62 mph (90-100 km/hr) and according to some accounts driven by the four rear wheels. This needs confirmation- the chain drive to the centre wheels can be seen just to the left of the tyre, but not so any chains to the rear axle. However if you had rear wheels, surely you would drive them? Other accounts suggest that the rear wheels were steerable, but not driven.
</p><p>
The first and third axles could slide axially, which was claimed to allow a very small turning-circle, equivalent to that of a car half the length. It sounds like that might make for some interesting handling. However contemporary writers enquired anxiously about the true size of its turning circle.
</p><p>
Just above the driver&#39;s position, a <a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/voicepipe/voicepipe.htm">speaking tube</a> can be seen. This allowed the passengers to give the driver instructions without the inconvenience of opening a window.

Another view of the Lorraine Dietrich six-wheeled car. It was commissioned by <a href="http://lafayette.org.uk/eck3504a.html">Baron Herrmann von Eckhardstein</a>, [1864-1933] who was first secretary at the German embassy in London from 1891 to 1901. Though never the ambassador, as the first secretary he performed most of the functions of one.
</p><p>
The car boasted a silver sink with hot and cold running water, electric lighting and heating, and a dashboard fitted with every imaginable instrument. The <i>fourgon</i> actually held a fully equipped kitchen in which Emil, the chef, prepared gourmet meals. Entry to this kitchen was naturally via a tradesman&#39;s entrance at the rear of the car.
</p><p>
The car is said to have had a wheelbase of 3.80 metres; this is presumably the distance between adjacent axles, rather than the overall wheelbase. The six-wheel suspension was based on a patent owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turcat-M%C3%A9ry">Turcat-Méry</a>, motor manufacturers from 1899 until 1928.

</p><p>
The four leaf springs visible are arranged as in the diagram above; in this case the driving chain sprocket is ahead of the centre axle. No drive chain to the rear wheel is visble.
</p><p>
The centre wheels are bigger than the front and rear, and their tyres are bigger too, supporting the idea that only the centre wheels were driven. Also, different size wheels at the back would have required a different gear ratio to drive them. Add to this that if the rear wheels HAD to be steerable, to get an acceptable turning radius with the axle layout, applying power to them as well is going to give you all the difficulties of front-wheel drive technology- specifically a need for constant-velocity joints. Perhaps this is why the idea did not thrive- it limits you to just driving the centre axle, which is not going to give good traction.

The patent shows four methods of interconnecting the suspension of the three axles so that they will take equal shares of the load even if the ground is uneven; all are the same in principle but the fourth method, shown here, is the simplest mechanically, and the one used by Turcat-Mery and Lorraine Dietrich.
</p><p>
Here the springs 4 do double duty as balance levers, transferring loads to and from the front and rear axles; they are pivoted on the chassis at their centres, indicated by two small circles. The centre axle is located by the radius arm 9; when the centre axle encounters a hole, it tends to sink, which causes springs 4 to swivel on their pivots and raise the inner ends of springs 3 by means of the little links. This reduces the load on the front and rear axles.

The load distribution could be changed by varying the lengths of the suspension components.

This bizarre vehicle was built by shortening a heavy touring car, by moving its rear axle to just behind the gearbox, removing the rear wheels, and fixing it to the chassis side-members. The rear springs were reversed and rested on the front axle of the fire engine. That is the middle set of wheels visible; they were chain-driven from what had been the car rear axle.

The original front axle of the fire-engine swivelled, and this was presumably retained to avoid a long rigid wheelbase, so it was effectively an articulated vehicle. It was built because there had been a spate of serious accidents when people tried to tow fire-engines with cars.

I don&#39;t think there is any rational way you could call this a 6-wheeled vehicle, but the very prominent nose-roller on this half-track relates to the French vehicles further on in this section. Of course once you let in tracked vehicles, you could have endless discussions as to whether you should count just the big wheels/sprockets at each end or all of the track roadwheels as well. Let&#39;s not bother.

The P16 was developed in 1924 by Citroën from the earlier Citroën-Kégresse Modèle 1923.

It should be simple enough to say how many wheels a vehicle has; and then you come across something like this. Does this count as six wheels or eight?

This vehicle is a VLTT (Voiture de Liason Tout Terraine) Lorraine 72, built under licence from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_(company)">Tatra</a> by Lorraine-Dietrich for the French forces. Images of this vehicle and others with the same chin-mounted axle are not hard to find if you know what you are looking for, but nonetheless none of the sources examined by the Museum staff even mention the very obvious extra wheels. It appears the idea is to make crossing ditches easier, as the extra wheels would help the front of the car to rise up the far side of the ditch.
</p><p>
Presumably the two chin wheels were not powered, as they have no tread on; they are purely to stop the vehicle burying its nose in the ground. There also appears to be no room under the extended starting-handle for any drive mechanism.

It has six normal wheels, two little wheels on the chin like the Lorrain vehicles- plus another two little wheels between the front and middle main axles, presumably to stop the chassis grounding on bumps. The first vehicles were delivered to the French army in 1937.

<p>
This is Professor Fate&#39;s Hannibal Twin-8 car from the 1965 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Race">The Great Race</a>. Jack Lemmon played the evil Professor Fate, opposite good guy Tony Curtis. (I saw it when it came out and I remember it as a good film) Sources differ as to whether three, five, or six were built, which is at least two more than some of the machines in this gallery. However it seems likely that only two of the cars were fully functional.
</p><p>
Unusual features are that the bodywork really can be raised 9 feet above the chassis by hydraulic rams, and there was a fully functional smoke screen generator. However, the retractable brass cannon pointing out of the front is not likely to fire anything other than a small pyrotechnic, and the nose that could be made to glow red-hot (for melting snow drifts) was just a lighting effect.
</p><p>
This machine is worth studying, because it was rather more than just a movie prop.  The Hannibal Twin-8&#39;s were custom built by Warner Bros from the ground up at a cost of $150,000 in 1965 money, which was about three times what a house went for back then. (It is not currently clear if that was the cost each or for the three; I suspect the latter)
</p><p>
Power is from a Corvair flat-6 with a 3-speed manual gearbox; all four of the rear wheels are powered by a chain drive. The Hannibal Twin-8 remains in its original and un-restored condition just as it was last used on the movie set. It is still fully operational, and it actually runs and drives. It even has a 1965 assigned VIN and could be titled, registered and driven over the road.
</p><p>
The exact significance of the name is obscure. I seem to recall that the fictional car was supposed to have twin engnes, but attempts by the Museum staff to confirm this have so far failed. As for the &#39;8&#39; surely they didn&#39;t mean twin V8 engines? 
</p><p>
There is a video of Jack Lemmon extolling the features of the Hannibal Twin-8 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzaj0bdduHM">YouTube</a>. The car appears at 0:40.

The Tyrell P34 was a six-wheeled Formula 1 racing car first unveiled in 1975. It was first tried on the track at Silverstone on 8th October 1975. After much testing, Tyrrell decided to build two more 6-wheel cars to race in the 1976 season.

The idea behind the P34 was the use of front tyres that would fit in with the streamlining. This would have two effects; this would be to lower overall drag and also provide smoother airflow to the rear wing. The wheels were only 10 inches (250 mm) in diameter, and because of the small contact patch with the road, four were required to give good cornering.

</p><p>
The detachable rear section provided seating for eight more passengers, making 11 occupants in all.  It was to be powered an independent 2.2 litre four-cylinder engine, with the two engines were linked electronically. For maximum fuel economy, use of the rear engine was intended to be optional when the segments were joined, but it is hard to believe a three-cylinder engine could safely move the combination. When both engines were in use the two-engine configuration gave the Voyager all-wheel drive traction, so presumably both rear axles were driven.
</p><p>
You are probably wondering what happens to the rear wheels of the front unit; they retracted underneath the Voyager III when the two halves were joined, with aerodynamic skirts covering the open wheel wells. So... is that four wheels, six wheels, or eight wheels?
</p><p>
All of this was obviously heavy and expensive to manufacture, and had the crippling snag that it would certainly have been cheaper to buy a small car and a big van separately; having two complete vehicles is clearly far more flexible.

The Eliica has eight wheels, supposedly to improve traction. They are smaller than normal car wheels, allowing the vehicles to be closer to the ground for better aerodynamics and stability. Each of the eight wheels is driven by a 60 kW (80 hp) electric motor, giving 480 kW (640 hp) eight wheel drive in total, with regenerative braking to recover energy.  The four front wheels steer. Each of the eight wheels has a disc brake.
</p><p>
Eight-wheel drive might in theory allow the Eliica to deal with all kinds of road surfaces, but the low ground clearance suggests that off-road operation is not a sensible option. Smooth acceleration of about 0.8 g is claimed.

<p>
The <i>mille pattes</i> has four wheels at the front, and six wheels at the back. Why so many? Because the vehicle was loaded down with lead until it weighed 9.5 tons; this was so that realistic truck loadings could be placed on the tyre under test. A strong metal casing retained tyre fragments if it disintegrated, and the ten other wheels allowed control to be maintained if that happened. In fact it was only ever used on a closed test circuit.
</p><p>
The car used as many standard parts as possible, and so bears a distinct resemblance to a Citroen DS. The tyre to be tested was installed in the centre of the car, shown open in this picture.
</p><p>
It is powered by two 454 Big-Block Chevrolet engines, one of which drove the rear six wheels, and the other the tyre under test. Top speed is over 110 mph.

The Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV) is a fictional 10-wheeled attack and pursuit vehicle that featured prominently in Gerry and Sylvia Anderson&#39;s science-fiction television series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Scarlet_and_the_Mysterons">Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</a>. (1967) Only the first, third and fifth axles were powered, and these carried larger wheels. The maximum speed was a rather unlikely 200 or 250 mph, depending on episode. A notable feature was that the crew of two faced backwards (for better crash protection) and drove using a television screen and front-mounted camera; this was an awkward decision as it had to be explained several times in the series.
</p><p>
The SPV was usually manned by Captain Blue and Captain Scarlet; Captain Blue was a skilled SPV driver, but Captain Scarlet crashed several times. Fortunately he was Indestructable.

</td><td><SPAN color="BROWN"><h5>Left: The desert Renault MH car: 1923<SPAN color="BLACK">
<p>
The Renault MH was designed to cope with desert conditions, having three axles, each carrying four wheels, to give low ground pressure. It also had a large ground clearance. Only the rear two axles were driven. Note a spare wheel either side of the bonnet, and two more spare tyres on the roof. Renault were doing things throughly.
</p><p>
I think this is indisputably a 12-wheeled vehicle. It was a response to Citroen, who in 1922 sent out tracked vehicles to cross the Sahara. At the time there were no railways joining north and southern Africa.
</p><p>
If you&#39;re wondering about the forward-facing louvres on the bonnet sides, they are to let air into the radiator, which in Renault cars of this era were <i>behind</i> the engine.
</p><p>
At the end of 1923, the first mission was accomplished—an overland drive from Touggourt in Algeria to Tozeur in Tunisia in two days. In January 1924 the Gradis-Estienne expedition linked Algeria to Niger.

<p>
The ADGZ was a heavy armoured car developed by the Austrian firm of Steyr. It was intended for &#39;internal security duties&#39; which no doubt covered a multitude of sins. A total of 27 were built between 1935 and 1937; after the 1938 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss">Anschluss</a> they were taken over by the Germans.
</p><p>
This vehicle caught the attention of the Museum Staff because of the unusual configuration with the two middle axles close together. Investigation showed that in fact it had not eight wheels, as it first appeared, but twelve, as the two middle axles each carried four wheels. I&#39;m certainly prepared to accept this as a twelve-wheeled car.
</p><p>
Another interesting feature of the ADGZ, which it shared with the <a href="#fm29">Swedish FM29</a> armoured car of 1932, was that it was designed with rapid retreat in mind. The body was essentially symmetric with a driver, headlights, and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_34">M34</a> machine gun at each end, with a dual transmission so that the drivers could rapidly switch roles. The engine was at the rear. The turret carried a 20mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_cm_KwK_30">KwK 35 L/45</a> autocannon.

If I&#39;ve counted correctly, 38 wheels are visible in the picture, on one side. So there must be at least 76 wheels when we include those on the other side. However most of the wheels will be at least double and may very well be fourfold as in the 30-wheeler shown above. If we assume all wheels are double (and none fourfold) except for the single steering wheels on the two International Pacific tractors, we get a total of 76 - 4 = 72 wheels. Impressive.
</p><p>
Now all we have to do is decide if this train counts a &#39;one vehicle&#39;.

This may not be the limit; there may be bigger trailers out there.
