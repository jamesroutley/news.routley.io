    <h1>I decided that I must live my life on my terms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Yesterday, I was talking to my partner, and even though I had heard Alex Hormozi mention that &#34;We&#39;re all going to die, it doesn&#39;t matter who we are&#34;, I had never had the &#34;click&#34; that I needed to have to feel it.<p>We&#39;re all going to die one day, and we don&#39;t know when that day will be.
I&#39;ve spent my whole life trying to find my purpose, where I was simply disappointed most of the time, and I was always looking at other people and comparing myself.</p><p>But now, I can finally say that I am slowly feeling like I am finding it with more clarity.</p><p>For that reason, as scary as it might be, I decided that I needed to stop being scared of things that weren&#39;t going to help me achieve the goals that I have set for myself.</p><p>The one is to make sure that I always focus on doing something that I love.</p><p>The second one is to enjoy the process and the journey that comes with doing what I love.</p><p>Basically, I want to grow old doing what I love, not feeling that I am working.</p><p>More specially what that means is: building solutions that solve problems (help people) and improve how things are being done (innovate).</p><p>What&#39;s that one thing for you?</p></td></div></div>
