    <h1>Advice to Aimless, Excited Programmers (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="c1"><p>I occasionally see messages like this from aimless, excited programmers:</p><blockquote><p>Hey everyone! I just learned Erlang/Haskell/Python, and now I&#39;m looking for a big project to write in it. If you&#39;ve got ideas, let me know!</p></blockquote><p>or</p><blockquote><p>I love Linux and open source and want to contribute to the community by starting a project. What&#39;s an important program that only runs under Windows that you&#39;d love to have a Linux version of?</p></blockquote><p>The wrong-way-aroundness of these requests always puzzles me. The key criteria is a programing language or an operating system or a software license. There&#39;s nothing about solving a problem or overall usefulness or any relevant connection between the application and the interests of the original poster. Would you trust a music notation program developed by a non-musician? A Photoshop clone written by someone who has never used Photoshop professionally? But I don&#39;t want to dwell on the negative side of this.</p><p>Here&#39;s my advice to people who make these queries:</p><p>Stop and think about all of your personal interests and solve a simple problem related to one of them. For example, I practice guitar by playing along to a drum machine, but I wish I could have human elements added to drum loops, like auto-fills and occasional variations and so on. What would it take to do that? I could start by writing a simple drum sequencing program--one without a GUI--and see how it went. I also take a lot of photographs, and I could use a tagging scheme that isn&#39;t tied to a do-everything program like Adobe Lightroom. That&#39;s simple enough that I could create a minimal solution in an afternoon.</p><p>The two keys: (1) keep it simple, (2) make it something you&#39;d actually use.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve got something working, then build a series of improved versions. Don&#39;t create pressure by making a version suitable for public distribution, just take a long look at the existing application, and make it better. Can I build an HTML 5 front end to my photo tagger?</p><p>If you keep this up for a couple of iterations, then you&#39;ll wind up an expert. An expert in a small, tightly-defined, maybe only relevant to you problem domain, yes, but an expert nonetheless. There&#39;s a very interesting side effect to becoming an expert: you can start experimenting with improvements and features that would have previously looked daunting or impossible. And those are the kind of improvements and features that might all of a sudden make your program appealing to a larger audience.</p><p><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/80.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>September 23, 2010</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/79.html">Erlang vs. Unintentionally Purely Functional Python</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/78.html">Common Sense, Part 1</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html">Personal Programming</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/76.html">Stop the Vertical Tab Madness</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/75.html">One Small Step Toward Reducing Programming Language Complexity</a></li></ul></div></div>
