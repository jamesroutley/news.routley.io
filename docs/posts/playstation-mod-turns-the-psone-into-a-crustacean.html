    <h1>Playstation Mod Turns the PSOne into a Crustacean</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you thought your <a href="https://gizmodo.com/playstation-5-tips-1851384547">PlayStation 5</a> already looks a little too animalistic with its massive whale fin-like console covers, perhaps you would enjoy a more explicitly aquatic Sony gaming machine. “Playstacean” is more than a pun, it’s a meme that’s transformed into an actual console, and it may be the cutest, working version of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/goodbye-psone-though-i-never-knew-you-at-all-163209">Sony’s long-defunct PSOne</a> in the 25 years since its initial launch.</p> <p>Playstacean is, in essence, an all-in one console mod for the PSOne console that’s made to look like a crab. If you ever heard the memeified term “<a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/animals/why-everything-becomes-crab-meme-carcinization/">carcinisation</a>,” then this is the crabbiest version of a console we’ve seen yet. Yes, it plays games, and you bet those crab claw controllers actually work. Just don’t imagine you can hold each controller end for too long before your own hands feel like calcified pincers.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Built A &#34;Playstacean&#34;" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSBNs3TeINc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p><div>
</div>  <p>The design was based on <a href="https://x.com/anhdangerous/status/1845279780268032431">the work of</a> video game concept artist Anh Dang. While you may imagine the smooth curves and inward-sloped mandibles were designed off the original PlayStation console, it’s actually formed from the PSOne, a more-compact version of Sony’s original console that first debuted in 2000 (after the launch of the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/aint-no-god-like-god-of-war-2000577804">PlayStation 2</a>). Dang told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSBNs3TeINc">GingerOfOz</a> that her concept originally came from an old meme she saved to her hard drive years ago. The “Playstacean” console is a meme built off a <a href="https://memewhore.tumblr.com/post/684834058976575488">meme</a>, built off a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/carcinization">meme</a>.</p> <p>In a video interview with Gizmodo, GingerofOz told us he had been planning this design after seeing a print of Dang’s artwork late last year. According to the YouTuber, “[Playstacean] is a really good pun. Plus Dang really nailed her original artwork. You could tell immediately that it’s supposed to be a PSOne.” He added, “I think people like crabs… the console hit this really cool niche.” The actual design process began in December, involving a fair bit of trial and error to make a solid and smooth print of the pun-console’s shell. GingerOfOz started the design in CAD and then 3D printed the parts.</p>

While the board itself was relatively simple, he said one of the most-complicated aspects of the build was the work angling the front controller and memory card ports to mirror Dang’s original design. That involved “a solid week and a half of work” involving trial and error.</p> <p>The other struggle was with the controllers themselves. GingerofOz used a modified third-party PlayStation controller he bought off eBay, which resulted in some trial and error before he realized the controller would “freak out” when you detached the thumbsticks from the buttons. The two controllers speak to each other via a switcher soldered to the mainboard, allowing each end to act as one with practically no latency.</p>

 <p>GingerOfOz admitted the current iteration has flaws. While constructing the final build, the Playstacean designer had to add knobs to seat the disc drive to avoid any grinding when pressing on the lid. He also admitted his wiring through the controllers wasn’t particularly stellar, but it was good enough to avoid any tangled cables when moving the joints of the crab claws around.</p> <p>Gizmodo asked if he plans to release his files so other modders could 3D print their own Playstacean, but he said he’s not planning to share anything currently. He said the big hurdle is fixing up the current CAD files, and he’s currently more keen to start work on future projects. He will be bringing Playstacean to the <a href="https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/">Midwest Gaming Classic</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin April 4, if you happen to be in town.</p> <p>As for what’s next, he said he considered making a folding Nintendo Switch, though that may be on the backburner now that the Switch 2 is imminent. The modder also hinted he’s working on another aquatic animal-themed console mod, this time for the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/who-needs-a-switch-2-when-you-can-get-a-space-world-nintendo-gamecube-for-100k-2000556892">Nintendo Gamecube</a>. Perhaps we could find a box jellyfish version of Nintendo’s console with a carrying handle.</p>
