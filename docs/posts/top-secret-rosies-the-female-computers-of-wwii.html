At the time, in the 1940s, when these women were doing this work, it was considered classified; moreover, contemporaries considered programming a clerical task.<sup id="cite_ref-light_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-light-4">[4]</a></sup> Because of this, and because of their invisibility during the media coverage of ENIAC, the work of these women was largely unrecognized.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Goldstine" title="Herman Goldstine">Herman Goldstine</a> selected the programmers from women who had been calculating ballistics tables with desk calculators and a differential analyzer prior to and during the development of ENIAC.<sup id="cite_ref-light_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-light-4">[4]</a></sup> Under Herman and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Goldstine" title="Adele Goldstine">Adele Goldstine</a>&#39;s direction, the programmers studied ENIAC&#39;s blueprints and physical structure to determine how to manipulate its switches and cables, rather than learning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming language</a>, which had not yet been invented. According to Jamie Gumbrecht in an article by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a>: </p><blockquote><p>They handed out its punch cards as souvenirs. They&#39;d taught the massive machine do math that would&#39;ve taken hours by hand. [...] But their work during the war was little known, unacknowledged or left out of official histories of the war and the development of computers.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-5">[5]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The film focuses on the contributions of several women, namely  the Blumberg twins, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doris_Polsky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Doris Polsky (page does not exist)">Doris Polsky</a> (née Blumberg) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shirley_Melvin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Shirley Melvin (page does not exist)">Shirley Melvin</a> (née Blumberg); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlyn_Meltzer" title="Marlyn Meltzer">Marlyn Meltzer</a> (née Wescoff); and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik" title="Jean Bartik">Jean Bartik</a> (a.k.a. Billie Jean Jennings). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli" title="Kathleen Antonelli">Kathleen Antonelli</a> (née McNulty) is another ENIAC computer programmer recognized in the film. It has been taught widely in schools and universities and is credited for recognizing the little-known contributions of classified women technology workers during World War II and making that history available to public audiences.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-5">[5]</a></sup> In the publication for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_University_Women" title="American Association of University Women">American Association of University Women</a> (AAUW), Erickson stated that the film is held in over 500 libraries worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2015 the film was adapted for the iPad in an interactive book app, The Computer Wore Heels.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The app allows users to follow key figures from the film, and it highlights social issues, the day-to-day experience or working long shifts, and the wartime context.

<p>The film has received largely positive reviews, and primarily among educational or library organizations.
</p><p>
In their review of the film, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America" title="Mathematical Association of America">Mathematical Association of America</a> wrote:</p><blockquote><p>This story would be of enormous value in courses in women’s studies, the history of computing and technology, the history of World War II, and the history of mathematics. [...] Fortunately, the video was made in the nick of time as two of the women interviewed have died since it was made.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Professor emeritus of mathematics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marymount_University" title="Marymount University">Marymount University</a>, Judy Green, took issue with the film, however, for its limited view of history, suggesting that the narrative scope skews the history of women in mathematics: </p><blockquote><p>While things today are better for women, mathematicians and others, than they were in the 1940s, it took awhile for the women of this film to be recognized. Nonetheless, many may come away from the film thinking that before World War II women not only did not work as computers or mathematicians but they also thought themselves incapable of doing such work. Listening to the four Rosies, one has the impression that such thoughts never entered their minds.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
