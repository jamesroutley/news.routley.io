<p><i>Resist</i> the dazzling spectacle of mainstream social and news media.</p>

 <pre aria-label="Welcome to rawtext.club" aria-role="heading" aria-level="2">__ __ __
\ V  V / elcome to rawtext.club, an experimental community for socializing,
 \_/\_/  digital skill building, and collaboration through the medium of the
         GNU/Linux shell.</pre>
<p>
RTC is a non-profit, do-it-yourself social network that uses a smaller,
simpler, user-built toolkit. We are proudly the polar opposite of the big,
exploitative, corporate-owned social media mega-sites.  Not cool. Not easy.
Not big. rawtext.club is what you make it.  The point is that you can do a
LOT using very minimal resources by stringing together command line tricks on
a Linux system.

    <p>
     OFF THE WEB. While users can publish webpages and gopher content here,
         the life of the party is on the command line where you control who
         sees your content and how long your content lives.  Nothing is 
         indexed by search engines on the command line, so it&#39;s more like
         socializing with other humans offline.
    </p>
 
    <p>
     DO-IT-YOURSELF. The GNU/Linux environment makes it easy to build your
         own tools, and many of the tools for social interaction on 
         rawtext.club are made by users here or from other similar systems.  
         It&#39;s more fun when you can access and tinker with the source code.
    </p>

    <p>
     RESOURCE MINIMALISM.  rawtext.club runs on a tiny cloud-based VPS with
         1 GB of memory and a 25 GB disk.  A desktop with these specs would
         choke on many modern websites, but we&#39;re able to run a whole digital
         social club off it because we use text-based interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      NON-PROFIT. No membership fee, no ads, and nobody tracking your online
         movements to sell data about you.  Rather, you pay to be a member of
         rawtext.club by being an active community member -- make neat things,
         test out what others have made, and teach others what you know.  You
         can&#39;t buy a community like this.  Read RTC&#39;s <a href="https://rawtext.club/social-contract.html">social contract
         statement</a> for further explanation of why this is important to us.
    </p>

    <p>
     ASYNCHRONOUS.  Unlike IRC and other instant message tools, much of the
          interaction on rawtext.club is asynchronous.  Check out what others
          are doing or saying, think about it a while, and respond when you
          want to.  No rush.  This is the slow social network after all.
