He determined that at least 50 submissions that day alone had been lazily drafted by artificial intelligence.<!-- --></p><p>Of the 1,200 global submissions that Clarke received in the first 20 days of February, he deemed 500 of them to be AI-generated. <!-- --></p><p>&#34;It was picking up at a daily rate,&#34; Clarke told Semafor. He was forced to close submissions because of the crush of ChatGPT-created content.<!-- --></p><p>Clarke identified the likely culprit: Followers of online get-rich-quick scammers trying to make a quick buck, in the off-chance their AI-generated work gets published.<!-- --></p><p>Its the latest evolution of internet side-hustle culture: Creators posing as business moguls are encouraging followers to use ChatGPT to earn money by churning out AI-generated content. The impact of these schemes is also being felt in other industries, including publishing, e-commerce, and video platforms like YouTube.<!-- --></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.semafor.com/_next/static/media/generaform@2x.3a47aa9e.png" alt="Title icon" width="20" height="16"/><span>Know More</span></p><div><p>Owing to his magazine&#39;s popularity, Clark told Semafor that scammers had included it on their lists of publications to which people could submit content they didn&#39;t write. If those submissions get published, the &#34;authors&#34; get paid. (Clarkesworld pays 12 cents per word.)<!-- --></p><p>&#34;You get one person who will put out a TikTok or YouTube or blog post. … &#39;Earn quick penny with ChatGPT,&#39;&#34; he said. <!-- --></p><p>Other science-fiction magazines, airline magazines, as well as prestigious outlets like The New Yorker, are also on these lists, according to Clarke. <!-- --></p><p>Clarke declined to provide the tell-tale signs he looks for to detect whether something is written by ChatGPT — he doesn&#39;t want to give away his methods to the scammers.<!-- --></p><p>But he said it was obvious that there&#39;s &#34;absolutely no effort put into masking&#34; the AI submissions.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;They cut, they paste, they send,&#34; he said. &#34;These are not good. These are not even remotely good.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Clarke said that he tried out AI-detection software, but that it was &#34;absolutely terrible&#34; and produced several false positives and negatives. <!-- --></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.semafor.com/_next/static/media/viewfrom@2x.26856835.png" alt="Title icon" width="20" height="16"/><span>The View From YouTube</span></p><div><p>The side-hustle phenomenon is perhaps most visible on YouTube, where there are over 4,000 videos with both <!-- --><a rel="no-referrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?as_q=chatgpt+money&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;lr=&amp;cr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_sitesearch=youtube.com&amp;as_occt=title&amp;safe=images&amp;as_filetype=&amp;tbs=">&#34;ChatGPT and &#34;money&#34; in the title</a>.
