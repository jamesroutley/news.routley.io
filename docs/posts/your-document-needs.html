    <h1>Your Document Needs...</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>When I open a business document<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there’s certain things that I always want to see in the header.
These orientate me to the document’s origin and how I can use it.</p>
<p>I’ll often ask the author to include these if they’re missing.
So here’s my blanket request, future collaborator: include these to begin with, for the sake of me and all your other readers!</p>
<h2 id="title">Title</h2>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Ideally, this is something that makes sense if pulled into another context – for instance, when used as text for a link to the document.</p>
<p>You’ll note the title of this article in the header…and in your browser’s tab bar, or your bookmarks, etc.</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>The “who” may more properly be an editor or compiler – but it should be a <em>responsible party</em> for the document as of <a href="#date">a point in time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://jjttrr.medium.com" rel="external" target="_blank">John Truscott Reese</a> would say that this should name a single person;
I tend to agree unless its’s <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/fractal-overdrive">a very close collaboration</a>.
I’d phrase this in terms of identifying a single “responsible party”,
plus diligently and generously acknowledging other contributors.</p>
<p>Another of John’s hobbyhorses is that a name should be an unambiguous identifier within context:
not “just a given name”, but a unique given+family name, or username-at-company, or e-mail address, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the header of this page says “cceckman.com”: that’s my unique name, according to ICANN.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="date">Date</h2>
<p>“When is it?”</p>
<p>Pick a meaningful date to put this document in history. Maybe that’s an “originally written”, maybe that’s a “last updated,” but something meaningful to the content.</p>
<p>This is not the same as a manually-curated revision history, or an automated history like a changelog or <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame" rel="external" target="_blank"><code>blame</code></a>.
The date(s) in the header should reflect your (human) understanding of when the document matters, not the full history
of every typo correction.</p>
<p>For my blog, I manually provide a date of publication, though I may have been drafting for A While beforehand.
If there are meaningful updates, I may add an “updated” stanza – for instance, if an article gets a lot of traffic that I want to <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/branchless-utf8-encoding/#the-coda">respond to</a>.</p>
<h2 id="canonical-link">Canonical link</h2>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>In the world of academic-affiliated publication, the canonical identifier is a [Digital Object Identifier]. A company-internal document might have a shortlink (e.g. a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/golink" rel="external" target="_blank">golink</a>).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> These kinds of links aren’t necessarily discoverable when you have the document open, so make them explicit.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>On the World Wide Web, this might just be the URL, if it’s a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink" rel="external" target="_blank">permalink</a> (as on my site); but be mindful of (re)directing <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/canonicalization" rel="external" target="_blank">to the canonical page</a>.</p>
