Heavily restricted and regulated, the official passport photo requirements include that the subject needs to face the camera straight on, needs a clear background without shadow, no glare on glasses and most importantly; no smile.</span></p><p><span>It seems almost impossible for any kind of self-expression.</span></p><p><span>The series tries to challenge these official rules by testing all the things you could be doing while you are taking your official document photo.</span></p></div></div></div>
