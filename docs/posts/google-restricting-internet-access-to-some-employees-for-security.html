The company will disable internet access on the select desktops, with the exception of internal web-based tools and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>-owned websites like Google Drive and Gmail. Some workers who need the internet to do their job will get exceptions, the company stated in materials.</p><p>In addition, some employees will have no root access, meaning they won&#39;t be able to run administrative commands or do things like install software.</p><p>Google is running the program to reduce the risk of cyberattacks, according to internal materials. &#34;Googlers are frequent targets of attacks,&#34; one internal description viewed by CNBC stated. If a Google employee&#39;s device is compromised, the attackers may have access to user data and infrastructure code, which could result in a major incident and undermine user trust, the description added.</p><p>Turning off most internet access ensures attackers cannot easily run arbitrary code remotely or grab data, the description explained.</p><p>The program comes as companies face increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. Last week, Microsoft said Chinese intelligence <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/us-government-emails-compromised-by-china-based-espionage-group.html">hacked into</a> company email accounts belonging to two dozen government agencies, including the State Department, in the U.S. and Western Europe in a &#34;significant&#34; breach<strong>. </strong>Google has been <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-sector/announcing-google-public-sector" target="_blank">pursuing</a> U.S. government contracts since launching a public sector division last year.</p><p>It also comes as Google, which is preparing a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/google-to-use-new-ai-models-for-ads-and-to-help-youtube-creators.html">companywide rollout</a> of various artificial intelligence tools, tries to boost its security. The company has also in recent months been striving harder to contain leaks. </p><p>&#34;Ensuring the safety of our products and users is one of our top priorities,&#34; a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. &#34;We routinely explore ways to strengthen our internal systems against malicious attacks.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
