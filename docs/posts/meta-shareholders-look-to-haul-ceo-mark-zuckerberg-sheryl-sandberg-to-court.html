    <h1>Meta shareholders look to haul CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg to court</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							


<p>Mark Zuckerberg is slated to make yet another high-stakes courtroom appearance this week as shareholders seek to hold him accountable for the more than $8 billion that Meta has spent to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/netflix-documentary-explores-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal/">settle lawsuits over privacy violations. </a></p>



<p>The trial, set to begin Wednesday in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, aims to hold Zuckerberg, former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg and other former executives <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-facebook-delaware-shareholders-trial-facebook-privacy-2025-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally liable for the billions the company spent</a> to resolve allegations that it failed to safeguard user data.</p>

<p>That failure, they say, <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/">enabled the Cambridge Analytica scandal </a>— a notorious breach that saw data from tens of millions of Facebook users improperly harvested for political profiling. </p>



<p>Meta is not a named defendant in the suit and declined to comment on the case. Attorneys for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday evening. </p>



<p>The case is a shareholder derivative lawsuit, a type of legal action that allows investors to sue company executives or board members on behalf of the company itself.</p>


	



<p>In these cases, shareholders argue that corporate insiders failed in their fiduciary duties and caused harm to the company—financial or otherwise—that management has failed to address.</p>



<p>In April, Zuckerberg was questioned by the Federal Trade Commission about internal communications surrounding Facebook’s<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/18/business/mark-zuckerbergs-explosive-emails-about-instagram-whatsapp-take-center-stage-at-ftc-antitrust-trial/"> acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.</a></p>



<p>Meta is<a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/15/business/metas-mark-zuckerberg-admits-buying-instagram-because-it-was-better-during-grilling-at-landmark-ftc-trial/"> facing regulatory scrutiny for allegedly abusing</a> its monopolistic power to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. </p>

<p>The trial in Delaware will further probe Meta’s handling of user privacy with a focus on the company’s knowledge and decision-making in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/02/cambridge-analytical-is-shutting-down/">run-up to the Cambridge Analytica breach.</a></p>



<p>Hastings, Thiel and Zients are no longer on Meta’s board of directors. </p>



<p>According to the shareholders’ complaint, the defendants <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/27/facebook-parent-company-settles-cambridge-analytica-lawsuit/">failed to act on multiple “red flags” </a>prior to the scandal.</p>

<p>That settlement, the shareholders argue, was approved by a board that disregarded evidence of noncompliance. </p>



<p>In its 2012 consent decree, the FTC ordered Facebook to give users “clear and prominent notice” and obtain “their express consent” before sharing information beyond their privacy settings.  </p>



<p>At the time of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook allowed third-party apps not only to collect data from users but also from those users’ friends — without their direct knowledge or consent.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg later issued a public apology, stating the platform had “a responsibility to protect your data.” </p>



<p>The fallout was global. In 2019, the FTC announced a then-record $5 billion fine against Facebook as part of a settlement over violations of the consent order.  </p>



<figure><figcaption>The shareholder lawsuit stems from the $8 billion that Meta has paid out to resolve claims that it failed to safeguard user data. <span>REUTERS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A separate investigation by the British parliament concluded that had Facebook taken its obligations seriously under the 2012 consent decree, the Cambridge Analytica breach might have been prevented.</p>



<p>Shareholders cite that conclusion in their pretrial filings. </p>



<p>In their defense, attorneys for Zuckerberg and the other executives claim there is no evidence of wrongdoing.  </p>



<p>“This evidence, and much more like it, negates plaintiffs’ pleaded portrait of a company indifferent to compliance,” the defense wrote in a recent court filing. </p>

<p>The lawsuit has been years in the making. Two years ago, efforts to have the case dismissed failed.  </p>



<p>At the time, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, the judge overseeing the case, remarked that “this is a case involving alleged wrongdoing on a truly colossal scale.” </p>




<p>The current non-jury trial will be presided over by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick. McCormick is best known for repeatedly striking down Elon Musk’s $55 billion Tesla compensation package.  </p>



<p>Her rulings have led to discontent in the tech and business world over Delaware’s handling of corporate governance cases. </p>







<p>In the aftermath, several major firms — among them Andreessen Horowitz, Roblox, Dropbox and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management — have either left Delaware or announced plans to reincorporate elsewhere. </p>



<p>The Post has sought comment from Meta, Sandberg, Andreessen, Hastings, Thiel, Zients, Alford and Papamiltiadis. </p>
