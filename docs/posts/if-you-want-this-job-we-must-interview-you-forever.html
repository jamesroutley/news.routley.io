We are eager to initiate phase three of the interview process. Please join us for a full-day team experience at Bubble App HQ, where the agenda will include the following:</p><ul><li>A panel interview with our V.P.s of engineering, sales, technology,
marketing, global marketing, and user happiness.</li><li>An Enneagram test and one-on-ones with nineteen different people in H.R.</li><li>A fajita lunch, some improv games, and a Ping-Pong tournament, after which you will be evaluated on our five-dimensional Work Hard, Play Harder
assessment matrix.</li><li>A ninety-minute walk-and-chat around our man-made lagoon with our
C.E.O., Benji, and Benji’s dog, Mr. Rex. (Mr. Rex will “interview”
you with his barks!)</li></ul><p>Phase three starts at 8 <em>A.M.</em> sharp, next Monday, and lasts for fourteen Pomodoro-timer cycles, concluding at 5:38 <em>P.M.</em></p><p>We can’t wait to see you there!</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>We’re thrilled to invite you to a fourth-round interview—an overnight camping trip with our twenty-five-person human-success department.</p><p>This interview is all about <em>culture fit</em>. It will include a hike to a waterfall, a campfire sing-along to niche seventies folk songs, a midnight skinny-dip, and some spooky ghost stories that are also silly. Please make your story sixty-forty scary-silly, as our team prefers to be only moderately frightened.</p><p>Afterward, everyone will vote on whether they find you fearless and fun. The itinerary is attached. We’re excited to camp with you!</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>You got a lot of “yes” votes, so we are delighted to initiate our community-stakeholder interview.</p><p>Could you come by Bubble HQ tomorrow and give a thirty-minute <em>TED</em>-style talk to an auditorium of six hundred employees, followed by a Q. &amp; A.? Think of it as one very big interview where everyone can see what you bring to the table!</p><p>Your topic is “The Future of U.I.”</p><p>P.S. The tone of the talk should be jovial, with some great zingers.</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>We are ready to discuss your offer—almost!</p><p>First, we need to test your lateral-thinking abilities with a hypothetical-situations interview.</p><p>You will wear a state-of-the-art V.R. headset and interact, virtually, with several H.R. managers who will appear as holographic avatars of historical figures and fantasy characters, ranging from King Tut to Darth Maul.</p><p>These avatars may ask you anything: how you would resolve certain historical conflicts, which hot sauce you most identify with, etc. They could even invite you to role-play a scene from “The Phantom Menace.”</p><p>Then the tables will be turned and you will interview <em>them</em>, asking questions and performing improvised role-plays that probe the very nature and limits of job interviews. You can also ask about dental benefits.</p><p>The V.R. rig will be on your doorstep momentarily.</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>We loved your role-play with Benjamin Franklin! We want to hire you, probably.</p><p>We are working through some internal process changes and will follow up in the next two hours to two months.</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>It’s official! We’re elated to offer you the U.I.-ninja job at Bubble App. Your offer letter is attached. Welcome to the team!</p><hr/><p><strong>FROM</strong>: jobs@bubbleapp.com</p><p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>As you may be aware, the past three weeks have been a test. You have been “working” at a facsimile of our HQ staffed by trained actors.</p><p>We call this “surviving the Matrix”—the final stage of your interview.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are sorry to say that we are moving forward with another candidate.</p><p>We have enjoyed getting to know you these past eight months. The entire team wishes you all the best in your job search.</p><p>Warmly,</p><p>Benji, Bubble C.E.O.</p></div></div></div></div>
