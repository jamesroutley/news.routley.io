            <span>Abstract:</span>Concentration is significant for maximizing potential in any activity. However, traditional methods to improve it often lack direct and natural feedback. We propose an innovative and inspiring VR system to experience and improve concentration. In the experience of pulling out the holy sword, which cannot be achieved simply by force, the player receives multimodal concentration feedback in visual, auditory, and haptic senses. We believe that this experience will help the user confront his/her concentration and improve the ability to control it consciously.
