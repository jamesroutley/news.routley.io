                                <p>The Federal Communications Commission has proposed a $504,000 fine against Fox after it used a three-second excerpt of the EAS tones as part of a 2021 promo for its “Fox NFL Sunday” program. Fox admits it downloaded the tones from a YouTube video for the promo, which aired on 190 television stations – including 29 it owns – as well as on its syndicated Fox Sports Radio on both broadcast and satellite radio, and online via its iHeartRadio web stream. If the fine is upheld, it would be the biggest ever fine issued by the FCC for misuse of EAS tones.</p><p>The FCC says its proposed fine is based on Fox’s admissions and its review of a video recording of the promotional segment. “Despite being shorter in duration than the full EAS Tones, the three-second EAS tone used in the promotional segment possessed the same dual-tone frequency, pitch, and timbre as the actual EAS tones, and was recognizable by viewers or listeners as substantially similar to the EAS tones, the FCC says. The Commission also says the segment’s comedic tone also “did not alter or neutralize its overall effect of falsely warning listeners and viewers of a non-existent emergency” since the tones were “clearly audible, cognizable, and appropriated for a non-emergency use.”</p><p>The Commission has previously applied an $8,000 base forfeiture for violations, but says the nature of EAS violations requires particularly serious consideration because, among other issues, such violations undermine the integrity of the EAS by desensitizing the public to the potential importance of warning tones.</p><p>“EAS violations therefore implicate substantial public safety concerns,” the FCC says in <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-4A1.pdf" target="_Blank"><span>the 12-page decision</span></a>. It says airing the bogus EAS tones on its 18 owned-and-operated television stations is enough to justify a $144,000 fine. But the FCC says an “an upward adjustment is warranted” because the promo also aired on all of Fox television network’s affiliates as well as on Fox Sports Radio and its scores of radio affiliates and SiriusXM.</p>
        <p>“Given the totality of the circumstances,” the Commission says, “we conclude that a proposed forfeiture of $504,000 is appropriate in this case for Fox’s apparent egregious violation.” The FCC also says it went tough on Fox due in part due to the fact that there has been “clear and unambiguous” notice to stations not to use EAS tones in programming or advertising not related to an actual emergency. It also says that the violation requires mandatory, not voluntary reporting. Under FCC rules, a broadcaster is required to notify the Commission within 24 hours of discovering it has transmitted a false alert to the public.</p><p>Fox did email the FCC’s operations center of the Nov. 28, 2021 segment, but the Commission says that email “does not constitute the type of good faith disclosure that warrants a reduction to the proposed forfeiture amount.”</p><p>For its part, Fox told the Commission that “all personnel involved in creation and review of the Nov. 28 segment … lacked full understanding of Fox’s policy against use of EAS attention signals.”</p><p>Fox now has 30 days to either pay the fine or to appeal, including seeking a reduction in its size. That may be difficult, however, since the FCC says in its proposal that the company had $4.44 billion of revenue in 2021.</p>
