OpenChess is a fully open source smart chessboard designed to make interactive, intelligent gameplay accessible to everyone. By combining low-cost electronics, 3D printing, and customizable software, OpenChess empowers makers, educators, and chess lovers to build their own connected chess experience â€” without the high price tag.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ Why OpenChess?</p>
<p>Most smart chessboards are expensive and closed-source. OpenChess changes that. Itâ€™s built from the ground up to be:</p>
<p>Affordable â€“ Uses a custom PCB with embedded magnetic sensors and LEDs for real-time move detection and feedback.</p>
<p>DIY-Friendly â€“ Print your own board, your own pieces, and assemble everything at home.</p>
<p>Programmable â€“ Based on Arduino, you can customize behavior, create new game modes, or build learning tools and challenges.</p>
<p>Modular &amp; Open â€“ Everything is open source. Remix the board, design your own pieces, or upgrade the electronics however you want.</p>
