<p>• UK funds a series of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01389-1">geoengineering experiments</a> to “buy time” in the race against climate change. Small-scale and cautious, they say. Ecologically sound, they say. Will certainly not be used as an excuse to not cut carbon emissions, they say.</p>
<p>We’ll see.</p>
<p><b>April ’25</b></p>
<p>• Trump opens protected marine conservation area <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-american-commercial-fishing-in-the-pacific/">to commercial fishing</a>. Because of course. PopSi coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/27/trump-fishing-regulation-order-pacific-islands">here</a>.</p>
<p>• Latest marine heatwave leaves <a href="https://www.coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php">over 80% of the world’s coral reefs impacted by bleaching</a>. On the upside, this is an official NOAA report on an ongoing environmental catastrophe. I thought they weren’t allowed to do that any more.</p>
<p>• Bypassing the International Seabed Authority, Trump signs executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/">opening the deep sea for commercial mining</a>. Because why refrain from fucking up an ecosystem just because it’s out of sight?</p>
<p>• Ocean heatwaves <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2413505122">three times longer and 1°C hotter</a> thanks to climate change. Only a paywalled preview link because the University of Toronto seems to have inexplicably stopped subscribing to PNAS, and I can’t find the paper on Sci-Hub. PopSci summary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/14/climate-crisis-has-tripled-length-of-deadly-ocean-heatwaves-study-finds">here</a></p>
<p>• “Entire asset classes are degrading in real time”. Top insurance company warns that climate change is “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/03/climate-crisis-on-track-to-destroy-capitalism-warns-allianz-insurer">on track to destroy capitalism</a>“. And yet, they say that as though it’s a <i>bad</i> thing.</p>
<p><b>March ’25</b></p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/12/global-weirding-climate-whiplash-hitting-worlds-biggest-cities-study-reveals">Canadian company in negotiations with Trump to mine seabed</a>. Because MAGATs aren’t the only assholes on the planet.</p>
<p>• South Korean wildfires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/27/south-korea-fires-death-toll-rises-worst-in-history">worst on record</a>.</p>
<p>• Another new buzzword for these times: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/28/deep-sea-mining-international-seabed-authority-canadian-the-metals-company-tmc-negotiations-trump-us">Global Weirding</a>“. AKA, “climate whiplash”.</p>
<p>• BP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back">abandoning its net-zero pledges</a> because, well, why the fuck not? They were empty anyway.</p>
<p><b>February ’25</b></p>
<p>• Looks like the odds are the AMOC <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08544-0">won’t be collapsing completely</a> before the end of the century— just “significantly weakening” by 50-80%. After 2100, though, all bets are off. Summary article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00551-z">here</a>.</p>
<p>• NOAA is now <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2469442-noaa-scientists-refuse-to-link-warming-weather-to-climate-change/">refusing to mention the C-words</a> when reporting record-breaking global temperatures.</p>
<p>• Last January <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/hottest-january-on-record-climate-scientists-global-temperatures-high">hottest on record</a>: 1.75°C above preindustrial baseline. So much for La Niña cooling the place down.</p>
<p>• “1.5°C is dead” is so passe. Based on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00139157.2025.2434494#abstract">these findings</a>, James Hansen now says that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/04/climate-change-target-of-2c-is-dead-says-renowned-climate-scientist">2°C is dead</a>, too.</p>
<p>In other news, the North Pole is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/04/temperatures-at-north-pole-20c-above-average-and-beyond-ice-melting-point">20°C warmer than it should be</a>. Assuming it’s not just some Chinese hoax.</p>
<p><b>January ’25</b></p>
<p>• Net Zero has “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/investor-climate-group-suspends-activities-after-blackrock-exit-2025-01-13/">suspended operations</a>” after Blackrock bails (the last straw in an ongoing procession of desertions from the world’s financial institutions).</p>
<p>• Four of Canada’s largest banks have also quit <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-banks-leave-net-zero-banking-alliance-1.7435273">Net-Zero</a>.</p>
<p>• I just learned a new word: “panzoonotic”. H5N1 is one. So far it’s infected over <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10902543/">48 mammalian species</a>.</p>
<p>• Lancet study estimates civilian deaths in Gaza at around <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02678-3/fulltext">64,260</a> from Oct 7 2023, to June 30 2024. Fun fact: that’s about 70% higher than estimates from the supposedly Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>• The six biggest banks in the US have all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/08/us-banks-quit-net-zero-alliance-before-trump-inauguration">bailed on Net Zero</a>. Because who cares about that shit now that Trump’s back in charge?</p>
<p>• Looks like a sea level rise of at least 1 m <a href="https://iccinet.org/statecryo24/">is now inevitable no matter what we do</a>, as early as 2070 under current emissions. 2-3m is “very likely”.</p>
<p>On the plus side, that means <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/04/climate-driven-sea-level-rise-set-to-flood-major-oil-ports">most of the world’s oil ports will be underwater</a> in less than fifty years.</p>
<p><b>December ’24</b></p>
<p>• Over half the current US population has been exposed to <a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.14072">adverse concentrations of lead</a>, resulting in elevated levels of mental illness.</p>
<p>Explains a lot.</p>
<p>• Geoffrey Hinton ups his guesstimate of AI-caused Human extinction to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/27/godfather-of-ai-raises-odds-of-the-technology-wiping-out-humanity-over-next-30-years">10-20%</a>” over the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Honestly, at this point, the sooner the better.</p>
<p>• 2024 officially the “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/2024-will-be-hottest-year-record-eu-scientists-say-2024-12-09/">hottest year on record</a>“.</p>
<p>• A whole new potential kind of environmental apocalypse: “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads9158">mirror life</a>“, based on biomolecules of reversed chirality. I’m sure we have nothing to worry about, though, now that the scientists have warned us of the dangers. Society always listens when scientists warn it of the dangers.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the whole mirror-life thing is old news in science fiction, dating at least back to 1970’s <i>Spock Must Die!</i> by James Blish, later to be ripped off by Sheri Tepper’s <i>Grass</i> in 1989.</p>
<p>• “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/01/international-talks-on-curbing-plastic-pollution-fail-to-reach-agreement-busan">International talks on curbing plastic pollution fail to reach agreement</a>“. Oh, and in case you missed it: the multicorporate entity “Alliance to End Plastic Waste” generated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/20/five-firms-in-plastic-pollution-alliance-made-1000-times-more-waste-than-they-saved-analysis-shows">1,000 times more plastic waste than they cleaned up</a>.</p>
<p><b>November ’24</b></p>
<p>• So it turns out that the usual collection of assholes and shitstains did, in fact, manage to effect real change at COP29 after all: they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/26/how-late-deal-left-a-sense-of-dissatisfaction-and-betrayal-at-cop29-baku">deleted the bit about “transitioning away from fossil fuels”</a>.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t know why they even bothered. It’s not like those things are ever binding anyway.</p>
<p>• 1.5° “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/18/climate-crisis-world-temperature-target">deader than a doornail</a>“. In other news, the Allieds storm the beaches of Normandy.</p>
<p>• Ah, crap: the planet will continue to warms for centuries <a href="https://theconversation.com/earths-climate-will-keep-changing-long-after-humanity-hits-net-zero-emissions-our-research-shows-why-241692">even after we hit net zero</a>. Assuming we ever do.</p>
<p>Tech specs <a href="https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/15/1353/2024/">here</a>.</p>
<p>• Oh, lookee here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-ceo-filmed-agreeing-to-facilitate-fossil-fuel-deals-at-climate-summit">Cop29 CEO filmed agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at climate summit</a>.</p>
<p>No big surprise, mind you. It’s not like this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/27/cop28-host-uae-planned-promote-oil-deals-climate-talks">hasn’t happened before</a>.</p>
<p>• Biodiversity COP16 turns out to have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/03/cop16-ends-in-disarry-and-indecision-despite-biodiversity-breakthroughs">a total clusterfuck</a>.</p>
<p>Not that we were expecting anything different, given that he international community has never met <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/15/every-global-target-to-stem-destruction-of-nature-by-2020-missed-un-report-aoe">a single fucking goal</a> in this particular arena.</p>
<p><b>October ’24</b></p>
<p>• Over a third of the world’s tree species currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/climate/trees-extinction-iucn-report-biodiversity.html">in danger of extinction</a>.</p>
<p>• Currently on track for <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024">2.6-3.1°C warming</a> by century’s end.</p>
<p>• Monkeypox has figured out how to spread <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03531-x">via direct human-to-human contact</a>, a step up from its original zoonotic mode of spreading. We’ve seen this before. Anyone remember Zika?</p>
<p>• Risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapsing in the near term have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/23/we-dont-know-where-the-tipping-point-is-climate-expert-on-potential-collapse-of-atlantic-circulation">“greatly underestimated”</a>.</p>
<p>• A decent overview of the various and sundry corporations who’ve chosen to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/net-zero-corporate-climate-targets-1.7338799">renege of their climate pledges</a>.</p>
<p>• Time to give up on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03266-9">direct-air carbon capture</a>. It was always a fool’s errand anyway.</p>
<p>2.7°C, here we come.</p>
<p><b>September ’24</b></p>
<p>• Everything tickety-boo! Nothing to see here!</p>
<p><b>August ’24</b></p>
<p>• Current ground temperatures on Antarctica are on average <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/antarctic-temperatures-rise-10c-above-average-in-near-record-heatwave">10°C higher than normal</a> (whatever “normal” means these days). Up to 25°C higher, in some spots.</p>
<p><b>July ’24</b></p>
<p>• This decade’s methane emissions—which have 80 times the heat-trapping power of CO<sub>2</sub>— have “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2024.1349770/full">far exceeded baseline projections</a>” and are accelerating. In completely unrelated news, Kamala Harris has reneged on an earlier pledge and, if elected, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/kamala-harris-fracking">will not ban fracking</a> after all.</p>
<p>• And now it’s Jasper’s turn to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wildfire-that-roared-into-jasper-was-a-wall-of-fast-moving-flame-says-fire-official-1.7274825">burn to the ground</a>. By way of poetic justice, the Trans-Mountain pipeline just happens to pass through that burg.)</p>
<p>• In unrelated news, last Sunday—July 21, 2024— was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/23/world-temperature-records-shattered-hottest-day-climate-crisis">the hottest day on record</a>, ever. Well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/24/record-hottest-day-earth-temperature-july">until Monday</a>, anyway.</p>
<p>• The next pandemic is expected to be “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02237-4">Bird Flu</a>” again? What is this, a clip show? Where’s Nipah when you need it?

PopSci coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/29/renewable-energy-us-financial-benefits">here</a>.</p>
<p>• Working paper (not yet peer reviewed) concludes that “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32450">macroeconomic damages from climate change are six times larger than previously thought</a>“. A mere 1°C increase (which, mind you, we’ve already passed) leads to a 12% decline in world GDP. PopSci coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/17/economic-damage-climate-change-report">here</a>.</p>
<p>If reality-based threats aren’t enough to get the politicians off their asses, maybe a threat to the global economy will. Not holding my breath, though.</p>
<p>• Global ocean temperatures have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68921215">breaking historical records for a solid year now</a>.</p>
<p>• Leafhoppers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-shifts-leafhopper-bug-plagues-argentinas-corn-fields-2024-05-07/">devastating Argentinian crops</a>. Winter frosts used to keep the insects in check, but, you know.</p>
<p>• We’ve already spent a year above 1.5°C, but that’s nothing; 78% of surveyed IPCC scientists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature">expect us to blow past 2.5°C</a> by century’s end (current trends <a>point to 2.7°C)</a>. “We live in an age of fools”, one scientist opines.</p>

<p>Of course, all those Exxon-Mobil CEOs will be long dead by then, so don’t expect anyone to move on this.</p>
