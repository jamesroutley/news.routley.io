<li><p>Level up your printf game and keep an actual event log. This will not tell you what the bug is, but where it is.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make logging frictionless. Make verbosity level configurable and make it easy to quickly toggle whole sections on and off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Log structured data and make it queryable. Bonus point for being able to reproduce the bug using the log itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think laterally and leverage all senses. I love using my peripheral vision or my ears. Trigger visual events and sounds as an alternative to printf.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep your code testable. Writing a unit test shouldn&#39;t require refactoring and writing mocks for 3h.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write down what you think is going on in plain English. I call it rubber-writing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grab a colleague and a whiteboard and explain the bug to them. Speaking is different than writing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw what you think is causing the bug. Use timing diagrams, causal diagrams, and class diagrams. Use colors and stickers. Write on top of previous diagrams as patterns emerge. A drawing is worth 1000 log lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Record your debugging session with a screen recording tool. You&#39;ll thank me if your bug hunt spans more than a single session.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Think hard and then take a walk.</p>
