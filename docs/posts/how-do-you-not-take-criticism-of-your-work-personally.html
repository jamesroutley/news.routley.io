    <h1>Ask HN: How do you not take criticism of your work personally?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve come to realize that I often take constructive criticisms personally. Everything from an unintentionally snarky comment in a PR I’ve made to someone highlight a mistake I’ve made that I probably couldn’t have known about.</p><p>I see this as one of my major flaws and try hard to mask how I feel.
