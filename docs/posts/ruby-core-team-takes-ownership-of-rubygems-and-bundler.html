    <p>Dear Ruby community,</p>

<p>RubyGems and Bundler are essential official clients for rubygems.org and the Ruby ecosystem, bundled with the Ruby language for many years and functioning as part of the standard library.</p>

<p>Despite this crucial role, RubyGems and Bundler have historically been developed outside the Ruby organization on GitHub, unlike other major components of the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>To provide the community with long-term stability and continuity, the Ruby core team, led by Matz, has decided to assume stewardship of these projects from Ruby Central. We will continue their development in close collaboration with Ruby Central and the broader community.</p>

<p>We want to emphasize the following important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repository ownership will transition to the Ruby core team to ensure long-term stability and alignment with the broader Ruby ecosystem. It will continue being managed by Ruby Central, now jointly with the Ruby core team.</li>
  <li>RubyGems and Bundler will remain open source under their current licenses, with no changes to licensing terms.</li>
  <li>All existing contributors retain full copyright and authorship of their code contributions. This transition does not affect any contributorâ€™s intellectual property rights.</li>
  <li>The collaborative, community-driven development process will continue as before, and we welcome contributions from all community members.</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition represents our commitment to ensuring the continued health, stability, and growth of the Ruby ecosystem for years to come. We are grateful to Ruby Central for their years of dedicated stewardship, and we look forward to working together with all members of the Ruby community to build an even brighter future for Ruby.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and contributions.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. Matz</p>
