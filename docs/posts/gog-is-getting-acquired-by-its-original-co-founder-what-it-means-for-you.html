<p>Hey everyone, GOG Team here.<br/></p>



<p>Today, Michał Kiciński, one of the co-founders of CD PROJEKT, and the co-founder of GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p>







<p>We believe the games that shaped us deserve to stay alive: easy to find, buy, download, and play forever. But time is annoyingly good at erasing them. Rights get tangled, compatibility breaks, builds disappear, and a nostalgic evening often turns into a troubleshooting session. That’s the difference between “I’m playing today” (the game lives on) and “I’ll play someday” (the game dies).</p>



<p>As Michał put it: “GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control.”</p>



<p>GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.</p>



<p>This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.</p>







<p>First of all, DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever. Your library stays yours to enjoy: same access, same offline installers, same sense of ownership. Your data stays with GOG, and GOG GALAXY remains optional.</p>



<p>We’ll keep our relationship with CD PROJEKT. CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on <a href="http://gog.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform. </p>



<p>If you’re a GOG Patron, or you donate to support the Preservation Program, those funds stay within GOG. Your support has been huge this year, and we think that with your help, we can undertake even more ambitious rescue missions in 2026 and 2027. We’ll have more to say about that sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>GOG will remain  independent in its operations. We will continue building a platform that’s ethical, non-predatory, and made to last, while helping indie developers reach the world. We’re also committed to giving the community a stronger voice, with new initiatives planned for 2026.</p>



<p>Thanks for being the reason this all matters.</p>



<p>A lot of companies sell games. Fewer do the unglamorous work of making sure the games that shaped people’s lives don’t quietly rot into incompatibility.</p>



<p>Thanks for caring about this mission with us. We’ll keep you posted as we ship, and in the meantime, you can dig into the full FAQ for the detailed answers.</p>
