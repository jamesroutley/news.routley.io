    <h1>NIR: Nim Intermediate Representation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div id="post-content-parent"><div id="post-content-wrapper"><p>I will preface this with a disclaimer: This post is a rant I needed to make, to get it out of my system and hopefully find I wasn&#39;t alone in this feeling. It is sincere, but it is also a product of profound privilege. The fact that this is my biggest problem is rather an indictment of what little serious problems I have at the end of the day. So this will be tiring to read for anyone subject to real marginalization, or even really anyone who&#39;s a real adult and too busy to wax philosophical about nonsense, and I sincerely apologize for that. This is not meant to critique everyone who works in technology, especially the vast numbers of people for whom it&#39;s a way to climb the economic ladder in ways that are becoming increasingly inaccessible.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just recently entered college, and I&#39;m finally fully trying to lay out a path before me to decide what precisely I want to do with my life. But I&#39;m finding a problem, and it seems a rather serious one to me, at least with what perspective I have.</p>
<p>I feel as though I&#39;m cursed with the capability and heartfelt desire to work on technology amid a world that has been in many ways made infinitely worse by people like me. I feel truly passionate about many things, in the way that young people do, I suppose, and I want to believe that technological skill can continue somehow to contribute to those causes, but I know on some level that it is a lie. A hopeless lie that I was sold when I was far too young to discern its nature.</p>
<p>I was lied to by people who believed that they could change the world for the better through inserting technology where it simply didn&#39;t belong, and call it disruption. By people who, in many cases sincerely, believed that freezing code into law, both in the literal sense or within large complex automation-ridden systems; with the notion that code was somehow inherently dispassionate, could subtract human error from systems susceptible to it; without realizing that they were simply codifying the existing systemic biases of our world in ways that made them even harder to correct.</p>
<p>Given the sheer amount of systemic injustices I benefit from - economic inequality, patriarchy, heteronormativity, elitism, racism, ableism and countless others that I will never come close to being able to truly acknowledge - I should be trying to find any way I can to pay back what I took and will continue to take for the rest of my life from society. But in truth, I have spent so long basing my very identity on this deified idea - this lie - of the &#34;tech industry&#34;, building my skills, and dreams, and sometimes I feel my very neurological pathways on it, that I feel lost. Now I feel, with some newly gained perspectives, that my dreams are not merely worthless but in many very real ways, actively evil. And I&#39;m not sure how to fix that.</p>
