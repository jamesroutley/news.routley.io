<p>Rolls-Royce, a flagship company in Britain, makes jet engines and systems on planes such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. It was, like many companies, hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic when air travel was grounded, and Rolls-Royce cut 9,000 jobs as a result. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/28/rolls-royce-tufan-erginbilgic/">“axeman”</a> Erginbilgiç took the helm, bringing an aggressive rethink to the company to save it while slashing divisions such as R2 Factory, an in-house artificial intelligence software unit, and a direct air carbon capture project. Last month, Rolls-Royce said it would cut 2,500 management and administration jobs.</p>



<p>The next head to roll is its electrical business, which develops propulsion systems for flying taxis and other aircraft. <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/28-11-2023-capital-markets-day.aspx">In an announcement yesterday</a>, Erginbilgiç said the company needed to make “choices on resource allocation” and that the electric business would offer “better value to a third party.”</p>



<p>While the company is also working on hydrogen technology with EasyJet, <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/28-11-2023-capital-markets-day.aspx">Erginbilgiç says</a> he believes that hydrogen is a long way off from being a viable solution for long-haul flights and that sustainable aviation fuels will be the way forward for aviation to achieve net-zero climate goals. Airbus, however, is working toward having hydrogen-powered planes in service by 2035.</p>
