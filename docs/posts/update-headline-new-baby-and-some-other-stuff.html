    <h1>Update - Headline - New Baby, and some other stuff</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><section><p>On January 5th, I had my second baby! -- a tiny lil boy named Dino.</p><p>How has it been? Unsurprisingly, it&#39;s been much harder than our first. Not because the baby is harder, but because we also have a toddler, which is really hard!</p><p>I heard from a few second time parents: &#34;One is none, two is ten.&#34; It&#39;s great quip. Fortunately, it hasn&#39;t been that extreme for us, and I&#39;m really grateful to have some time on paid parental leave - which makes it all much more bearable and humane.</p><p>At the end of the year, my partner and I got a tarot reading from the amazing <a href="https://daniellebaskin.com/" target="_blank">Danielle Baskin</a> on her new tarot reading platform <a href="https://moonlight.world/" target="_blank">moonlight.world</a>.</p><p>She pulled a card to represent the upcoming relationship between my partner and me. Horrifyingly, (as you&#39;ll see from the artwork), we pulled the <a href="https://biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/minor-arcana/suit-of-pentacles/five-of-pentacles/" target="_blank">5 of pentacles</a>. Traditional readings indicate this is not good, but Danielle pointed out that it&#39;s one of the few cards that feature a couple as the cards protagonist -- tough roads ahead, for us to walk together.</p><p>This has become something of a mantra for us - so I got to photoshop and made this image -- something that I expect to make a <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/custom-duds">custom dud</a> for soon.</p><p><img alt="we walk these roads together" src="https://aaronstrick.com/update/images/updates/walk-these-roads.jpg"/></p><p>Exciting news! I finished it!!</p><p>So, now I have a <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/projects/the-golem">project page</a> for it (Some of what made it really interesting to work on is listed here). But also - here&#39;s a direct link to <a href="https://www.samreidermusic.com/experience-the-golem" target="_blank">the experience</a>.</p><p><img alt="The Golem" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/projects/the-golem/seo.jpg"/></p><div id="first-ever-update-to-wikipedia"><h3>First ever update to wikipedia</h3></div><p>In other news, since the last site update - I made my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_gravity_hills&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1236837048" target="_blank">first contribution</a> to wikipedia!</p><p>I learned the name for an optical illusion where the relative geography makes a downward slope appear to be running upward. It&#39;s known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_hill" target="_blank">gravity hill</a>. When I was in high school, a friend of mine made a scavenger hunt for another friend that featured a &#34;the place where water flows up hill&#34; in Golden Gate Park -- and ever since then, it&#39;s been a favorite &#34;hidden attraction&#34; of the park for me.</p><p>I was shocked then, when wikipedia&#39;s list of gravity hills didn&#39;t include it! I was excited to take action (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_gravity_hills&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1236837048" target="_blank">the diff</a>):</p><p><img alt="screenshot of my wikipedia edit" src="https://aaronstrick.com/update/images/updates/wikipedia.jpeg"/></p><p>Also - here&#39;s our 2025 New Years card to add to <a href="https://aaronstrick.com/happy-new-year">the collection</a>.</p><p><img alt="happy 2025" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/happy-new-year/new-year-2025.jpg"/></p><p>It&#39;s been 7 months since my last website update. Obviously - so much. It feels kind of absurd choosing a select few things to add, but, that&#39;s how it goes. A new baby and wikipedia.</p></section></div></div>
