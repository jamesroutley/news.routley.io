                    The  French government is putting a plan in place to deal with the looming energy crisis as fears rise of electricity power cuts. A directive will be sent to regional police chiefs to anticipate scheduled power cuts, which could affect 60 percent of the population in the  worst-case scenario.                </p>

                    <p>At the moment, half of the country&#39;s reactors are offline because of ongoing or delayed maintenance, or corrosion problems. The new generation of power stations has yet to be built.</p><p>As a result, France will be &#34;a major importer of electricity this winter&#34; to compensate, explains Xavier Piechaczyk, chairman of the management board of <a href="https://www.rte-france.com/" target="_blank">RTE</a>, which manages the country&#39;s electricity transmission network.</p><ul>  	<li><a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20221118-french-electricity-network-facing-blackout-risk-in-january" target="_self"><strong>France&#39;s electricity grid warns it will strain to deliver this winter</strong></a></li></ul><p>&#34;Historically, France is an exporter because of its very large nuclear fleet, however, now it turns out that it has temporary difficulties ... (which) will be resolved but it will take a few years,&#34; he told France Info on Thursday.</p><p>He said France would turn to European neighbours to import up to 15 GW, which represents &#34;a useful amount&#34; to cope with a peak in electricity consumption of around 90 GW, and &#34;contributes to being able to avoid cuts&#34;.</p><p>There is &#34;a risky situation but these cuts should not be considered inevitable&#34;, he said.</p><h2>Energy saving &#39;paying off&#39;</h2><p>In the last few weeks, the government has launched a major publicity campaign encouraging French citizens and companies to reduce energy consumption and cut down on wasteful practices.</p><p>This means reducing heating to 19°C maximum, turning off unused appliances, and for businesses, switching off unnecessary lighting or advertising at night.</p><p>On Tuesday, government spokesperson Olivier Véran told the Council of Ministers that the energy saving plan &#34;is already bearing fruit&#34;, noting a five percent reduction in energy use overall.</p><p>Milder temperatures have contributed, he said, indicating that as winter progressed, the demands on electricity for heating would obviously increase.</p><ul>  	<li><a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20221022-french-climate-activists-target-store-lights-in-paris-night-raids-energy-crisis-environment" target="_self"><strong>French climate activists target store lights in Paris night raids</strong></a></li>  	<li><a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20220914-city-of-light-paris-flicks-dimmer-switch-to-save-on-energy-costs" target="_self"><strong>&#39;City of Light&#39; Paris flicks dimmer switch to save on energy costs</strong></a></li></ul><p>French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, who has been holding weekly crisis meetings on the energy issue, said she would be sending a directive to prefects around the country this week to prepare for eventual planned electricity cuts to avoid a major blackout.</p><p>One of the key concerns is the question of how to maintain telephone access to emergency numbers, an issue the government admits it has not yet resolved.</p><p>In addition, police chiefs will be asked to reinforce patrols in the absence of street lights in public spaces and deal with a contingency plan for public transport, notably electric trains.</p><p>&#34;Nothing is excluded, nothing is confirmed. But it&#39;s our responsibility, and we are preparing,&#34; Véran said, insisting that the government&#39;s intention was not to frighten the population.</p><p>He added that the implementation of an emergency plan would depend largely on how cold temperatures would be over the winter.</p><h2>Return to coal</h2><p>In a worst-case scenario, the risk of cuts would impact 60 percent of the population, but would never affect an entire region or department.</p><p>The plan would exclude critical infrastructure such as hospitals, police stations or fire stations.</p><p>An online system called <a href="https://www.monecowatt.fr/" target="_blank">Ecowatt</a> has already been set up to inform citizens of future cuts and help them reduce their consumption.</p><p>Some 10,000 households have subscribed to the app, which sends out alerts in case of a problem.</p><p>In the meantime, the government is also temporarily returning to coal for electricity needs. A coal station in Saint-Avold in the east of France, which had shut down earlier this year, started up again on Monday.</p><ul>  	<li><a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20221129-france-reboots-coal-fired-power-plant-to-boost-winter-electricity-supplies" target="_self"><strong>France reboots coal-fired power plant to boost winter electricity supplies</strong></a></li></ul><p>Electricity consumption in France fell by 6.7 percent last week compared to the average for previous years (2014-2019), a drop &#34;largely concentrated in the industrial sector&#34;, according to RTE&#39;s latest report on Tuesday.</p><p>But it warns that consumption had not shifted in the tertiary sector, which could put pressure on electricity demands in the future.</p>
