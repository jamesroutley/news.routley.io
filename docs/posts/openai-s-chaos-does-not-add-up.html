<p>A list of things that a coherent story does not make:</p>
<ul><li><p>Sam Altman crafts an elaborate non-profit structure but gets completely blindsided by the possibility of the board overthrowing them.  </p></li><li><p>Microsoft invests $10 billion but apparently has no checks in place to know what&#39;s happening with their investment.</p></li><li><p>The board moves quickly to sack the CEO but then falls completely silent, thus almost intentionally losing the communication war.</p></li><li><p> Sam Altman says he wants to develop AI for the benefit of humanity yet at the first possible moment he sets up a deal that sells 49% of their endeavor to Microsoft. </p></li><li><p>After getting kicked out of OpenAI, his first move is to start a brain drain campaign and move their operations under the wings of Microsoft. </p></li><li><p>Ilya is never actually publicly blamed for the coup but is logically assumed to be at fault. He does not communicate at allâ€¦ until posting a regretful apology for merely &#34;participating&#34; in the board&#39;s actions. </p></li><li><p>The board is made up seemingly random selection of people, one of them leading a potential OpenAI competitor. </p></li></ul>
