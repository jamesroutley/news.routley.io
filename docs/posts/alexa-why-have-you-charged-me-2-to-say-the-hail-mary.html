    <h1>Alexa, why have you charged me £2 to say the Hail Mary?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>W</span></span><span>hen my 87-year-old mother, Patricia Collinson, was given an Alexa speaker by my sister, she was delighted to find she could ask it to say the Hail Mary. Every morning for a week the devout Catholic asked Alexa to recite the prayer.</span></p><p>What she was less delighted to learn was that she had unwittingly ordered a premium subscription payable through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a> to a private company called Catholic Prayers. </p><p>Patricia, a retired district nurse in Hastings, does not own a computer, and does not know how to use one. She had signed up by voice command, without being presented with the kind of outline or terms and conditions that now comes as standard when you pay for things online.</p><p>Her experience throws a spotlight on a relatively new phenomenon, Alexa “skills”. Launched in the UK in 2016, these are the voice service’s version of apps. There are 45,000 in the UK, which range from security offerings (such as enabling your Alexa to hear breaking glass or a smoke alarm) through to recipe ideas and even “send a hug” services.</p><p>Although they are usually free to order verbally over Amazon’s Alexa, many also encourage in-app purchases – which can be made simply by saying “yes”.</p><p>Patricia says that at no point did she understand she was making a purchase or entering into a subscription.</p><p>“I got into the habit most mornings of coming downstairs, sitting in my recliner and saying: ‘Good morning, Alexa. Can you say the Hail Mary please,’” she says.</p><p>“It never asked for money. It never said it was charging me. It was completely news to me.”</p><p>The Alexa was set up by my sister, Catherine, and is attached to her Amazon account. She spotted an unusual email from the retailer, which said: “Order confirmation. Your payment has been processed and your subscription term has started.”</p><p>Fortunately the subscription was only for £1.99 a month, and there was a free seven-day cancellation period, which Catherine caught just in time. But my sister is still befuddled as to how my mother could have entered into the contract, and how, had she not noticed the email, my mother would now be paying.</p><p>“Thank goodness she didn’t ask Alexa to say the Rosary,” my sister joked, referring to the set of prayers that includes 53 Hail Marys.</p><p>But there is a serious point here. Digital voice assistants, such as those from Amazon and Google, are now in millions of UK homes. Vulnerable consumers including children and the non-computer-savvy can inadvertently enter into premium subscriptions simply by saying yes.</p><figure id="97aff5b7-cb84-4d53-992c-623a203c401b"
