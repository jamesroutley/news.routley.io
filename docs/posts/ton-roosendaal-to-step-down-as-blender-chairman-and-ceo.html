<p>Roosendaal – the <a href="https://www.blender.org/about/history/" target="_blank">original author</a> of the open-source 3D software, and its public figurehead for the past three decades – will pass on his roles to current Blender COO Francesco Siddi.</p>
<p>Roosendaal himself will move to the newly established Blender Foundation supervisory board.</p>
<p>Other new Blender Foundation board positions will also include Sergey Sharybin (Head of Development), Dalai Felinto (Head of Product) and Fiona Cohen (Head of Operations).</p>
<p>“We’ve been preparing for this since 2019,” said Roosendaal, “I am very proud to have such a wonderfully talented young team around me to bring our free and open source project into the next decade.”</p>
<p><em>We aim to update this story with a brief retrospective of Ton’s time as Blender CEO and the growth of Blender during that time, so check back for updates.</em></p>
