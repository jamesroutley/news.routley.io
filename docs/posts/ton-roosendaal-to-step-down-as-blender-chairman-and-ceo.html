    <h1>Ton Roosendaal to step down as Blender chairman and CEO</h1>

<p>Roosendaal – the original author of the open-source 3D software, and its public figurehead for the past three decades – will pass on his roles to current Blender COO Francesco Siddi.</p>
<p>Roosendaal himself will move to the newly established Blender Foundation supervisory board.</p>
<p>Other new Blender Foundation board positions include Head of Development Sergey Sharybin, Head of Product Dalai Felinto, and Head of Operations Fiona Cohen.</p>

<p><em>Ton Roosendaal in the early 1990s. Blender originated as in-house software at NeoGeo, the animation studio he co-founded.</em></p>

<p>Although initially set to become a commercial product, when investors decided to pull the plug on Not a Number, the firm he had founded to develop Blender, Roosendaal went open-source. </p>
<p>A crowdfunding campaign quickly raised the €110,000 needed to buy back the code base, and on 13 October 2002, Blender was released to the world under a GPL licence.</p>
<p>From the start, two things distinguished Blender from most other open-source CG applications.</p>
<p>First, even before the first release, Roosendaal established the non-profit <a href="https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/" target="_blank">Blender Foundation</a>, so development was run through an organization akin to a commercial software developer.</p>
<p>Second, the software was tested in something close to real-world production conditions, on a series of ‘open movies’, beginning with 2006’s <a href="https://orange.blender.org/" target="_blank">Elephants Dream</a>, and <a href="https://studio.blender.org/films/" target="_blank">continuing to this day</a>.</p>
<p>The early open movies – funded through a combination of DVD pre-sales and arts grants – also provided valuable exposure for Blender, and illustrated Roosendaal’s gifts as a producer and promoter: a mixture of passion, physical presence, and sheer force of personality.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Blender from fan favorite to staple of professional production</strong></p>
<p>A major turning point was the release of <a href="https://www.cgchannel.com/2019/07/blender-2-80-ships/" target="_blank">Blender 2.80</a>: the 2019 update that addressed many of the UI and workflow issues that had previously alienated artists used to commercial 3D apps.</p>
<p>It catalysed support for Blender among big tech firms, with a <a href="https://www.cgchannel.com/2019/07/epic-games-donates-1-2-million-to-blender-development/" target="_blank">landmark $1.2 million grant</a> from Epic Games followed by backing from companies including AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm.</p>
<p>Last year, the Corporate Patrons of the <a href="https://fund.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender Development Fund</a> accounted for just under 40% of the <a href="https://download.blender.org/foundation/Blender-Foundation-Annual-Report-2024.pdf" target="_blank">collective income</a> of the Blender organizations.</p>
<p>The resulting €3.1 million paid the salaries of over 15 full-time developers, plus a similar number of tech support staff and part-time devs: a larger team than many commercial CG tools.</p>

<p><em>Roosendaal (right) introduces the new Blender leadership team: (L-R) incoming CEO Francesco Siddi, Sergey Sharybin, Dalai Felinto and Fiona Cohen.</em></p>

<p>When I interviewed him in 2019 for an article in a UK tech magazine, he described himself, quite accurately, as “the incarnation of Blender”.</p>
<p>But in the same interview, he noted that “Blender is much bigger than me” and commented: “Now I need to get the organisation working without me, and then I can move on.”</p>
<p>Six years later, those plans have finally come to fruition, with the appointment of a new Blender leadership team.</p>
<p><strong>From single figurehead to four core leadership roles</strong></p>
<p>It’s telling that rather than trying to appoint one person to fulfil all four roles, they have been split out to four separate people.</p>
<p>Former animation producer Fiona Cohen takes on the organizational role, as the Blender Foundation’s new Head of Operations. </p>
<p>The developer role will be taken by Blender Lead Engineer Sergey Sharybin in his new role as the Foundation’s Head of Development.</p>
<p>The designer role passes to another long-time Blender artist and developer, Dalai Felinto, as the new Head of Product.</p>
<p>The critical entrepreneurial role will be fulfilled by current Blender COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsiddi/" target="_blank">Francesco Siddi</a>, who takes on Roosendaal’s job tiles of chairman and CEO.</p>
<p>Siddi first began working with the Blender organization in 2012, as a VFX artist on the open movie Tears of Steel, later acting as a web developer and pipeline developer.</p>
<p>He began working as a producer on subsequent open movies in 2017, and has managed Blender’s industry relations since 2020.</p>
<p>“I am very proud to have such a wonderfully talented young team around me to bring our free and open source project into the next decade,” commented Roosendaal.</p>
