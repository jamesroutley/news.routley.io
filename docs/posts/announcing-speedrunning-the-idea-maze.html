Starting a new company?</h2><h3 id="youre-probably-quietly-terrified-and-that%E2%80%99s-ok">You&apos;re probably quietly terrified ... and that&#x2019;s ok.</h3><p>For most people, launching a new product is the scariest thing they&#x2019;ll do.&#xA0;</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re a founder, launching your first startup, or a product manager, launching a new initiative for your company. As you build your thing, you begin to wonder:</p><ul><li>What if people don&#x2019;t buy it?</li><li>What if it doesn&#x2019;t amount to much?</li><li>What if I get career blowback on this?&#xA0;</li><li><strong>I&#x2019;ve already spent so much time, what if it doesn&#x2019;t work out?</strong></li></ul><p>This is normal. Creating and launching a brand new product is the closest thing to pure uncertainty that most folks will face.&#xA0;</p><p>And! If you&#x2019;re like most folks, you&#x2019;d reach for books and frameworks that TELL YOU HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL &#x2014; with the implication that you can increase the odds of your success.</p><p><em>And maybe they will!&#xA0;</em></p><p>But the odds are actually pretty good that <strong>they&#x2019;re not going to work</strong>, and that your experience is going to be <em>very different</em> from whatever your framework teaches you.&#xA0;</p><p>Because &#x2014; and this is something that anyone <em>honest</em> will tell you &#x2014; <strong>there is no silver bullet to finding product market fit</strong>.&#xA0;</p><ol><li>Every company&#x2019;s experience of PMF is going to be different</li><li>Most frameworks do not work most of the time, and</li><li>Many successful attempts at PMF were by folks <strong>who had to go at it a number of times over the course of their careers</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="so-this-is-not-a-course-that-teaches-you-a-framework-for-finding-product-market-fit">So: this is NOT a course that teaches you a framework for finding product market fit.</h2><p>This is a course designed <em>to accelerate your expertise through compressed experience</em>. Synthetic experience, sure, but experience nevertheless.</p><p>What do we mean by this?&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Think about going on a first date.</strong> If you&#x2019;ve never gone on a first date before, you&#x2019;re probably going to be very nervous. You&#x2019;ll make mistakes. You may say things that &#x2014; with the benefit of hindsight &#x2014; you will see as dumbass moves.</p><p>But you get better. The more first dates you go on, the better things will go &#x2014; even if you <em>don&#x2019;t</em> read books or articles or watch YouTube videos or have conversations with your friends about what to do.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The glib answer is that you have more experiences. You know what to expect. You are <strong>better calibrated to do first dates</strong>.&#xA0;</p><p>Notice the following:</p><ul><li>You know that the next time you go on a first date is going to be different from the previous time. You&#x2019;re meeting a new person, after all. You&#x2019;re still nervous.&#xA0;</li><li>But at the same time, you&#x2019;re not <em>too </em>nervous. There are things that you expect. The small talk becomes easier. The uncertainty is more manageable. You&#x2019;re less surprised by how each date unfolds.&#xA0;</li><li>And so while each date is <strong>unique and different</strong>, you get better at this first date thing &#x2026; so that hopefully you don&#x2019;t have to do first dates anymore.</li></ul><p>The same applies to searching for product market fit (PMF).</p><ul><li><strong>Every hunt for PMF is going to be different</strong>. Every new product you build will be unique &#x2014; unique market, different customers, different competitors, a custom value proposition.</li><li>But if you&#x2019;ve seen the <em>many </em>ways that PMF journeys can go, <strong>you&#x2019;ll be less surprised</strong>. You&#x2019;ll be more comfortable making decisions under the cloud of uncertainty &#x2014; where you <em>don&#x2019;t</em> know if your decisions are good or bad.</li><li>You&#x2019;ll have a lighter grip on the whole process. You&#x2019;ll be more willing to roll with the punches when they come. And you&#x2019;re more equipped to say: &#x201C;ok, that didn&#x2019;t work, let&#x2019;s have another go.&#x201D;</li></ul><p>With one catch.&#xA0;</p><p>First dates last at most one night. A search for PMF can last <em>years</em>.&#xA0;</p><p>Which is where this course can help.</p><h2 id="introducing-speedrunning-the-idea-maze-the-goal-of-this-course-is-to-compress-more-than-65-years-of-product-market-fit-experiences-into-four-weeks">Introducing <strong>Speedrunning the Idea Maze</strong>. The goal of this course is to compress more than 65 years of product market fit experiences into four weeks.</h2><p>Over the course of four sessions, we will walk you through <strong>ten journeys </strong>of companies and products that have found PMF. Most of these journeys took between two and 15 years.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll experience these cases as they happen, with enough detail to make you feel like you&#x2019;re experiencing the journey for yourself.</p><p>We will make sense of these cases as a group &#x2013; comparing the different paths with each other, and also with your experiences, before gradually introducing the tiny handful of frameworks that actually work under such uncertainty.&#xA0;</p><p>In other words, we&#x2019;re trying to give you memories, <em>without the cost of years</em>.</p><p><strong>Speedrunning the Idea Maze costs $1000 per person and is limited to 30 people.&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>The program is first come, first served, and the deadline for purchase is Monday, 21st July 2025.</strong></p><p>The program consists of 90 minute slots held once a week, for four weeks.

    <p class="box__heading">How do we know this approach works?</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Speedrunning the Idea Maze is built around an expertise acceleration approach called Cognitive Flexibility Theory, that has been used by the US military (amongst other organisations) to speed up training.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The theory explains why investors and businesspeople think in terms of <em>fragments</em> of cases when reasoning about their domain. It tells us why folks like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger read and collect large amounts of biographies and company reports .. and more importantly <em>how they consume them</em>.</p>
