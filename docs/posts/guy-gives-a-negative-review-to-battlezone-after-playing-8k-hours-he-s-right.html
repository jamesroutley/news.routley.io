<p>No one is as vicious about a game as its most dedicated player.

It&#39;s a relationship with a single piece of art that I can&#39;t really fathom. My favourite game of all time is Morrowind and I&#39;ve poured a paltry few hundred hours into that. My most-played, according to Steam? Fallout: New Vegas with 650ish hours, a mere 7% of Smith&#39;s total in BZ98R. I have only positive things to say about either. Naturally, I had to leverage my position as a PCG writer to reach out to Smith and see if he&#39;d chat about what makes him tick.</p><h2 id="moon-units-3">Moon units</h2><p>&#34;I don&#39;t blame people for thinking that something is wrong with me after playing over 8,000 hours of a game only to leave a negative review,&#34; says Smith. &#34;Anyone who came back to either BZ1 or BZ2 after a decade or more, specifically the multiplayer, and also sticks around to this day, has something seriously wrong with them.&#34;</p><p>But Smith clearly still lives and breathes the game, even if he&#39;s long-since fallen off the BZ98R train. His chatter is peppered with references to obscure devs, infamous community figures, niche bugs, and a litany of grievances. &#34;I believe that I received Battlezone along with a handful of other games from my mother for Christmas in 1999… I can tell you that I still had 56k [dial-up internet] as I remember downloading the 1.31 and 1.4 patches… and suffering.&#34;</p><a target="_blank" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-320-80.jpg" alt="Assaulting a base." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfY97SDZ99KitqogqYDaoX.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rebellion)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>Those were the Battlezone salad days.

Jump sniping in the remaster, for instance, is inauthentic to this day. &#34;It took some skill to abuse this aspect of the [original] game,&#34; says Smith, detailing a process whereby players would have to repeatedly bunny-hop while undeploying their snipers before they touched the ground and became rooted in place. In BZ98R it&#39;s a walk in the park: &#34;You can just hold the jump key with the sniper rifle deployed indefinitely without having to worry about it.&#34;</p><p>The kind of bug that might annoy an old-timer, sure, but you probably wouldn&#39;t warn new players away for it. But others are worse. One bug lets players detonate a specific kind of bomb in their own base without taking damage themselves, providing a hacky way to vaporise invaders. Another? The remaster&#39;s minimap reveals everything where the original only showed the areas your radar covered—essentially abolishing fog of war from the game&#39;s RTS layer.</p><p>There are plenty more besides, but Smith&#39;s most trenchant criticisms go back to the multiplayer. His number one complaint is the netcode. Community legend holds, says Smith, that BZ98R&#39;s multiplayer code was ginned up &#34;&#39;in about a week&#39;,&#34; though he isn&#39;t sure if that&#39;s really true.</p><a target="_blank" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-320-80.jpg" alt="A loading screen showing a close-up of a speedy space tank." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6EHy3riVWJ4HosmvcVdnX.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rebellion)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>Still, the fact it <em>could</em> be believed says a lot. &#34;Players get disconnected too easily and it often has nothing to do with the quality of their internet connection… In the past, both Battlezone remasters had repeat issues with their multiplayer servers and I was DEEPLY involved in trying to get that addressed.

He sent support requests, but they were closed without answer. He took a look at the players themselves and, where usually a tag would list if a player was on Steam or GOG, theirs would just say &#34;Other.&#34;</p><a target="_blank" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-320-80.jpg" alt="An overhead view of a battle between space tanks." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHWzcvNgHmm9tJqYBaE8nX.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rebellion)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>&#34;They sit in the lobby, and then the game closes, and that&#39;s when things started getting pretty obvious that something was going on.&#34;</p><p>Smith operated in gumshoe mode for a year, &#34;collecting all this information,&#34; and eventually settled on a theory.

The community never got a firm answer, but the whole episode seems emblematic of Smith&#39;s relationship with BZ98R: A lack of trust and communication, and a feeling that something that had once been the domain of a passionate and active few had been taken over and puppeted by outside forces.</p><h2 id="and-i-would-play-600-more-3">And I would play 600 more</h2><p>Smith says he no longer plays BZ98R, though he does boot up the remaster of the sequel—Battlezone: Combat Commander—from time to time. He wrote his review in August 2021, five years after the remaster came out. &#34;I don&#39;t think anything in particular triggered me to finally write my review. I had meant to do so for YEARS,&#34; he says. He just happened to get around to it (it is quite lengthy) at that time.</p><p>But the question remains: Steam the eternal tattle-tale says that, even after he wrote that review, Smith poured almost 600 extra hours into BZ98R, a game that had destroyed the multiplayer scene he was part of and that was still riddled with bugs he considered unforgivable.
