    <h1>I tracked everything I read on the internet for a year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since early July 2021, I&#39;ve been keeping <a href="https://pages.tdpain.net/readingList" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record of every article I read on the internet</a>, which at the time of writing, is <del>just</del> <em>a few months</em> over a year&#39;s worth or articles.<sup id="marker-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> Every article I read, I put on the list - and as it turns out, I read a fair amount. I thought I&#39;d take a moment to do some stats, talk about how the list works and why I do it.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are 1024 articles in my list. On average, I&#39;ve read ~2.4 articles in each of the 421 days since I started the list. The majority of those articles come from the Hacker News digest email I get every morning or the long list of RSS feeds I subscribe to<sup id="marker-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, but I also find articles in a smattering of other places, like Reddit or a news app of some sort.</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing interesting about the graph of the number of articles I&#39;ve read over time. It&#39;s a straight line.</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/assets/img/blog/a-year-of-reading/articlesOverTime.png" alt="Articles over time"/></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see where I hit my &#34;personal best&#34; of 15 articles in a day on 2022-04-06. My calendar says that day in particular was during a holiday, so I can only imagine the 15 articles was the result of a few lazy hours in bed one morning.</p>
<p>What&#39;s a little more interesting is the data about the sites I was actually reading.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve read pages on 596 unique websites.<sup id="marker-3"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> I only read articles on 116, or 19.46%, of those websites more than once.</p>
<p>The top three most-read websites in my list are:</p>
<ol>
<li>the BBC (<code>www.bbc.co.uk</code>), 79 articles (!)</li>
<li>Xe Iaso&#39;s blog (<a href="https://xeiaso.net" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>xeiaso.net</code></a>), 26 articles</li>
<li>Ars Technica (<code>arstechnica.com</code>), 24 articles</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other notable mentions are <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rachelbythebay.com</code></a> (9th, 9 articles), <a href="https://simonwillison.net" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>simonwillison.net</code></a> (14th, 7 articles), and <a href="https://jvns.ca" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>jvns.ca</code></a> (16th, 6 articles).</p>
<p>I wish there was an easy way to filter by &#34;independent websites&#34;, but there isn&#39;t. There&#39;s quite a lot of commercial domains on the top end of my most-visited list, I&#39;d like to see a ranking of my most visited independent websites.</p>

<p>Somehow, I have to add an article to my reading list. The easiest way I came up with to do this was with a JavaScript bookmarklet.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty simple - it gathers the URL, page title and meta description and image, then modifies <code>window.location.href</code> to redirect me to an endpoint on this website. That endpoint processes the input data then redirects me back to the original article. If you&#39;re interested, <a href="https://gist.github.com/codemicro/f7d4d4b687c3ec2e7186ef7efecfcc35" rel="noopener noreferrer">the source code can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s done this way because some websites restrict what HTTP requests can be made with JavaScript on their site. I originally tried to use the <code>Fetch</code> (or was it <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>?) API to save the data, but quickly ran into the a dead-end and pivoted to using the current redirect-based method.</p>
<p>Since I use Firefox on both the desktop and my Android phone, my bookmarklet auto-syncs between my devices. It&#39;s fairly easy to add to my reading list on my phone, which is pretty handy as that&#39;s where I do a large portion of my reading.</p>

<p>All the data for my reading list is stored in a big CSV file in <a href="https://github.com/codemicro/readingList" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Git repository</a>. It used to be that the endpoint on my website would clone the repository, make a new commit and push the changes, but now all of that is handled completely within GitHub Actions. <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/offloading-work-to-github">I wrote about making this change in my last post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.tdpain.net/readingList" rel="noopener noreferrer">The static site that displays the list</a> is generated using a small static site generator I wrote in Golang and deployed on GitHub Pages. When a new item is added to the list, the generator automatically runs and deploys using the magic of someone else&#39;s computer.</p>
<p>The static site uses a variation of this website&#39;s stylesheet, just with tweaked colours. Otherwise, everything is identical.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve so much as looked at the reading list site, you&#39;d probably agree that it&#39;s a bit of a disaster. It&#39;s a single <em>huge</em> page with every entry in it, making it difficult to navigate and near impossible to search. I&#39;d like to fix this - at some point, I&#39;m going to enhance the reading list to split the content over a few pages and attempt to add a client-side search, but that&#39;s a project for the future.</p>

<p>Honestly? I don&#39;t remember why I started doing this in the first place, but I certainly like having it around.</p>
<p>Often I&#39;ll find myself wanting to share an article I read a few weeks ago with someone, and with my reading list, I can do that with a quick Ctrl+F. It&#39;s really handy, and for that reason alone, I&#39;m going to keep doing it. There&#39;s not really another, practical use for it.</p>
<p>That said, having a list of all the articles I&#39;ve read and being able to fiddle around with that data whenever I want to very much satisfies my inner nerd.</p>
<p>I guess I keep up with my reading list, in part, because I enjoy it.</p>
