    <h1>The Problem with Go</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            




<p>Hint: It’s not error handling.<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Excuse the provocative title. I am actually a huge fan of the Go programming
language.</p>

<p>The real problem is human, and it’s about human processes.</p>

<p>Critically, I do believe that the Go project is healthy enough that this can
be solved.</p>

<h2>Contributing is harder than it needs to be</h2>

<p>Every change needs approval from at least two Google employees.
Their code review platform, Gerrit, is meant to automate this. But it will
happily assign your pull request to ex-employees who haven’t logged
in for years.</p>

<p>You need to know exactly who to talk to, on a different channel, to get things
moving again.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to merge a <strong>single line bug fix</strong> for three months, and it has
taken me repeated effort to get it moving. I really want it merged
before the release freeze for the next Go version, which might be in about
a month.</p>

<p>This is in what I consider a fairly critical section of Go (support for text
internationalisation), which is half finished, and where I counted 150 “TODO”s
in the comments.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of interest from (non-Google) developers in improving this area.
But how can we ever do anything substantial, if every one-line change has this
much friction?</p>

<h2>Accepting contributions takes time</h2>

<p>Even if Google ultimately calls the shots,
the Go project is commendably
transparent and publishes the minutes of several weekly meetings.
A month ago, the compiler and runtime meeting minutes revealed an
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43930#issuecomment-1267450184">interesting discussion</a>
about processes and change requests:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… we have to reduce our processes… little things like the two Googler
review rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--// //-->

<blockquote>
<p>Last week there was a big uptick in contributors sending a huge number of
tiny changes. A lot weren’t substantial improvements and could have
introduced bugs…</p>
</blockquote>

<!--// //-->

<blockquote>
<p>I think we should push back more… it’s a zero-sum game.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--// //-->

<blockquote>
<p>The time we spend reviewing these takes away from time we could be improving
go.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--// //-->

<blockquote>
<p>Some folks who send these sorts of will turn into useful contributors over
time… if [a specific] Go community is getting more involved, we want to
encourage that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Go needs</h2>

<p>I don’t mind the reliance on Google maintainers. It has advantages and
disadvantages.</p>

<p>But if it’s going to continue, and it’s a bottleneck, then I think the Go
project needs more resources.</p>

<p>Last year, Google pledged to spend:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/why-were-committing-10-billion-to-advance-cybersecurity/">$10 billion USD over 5 years to advance cybersecurity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/09/google-supports-open-source-technology.html">$100 million to support the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a noble and worthy thing to do, but it’s incomprehensible that their
own open source product doesn’t get a slice of this.</p>

<p>Google, of course, have put a lot into Go already. They have no obligation to
put a penny more into it. But I feel like funding even just one or two extra
maintainers would have an outsized impact.</p>

<h2>Reasons to be hopeful</h2>

<p>In an ideal world, when you fix a bug you can send a fix, get it reviewed, and
have it merged, without having to chase it. Where this doesn’t happen, we
have to become “amateur maintainers” and learn the ins and outs of how
maintenance happens, who to talk to, etc. That’s fine - when the world is less
than perfect, an engineer’s instinct is to work on fixing it.</p>

<p>What gives me confidence about the Go project is that I’ve seen how problems,
including non-technical problems with processes, can be addressed
through collective discussion.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of people willing to volunteer their time to improve parts
of Go.</p>

<p>What they, and the core Go developers need, is maintainers with the time to
coordinate the work.</p>
