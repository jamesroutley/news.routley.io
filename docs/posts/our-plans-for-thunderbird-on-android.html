<p>For years, we’ve wanted to extend Thunderbird beyond the desktop, and the path to delivering a great Thunderbird on Android™ experience started in 2018. </p>



<p>That’s when Thunderbird Product Manager Ryan Lee Sipes first met up with Christian Ketterer (aka “cketti”), the project maintainer for open-source Android email client <a href="https://k9mail.app">K-9 Mail</a>. The two instantly wanted to find a way for the two projects to collaborate. Throughout the following few years, the conversation evolved into how to create an awesome, seamless email experience across platforms. </p>



<p>But Ryan and cketti both agreed that the final product had to reflect the shared values of both projects. It had to be open source, respect the user, and be a perfect fit for power users who crave customization and a rich feature set. </p>



<p>“Ultimately,” Sipes says, “it made sense to work together instead of developing a mobile client from scratch.”</p>



<h2>K-9 Mail Joins The Thunderbird Family</h2>



<p>To that end, we’re thrilled to announce that today, K-9 Mail officially joins the Thunderbird family. And cketti has already joined the full-time Thunderbird staff, bringing along his valuable expertise and experience with mobile platforms. </p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, K-9 Mail will transform into Thunderbird on Android</strong>. </p>



<p>That means the name itself will change and adopt Thunderbird branding. Before that happens, we need to reach certain development milestones that will bring K-9 Mail into alignment with Thunderbird’s feature set and visual appearance. </p>



<p>To accomplish that, we’ll devote finances and development time to continually improving K-9 Mail. We’ll be adding brand new features and introducing quality-of-life enhancements. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>K-9 Mail and Thunderbird are both community-funded projects. If you want to help us improve and expand K-9 Mail faster, please consider donating at <a href="https://mzla.link/k9-give" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://mzla.link/k9-give</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<p><span>Here’s a glimpse into our features roadmap</span>: </p>



<ul><li>Account setup using Thunderbird account auto-configuration.</li><li>Improved folder management.</li><li>Support for message filters.</li><li>Syncing between desktop and mobile Thunderbird. </li></ul>



<p> “Joining the Thunderbird family allows K-9 Mail to become more sustainable and gives us the resources to implement long-requested features and fixes that our users want,” cketti says. “In other words, K-9 Mail will soar to greater heights with the help of Thunderbird.”</p>



<h2>Thunderbird On Android: Join The Journey</h2>



<p>Thunderbird users have long been asking for Thunderbird on their Android and iOS devices. This move allows Thunderbird users to have a powerful, privacy-respecting email experience <em>today</em> on Android. Plus, it lets the community help shape the transition of K-9 Mail into a fully-featured mobile Thunderbird experience.</p>



<p>This is only the beginning, but it’s a very exciting first step. </p>



<p>Want to talk directly with the Thunderbird team about it? Join us for a Twitter Spaces chat (via <a href="https://twitter.com/mozthunderbird">@MozThunderbird</a>) on Wednesday, June 15 at 10am PDT / 1pm EDT / 7pm CEST). I’ll be there alongside cketti and Ryan to answer your questions, and discuss the future of Thunderbird on mobile devices.</p>
