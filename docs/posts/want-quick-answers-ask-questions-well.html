        <!-- Why this matters -->
        <div>
            <p>
                In our modern day world, focus is paramount to getting things done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every interruption introduces <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/context-switching">context switching</a>, which
                makes productivity suffer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, it can be good to embrace <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">asynchronous
                    communication</a> and respect others&#39; time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the following two situations...
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Situation #1 -->
        <p>
            <h3>Situation #1: Communication That Could Be Improved</h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <h4>Here&#39;s the situation...</h4>
            <p><img src="https://quick-answers.kronis.dev/img/person-1-situation.JPG" alt="Situation #1 Image"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>...so what&#39;s wrong with it?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A greeting <a href="https://nohello.net/en/">without saying what you need</a> makes the other person
                    switch contexts and wait on you</li>
                <li>Not telling the other person <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">what you know and
                        have tried</a> makes figuring it all out take much longer</li>
                <li>Asking for a call means that the other person will have to drop whatever they are doing to join it
                </li>
                <li>
                    This way, even simple questions need more time, to get the details and start talking about the
                    actual problem
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And what if they&#39;re too busy to help you right now?
                Will you wait for an hour until their schedule frees up for that call?
            </p>
            <p>
                Once or twice a day may not be too bad, but what if there&#39;s lots of people with lots of problems?
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Situation #2 -->
        <p>
            <h3>Situation #2: Quicker And More Useful Communication</h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <h4>Here&#39;s the alternative...</h4>
            <p><img src="https://quick-answers.kronis.dev/img/person-2-situation.JPG" alt="Situation #1 Image"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>...so how is it better?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Offering the details up front is an excellent way to get the other person up to speed</li>
                <li>Being specific with what you&#39;re trying to do (links, method/class names, code snippets, error
                    messages) eliminates lots of guesswork</li>
                <li>If you&#39;ve already tried some steps towards a solution, sharing those can also be very useful</li>
                <li>You won&#39;t have to do as much back and forth or calls, the message alone might have enough details
                    for them to help</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now, the other person doesn&#39;t need to feel frustrated, pausing their work, to wait for you to explain
                the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, if they&#39;re out at the moment (or in a different time zone), they can just get back to you
                with the full answer later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Summary -->
        <p>
            <h3>In summary</h3>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                You can make communication more useful and less frustrating with relatively little effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                This could cut down on the amount of context switching that you or others need to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not every question needs a call, not every answer needs to be preceded by lots of back and forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, sometimes you do just need a meeting or a call and that is also okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Better yet, write down information about how problems were solved in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good luck!
            </p>
        </div>
