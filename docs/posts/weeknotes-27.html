    <ul>
<li>i am going to turn off my beeminder reminders, i think. it&#39;s a little aggressive and whilst it is getting me to write these posts i don&#39;t think it&#39;s of good quality always, or even always something i feel like is worth posting, so slower, less frequent weeknotes it will have to be!</li>
<li>think i&#39;m gonna start a weekday challenge though where i try and post on tiktok/insta reels/YT shorts or similar every day or every other day, just deciding whether i want to start in the new year or sooner.</li>
<li>still trying to decide what i want my newsletter to be. i don&#39;t know if i want it on substack for nazi reasons, don&#39;t know if i want to go solo for monetary reasons, and am unsure if a roundup of cool links and recent posts is just this post?? but i&#39;ll have more of a think in the coming days.</li>
<li>obligatory &#34;can you believe it&#39;s so close to the end of the year&#34; sentence</li>
<li>i don&#39;t think my content crit circle idea worked (rip!) but collaborating on stuff is helpful, been doing a bit with <a href="https://gfsc.studio/">geeks for social change</a>, and it sparked off a lot of thoughts!</li>
<li>one of the few weeks i didn&#39;t fully fill out my planning and review template, and i&#39;m feeling it trying to write this! i love being beholden to my external brain for some things (no sarcasm) it makes me appreciate my systems more, even if i feel a bit anxious for the gap lol.</li>
<li>what year review/planning things do you do? I&#39;m trying to only plan in quarters/12 week years i guess, but i do like to do some high level review and thinking through what was good and bad. i use <a href="https://shop.getbullish.com/en-ca/products/design-your-2025-downloadable-workbook-pdf-instant-download">Get Bullish&#39;s Design you 20XX</a> partly out of force of habit, partly cos i enjoy the questions, and whatever <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/muchelleb">muchelleb</a> has put out that year is sure to feature also.</li>
<li>i think a full breakdown of my <a href="https://olu.online/24-hopes-for-2024/">24 hopes for this year</a> would be boring on further reflection so trying to think if i can think of a way to spice it up, suggestions welcome!</li>
<li>got lots of podcast thoughts too but they&#39;re all very early days. hopefully i will have more formed ones by next time.</li>
<li>and you know what, maybe if i give myself at least half an hour the beeminder goal isn&#39;t too bad, i did write a bit! see you next time ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
