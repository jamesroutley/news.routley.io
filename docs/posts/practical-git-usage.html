  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I use <code>git</code> almost daily both personally and professionally, and my usage
follows a pretty regular pattern. By sticking to this pattern, I rarely get
into a sticky situation or unexpected state. As many can attest, <code>git</code> is a
beast of a CLI tool, but these workflows have been enough to keep my projects
organized.</p>

<h3 id="personal-usage">Personal usage</h3>

<p>Repositories where you’re the sole contributor are a lot easier to manage than a
group project, so let’s start with that. Here’s my workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a feature / modify the code</li>
  <li>Add the changes to the staging area with <code>git add -p</code></li>
  <li>Commit the staged changes with <code>git commit -v</code></li>
</ol>

<p>That’s pretty much it. If I want to experiment with a new feature or
alternative approach, I’ll checkout a new branch with <code>git checkout -b
feature-branch</code>. When the branch is good enough, I’ll merge it back into <code>main</code>
with <code>git merge feature-branch</code>.</p>

<h3 id="team-usage">Team usage</h3>

<p>Using <code>git</code> on a team is a different story. It’s not uncommon to encounter
conflicts, which can be frustrating but manageable. There’s also usually a code
review process, so working directly on <code>main</code> is restricted. Here’s how I
handle those situations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure <code>main</code> is up to date with <code>git pull</code></li>
  <li>Create a feature branch with an appropriate name with <code>git checkout -b feature-branch</code></li>
  <li>Add a feature / modify the code</li>
  <li>Add the changes to the staging area with <code>git add -p</code></li>
  <li>Commit the staged changes with <code>git commit -v</code></li>
  <li>Push the changes to origin with <code>git push -u origin feature-branch</code></li>
  <li>Create a pull request in GitHub UI (the link is usually printed when pushing
in the previous step)</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, I’ll wait for a review and address any comments that arise. If
another change gets merged and causes a conflict, I’ll fix it by taking the
following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure I’m on <code>feature-branch</code></li>
  <li>Fetch origin changes with <code>git fetch origin main</code></li>
  <li>Rebase my changes onto main with <code>git rebase origin/main</code></li>
  <li>When the rebase stops due to conflicts, fix them
    <ol>
      <li>Identify the conflicts by doing a <code>git status</code></li>
      <li>Edit the files to remove the conflicts</li>
      <li>Tell <code>git</code> the conflicts have been resolved with <code>git add path/to/conflicting/files</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Continue rebasing with <code>git rebase --continue</code></li>
  <li>Repeat step 4 until the rebase finishes</li>
  <li>Force push to update my PR with <code>git push --force-with-lease</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the two big flows that get me through pretty much everything when
working on a team. On rare occasions I may have a feature branch off of another
one of my feature branches (to keep pull requests a manageable size). For
example <code>feature-part1</code> and <code>feature-part2</code>. When the <code>feature-part1</code> gets
merged, I’ll rebase <code>feature-part2</code> to branch off of <code>main</code> with <code>git rebase
--onto main feature-part1 feature-part2</code>.</p>

<p>To visualize what that looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Before    o---o---o---o---o  main
               \
                o---o---o---o---o  feature-part1
                                 \
                                  o---o---o  feature-part2

After    o---o---o---o---o  main
             |            \
             |             o&#39;--o&#39;--o&#39;  feature-part2
              \
               o---o---o---o---o  feature-part1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="notes-on-commands">Notes on commands</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>git add -p</code> will interactively add each <strong>patch</strong>. I like to use it as a
self review to help catch bugs early and scope commits to a single logical
change. My one complaint is that it won’t add newly created files.</li>
  <li><code>git commit -v</code> shows all the changes that will be committed. While I don’t
read through them, I tend to use it as a reference when constructing the commit
message.</li>
  <li><code>git push --force-with-lease</code> force pushes only if no one has added commits
to the remote branch (which prevents accidentally erasing those commits)</li>
  <li><code>git log --graph --decorate --all</code> shows the entire git history as a
graph and can be useful to situate where everything is.</li>
</ul>
