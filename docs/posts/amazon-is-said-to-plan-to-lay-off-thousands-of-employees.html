But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon’s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.</p><p>Amazon’s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season — when the company typically has valued stability — shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Amazon would also become the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/technology/big-tech-layoffs.html" title="">latest technology company</a> to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/business/amazon-salary-cash-cap.html" title="">more than doubled</a> the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing “a particularly competitive labor market.”</p><p>Changing business models and the precarious economy have set off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/tech-companies-hiring-freeze-job-cuts.html" title="">layoffs</a> across the tech industry. Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs.html" title="">halved</a> Twitter’s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/meta-layoffs-facebook.html" title="">announced</a> it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.</p><p>Brad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.</p><p>The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" title="">Amazon doubled its work force</a> in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.</p><p>But earlier this year, Amazon’s growth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/business/amazon-revenue-slow-growth-rate.html" title="">slowed</a> to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.</p><p>Amazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings.html" title="">growth could weaken again</a>, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/amazon-hits-unwelcome-milestone-with-1-trillion-in-value-lost?sref=GaFxjgEt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">erasing $1 trillion in value</a> since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/18/technology/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy.html" title="">Andy Jassy</a> took over as chief executive last year.</p><div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" data-testid="region"><section id="trust-inline-module-anonymous"><div><div data-slug="anonymous-explainer" data-iterate-survey="62fbffa010eae90001b94079"><hr/><p><span><strong>What we consider before using anonymous sources.</strong></span> <span>Do the sources know the information?

He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.</p><p>In recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/amazon-care.html" title="">failed to find </a>enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-06/amazon-abandons-autonomous-home-delivery-robot-in-latest-cut?sref=GaFxjgEt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.</p><p>From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html" title="">high attrition</a>.</p><p>Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/technology/amazon-freezes-corporate-hiring.html" title="">stopped filling</a> more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/tech-companies-hiring-freeze-job-cuts.html" title="">corporate hiring </a>across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.</p><p>That news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.</p><p>Devices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface.<strong> </strong>From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-says-it-has-over-10-000-employees-working-on-alexa-echo-1542138284" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10,000 engineers</a>. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.</p><p>In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.</p><p>Amazon’s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.</p><p>“We’re realistic that there’s various factors weighing on people’s wallets,” Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but “we’re ready for a variety of outcomes.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
