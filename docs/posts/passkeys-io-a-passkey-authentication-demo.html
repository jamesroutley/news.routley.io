    <h1>Passkeys.io – A Passkey Authentication Demo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Why is a passkey </h3><p>Instead of passwords, which can easily fall into the wrong hands, passkeys are stored exclusively on your devices and are never shared with anyone else. When you log in, the passkey on your device creates a unique signature that confirms to the website that you are in possession of the passkey. Neither the passkey nor your biometrics are shared with the website or app operators (as it happens with the password).</p></div><div><h3>Why is a passkey </h3><p>Easily create and use your passkeys using your device&#39;s security method, such as Touch ID, Face ID, or Windows Hello. To allow you to use your passkeys anywhere, they are encrypted and synced to your devices as long as they come from the same provider (e.g. Apple). If you want to log in to a device where your passkeys are not yet available, you can use a passkey on your phone by scanning a passkey QR code.</p></div></div>
