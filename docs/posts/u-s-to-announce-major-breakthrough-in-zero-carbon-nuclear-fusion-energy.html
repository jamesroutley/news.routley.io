<p><em>Washington</em> — The U.S. Department of Energy said Sunday it would announce a &#34;major scientific breakthrough&#34; this week, after media reported a federal laboratory had recently achieved a major milestone in nuclear fusion research. The Financial Times reported Sunday that scientists in the California-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) had achieved a &#34;net energy gain&#34; from an experimental fusion reactor.</p><p> That would represent the first time that researchers have successfully produced more energy in a fusion reaction - the same type that powers the Sun - than was consumed during the process, a potentially major step in the pursuit of zero-carbon power.</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion-iter-harnessing-power-of-the-sun/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">What is nuclear fusion?</a></span></li></ul><p>Energy Department and LLNL spokespeople told AFP they could not comment or provide confirmation regarding the FT report, but said US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm would &#34;announce a major scientific breakthrough&#34; on Tuesday.</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/12/25673eba-bf41-410b-a43c-4048f87ab55f/thumbnail/620x413/a12b7e016a42fc9a36447fd1570a7982/fusion-llnl-lab-ap22025651803348.jpg#" alt="Fusion Milestone " height="413" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/12/25673eba-bf41-410b-a43c-4048f87ab55f/thumbnail/620x413/a12b7e016a42fc9a36447fd1570a7982/fusion-llnl-lab-ap22025651803348.jpg 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/12/25673eba-bf41-410b-a43c-4048f87ab55f/thumbnail/1240x826/f6f7cdeb24470b1a10cfa274e7bca0fc/fusion-llnl-lab-ap22025651803348.jpg 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D&#39;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg&#39;%20viewBox%3D&#39;0%200%20620%20413&#39;%2F%3E"/></span>

<p>Ott visited the multibillion-dollar fusion project known as <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ITER</a> — which means &#34;the way&#34; in Latin and is short for &#34;International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor&#34; in southern France this year, where 35 countries are working together to try and crack the same scientific riddle that the U.S. is working on at LLNL unilaterally.</p><p>Some of the participating countries in the ITER project — which include the United States, Russia, China, India, South Korea, Japan, and the nations of the European Union — are frequent collaborators, but some are major adversaries on the world stage. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine</a></span> has prompted an unprecedented barrage of sanctions against Moscow from some partner nations, for example, and in response, Moscow has <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cuts-off-gas-to-europe-ukraine-war-germany-eu-energy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">restricted its natural gas supplies</a></span> to Europe, exacerbating the energy crisis.</p><p>The international science experiment was born out of an attempt to cool tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the joint project has continued despite the ongoing tension between not only the U.S. and Russia, but also China, which is also involved.</p><p>In March, the White House announced a plan to accelerate fusion&#39;s commercial development over the coming decades through continued investment in ITER, and through domestic projects like that underway at the LLNL facility. The White House heralded in the spring fusion&#39;s &#34;potential to revolutionize the energy industry, helping combat the climate crisis while meeting the growing electricity needs of the U.S. and the world.&#34; </p><figure><div>

The committee recently held a hearing to examine how the federal government could further support the commercial development of fusion energy.</p>

    
    

<p>&#34;The race to fusion is also a race for future global leadership,&#34; said Dr. Scott C. Hsu, lead fusion coordinator at the Office of the Undersecretary for Science and Innovation at the U.S. Department of Energy. &#34;While fusion has long enjoyed international collaboration and should continue to do so, make no mistake, fusion is now also an international competition. Failure to act now may relegate the U.S. to being importers rather than exporters of fusion technology.&#34;</p>
