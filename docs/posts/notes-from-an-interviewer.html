<p>These days I find myself interviewing quite a few candidates. Some are good, some aren’t. So it goes. However, there is another group who I feel could be good but just aren’t showing it in the interview. I think I was probably in this group earlier in my career. So, in a bid to help my younger self, and hopefully somebody else, here’s some things to consider.</p>



<p>If you google ‘top 10 X interview questions’ where X is your technology, and a question is on that list you should probably know the answer. It turns out that interviewers aren’t that original so you’ll find the same questions cropping up again and again. There’s definitely a debate to be had about whether interviewers should ask more original questions, but we are where we are. At least score the easy goals.</p>







<p>Great you know what idempotency is but why is it a useful property? There’s probably no quicker way to tell the difference between a junior who knows a lot and an experience dev than the ability to articulate why things are the way they are. </p>







<p>If a company wanted you to be a dumb vessel for received wisdom you probably wouldn’t want to work there. Just like knowing that things are they way they are for a reason, we should also know that those reasons aren’t valid in certain scenarios.</p>
