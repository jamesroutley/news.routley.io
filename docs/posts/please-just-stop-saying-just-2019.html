      <p>Do you work in Software Engineering, and have you seen messages or sentences like these before?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Can’t we <em>just</em> set up a redirect to this other domain?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why don’t we <em>just</em> add some caching to speed that page up?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I read their documentation, and we <em>just</em> need to inject some javascript, we should be all set!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too, and it drives me a little crazy.</p>

<p>Not because anyone is being rude, or because anything they are saying is necessarily wrong. Nobody is being intentionally malice, here. <strong>It’s that (in my opinion) the word “<em>just</em>” added as a qualifier to an idea carries with it a whole bunch of implied baggage.</strong></p>



<h2 id="implies-simplicity">Implies Simplicity</h2>

<p>First and foremost, the word “<em>just</em>” implies that an idea is simple. “Oh, we can <em>just</em> do this!”.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I’ve learned with Software Engineering, it’s that <em>Computers are Hard</em> and implementation details matter, especially when it comes to complexity. Very rarely can the complexity of an engineering solution be outlined in a single sentence. There is almost always more to it.</p>

<p>Let’s take one of the above examples of “<em>just</em>” injecting javascript into the page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we trust this javascript to run on our page? What is the security posture of the javascript author?</li>
  <li>What dependencies does the script have, and are they trusted and up-to-date?</li>
  <li>What data is being sent from their javascript? Do we need to update our privacy policy?</li>
  <li>How will the javascript be minified?</li>
  <li>Does it work with our other libraris, such as React or Turbolinks?</li>
  <li>Do we need to load this Javascript from a third party? What if that server goes down? Can we trust the integrity of their server?</li>
  <li>Do we need to update our Content Security Policy for this script?</li>
  <li>What sort of performance impact will this have on our page load performance?</li>
  <li>Does the script need to run at any a particular point in the page load process?</li>
  <li>Does the styling of the DOM elements it produces match our brand? Is that important?</li>
  <li>What sort of impact will this have on the accessibility of our website?</li>
  <li>Who is going to maintain this javascript, and update it when it needs to be?</li>
  <li>How will we monitor if this javascript snippet is still working?</li>
  <li>If the business decides to stop using it, who will tell us and how will we know?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reinforces-imposter-syndrome">Reinforces Imposter Syndrome</h2>

<p>Many engineers report having Imposter Syndrome, with some data even suggesting over <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-58-of-tech-employees-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome/">half of engineers</a> at most major Silicon Valley companies.</p>

<p>Let’s paint the picture of a very common, every-day scenario…</p>

<p>Imagine being an engineer with Imposter Syndrome, and you are working on solving a problem all day. You find yourself stuck on a few tricky details on the solutions you are considering, and so you ask for help from a Senior Engineer on your team. You sit down, start to talk through it, and your coworker says…</p>

<p><strong>“what if you <em>just</em> do this?”</strong></p>

<p>I ask you, reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Would you feel good or happy to hear that?</li>
  <li>If you disagreed, would you voice that disagreement with such a confident and simple answer from a Senior Engineer?</li>
  <li>If you don’t understand, do you ask “what do you mean?”</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is probably not. How could you disagree with such a simple answer?! Or not understand it?!</p>

<h2 id="reduces-ideation">Reduces Ideation</h2>

<p>Because of the implications the word “<em>just</em>” comes with, I believe that engineers are less likely to ideate and brainstorm in that environment.</p>

<p>In the face of an idea that says to “<em>just</em> do this”, I believe engineers are less confident in voicing disagreement, and are less likely to ask “what do you mean?” to truly understand the problem and the solution.</p>

<p>A team where engineers aren’t asking for clarification, don’t understand their solutions, and aren’t voicing alternative approaches is <strong>not a team that I hope to be on</strong>. That team is missing out on so much, including great ideas.</p>



<p>My solution is simple: stop qualifying your statements with the word “<em>just</em>”.</p>

<p>Of course, I’ll acknowledge right away that such as task is not easy. And I continue to use the word by mistake all the time! But I try hard not to, and I believe I am better for it.</p>

<p>When I catch myself typing a sentence that uses the word “just”, I pause and rephrase my sentence to avoid using it. I find that doing so helps for me to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get better response and ideation back from others</li>
  <li>clarify my thinking with strong examples and evidence</li>
  <li>orient the discussion towards a more generative mindset</li>
  <li>produce a healthier debate with more learning and sharing from everyone</li>
</ul>

<p>So please… <em>just</em> stop saying “<em>just</em>”!</p>
