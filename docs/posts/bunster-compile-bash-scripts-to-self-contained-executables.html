<p dir="auto">Have you ever wished your shell scripts could be faster, more portable, and secure ? <strong>Bunster</strong> brings this to life by transforming your shell scripts into efficient, standalone binaries that are easy to distribute and deploy across platforms <em>(only unix is supported at the moment)</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike other tools, <strong>Bunster</strong> doesn’t just wrap your scripts in a binary—it compiles them down to efficient native machine code, leveraging the powerful Go toolchain. This ensures performance, portability, and robustness.</p>
<p dir="auto">Technically speaking, <strong>Bunster</strong> in fact is a <code>shell-to-Go</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler" rel="nofollow">Transplier</a> that generates <a href="https://go.dev" rel="nofollow">Go</a> source out of your scripts. Then, optionally uses the <a href="https://go.dev/dl" rel="nofollow">Go Toolchain</a> to compile the code to an executable program.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Bunster</strong> targets <code>bash</code> scripts in particular. The current syntax and features are all inherited from <code>bash</code>. additional shells will be supported as soon as we relase v1.</p>

<p dir="auto">In addition to the shell features, We aim to add several custom features to make shell scripts feel like any modern programming language. These features are either supported or are planned to be implemented in future. (<em>consider contributing to help us speed up the develpment cycle</em>)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Different Shells support</strong>: Bunster currently aims to be compatible with <code>bash</code> as a starting move. Then additional shells in future.</li>
<li><strong>Modules</strong>: Something shell scripts lack is a module system, we aim to introduce a module system that allow you to publish and consume scripts as libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Static Asset Embedding</strong>: This feature allows you to embed a file&#39;s content to a variable at build time. (<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/embed" rel="nofollow">Go has one already</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Password and Expiration Lock</strong>: Surprisingly, some people have asked for this feature. Basically, It allows you to choose an expirity date at build time. the generated program will not work after that date. Also you can choose to lock the script using a password. whenever you try to run it, it prompts for the password.</li>
<li><strong>Standard library</strong>: we aim to add first-class support for a variety of frequently used/needed commands as builtins. you no longer need external programs to use them.</li>

Not all features are implemented yet. But, plenty of them are. <a href="https://bunster.netlify.app/supported-features.html" rel="nofollow">see what features are implemented so far</a>.</p>
</div>

<p dir="auto">Bunster follows <a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">SemVer</a> system for release versionning. On each minor release <code>v0.x.0</code>, You should expect adding new features. Code optimization and build improvements. On each patch release <code>v0.N.x</code>, you should expect bug fixes and/or other minor enhancements.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once we reach the stable release <code>v1.0.0</code>, you must expect your bash scripts to be fully compatible with Bunster (<em>there might be some caveats</em>). All features mentioned above to be implemeted unless the comunity agreed on skipping some of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding support for additional shells is not planned until our first stable release <code>v1</code>. All regarding contributions will remain open until then.</p>
