    <h1>Gender and Age Differences in Love Styles and Attitudes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We looked at respondent data from <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/">Dimensional’s Personality test</a> to explore how men and women differ in the way they express, desire, and think about love. We also examined how these traits change with age.</p><p>Here are the results.</p><h2>Most people don’t give love the way they want to receive it.</h2><p>Most literature on love languages assumes that we express love the same way we desire it. For instance, if our highest desired love language is <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-service">Service</a>, then we also naturally give Service. Our research shows this assumption is wrong.</p><p>On average, less than one-third of users have alignment between the love languages they desire and the love languages they express.</p><p>The discrepancy between expression and desire of love languages was highest in <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-affirmation">Affirmation</a>. Just 14% of respondents who had Affirmation in their top 2 desired languages (making it a &#34;Signature&#34; trait) also had it in their top 2 expressive languages.</p><p>Conversely, this discrepancy was lowest in <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-touch">Touch</a>. Not surprising considering it’s difficult to desire being touched without also touching in return.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>% of respondents who scored Signature on Expressing a Love Languages given they scored Signature on desiring it.</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fd918445b99ea8791ba4851/6312253aea4fb92f1fa62226_Alignment.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Men desire more Touch, women desire more Affirmation.</h2><p>We found that women were more likely to desire <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-affirmation">Affirmation</a> while men were more likely to desire <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-touch">Touch</a>. The magnitude of these differences was not dramatic.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>% of users who have each desired LL as a &#34;Signature&#34; trait </strong>(Signature defined as scoring in their top 2)</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fd918445b99ea8791ba4851/63122552dea098500eebdd45_Needing%20LS%20by%20Gender.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Men instinctively give more Service, women give more Gifts.</h2><p>Relative to women, the average male respondent expressed love in the form of <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-service">Service</a>, whereas women gave more <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/ls-needing-gifts">gifts</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>% of users who have each expressed LL as a &#34;Signature&#34; trait </strong> (Signature defined as scoring in their top 2)</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fd918445b99ea8791ba4851/6312257453d33f0fccde81c3_Giving%20LS%20by%20Gender.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Women are more possessive and practical. Men are more idealistic and casual.</h2><p>On average, women scored higher than men in two Love Attitudes: <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/la-mania">Mania</a> and Pragma. Mania is characterized as an obsessive, possessive, or jealous love. People who score high on Mania want to belong to their partner and want their partner to belong to them. <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/la-pragma">Pragma</a> is defined as a practical, less-romantic love attitude that’s characterized by wanting a checklist of traits in a partner.</p><p>Men, on the other hand, scored higher in <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/la-eros">Eros</a> and <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/la-ludus">Ludus</a> love. These fantasy-oriented Love Attitudes centre around &#34;fairy-tale&#34; and casual fun, respectively. Simply put, men crush more easily and are more likely to want no-strings romance with multiple partners.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Percent of Users Signature by Love Attitude and Gender</strong> (Signature defined as scoring in their top 2)</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fd918445b99ea8791ba4851/6312258e8d9953707b4cd774_LS%20by%20Gender.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Older people are more pragmatic and less idealistic when choosing partners.</h2><p>Looking at how love attitudes change with age, we found that older generations generally scored lower on Eros and much higher on Pragma.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found that people above the age of 30 were 2 to 3 times more likely to desire casual/uncommitted romance (<a href="https://www.dimensional.me/element/la-ludus">Ludus</a>). This desire peaked among people in their 30s, but it remained higher than younger people even in older age.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Percent of Users Signature by Love Attitude and Age Cohort</strong> (Signature defined as scoring in their top 2)</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fd918445b99ea8791ba4851/631225a47bab4a41681f0a80_LA%20by%20age.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Methodology Notes</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.dimensional.me/">Dimensional’s personality test</a> currently measures 10 dimensions of Personality (Big5, Jungian functions, Values, Basic Interests, Conflict Styles, DISC, etc.). This study explored two of these Dimensions: Love Styles and Love Attitudes, which measure how people communicate and conceptualize love respectively.</li><li>Sample of 5,000 users chosen at random</li><li>Because this is not a longitudinal study, we can’t know whether insights based on age cohorts are generational (aka Gen Z vs Millennials vs. X vs. Boomers) or the result of aging.</li><li>Trait scores (aka scales) are based on self-reported likert ratings.</li><li>We measure both “giving” and “needing” love styles scales.</li><li>Non-binary and “other” genders are excluded from this study due to lack of sample size.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><p>Saeid Fard has 9 years of experience working in personality testing and is the founder of <a href="https://www.dimensional.me/">dimensional.me</a>.
