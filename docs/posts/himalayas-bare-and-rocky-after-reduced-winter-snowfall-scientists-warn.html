This dwindling snowfall during winter is making matters worse, experts have told the BBC.</p><p>They say that the reduction in ice and snow will not only change how the Himalayas look, it will also impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people and many ecosystems in the region.</p><p>As temperatures rise in spring, snow accumulated during winter melts and the runoff feeds river systems. This snowmelt is a crucial source for the region&#39;s rivers and streams, supplying water for drinking, irrigation and hydropower. </p><p>Apart from impacting the water supply, less winter precipitation - rainfall in the lowlands and snowfall on the mountains - also means the region risks being gutted by forest fires due to dry conditions, experts said.</p><p>They add that vanishing glaciers and declining snowfall destabilise mountains as they lose the ice and snow that act as cement to keep them intact. Disasters like rockfalls, landslides, glacial lakes bursting out and devastating debris flows are already becoming more common.</p><p>So, how serious is the drop in snowfall?</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5487/live/4de72ac0-ef21-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Yunish Gurung Mountain Machhapuchhre (Fishtail) in western Nepal that hosts central Himalayan ranges was seen bare and rocky last winter due to very less snowfall."/><span>Yunish Gurung</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Meteorologists say central Himalayas have also seen significant decrease in winter snowfall leaving mountains bare and rocky</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Indian Meteorological Department recorded no precipitation - rainfall and snowfall - in almost all of northern India in December.</p><p>The weather department says there is a high possibility that many parts of northwest India, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh states, and the federally-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, will see 86% less than long period average (LPA) rainfall and snowfall between January and March.</p><p>LPA is the rainfall or snow recorded over a region over 30 to 50 years and use its average to classify current weather as normal, excess or deficient.</p><p>According to the weather department, north India&#39;s LPA rainfall between 1971 and 2020 was 184.3 millimetre.</p><p>Meteorologists say the sharp drop in precipitation is not just a one-off thing.</p><p>&#34;There is now strong evidence across different datasets that winter precipitation in the Himalayas is indeed decreasing,&#34;

Both of these inhibit their ability to pick up moisture from the Arabian Sea, resulting in weaker precipitation,&#34; he added.</p><p>The Indian weather department has labelled the westerly disturbance north India has experienced so far this winter as &#34;feeble&#34; because it could generate very nominal rainfall and snowfall.</p><p>Scientists may sooner or later find out what is behind the decrease in winter precipitation.</p><p>But what is already becoming clear is that the Himalayan region now faces a double trouble.</p><p>Just when it is rapidly losing its glaciers and icefields, it has also begun to get less snow.
