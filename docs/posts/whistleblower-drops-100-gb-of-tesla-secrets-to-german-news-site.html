Tesla attempted to stop the publication from using this data in its reporting and even threatened legal action against <em>Handelsblatt. </em>The publication, however, decided this was one of the extraordinary circumstances when reporting on such a data breach would be legal under European Union law.</p><p>It posted <em>“</em><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My autopilot almost killed me”: Tesla files cast doubt on Elon Musk’s promises</a></span> on Thursday. The story is both in German and behind a paywall, but the English translation is of excellent quality. Here’s a bit of the meat of it:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The Tesla files contain more than 2,400 self-acceleration complaints and more than 1,500 braking function problems, including 139 cases of unintentional emergency braking and 383 reported phantom stops resulting from false collision warnings. The number of crashes is more than 1000. A table of incidents involving driver assistance systems where customers have expressed safety concerns has more than 3000 entries.</p><p>The oldest complaints available to the Handelsblatt date from 2015, the most recent from March 2022. During this period, Tesla delivered around 2.6 million vehicles with the autopilot software. Most of the incidents took place in the <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.handelsblatt.com/themen/usa&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/themen/usa" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">US</a></span> , but there are also complaints from Europe and Asia in the documents - including many from German Tesla drivers.</p><p>The Handelsblatt contacted dozens of customers from several countries. All confirmed the information from the Tesla files. In discussions, they gave insights into their experiences with the autopilot. Some disclosed their communication with the US automaker, others showed Handelsblatt reporters videos of the accident.﻿<br/></p></blockquote><p>Customers from the U.S. and Europe told <em>Handelsblatt </em>Tesla wasn’t too interested in <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://jalopnik.com/tesla-asks-model-y-owner-to-tow-burned-out-car-to-servi-1850455277&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-asks-model-y-owner-to-tow-burned-out-car-to-servi-1850455277">assisting with their issues</a></span>, but seemed more intent on covering for the company. It turns out, this was explicit policy at Tesla: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>How did the company deal with complaints? The Tesla files also provide information about this. The files show that employees have precise guidelines for communicating with customers. The top priority is obviously: offer as little attack surface as possible.</p><p>For each incident there are bullet points for the “technical review”. The employees who enter this review into the system regularly make it clear that the report is “for internal use only”. Each entry also contains a note in bold type that information, if at all, may only be passed on “VERBALLY to the customer”.</p><p>“Do not copy and paste the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer,” it said. Vehicle data should also not be released without permission. If, despite the advice, “an involvement of a lawyer cannot be prevented”, this must be recorded.</p><p>Customers that Handelsblatt spoke to have the impression that Tesla employees avoid written communication. “They never sent emails, everything was always verbal,” says the doctor from California, whose Tesla said it accelerated on its own in the fall of 2021 and crashed into two concrete pillars.﻿<br/></p></blockquote><p>Throughout the report, there is a refrain familiar to anyone who covers Tesla: “Tesla did not answer questions about the allegations from customers.” Some told <em>Handelsblatt</em> they either sold their Teslas or tried to give them back to the company, saying they couldn’t in good conscience let anyone else drive the car.</p><p>Elon Musk and Tesla <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://jalopnik.com/musk-tesla-and-spacex-had-a-hell-of-a-year-1849920875&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://jalopnik.com/musk-tesla-and-spacex-had-a-hell-of-a-year-1849920875">had a hell of a 2022</a></span>, and this year is s<span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://jalopnik.com/teslas-reputation-in-us-absolutely-tanked-last-year-1850475221&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://jalopnik.com/teslas-reputation-in-us-absolutely-tanked-last-year-1850475221">haping up to be no different</a></span>.
