    <h1>Keycloak: Open-Source Identity and Access Management</h1>

                Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort.</p>
            <p>
                Keycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Latest release 18.0.0
            </p>

            <h2>Single-Sign On</h2>
            <p>
                Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. This means that your applications
                don&#39;t have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in to
                Keycloak, users don&#39;t have to login again to access a different application.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also applied to logout. Keycloak provides single-sign out, which means users only have to logout once to be
                logged-out of all applications that use Keycloak.
            </p>

            <h2>Identity Brokering and Social Login</h2>
            <p>
                Enabling login with social networks is easy to add through the admin console. It&#39;s just a matter of selecting the
                social network you want to add. No code or changes to your application is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keycloak can also authenticate users with existing OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers. Again, this is
                just a matter of configuring the Identity Provider through the admin console.
            </p>

    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>User Federation</h2>
            <p>
                Keycloak has built-in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers. You can also implement your own
                provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p><img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/dia-user-fed.png"/>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Admin Console</h2>
            <p>
                Through the admin console administrators can centrally manage all aspects of the Keycloak server.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can enable and disable various features.  They can configure identity brokering and user federation.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can create and manage applications and services, and define fine-grained authorization
                policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can also manage users, including permissions and sessions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p><img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/screen-admin.png"/>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Account Management Console</h2>
            <p>
                Through the account management console users can manage their own accounts. They can update the profile,
                change passwords, and setup two-factor authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can also manage sessions as well as view history for the account.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you&#39;ve enabled social login or identity brokering users can also link their accounts with additional
                providers to allow them to authenticate to the same account with different identity providers.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Standard Protocols</h2>
            <p>
                Keycloak is based on standard protocols and provides support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p><img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/dia-protocols.png"/>

    </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Authorization Services</h2>
            <p>
                If role based authorization doesn&#39;t cover your needs, Keycloak provides fine-grained authorization services as well.
                This allows you to manage permissions for all your services from the Keycloak admin console and gives you the
                power to define exactly the policies you need.
