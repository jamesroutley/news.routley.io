    <h1>Ask HN: How do you deal with getting old and feeling lost?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I am turning 35 years soon and I feel like I haven&#39;t achieved much, both personally and professionally. I have held jobs in small and big companies for mostly for 1-2 years each, traveled and lived in different countries, had 2 failed startups, and have about $500k in savings. I am single and haven&#39;t had a serious relationship for many years now.<p>As time went on, I started feeling less excited about everything, personal or work related. I used to be excited about new technologies, but not these days. I feel like I&#39;ve seen most things before, and it&#39;s all just different iterations of the same. I increasingly wish I could go back to my 20s. Now I feel too old to go to festivals, bars and clubs and make new friends that way.</p><p>This has been a recent change for me. When I was ~30 I still considered myself young and able to do anything I could do when I was in my 20s. But not anymore now. I feel like my time for everything is running out. Have you been through a similar thing? How did you deal with it?</p></td></div></div>
