The Canada Revenue Agency has taken all reasonable steps to ensure the security of this Web site. We have used sophisticated encryption technology and incorporated other procedures to protect your personal information at all times. However, the Internet is a public network and there is the remote possibility of data security violations. In the event of such occurrences, the Canada Revenue Agency is not responsible for any damages you may experience as a result.&#34;</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that is not true. After reviewing the HTTP responses from the CRA My Account login page, it&#39;s clear the agency has not configured even some of the most basic security features. For example, security protections for their cookies are not configured, nor are all the recommended security headers used.</p><p><span>Not only is that </span><em>not</em><span> &#34;all reasonable steps,&#34; but the CRA is missing the very basics for securing online web applications.</span></p><p>The terms of use also state that users are not allowed to use &#34;any script, robot, spider, Web crawler, screen scraper, automated query program or other automated device or any manual process to monitor or copy the content contained in any online services.&#34;</p><p>Looking at the HTTP response headers using web browser developer tools doesn&#39;t breach the terms of services, but the CRA must be well aware that internet users perform scans like this all the time.</p><p>And it&#39;s not the legitimate My Account users who are likely to be the culprits. Unfortunately for Canadians, threat actors don&#39;t read terms of use pages.</p><p>A statement like this doesn&#39;t protect anyone, except CRA, from being held responsible for failing to properly secure Canadian citizens&#39; personal data.</p><p><span>The changes to the terms of service may be the result of numerous data breaches (</span><em>see below</em><span>) that have already occurred at the CRA (see below), as well as the result of a </span><a href="https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/practice-areas/privacy-and-data/class-action-on-canada-revenue-agency-data-breach-certified-by-federal-court-of-canada/369432" rel="">class action lawsuit</a><span> filed against the agency last August.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>August 2020</strong><span> - </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/news/2020/08/statement-from-the-office-of-the-chief-information-officer-of-the-government-canada-on-recent-credential-stuffing-attacks.html" rel="">Statement from the Office of the Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada on recent credential stuffing attacks</a></p></li><li><p><strong>September 2020</strong><span> - </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/news/2020/09/update-from-the-office-of-the-chief-information-officer-of-the-government-canada-on-recent-cyber-attacks.html" rel="">Update from the Office of the Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada on recent cyber attacks</a><span> </span></p></li><li><p><strong>August 2020</strong><span> - </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-revenue-agency-cra-cyberattack-1.5688163" rel="">CRA shuts down online services after thousands of accounts breached in cyberattacks</a></p></li><li><p><strong>March 2021</strong><span> - </span><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/cra-locking-800k-canadian-taxpayers-out-of-accounts-1.5345069?cache=ihmzhdxdoji%3FcontactForm%3Dtrue" rel="">CRA locking 800K Canadian taxpayers out of accounts</a><span>  </span></p></li></ul><p>The CRA offloading its responsibility for securing citizens&#39; data via a benign ToS update is a worrisome development from the government agency that should be safeguarding their data in the first place.</p><p>The data that CRA holds on every single Canadian is more than enough to help threat actors steal their identity or decide who might be worth robbing or blackmailing.</p><p>If threat actors identify particular vulnerabilities in the CRA website, they could also erase or modify taxpayers&#39; data, creating infinitely more terrifying scenarios.</p><p> Nation states, criminal organizations, and even political rivals would be very interested in obtaining the data that the CRA is entrusted with holding on behalf of the citizens of Canada.</p><p><span>You can view the CRA&#39;s new terms of use </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Tk3FyGiu9-TErOtM_Wccy3G-tmsI_19/view?usp=sharing" rel="">here</a><span>. </span></p><p>Attempts to get the CRA to address its web security posture have been met with silence.</p><p><strong>Acer confirms hack:</strong><span> Taiwanese hardware vendor Acer has </span><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/acer-breached-hacker-selling-access-to-160gb-of-stolen-data" rel="">confirmed</a><span> a security breach after a hacker began selling more than 160GB of data they stole from one of the company&#39;s servers. According to the seller, an individual going by the name of Kernelware, the stolen data includes details about the Acer BIOS, confidential presentations, product documentation, ROM, and other binary files. Acer says the files originated from a server for repair technicians.</span></p><p><strong>Facebook&#39;s LLaMA leak:</strong><span> LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), a collection of large language models developed internally at Meta, was leaked on 4chan last week, marking the first time when a major tech company&#39;s proprietary AI model has leaked in full. Prior to the leak, Meta, Facebook&#39;s parent company, had provided access to the LLaMA model to select researchers from the AI community. While the leaker hid their identity using the &#34;llamanon&#34; 4chan username, </span><em><a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/metas-llama-leaked-to-the-public-thanks-to-4chan/" rel="">AnalyticsIndiaMag</a></em><span> notes that the LLaMA torrent file contained a unique identifier that would, theoretically, allow Meta to track down who received and leaked the files. </span><em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwqgw/facebooks-powerful-large-language-model-leaks-online-4chan-llama" rel="">Motherboard</a></em><span> reported that Meta</span><em> </em><span>did not deny or confirm the leak, nor has it taken any steps to have the torrent removed.</span></p><p><strong>LaunchZone crypto-heist:</strong><span> The LaunchZone cryptocurrency portal announced this week a </span><a href="https://archive.ph/5Dr8o" rel="">compensation plan</a><span> for users who lost funds in a </span><a href="https://archive.ph/Qc5aB" rel="">hack</a><span> that took place at the end of February. At the time, the company lost $700,000 following an exploit against one of its contracts that drained around 80% of the funds from its liquidity pools.</span></p><p><strong>Another DDoS attack hits Mastodon:</strong><span> Mastodon.social, today&#39;s largest Mastodon server, was hit by a </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@ruud@mastodon.world/109978034715776292" rel="">massive</a><span> </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/109977517512130143" rel="">DDoS attack</a><span> on Monday, just as Twitter was dealing with a major outage after shooting itself in the foot. </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@DataDrivenMD@fedified.com/109979396195987715" rel="">According to Jorge A.

Since the end of February, the company has been publishing spreadsheets with the in-game nicknames of players it caught cheating. So far, the company has named and shamed more than 6,700 players.

German officials cited fears that Huawei and ZTE equipment could be used for Chinese espionage or sabotage. Previously, the German government gave the go-ahead for Chinese equipment to be used for its 5G network, but the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russia&#39;s attempt to blackmail Germany from aiding Ukraine through its NordStream natural gas pipeline led to a major change of thinking in Berlin. According to German media, telcos that previously installed 5G technology from the two vendors may be forced to rip and replace the equipment.</span></p><p><strong>Israel blames Iran for ransomware attack:</strong><span> Israel has </span><a href="https://www.jns.org/iran-was-behind-last-months-cyberattack-on-the-technion/" rel="">blamed</a><span> Iranian hackers for a ransomware attack that crippled the IT network of the Technion research university last month. Officials with the Israel National Cyber Directorate say that a cyber-espionage group named MuddyWater breached the university and deployed a ransomware strain named DarkBit on its network. In February 2022, the US government </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2022/02/24/iranian-government-sponsored-muddywater-actors-conducting-malicious" rel="">formally linked</a><span> the MuddyWater group to Iran&#39;s Ministry of Intelligence and Security.</span></p><p><strong>Russia wants to ban IM and push-noty spam:</strong><span> FAS, Russia&#39;s anti-monopoly watchdog, has put forward </span><a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects/#npa=136402" rel="">legislation</a><span> to ban the distribution of ads via instant messengers and push notifications without a user&#39;s explicit consent.

Two suspects were questioned in Germany and Ukraine, while German authorities issued </span><a href="https://polizei.nrw/presse/schlag-gegen-international-agierendes-netzwerk-von-cyber-kriminellen" rel="">international arrest warrants</a><span> for three other suspects, </span><a href="https://polizei.nrw/fahndung/100196" rel="">Igor Olegovich Turashev</a><span>, </span><a href="https://polizei.nrw/fahndung/100198" rel="">Igor Garshin</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://polizei.nrw/fahndung/100197" rel="">Irina Zemlianikina</a><span>, all three &#34;with connections to Russia&#34; and considered &#34;core members&#34; of the DoppelPaymer gang. The DoppelPaymer crew started operations in 2019 as a spin-off project from the BitPaymer, a ransomware strain created by the infamous EvilCorp cybercrime cartel. The ransomware got on everyone&#39;s radar after an attack on the Duesseldorf University Hospital was believed to have indirectly caused the </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/first-death-reported-following-a-ransomware-attack-on-a-german-hospital/" rel="">first ransomware-linked death</a><span> of a patient, who had to be redirected to a nearby hospital 30km away. Since then, the DoppelPaymer gang tried to rebrand as the Grief ransomware service, but the intensity of attacks and payments fell after the EvilCorp was sanctioned by the US Treasury, and victims began avoiding paying ransoms to gangs even remotely connected to EvilCorp in an attempt to avoid breaking international sanctions. The gang is believed to have carried out more than 600 intrusions and earned more than €40 million from ransom payments.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png" width="990" height="366" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:366,&#34;width&#34;:990,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:562993,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb19cb42-3e28-4030-8dae-696e67470058_990x366.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>New ransomware strains:</strong><span> Equinix&#39;s William Thomas has </span><a href="https://archive.ph/iSfPF" rel="">spotted</a><span> two new ransomware strains—named Mario ESXI and DarkAngelSteam, both based on the leaked source code of the now-defunct Babuk ransomware.

In addition, the attacker also installs a version of the tcpdump utility through which they monitor email and file-transfer traffic originating from the router&#39;s internal network.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png" width="522" height="401.185546875" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:787,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:522,&#34;bytes&#34;:197658,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3ef5aa2-2e5c-426d-b389-9b6e933968fd_1024x787.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>RunZero is one of this newsletter&#39;s four main supporters and this week&#39;s featured sponsor.

Proofpoint says the group&#39;s main task appears to be to lure unsuspecting victims into phone or video calls discussing controversial topics related to their support of Ukraine. These videos are then edited to discredit the subject and their support for Ukraine and uploaded on YouTube and RuTube. Proofpoint believes the campaign is part of a Russian internal propaganda effort to support its invasion of Ukraine and denigrate critics of Vladimir Putin. Researchers say that in most of the group&#39;s operations, TA499 uses email to reach out to victims, typically posing as embassy employees, Ukrainian government officials, and members of Alexey Navalny&#39;s staff.</span></p><blockquote><p>&#34;Conversations with TA499 typically begin serious and allow the target to voluntarily say as much information as possible. Once the target begins asking questions, the actor mirrors the target&#39;s replies to keep the conversation going. Some of the 2021 videos with the threat actor have the Leonid Volkov impersonator asking for financial support and appear to encourage the target into voicing particular obligations and efforts in tandem with the Russian opposition led by Navalny. Once the target makes a statement on the matter, the video devolves into antics, attempting to catch the target in embarrassing comments or acts. The recordings are then edited for emphasis and placed on YouTube and Twitter for Russian and English-speaking audiences.&#34;</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png" width="926" height="469" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:469,&#34;width&#34;:926,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:88504,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dddea43-63d2-4248-8a7d-c803ca91d3dc_926x469.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Android security updates:</strong><span> ...for March 2023 are </span><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-03-01" rel="">out</a><span>!</span></p><p><strong>Word RCE PoC:</strong><span> Security researcher Joshua J.
