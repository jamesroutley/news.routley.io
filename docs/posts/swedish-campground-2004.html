<p>We thought it was important for the user to be able to invoke every menu command directly from the keyboard, so we added a special key to the keyboard to invoke menu commands, just like our predecessor, Lisa.   We called it the &#34;Apple key&#34;; when pressed in combination with another key, it selected the corresponding menu command.   We displayed a little Apple logo on the right side of every menu item with a keyboard command, to associate the key with the command. </p></div></div>
