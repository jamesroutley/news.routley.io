<p>Years ago I had a discussion with <a href="https://saul.pw/">Saul Pwanson</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability#Other_islands_of_stability">islands of stability</a> and wondered, can I discover an unknown element by calculating its spectra and pointing a telescope at distant stars?</p>
<p>I asked some smart people I know and they said, ‘Yes and…’.</p>
<p>They said I’d need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_set_(chemistry)">basis set</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory">density function</a> calibrated for those elements. They also said problem setup would be a large amount of work, and then a very large amount of CPU and memory to answer the problem.</p>
<p>They suggested I also look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_rule">selection rule</a>.</p>
<p>A related and disheartening discovery was the furious disagreements in publications titled <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=undecidability+of+the+spectral+gap">Undecidability of the spectral gap</a>. What’s up with that?</p>
<p>The math is beyond me, I wouldn’t even know where to start.</p>
<p>If the math isn’t beyond you, try it out and tell me how it goes?</p>
