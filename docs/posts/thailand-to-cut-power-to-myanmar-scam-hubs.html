<p>Thailand will cut electricity, oil supplies, and internet services to five locations in Myanmar at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, citing security concerns over suspected Chinese-operated call center scams. The sites, located in Payathonzu, Tachileik, and Myawaddy townships along the border, have been linked to fraudulent operations targeting victims in Thailand, China, and other countries. Authorities estimate that these scams have cost Thailand alone over 80 million baht per day, amounting to 86 billion baht in total.</p>



<p>The move was decided during an urgent meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister for security affairs Phumtham Wechayachai. The meeting included Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, National Security Council Secretary-General Chatchai Bangchuad, Interior Permanent Secretary Orasit Samphantharat, and Deputy Governor of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) Prasit Chanprasit. Phumtham stressed that national security concerns outweigh economic interests, warning that government officials failing to act could face reassignment.</p>



<p>Authorities have identified unusually high electricity consumption at the targeted sites, reinforcing suspicions that these locations are central to large-scale scam operations. Under the Provincial Electricity Authority Act and a 1996 Cabinet Resolution, the PEA has the authority to cut power to sites found to be non-compliant with contractual agreements. Phumtham emphasized that the decision does not require additional government approval and ordered immediate action.</p>

<p>There are concerns about potential retaliation from Myanmar, particularly regarding natural gas supplies to Thailand. However, Phumtham remained non-committal on the matter, instead reiterating the significant financial and social harm caused by scam operations based in Myanmar.</p>



<p>These fraudulent networks are known to operate primarily from two locations in Myawaddy township: Shwe Kokko and KK Park, both notorious for criminal activities. Thai authorities have previously cut power to three locations in Myanmar in similar efforts to disrupt illegal call centers.</p>



<p>The crackdown comes just before Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s visit to China, where she will participate in events marking 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. The issue of transnational crime, particularly online scams, is expected to be a topic of discussion between Thai and Chinese officials.</p>



<p>Officials attending the security meeting emphasized that action against the call centers falls within Myanmar’s jurisdiction, though Thailand has formally communicated its concerns. A Thai security officer noted that up to 100,000 people, including individuals of various nationalities and a hospital, could be affected by the power cuts in Myawaddy. Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul stated that the PEA must have a formal order from Phumtham before proceeding, and that the exact areas to be affected had been clearly identified.</p>



<p>Thailand’s latest move signals a shift from previous reluctance in tackling cross-border electricity supplies to suspected scam hubs. By cutting power and internet access, Thai authorities aim to disrupt these operations and mitigate the financial damage caused to victims both domestically and internationally.</p>
