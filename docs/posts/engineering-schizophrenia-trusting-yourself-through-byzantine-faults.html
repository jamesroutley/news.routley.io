    <h1>Show HN: Engineering Schizophrenia: Trusting yourself through Byzantine faults</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN!</p><p>My name&#39;s Robert Escriva. I got my PhD from Cornell&#39;s Computer Science department back in 2017.  And three years ago I had a psychotic episode that irreversibly shook up my world.</p><p>Since then I&#39;ve been applying a skill I learned in grad school---namely, debugging distributed and complex systems---to my own mind.</p><p>What I&#39;ve found I&#39;ve put into a [book (pdf)](<a href="https://rescrv.net/engineering-schizophrenia.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://rescrv.net/engineering-schizophrenia.pdf</a>) on engineering, my particular schizophrenic delusions, and how people who suffer as I once did can find a way through the fog to the other side.</p><p>This is not a healing memoir; it is a guide and a warning for all those who never stopped to ask,
&#34;What happens if my brain begins to fail me?&#34;</p><p>I am writing because what I&#39;ve found is not a destination, but a process. It is an ongoing process for me and for people like me. I also believe it is automate-able using the same techniques we apply to machine-based systems.</p><p>I am looking for others who recognize the stakes of the human mind to engage in discussion on the
topic.</p><p>Happy hacking,
Robert</p></div></div></div>
