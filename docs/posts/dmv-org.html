    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>The majority of US states have something called a &#34;Department of Motor
Vehicles,&#34; or DMV. Actually, the universality of the term &#34;DMV&#34; seems to be
overstated. A more general term is &#34;motor vehicle administrator,&#34; used for
example by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators to address
the inconsistent terminology.</p>
<p>Not happy with merely noting that I live in a state with an &#34;MVD&#34; rather than a
&#34;DMV,&#34; I did the kind of serious investigative journalism that you have come to
expect from me. Of These Fifty United States plus six territories, I count 28
DMVs, 5 MVDs, 5 BMVs, 2 OMVs, 2 &#34;Driver Services,&#34; and the remainder are hard
to describe succinctly. In fact, there&#39;s a surprising amount of ambiguity
across the board. A number of states don&#39;t seem to <em>formally</em> have an agency or
division called the DMV, but nonetheless use the term &#34;DMV&#34; to describe something
like the Office of Driver Licensing of the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the very topic of <em>where</em> the motor vehicle administrator is found is
interesting. Many exist within the Department of Transportation or Department
of Revenue (which goes by different names depending on the state, such as DTR
or DFA). Some states place driver&#39;s licensing within the Department of State.
One of the more unusual cases is Oklahoma, which recently formed a new state
agency for motor vehicle administration but with the goal of expanding to other
state customer service functions... leaving it with the generic name of Service
Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The most exceptional case, as you&#39;ll find with other state government functions
as well, is Hawaii. Hawaii has deferred motor vehicle administration to counties,
with the Honolulu CSD or DCS (they are inconsistent!) the largest, alongside
others like the Hawaii County VRL.</p>
<p>So, the point is that DMV is sort of a colloquialism, one that is widely
understood since the most populous states (CA and TX for example) have proper
DMVs. Florida, third most populous state, actually has a DHSMV or FLHSMV
depending on where you look... but their online services portal is branded
MyDMV, even though there is no state agency or division called the DMV. See how
this can be confusing?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are sitting around on a Saturday morning searching for the name
of every state plus &#34;DMV&#34; like I am, you will notice something else: a lot
of...  suspicious results. guamtax.com is, it turns out, actually the website
of the Guam Department of Revenue and Taxation. dmvflorida.org is not to be
confused with the memorable flhsmv.gov, and especially not with
mydmvportal.flhsmv.gov. You have to put &#34;portal&#34; in the domain name so people
know it&#39;s a portal, it&#39;s like how &#34;apdonline.com&#34; has &#34;online&#34; in it so you
know that it&#39;s a website on the internet. </p>
<p>dmvflorida.org calls itself the &#34;American Safety Council&#39;s Guide to the Florida
Department of Motor Vehicles.&#34; Now, we have established that the &#34;Florida
Department of Motor Vehicles&#34; does not exist, but the State of Florida itself
seems a little confused on that point, so I&#39;ll let it slide. But that brings us
to the American Safety Council, or ASC.</p>
<p>ASC is... It&#39;s sort of styled to sound like the National Safety Council (NSC)
or National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), independent nonprofits that publish
standards and guidance. ASC is a different deal. ASC is a for-profit vendor of
training courses. Based on the row of badges on their homepage, ASC wants you
to know not only that they are &#34;Shopper Approved,&#34; &#34;Certifiably Excellent (The
Stats To Prove It),&#34; they have won a &#34;5-Star Excellence Award&#34; (from whom not
specified), and that the Orlando Business Journal included their own John
Comly on its 2019 list of &#34;CEOs of the Year.&#34;</p>
<p>This is the most impressive credential they have on offer besides accreditation
by IACET, an industry association behind the &#34;continuing education units&#34; used
by many certifications, and which is currently hosting a webinar series on &#34;how
AI is reshaping learning landscapes from curriculum design to compliance.&#34; This
does indeed mean that, in the future, your corporate sexual harassment training
will be generated by Vyond Formerly GoAnimate based on a script right out of
ChatGPT. The quality of the content will, surprisingly, not be adversely
affected. &#34;As you can see, this is very important to Your Company. Click Here

<p>In reality, ASC is a popular vendor of driver safety courses that businesses
need their employees to take in order to get an insurance discount. Somewhere
in a drawer I have a &#34;New Mexico Vehicle Operator&#39;s Permit,&#34; a flimsy paper
credential issued to state employees in recognition of their having completed
an ASC course that consisted mostly of memorizing that &#34;LOS POT&#34; stands for
&#34;line of sight, path of travel.&#34; Years later, I am fuzzy on what that phrase
actually means, but expanding the acronym was on the test.</p>
<p>We can all reflect on the fact that the state&#39;s vehicle insurance program is
not satisfied with merely possessing the driver&#39;s license that the state itself
issues, but instead requires you to pass a shorter and easier exam on actually
driving safely. Or knowing about the line of sight and the path of travel, or
something. I once took a Motorcycle Safety Foundation course that included a
truly incomprehensible diagram of the priorities for scanning points of
conflict at an intersection, a work of such information density that any
motorcyclist attempting to apply it by rote would be entirely through the
intersection and to the next one before completing the checklist. We were,
nonetheless, taught as if we were expected to learn it that way. Driver&#39;s
education is the ultimate test of &#34;Adult Learning Theory,&#34; a loose set of
principles influential on the design of Adobe Captivate compliance courses, and
the limitations of its ability to actually teach anyone anything.</p>
<p>This is all a tangent, so let&#39;s get back to the core. ASC sells safety courses
and... operates dmvflorida.org?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing: running DMV websites is a profitable business. Very few
people look for the DMV website because they just wanted to read up on driver&#39;s
license endorsements. Almost everyone who searches for &#34;&lt;state name&gt; DMV&#34; is on
the way to spending money: they need to renew their license, or their
registration, or get a driving test, or ideally, a driver&#39;s ed course or
traffic school.</p>
<p>The latter are ideal because a huge number of states have privatized them, at
least to some degree. Driver&#39;s ed and traffic school are both commonly offered
by competitive for-profit ventures that will split revenue in exchange for
acquiring a customer. I would say that dmvflorida.org is a referral scam, but
it&#39;s actually not! it&#39;s even better: it&#39;s owned by ASC, one of the companies
that competes to offer traffic school courses! It&#39;s just a big, vaguely
government-looking funnel into ASC&#39;s core consumer product.</p>
<p>In some states, the situation is even better. DMV services are partially
privatized or &#34;agents&#34; can submit paperwork on the behalf of the consumer.
Either of these models allow a website that tops Google results to submit your
driver&#39;s license renewal on your behalf... and tack on a &#34;convenience fee&#34; for
doing so. Indeed, Florida allows private third-parties to administer the
written exam for a driver&#39;s license, and you know dmvflorida.org offers such an
online exam for just $24.95.</p>
<p>You can, of course, renew your driver&#39;s license online directly with the state,
at least in the vast majority of cases. so how does a website that does the
same thing, with the same rates, <em>plus</em> their own fee, compete? SEO. Their best
bet is to outrank the actual state website, grabbing consumers and funneling
them towards profitable offerings before they find the <em>actual</em> DMV website.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a whole world of DMV websites that operate in a fascinating nexus of
SEO spam, referral farm, and nearly-fraudulent imitation of official state
websites. This has been going on since, well, I have a reliable source that
claims since 1999: dmv.org.</p>
<p>dmv.org is an incredible artifact of the internet. It contains an <em>enormous</em>
amount of written content, much of it of surprisingly high quality, in an
effort to maintain strong search engine rankings. It used to work: for many
years, dmv.org routinely outranked state agency websites for queries that were
anywhere close to &#34;dmv&#34; or &#34;renew driver&#39;s license&#34; or &#34;traffic school.&#34; And it
was all in the pursuit of referral and advertising revenue. Take it from them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advertise with DMV.ORG</p>
<p>Partner with one of the most valuable resource for DMV &amp; driving - driven by
85% organic reach that captures 80% of U.S drivers, DMV.ORG helps organize
the driver experience across the spectrum of DMV and automotive- related
information. Want to reach this highly valued audience? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>dmv.org claims to date back to 1999, and I have no reason to doubt them, but
the earliest archived copies I can find are from 2000 and badly broken. By late
2001 the website has been redesigned, and reads &#34;Welcome to the Department of
Motor Vehicles Website Listings.&#34; If you follow the call to action and look up
your state, it changes to &#34;The Department of Motor Vehicles Portal on the
Web!&#34;</p>
<p>They should have gone for dmvportal.org for added credibility.</p>
<p>In 2002, dmv.org takes a new form: before doing pretty much anything, it asks
you for your contact information, including an AOL, MSN, or Yahoo screen name.
They promise not to sell your address to third parties but this appears to be a
way to build their own marketing lists. They now prominently advertise vehicle
history reports, giving you a referral link to CarFax.</p>
<p>Over the following months, more banner ads and referral links appear: vehicle
history reports, now by edriver.com, $14.99 or $19.99. Driving record status,
by drivingrecord.org, $19.99. Traffic School Online, available in 8 states,
dmv-traffic-school.com and no price specified. The footer: &#34;DMV.ORG IS
PRIVATELY OPERATED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS USERS.&#34;</p>
<p>In mid-2003, there&#39;s a rebranding. The header now reads &#34;DMV Online Services.&#34;
There are even more referral links. Just a month later, another redesign, a
brief transitional stage, before in September 2003, dmv.org achieves the form
familiar to most of us today: A large license-plate themed &#34;DMV.ORG&#34; logotype,
referral links everywhere, map of the US where you can click on your state.
&#34;Rated #1 Site, CBS Early Show.&#34;</p>
<p>This year coincides, of course, with rapid adoption of the internet. Suddenly
consumers really are online, and they really are searching for &#34;DMV.&#34; And
dmv.org is building a good reputation for itself. A widely syndicated 2002
newspaper article about post-marriage bureaucracy (often appearing in a
Bridal Guide supplement) sends readers to dmv.org for information on updating
their name. <em>The Guardian,</em> of London, points travelers at dmv.org for
information on obtaining a handicap placard while visiting the US.</p>
<p>You also start to see the first signs of trouble. Over the following years, an
increasing number of articles both in print and online refer to dmv.org as if
it is <em>the</em> website of <em>the</em> Department of Motor Vehicles. We cannot totally
blame them for the confusion. First, the internet was relatively new, and
reporters had perhaps not learned to be suspicious of it. Second, states
themselves sometimes fanned the flames. In a 2005 article, the director of
driver services for the Mississippi Department of Transportation tells the
reporter that you can now renew your driver&#39;s license online... at dmv.org.</p>
<p>dmv.org was operated by a company called eDriver. It&#39;s hard to find much about
them, because they have faded into obscurity and search results are now
dominated by the lawsuit that you probably suspected is coming. The &#34;About Us&#34;
page of the dmv.org of this period is a great bit of copywriting, complete with
dramatic stories, but almost goes out of its way not to name the people
involved. &#34;One of our principals likes to say...&#34;</p>
<p>eDriver must not have been very large, their San Diego office address was a
rented mail box. Whether or not it started out that way is hard to say, but
by 2008 eDriver was a subsidiary of Biz Groups Inc., along with Online Guru
Inc and Find My Specialist Inc. These corporate names all have intense &#34;SEO
spam&#34; energy, and they seem to have almost jointly operated dmv.org through
a constellation of closely interlinked websites. In 2008, eDriver owned dmv.org
but didn&#39;t even run it: they contracted Online Guru to manage the website.</p>
<p>Biz Groups Inc was owned by brothers Raj and Ravi Lahoti. Along with third
brother David, the Lahotis were &#39;00s domain name magnates. They often landed on
the receiving end of UDRP complaints, ICANN&#39;s process for resolving disputes
over the rightful ownership of domain names. Well, they were in the business:
David Lahoti owns UDRP-tracking website udrpsearch.com to this day.</p>
<p>Their whole deal was, essentially, speculating on domain names. Some of them
weren&#39;t big hits. An article on a dispute between the MIT Scratch project and
the Lahotis (as owners of scratch.org) reads &#34;Ravi updated the site at
Scratch.org recently to includes news articles and videos with the word scratch
in them. It also has a notice that the domain was registered in 1998 and
includes the dictionary definition of scratch.&#34;</p>
<p>Others were more successful. In 2011, Raj Lahoti was interviewed by a Korean
startup accelerator called beSuccess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My older brother Ravi was the main inspiration behind starting OnlineGURU.
Ravi owned many amazing domain names and although he didn&#39;t build a website
on every one of his domains, he DID build a small website at www.DMV.org and
this website started doing well. Well enough that he saw an opportunity to do
something bigger with it and turn it into a bigger business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he is clear on how the strategy evolved to focus on SEO farming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Search Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization has definitely been
most effective in my overall marketing strategy. The beautiful thing about
search engines is that you can target users who are looking for EXACTLY what
you offer at the EXACT moment they are looking for it. Google Adwords has so
many tools, such as the Google Keyword Tool where you can learn what people
are searching for and how many people are searching the same thing. This has
allowed me to learn about WHAT the world wants and gives me ideas on how I
can provide solutions to help people with what they are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, San Diego Business Journal named Raj Lahoti &#34;among the finalists of the
publication&#39;s Most Admired CEO award&#34; in 2011. So if he ever meets John Comly,
they&#39;ll have something to talk about.</p>
<p>The thing is, the relationship between dmv.org and actual state motor vehicle
administrators became blurrier over time... perhaps not coincidentally, just as
dmv.org ascended to a top-ranking result across a huge range of Google queries.
It really was a business built entirely on search engine ranking, and they
seemed to achieve that ranking in part through a huge amount of content (that
is <em>distinctly</em> a cut above the nearly incoherent SEO farms you see today), but
also in part through feeding consumer confusion between them and state
agencies. I personally remember ending up on dmv.org when looking for the
actual DMV&#39;s website, and that was probably when I was trying to get a driver&#39;s
license to begin with. It was getting a bit of a scammy reputation, actual DMVs
were sometimes trying to steer people away from it, and in 2007 they were sued.</p>
<p>A group of website operators in basically the same industry, TrafficSchool.com
Inc and Driver&#39;s Ed Direct, LLC, filed a false advertising suit against the
Online Guru family of companies. They claimed not that dmv.org was fraudulent,
but that it unfairly benefited from pretending to be an official website.</p>
<p>Their claim must have seemed credible. At the beginning of 2008, before the
lawsuit made it very far,  dmv.org&#39;s tagline changed from &#34;No need to stand IN
LINE. Your DMV guide is now ON LINE!&#34; to &#34;Your unofficial guide to the DMV.&#34;
This became the largest indication that dmv.org was not an official website,
supplementing the small, grey text that had been present in the footer for
years.</p>
<p>The judge was not satisfied.</p>
<p>See, the outcome of the lawsuit was sort of funny. The court agreed that
dmv.org was engaging in false advertising under the Lanham Act, but then found
that the plaintiffs were doing basically the same thing, leaving them with
&#34;unclean hands.&#34; Incidentally, they would appeal and the appeals court would
disagree on some details of the &#34;unclean hands&#34; finding, but the gist of the
lower court&#39;s ruling held: the plaintiffs would not receive damages, since
they had been pursuing the same strategy, but the court did issue an injunction
requiring dmv.org to add a splash screen clearly stating that it was not an
official website.</p>
<p>The lawsuit documents are actually a great read. The plaintiffs provided the
court with a huge list of examples of confusion, including highlights like a
Washington State Trooper emailing dmv.org requesting a DUI suspect&#39;s Oregon
driving records. dmv.org admitted to the court that they received emails like
this on &#34;a daily basis,&#34; many of them being people attempting to comply with
mandatory DUI reporting laws by reporting their recent DUI arrest... to Online
Guru.</p>
<p>The court noted the changes made to dmv.org in early 2008, including the
&#34;Unofficial&#34; heading and changing headings from, for example, &#34;California DMV&#34;
to &#34;California DMV Info.&#34; But those weren&#39;t sufficient: going forward, users
would have to click &#34;acknowledge&#34; on a page warning them.</p>
<p>It is amusing, of course, that the SEO industry of the time interpreted the
injunction mainly in the SEO context. This was, after all, a website that lived
and died by Google rankings, part of a huge industry of similar websites. Eric
Goldman&#39;s <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2008/09/dmvorg_hit_with.htm">Technology and Marketing Law
Blog</a> wrote
that &#34;My hypothesis is that such an acknowledgment page wrecks DMV.org’s
search engine indexing by preventing the robots from seeing the page content.&#34;</p>
<p>The takeaway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This suggests a possible lesson to learn from this case. The defendants had a
great domain name (DMV.org) that they managed to build nicely, but they may
have too aggressive about stoking consumer expectations about their
affiliation with the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s wild that &#34;get a good domain name and pack it with referral links&#34; used to
be a substantial portion of the internet economy. Good thing nothing that vapid
survives today! Speaking of today, what happened to dmv.org?</p>
<p>Well, the court order softened over time, and the acknowledgment page
ultimately went away. It was replaced by a large, top-of-page banner, almost
comically reminiscent of those appearing on cigarettes. &#34;DMV.ORG IS A
<strong>PRIVATELY OWNED</strong> WEBSITE THAT IS <strong>NOT</strong> OWNED OR OPERATED BY ANY STATE
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.&#34; Below that, the license plate dmv.org logotype, same as
ever.</p>
<p>Besides, they reformed. At
<a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/organizational-change/paying-it-forward-how-dmv-org-is-taking-sustainability-to-the-streets">sustainablebrands.com</a>
we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over our 10-year history, DMV.org’s mission has shifted entirely from profit
to purpose. We not only want to bring value to our users by making their DMV
experience easier, we ultimately want to reduce transportation-related
deaths, encourage eco-friendly driving habits, and influence other businesses
to reduce their carbon footprints and become stewards of change themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This press-release-turned-article says that they painted &#34;the company’s human
values on our wall, to remind ourselves every day what we’re here for and why&#34;
and that, curiously, dmv.org &#34;potentially aim[s] to&#34; &#34;eliminate Styrofoam from
local eateries.&#34; The whole thing is such gross greenwashing, bordering on
incoherent, that I might accuse it of being AI-generated were it not a decade
old.</p>
<p>dmv.org lived by Google and, it seems, it will die by Google. Several SEO blogs
report that, sometime in 2019, Google seems to have applied aggressive manual
adjustments to a list of government-agency-like domain names that include
irs.com (its whole own story) and dmv.org. Their search traffic almost
instantaneously dropped by 80%.</p>
<p>dmv.org is still going today, but I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s relevant any more. I
tried a scattering of Google queries like &#34;new mexico driver&#39;s license&#34; and
&#34;traffic school,&#34; the kind of thing where dmv.org used to win the top five
results, and they weren&#39;t even on the first page. Online Guru still operates
dmv.org, and &#34;dmv.org is NOT your state agency&#34; might as well be the new
tagline. Phrases like that one constantly appear in headings and sidebars.</p>
<p>They advertise auto insurance, and will sell you online practice tests for $10.
Curiously, when I look up how to renew my driver&#39;s license in New Mexico,
dmv.org sends me to the actual NM MVD website. That&#39;s sort of a funny twist,
because New Mexico does indeed allow renewal through private service providers
that are permitted to charge a service fee. I don&#39;t think dmv.org makes enough
money to manage compliance with all these state programs, though, so it&#39;s actually
returned to its roots, in a way: just a directory of links to state websites.</p>
<p>Also, there&#39;s a form you can fill out to become a contributor! <em>Computers Are
Bad</em> has been fun, but I&#39;m joining the big leagues. Now I write for dmv.org.</p>
