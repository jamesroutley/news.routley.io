Since its founding in 2021, Anthropic has raised more than $14.8 billion from venture firms like Menlo Ventures and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Salesforce.</p><p>The deal comes amid a surge in funding activity for the industry’s most prominent A.I. start-ups. OpenAI is set to complete a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/technology/openai-softbank-investment.html" title="">$40 billion fund-raising deal that would value the company at $300 billion</a>, nearly double its valuation from just five months ago. Elon Musk’s xAI is in talks for a new financing round that could value it at as much as $75 billion, up from about $40 billion just two months ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/technology/openai-elon-musk.html" title="">two people with knowledge of the discussions said</a>.</p><p>OpenAI started the A.I. boom in late 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, setting off a funding surge that moved billions into a wide range of start-ups. Enthusiasm among investors for A.I. companies cooled in 2024, as several high-profile start-ups were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/technology/ai-start-ups-google-microsoft-amazon.html" title="">essentially folded into tech giants</a> like Google and Amazon. But as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, with its chatbot called Claude, have continued to improve their A.I. technologies, investor interest has returned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied those claims.)</p><p>Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s chief executive, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, its president, founded the company as a start-up that would build A.I. with guardrails. Like several others on the company’s founding team, they had left OpenAI after disagreements with the start-up&#39;s leadership over how its technologies were being funded and released through Microsoft.</p><p>In a podcast interview in 2023, Mr. Amodei said there was a 10 to 25 percent chance that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLv62w2G6os" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A.I. technology could destroy humanity</a>. But in October, he struck a more optimistic tone, publishing a <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14,000-word essay</a> on the potential benefits of A.I. technologies.</p><p>“I think that most people are underestimating just how radical the upside of A.I. could be, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks could be,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The next month, Anthropic raised $4 billion from Amazon, its largest investor, which has put a total of $8 billion into the start-up. Anthropic builds and operates its A.I. systems using computer data centers owned by Amazon and Google.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
