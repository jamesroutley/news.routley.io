It listens for the chatter that matters — another host pinging you, a trunk port exposing extra VLANs, LLDP/CDP Neighbor information or a flood of DHCP or broadcast traffic. These are just a few of the events PingStalker automatically detects and logs, giving you eyes on everything happening beneath the surface.</p>
