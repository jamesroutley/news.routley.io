          Introducing AlphaFold 3, a new AI model developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs. By accurately predicting the structure of proteins, DNA, RNA, ligands and more, and how they interact, we hope it will transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery.

        <div><p data-block-key="t1yf2">Inside every plant, animal and human cell are billions of molecular machines. They’re made up of proteins, DNA and other molecules, but no single piece works on its own. Only by seeing how they interact together, across millions of types of combinations, can we start to truly understand life’s processes.</p><p data-block-key="37r0c">In a paper published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w" rt-link-type="external"><i>Nature</i></a>, we introduce AlphaFold 3, a revolutionary model that can predict the structure and interactions of all life’s molecules with unprecedented accuracy. For the interactions of proteins with other molecule types we see at least a 50% improvement compared with existing prediction methods, and for some important categories of interaction we have doubled prediction accuracy.</p><p data-block-key="2am3m">We hope AlphaFold 3 will help transform our understanding of the biological world and drug discovery. Scientists can access the majority of its capabilities, for free, through our newly launched <a href="http://alphafoldserver.com/" rt-link-type="external">AlphaFold Server</a>, an easy-to-use research tool. To build on AlphaFold 3’s potential for drug design, <a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/rational-drug-design-with-alphafold-3" rt-link-type="external">Isomorphic Labs</a> is already collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to apply it to real-world drug design challenges and, ultimately, develop new life-changing treatments for patients.</p><p data-block-key="79nqe">Our new model builds on the foundations of AlphaFold 2, which in 2020 made a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology/" rt-link-type="external">fundamental breakthrough in protein structure prediction</a>. So far, <a href="https://deepmind.google/impact/meet-the-scientists-using-alphafold/" rt-link-type="external">millions of researchers</a> globally have used AlphaFold 2 to make discoveries in areas including malaria vaccines, cancer treatments and enzyme design. AlphaFold has been cited more than 20,000 times and its scientific impact recognized through many prizes, most recently the <a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/73" rt-link-type="external">Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences</a>. AlphaFold 3 takes us beyond proteins to a broad spectrum of biomolecules. This leap could unlock more transformative science, from developing biorenewable materials and more resilient crops, to accelerating drug design and genomics research.</p></div>

It models large biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as small molecules, also known as ligands — a category encompassing many drugs. Furthermore, AlphaFold 3 can model chemical modifications to these molecules which control the healthy functioning of cells, that when disrupted can lead to disease.</p><p data-block-key="bkj8h">AlphaFold 3’s capabilities come from its next-generation architecture and training that now covers all of life’s molecules. At the core of the model is an improved version of our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2" rt-link-type="external">Evoformer module</a> — a deep learning architecture that underpinned AlphaFold 2’s incredible performance. After processing the inputs, AlphaFold 3 assembles its predictions using a diffusion network, akin to those found in AI image generators. The diffusion process starts with a cloud of atoms, and over many steps converges on its final, most accurate molecular structure.</p><p data-block-key="bc95f">AlphaFold 3’s predictions of molecular interactions surpass the accuracy of all existing systems. As a single model that computes entire molecular complexes in a holistic way, it’s uniquely able to unify scientific insights.</p></div>

This new window on the molecules of life reveals how they’re all connected and helps understand how those connections affect biological functions — such as the actions of drugs, the production of hormones and the health-preserving process of DNA repair.</p><p data-block-key="8bon2">The impacts of AlphaFold 3 and our free AlphaFold Server will be realized through how they empower scientists to accelerate discovery across open questions in biology and new lines of research. We’re just beginning to tap into AlphaFold 3’s potential and can’t wait to see what the future holds.</p></div>
