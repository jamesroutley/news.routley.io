    <h1>What is the prime factorization of zero?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Fundamental theorem of arithmetic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: every whole number can be split into a product of prime numbers in a <em>unique</em> way.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>\(6 = 2*3 = (2,3)\) \(8 = 2 *2 *2 =2^3 = (2, 2, 2)\)</p>

<p>What is prime factorization of one? An empty sequence, because it is the multiplicative identity and an empty product is the identity.</p>

<p>Now given this theorem, let’s think of 6 from a different POV:</p>

\[6 = (2,3)\]

<p>Then dividing by a prime p is equivalent to dropping a term of value p from the sequence on the right hand side.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a bold step and declare 0 has a factorization. Name it $F$(actorization).</p>

<p>\(0 = F\) But \(\frac{0}{2} = 0\), so dropping a term from F should give us the factorization of zero. Which is \(F\) itself!</p>

<p>This dropping property holds for any prime p, and by extension any nonzero number at all<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So F:</p>

<ol>
  <li>has to be infinite length, else dropping a term from it would strictly shorten it.</li>
  <li>contains every prime infinitely many times since 0 can be divided arbitrarily many times without changing.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the prime factorization of 0 is all the prime numbers repeated a infinite number of times. Unlike every other standard natural number, not a finite sequence. \(0 = (2^\infty,3^\infty,5^\infty...) = \prod_p p^\infty\)</p>

<p>So if you take every positive number and multiply them all by each other you get zero. Trippy.</p>
