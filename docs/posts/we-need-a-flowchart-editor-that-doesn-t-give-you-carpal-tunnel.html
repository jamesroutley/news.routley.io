        <p>
          This is a post about why I&#39;m making <a href="https://www.knotend.com">knotend</a>, a flowchart editor
          designed for speed, and why we need to get away from mouse-based flowchart editors.
        </p>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          As a programmer, I&#39;ve worked on a lot of large projects and I always
          found that none of our project management tools were good at letting us define dependencies between tasks. This is a
          major pain because the connections between tasks give you critical information about how to accomplish those tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started thinking about why these tools don&#39;t have a good graphical view of dependencies.
          My belief is that we haven&#39;t found a good interface for editing directed graphs rapidly. Speed is
          important because people won&#39;t bother to update the graph if it&#39;s cumbersome.
          With most flowcharting tools you drag boxes around to position them, then drag arrows
          to connect them. There&#39;s usually a zoomable 2D canvas. After dragging around boxes for a few minutes you need to
          take a break and ice your wrists. It&#39;s just too slow, there&#39;s too many micro-interactions, and it distracts you from what matters
          most: defining your dependencies.
        </p>
        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>
          My first goal was to make a keyboard-centric interface for editing graphs.
          This is drastically different than the common representation of a flowchart as a zoomable canvas. Traditionally you can place a
          box at any pixel that you like, so you need an input mode that operates on the granularity of pixels, like a mouse.
        </p>        
        <p>
          I decided to have <a href="https://www.knotend.com">knotend</a> use a 2D
          grid, similar to a spreadsheet, but with padding between the cells. Every node must go in one cell of the grid, and every node is the same size. In addition to this,
          <b>the user cannot choose how the nodes are layed out</b>. That&#39;s determined by an autolayout algorithm that looks at the dependencies.
          You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VinTyR3fh_8">view  a demo here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the layout is constrained to a grid, we can add a similar selection/navigation mechanism
          that you find in a spreadsheet. For example if there&#39;s a node 3 cells over to the right, I could hit <b>-&gt;</b> 3 times to move there,
          then hit <b>Tab</b> to create a new child node (or Shift-Tab to add a parent node).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a comparison, have you ever thought about how easy it is to edit a bulleted list in a text document?
          An average user can fluidly write out a nested list using <b>Return</b>, <b>Tab</b>, <b>Shift-Tab</b>, etc to add items. This is how I want
          knotend to feel. It should feel like a text editor, not a big graphical mess of boxes and arrows.
