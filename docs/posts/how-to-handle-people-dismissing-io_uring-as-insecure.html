    <h1>How to handle people dismissing io_uring as insecure?</h1>

        <p dir="auto">As I&#39;m sure you know, this is all mostly centered around a) google using an old kernel on android, b) the older kernel had a design issue around async offload, and c) google paying out money for exploits / security issues found there. It&#39;s not secret that the initial async offload design in io_uring was not great, which is why 5.10-stable and all later kernels changed the thread model for that to not use kthreads at all. Then they put out the announcement last year, and that&#39;s all most people know about it.</p>
<p dir="auto">My hope is that this reputation will go away eventually, as less issues are found in the code. There are no inherent problems with io_uring since the above got sorted out, and we&#39;re obviously very careful with new features. That said, a performant async framework is very hard work, and particularly one with a user facing API. It was to be expected that issues would be found initially, it&#39;s just impossible to avoid. Perhaps if it had been written in Rust we would&#39;ve been better off ;-). We continually add more test cases and all new features are accompanied by both functional and stress tests on the liburing side. We&#39;re most certainly doing what we can to ensure the base is solid.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re running this in production at Meta, mostly storage for now, but networking is being heavily tested and will be rolled out in the very near future. We certainly think it&#39;s fine... Fact is that security issues are found in the kernel every day, and io_uring isn&#39;t any less secure than anything else. One of the more recent issues that I saw got tagged as an io_uring issue (credential ref count overflows) isn&#39;t an io_uring issue, it&#39;s just that io_uring was the method used to trigger it. It&#39;s very much possible to hit without io_uring, and in fact methods for doing so were known, it just required more memory to do so.</p>
