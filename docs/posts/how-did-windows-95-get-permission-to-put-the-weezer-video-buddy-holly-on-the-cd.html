    <h1>How did Windows 95 get permission to put the Weezer video Buddy Holly on the CD?</h1>

            <p>Some time ago, I noted that <a title="Why did the Windows 95 CD have extra fun stuff?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060103-52/?p=32853"> the Windows 95 CD contained a variety of multimedia extras</a>, partly because they were fun, and partly to show off Windows 95’s multimedia capabilities.</p>
<p>One of those multimedia extras was the music video for the song <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)">Buddy Holly</a></i> by the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer">Weezer</a>. Acquiring permission to redistribute the video took multiple steps.</p>
<p>First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer’s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently <a title="Knowledge Drop: Weezer Had No Idea The Music Video For " href="https://genius.com/a/weezer-had-no-idea-the-music-video-for-buddy-holly-would-be-included-with-windows-95"> without the knowledge of the band members themselves</a>. They were reportedly upset that they weren’t consulted but later realized that it was “one of the greatest things that could have happened to us. Can you imagine that happening today? It’s like, there’s one video on YouTube, and it’s your video.”</p>
<p>But that only secured the rights to the music. What about the video?</p>
<p>The video takes place in a reconstruction of a location from the <i>Happy Days</i> television program, and clips from that show were spliced into the music video to create the illusion that many of the characters from the show were part of the video. The lawyer responsible for securing the rights to the video had to contact all of the actors from <i>Happy Days</i> to get their permission. That lawyer thoroughly enjoyed the assignment. I don’t know whether he got to talk to the actors directly, or only to their agents, but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler’s telephone number (or his agent’s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.</p>
