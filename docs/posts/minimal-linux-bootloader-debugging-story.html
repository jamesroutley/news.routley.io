  <p>I maintain two builds of the Linux kernel, a <code>linux/arm64</code> build for <a href="https://gokrazy.org">gokrazy,
my Go appliance platform</a>, which started out on the
Raspberry Pi, and then a <code>linux/amd64</code> one for <a href="https://router7.org/">router7</a>,
which runs on PCs.</p>
<p>The update process for both of these builds is entirely automated, meaning new
Linux kernel releases are automatically tested and merged, but recently the
continuous integration testing <a href="https://github.com/rtr7/kernel/pull/434">failed to automatically merge Linux
6‚Ä§7</a> ‚Äî this article is about tracking
down the root cause of that failure.</p>
<h2 id="background-info-on-the-bootloader">Background info on the bootloader</h2>
<p>gokrazy started out targeting only the Raspberry Pi, where you configure the
bootloader with a plain text file on a FAT partition, so we did not need to
include our own UEFI/MBR bootloader.</p>
<p>When I ported gokrazy to work on PCs in BIOS mode, I decided against complicated
solutions like GRUB ‚Äî I really wasn‚Äôt looking to maintain a GRUB package. Just
keeping GRUB installations working on my machines is enough work. The fact that
GRUB consists of many different files (modules) that can go out of sync really
does not appeal to me.</p>


<p>Instead, I went with Sebastian Plotz‚Äôs <a href="https://sebastian-plotz.blogspot.com/2012/07/1.html">Minimal Linux
Bootloader</a> because it fits
entirely into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">Master Boot Record
(MBR)</a> and does not require
any files. In bootloader lingo, this is a stage1-only bootloader. You don‚Äôt even
need a C compiler to compile its (Assembly) code. It seemed simple enough to
integrate: just write the bootloader code into the first sector of the gokrazy
disk image; done. The bootloader had its last release in 2012, so no need for
updates or maintenance.</p>
<p>You can‚Äôt really implement booting a kernel <strong>and</strong> parsing text configuration
files in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record#Sector_layout">446
bytes</a> of 16-bit
8086 assembly instructions, so to tell the bootloader where on disk to load the
kernel code and kernel command line from, gokrazy writes the disk offset
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_block_addressing">LBA</a>) of <code>vmlinuz</code> and
<code>cmdline.txt</code> to the last bytes of the bootloader code. Because gokrazy
generates the FAT partition, we know there is never any fragmentation, so the
bootloader does not need to understand the FAT file system.</p>
<h2 id="symptom">Symptom</h2>
<p>The symptom was that the <code>rtr7/kernel</code> <a href="https://github.com/rtr7/kernel/pull/434">pull request
#434</a> for updating to Linux 6.7 failed.</p>
<p>My continuous integration tests run in two environments: a physical embedded PC
from <a href="https://pcengines.ch/">PC Engines</a> (apu2c4) in my living room, and a
virtual QEMU PC. Only the QEMU test failed.</p>
<p>On the physical PC Engines apu2c4, the pull request actually passed the boot
test. It would be wrong to draw conclusions like ‚Äúthe issue only affects QEMU‚Äù
from this, though, as later attempts to power on the apu2c4 showed the device
boot-looping. I made a mental note that <em>something is different</em> about how the
problem affects the two environments, but both are affected, and decided to
address the failure in QEMU first, then think about the PC Engines failure some
more.</p>


<p>In QEMU, the output I see is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>SeaBIOS (version Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1)

iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 C900 PCI2.10 PnP PMM+06FD3360+06F33360 C900

Booting from Hard Disk...
</code></pre><p>Notably, the kernel doesn‚Äôt even seem to start ‚Äî no ‚ÄúDecompressing linux‚Äù
message is printed, the boot just hangs. I tried enabling debug output in
SeaBIOS and <a href="https://github.com/rtr7/router7/issues/83#issuecomment-1890354927">eventually succeeded, but only with an older QEMU
version</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Booting from Hard Disk...
Booting from 0000:7c00
In resume (status=0)
In 32bit resume
Attempting a hard reboot
</code></pre><p>This doesn‚Äôt tell me anything unfortunately.</p>
<p>Okay, so something about introducing Linux 6.7 into my setup breaks MBR boot.</p>
<p>I figured using <a href="https://opensource.com/article/22/11/git-bisect">Git Bisection</a>
should identify the problematic change within a few iterations, so I cloned the
currently working Linux 6.6 source code, applied the router7 config and compiled
it.</p>
<p>To my surprise, even my self-built Linux 6.6 kernel would not boot! üò≤</p>
<p>Why does the router7 build work when built inside the Docker container, but not
when built on my Linux installation? I decided to rebase the Docker container
from Debian 10 (buster, from 2019) to Debian 12 (bookworm, from 2023) and that
resulted in a non-booting kernel, too!</p>
<p>We have two triggers: building Linux 6.7 or building older Linux, but in newer
environments.</p>

<details>
<summary>(Contains spoilers) Instructions for following along</summary>
<p>First, check out the <code>rtr7/kernel</code> repository and undo <a href="#mitigation">the mitigation</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% mkdir -p go/src/github.com/rtr7/
% cd go/src/github.com/rtr7/
% git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rtr7/kernel
% cd kernel
% sed -i &#39;s,CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD,#CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD,g&#39; cmd/rtr7-build-kernel/config.addendum.txt
% go run ./cmd/rtr7-rebuild-kernel
# takes a few minutes to compile Linux
% ls -l vmlinuz
-rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 15885312 2024-01-28 16:18 vmlinuz
</code></pre><p>Now, you can either create a new gokrazy instance, replace the kernel and
configure the gokrazy instance to use <code>rtr7/kernel</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% gok -i mbr new
% gok -i mbr add .
% gok -i mbr edit
# Adjust to contain:
    &#34;KernelPackage&#34;: &#34;github.com/rtr7/kernel&#34;,

    &#34;EEPROMPackage&#34;: &#34;&#34;,
</code></pre><p>‚Ä¶or you skip these steps and extract <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2024-02-11-minimal-linux-bootloader-debugging-story/gokrazy-mbr.tar.bz2">my already prepared
config</a> to <code>~/gokrazy/mbr</code>.</p>
<p>Then, build the gokrazy disk image and start it with QEMU:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% GOARCH=amd64 gok -i mbr overwrite \
  --full /tmp/gokr-boot.img \
  --target_storage_bytes=1258299392

  -nographic \
  -drive file=/tmp/gokr-boot.img,format=raw
</code></pre></details>
<h2 id="updowngrade-versions">Up/Downgrade Versions</h2>
<p>Unlike application programs, the Linux kernel doesn‚Äôt depend on shared libraries
at runtime, so the dependency footprint is a little smaller than usual. The most
significant dependencies are the components of the build environment, like the C
compiler or the linker.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs look at the software versions of the known-working (Debian 10)
environment and the smallest change we can make to that (upgrading to Debian
11):</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian 10 (buster) contains gcc-8 (8.3.0-6) and binutils 2.31.1-16.</li>
<li>Debian 11 (bullseye) contains gcc-10 (10.2.1-6) and binutils 2.35.2-2.</li>
</ul>
<p>To figure out if the problem is triggered by GCC, binutils, or something else
entirely, I checked:</p>
<p>Debian 10 (buster) with its <code>gcc-8</code>, but with <code>binutils 2.35</code> from bullseye
still works. (Checked by updating <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>, then upgrading only
the <code>binutils</code> package.)</p>
<p>Debian 10 (buster), but with <code>gcc-10</code> and <code>binutils 2.35</code> results in a
non-booting kernel.</p>
<p>So it seems like upgrading from GCC 8 to GCC 10 triggers the issue.</p>
<p>Instead of working with a Docker container and Debian‚Äôs packages, you could also
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)">Nix</a>. The instructions
aren‚Äôt easy, but I <a href="https://github.com/rtr7/router7/issues/83#issuecomment-1885612487">used
<code>nix-shell</code></a>
to quickly try out GCC 8 (works), GCC 9 (works) and GCC 10 (kernel doesn‚Äôt boot)
on my machine.</p>
<h2 id="new-hypothesis">New Hypothesis</h2>
<p>To recap, we have two triggers: building Linux 6.7 or building older Linux, but
with GCC 10.</p>
<p>Two theories seemed most plausible to me at this point: Either a change in GCC
10 (possibly enabled by another change in Linux 6.7) is the problem, or the size
of the kernel is the problem.</p>
<p>To verify the file size hypothesis, I padded a known-working <code>vmlinuz</code> file to
the size of a known-broken <code>vmlinuz</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% ls -l vmlinuz
% dd if=/dev/zero bs=108352 count=1 &gt;&gt; vmlinuz
</code></pre><p>But, even though it had the same file size as the known-broken kernel, the
padded kernel booted!</p>
<p>So I ruled out kernel size as a problem and started researching significant
changes in GCC 10.</p>


<p>I read that one of the main changes in GCC 10 is to enable stack protection by default.</p>
<p>Indeed, building the kernel with Debian 11 (bullseye), but with
<code>CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR=n</code> makes it boot. So, I suspected that our bootloader
does not set up the stack correctly, or similar.</p>
<p>I sent an email to Sebastian Plotz, the author of the Minimal Linux Bootloader,
to ask if he knew about any issues with his bootloader, or if stack protection
seems like a likely issue with his bootloader to him.</p>
<p>To my surprise (it has been over 10 years since he published the bootloader!) he
actually replied: He hadn‚Äôt received any problem reports regarding his
bootloader, but didn‚Äôt really understand how stack protection would be related.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-with-qemu">Debugging with QEMU</h2>
<p>At this point, we have isolated at least one trigger for the problem, and
exhausted the easy techniques of upgrading/downgrading surrounding software
versions and asking upstream.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time for a <strong>Tooling Level Up</strong>! Without a debugger you can only poke into
the dark, which takes time and doesn‚Äôt result in thorough
explanations. Particularly in this case, I think it is very likely that any
source modifications could have introduced subtle issues. So let‚Äôs reach for a
debugger!</p>
<p>Luckily, QEMU comes with built-in support for the GDB debugger. Just add the <code>-s -S</code> flags to your QEMU command to make QEMU stop execution (<code>-s</code>) and set up a
GDB stub (<code>-S</code>) listening on <code>localhost:1234</code>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to debug the Linux kernel, you could connect GDB to QEMU right
away, but for debugging a boot loader we need an extra step, because the boot
loader runs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode">Real Mode</a>, but QEMU‚Äôs
GDB integration rightfully defaults to the more modern Protected Mode.</p>
<p>When GDB is not configured correctly, it decodes addresses and registers with
the wrong size, which throws off the entire disassembly ‚Äî compare GDB‚Äôs
output with our assembly source:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(gdb) b *0x7c00

   0x7c16: xor    %ebx,%ebx
</code></pre><p>So we need to ensure we use <code>qemu-system-i386</code> (<code>qemu-system-x86_64</code> prints
<code>Remote &#39;g&#39; packet reply is too long</code>) and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32955887/how-to-disassemble-16-bit-x86-boot-sector-code-in-gdb-with-x-i-pc-it-gets-tr">configure the GDB target
architecture to 16-bit
8086</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(gdb) set architecture i8086
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, the above doesn‚Äôt actually work in QEMU 2.9 and newer:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/141">https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/141</a>.</p>
<p>On the web, people are working around this bug by <a href="https://gist.github.com/MatanShahar/1441433e19637cf1bb46b1aa38a90815">using a modified <code>target.xml</code>
file</a>. I
tried this, but must have made a mistake ‚Äî I thought modifying <code>target.xml</code>
didn‚Äôt help, but when I wrote this article, I found that it does actually seem
to work. Maybe I didn‚Äôt use <code>qemu-system-i386</code> but the <code>x86_64</code> variant or
something like that.</p>
<h2 id="using-an-older-qemu">Using an older QEMU</h2>


<p>It is typically an exercise in frustration to get older software to compile in newer environments.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs much easier to use an older environment to run old software.</p>
<p>By querying <code>packages.debian.org</code>, we can see the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=qemu-system-x86&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=all&amp;section=all">QEMU versions included in
current and previous Debian
versions</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the oldest listed version (QEMU 3.1 in Debian 10 (buster)) isn‚Äôt
old enough. By querying <code>snapshot.debian.org</code>, we can see that <a href="https://snapshot.debian.org/binary/qemu-system-x86/">Debian 9
(stretch) contained QEMU
2.8</a>.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs run Debian 9 ‚Äî the easiest way I know is to use Docker:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% docker run --net=host -v /tmp:/tmp -ti debian:stretch
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, the <code>debian:stretch</code> Docker container does not work out of the
box anymore, because its <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> points to the <code>deb.debian.org</code>
CDN, which only serves current versions and no longer serves <code>stretch</code>.</p>
<p>So we need to update the <code>sources.list</code> file to point to
<code>archive.debian.org</code>. To correctly install QEMU you need both entries, the
<code>debian</code> line and the <code>debian-security</code> line, because the Docker container has
packages from <code>debian-security</code> installed and gets confused when these are
missing from the package list:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root@650a2157f663:/# cat &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list &lt;&lt;&#39;EOT&#39;

deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security/ stretch/updates main
EOT
root@650a2157f663:/# apt update
</code></pre><p>Now we can just install QEMU as usual and start it to debug our boot process:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root@650a2157f663:/# apt install qemu-system-x86
root@650a2157f663:/# qemu-system-i386 \
  -nographic \
  -drive file=/tmp/gokr-boot.img,format=raw \
  -s -S
</code></pre><p>Now let‚Äôs start GDB and set a breakpoint on address <code>0x7c00</code>, which is <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/21957">the
address to which the BIOS loades the MBR
code</a> and starts execution:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% gdb

Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x00007c00 in ?? ()

</code></pre><h2 id="debug-symbols">Debug symbols</h2>
<p>Okay, so we have GDB attached to QEMU and can step through assembly
instructions. Let‚Äôs start debugging!?</p>
<p>Not so fast. There is another Tooling Level Up we need first: debug
symbols. Yes, even for a Minimal Linux Bootloader, which doesn‚Äôt use any
libraries or local variables. Having proper names for functions, as well as line
numbers, will be hugely helpful in just a second.</p>
<p>Before debug symbols, I would directly build the bootloader using <code>nasm bootloader.asm</code>, but to end up with a symbol file for GDB, we need to instruct
<code>nasm</code> to generate an ELF file with debug symbols, then use <code>ld</code> to link it and
finally use <code>objcopy</code> to copy the code out of the ELF file again.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://github.com/gokrazy/internal/commit/d29c615f07b8e2632e2178b77d2d3d43dec9d46c">commit
d29c615</a>
in <code>gokrazy/internal/mbr</code>, I have <code>bootloader.elf</code>.</p>
<p>Back in GDB, we can load the symbols using the <code>symbol-file</code> command:</p>

<p>The easiest way to understand program flow seems to be to step through the program.</p>
<p>But Minimal Linux Bootloader (MLB) contains loops that run through thousands of
iterations. You can‚Äôt use gdb‚Äôs <code>stepi</code> command with that.</p>
<p>Because MLB only contains a few functions, I eventually realized that placing a
breakpoint on each function would be the quickest way to understand the
high-level program flow:</p>

</code></pre><p>Okay! Now we see that the bootloader starts loading the kernel from disk into
RAM, but doesn‚Äôt actually get far enough to call <code>run_kernel</code>, meaning the
problem isn‚Äôt with stack protection, with loading a working command line or with
anything <em>inside</em> the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This lets us rule out a large part of the problem space. We now know that we can
focus entirely on the bootloader and why it cannot load the Linux kernel into
memory.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="wait-this-isnt-gdb">Wait, this isn‚Äôt GDB!</h2>
<p>In the example above, using breakpoints was sufficient to narrow down the problem.</p>
<p>You might think we used GDB, and it looked like this:</p>

It‚Äôs an easy mistake to make. After all, GDB starts up with
just a text prompt, and as you can see from the example above, we can just enter
text and achieve a good result.</p>
<p>To see the real GDB, you need to start it up fully, meaning including its user
interface.</p>
<p>You can either use GDB‚Äôs text user interface (TUI), or a graphical user
interface for gdb, such as the one available in Emacs.</p>
<h3 id="the-gdb-text-mode-user-interface-tui">The GDB text-mode user interface (TUI)</h3>
<p>You‚Äôre already familiar with the <code>architecture</code>, <code>target</code> and <code>breakpoint</code>
commands from above. To also set up the text-mode user interface, we run a few
<code>layout</code> commands:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(gdb) set architecture i8086
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
(gdb) symbol-file bootloader.elf
(gdb) layout split
(gdb) layout src
(gdb) layout regs
(gdb) break *0x7c00
(gdb) continue
</code></pre><p>The <code>layout split</code> command loads the text-mode user interface and splits the
screen into a register window, disassembly window and command window.</p>
<p>With <code>layout src</code> we disregard the disassembly window in favor of a source
listing window. Both are in assembly language in our case, but the source
listing contains comments as well.</p>
<p>The <code>layout src</code> command also got rid of the register window, which we‚Äôll get
back using <code>layout regs</code>. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs an easier way.</p>
<p>The result looks like this:</p>

On
the left, the <code>B+</code> marker indicates an enabled breakpoint, which will become
helpful with multiple breakpoints. Whenever a register value changes, the
register and its new value will be highlighted.</p>
<p>The up and down arrow keys scroll the source window.</p>
<p>Use <code>C-x o</code> to switch between the windows.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre familiar with Emacs, you‚Äôll recognize the keyboard shortcut. But as an
Emacs user, you might prefer the GDB Emacs user interface:</p>

<h2 id="root-cause">Root cause</h2>
<p>At this point I reached out to Sebastian again to ask him if there was an
(undocumented) fundamental architectural limit to his Minimal Linux Bootloader ‚Äî
with 24 bit addresses, you can address at most 16 MB of memory.</p>
<p>He replied explaining that he didn‚Äôt know of this limit either! He then linked
to <a href="http://www.techhelpmanual.com/222-int_15h_87h__move_memory_block.html">Move Memory Block
(techhelpmanual.com)</a>
as proof for the 24 bit limit.</p>
<h3 id="speculation">Speculation</h3>
<p>So, is it impossible to load larger kernels into memory from Real Mode? I‚Äôm not
sure.</p>
<p>The current bootloader code prepares a GDT in which addresses are 24 bits long
at most. But note that the techhelpmanual.com documentation that Sebastian
referenced is apparently for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286">Intel
286</a> (a 16 bit CPU), and some of the
GDT bytes are declared reserved.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs CPUs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">Intel 386</a>-compatible (a
32 bit CPU), which seems to use one of the formerly reserved bytes to represent
bit <code>24..31</code> of the address, meaning we might be able to pass 32 bit addresses
to BIOS functions in a GDT after all!</p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt able to find clear authoritative documentation on the Move Memory Block
API on 386+, or whether BIOS functions in general are just expected to work with 32 bit addresses.</p>
<p>But Microsoft‚Äôs 1989 <a href="https://github.com/MikeyG/himem/blob/e041532abee44d663067dc6c2b782e459081fa14/oemsrc/xm386.asm#L12">HIMEM.SYS source contains a
struct</a>
that documents this 32-bit descriptor usage. A more modern reference is this
<a href="https://sys.cs.fau.de/extern/lehre/ws23/bs/uebung/seminar/boot.pdf">Operating Systems Class from FAU
2023</a> (page
71/72).</p>
<p>Hence I‚Äôm <em>thinking</em> that most BIOS implementations should actually support 32
bit addresses for their Move Memory Block implementation ‚Äî provided you fill the
descriptor accordingly.</p>
<p>If that doesn‚Äôt work out, there‚Äôs also <a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/a-brief-history-of-unreal-mode/">‚ÄúUnreal
Mode‚Äù</a>, which
allows using up to 4 GB in Real Mode, but is a change that is a lot more
complicated. See also <a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos">Julio Merino‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeyond the 1 MB barrier in DOS‚Äù
post</a> to get
an idea of the amount of code needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/kaj3c2/minimal_linux_bootloader_debugging#c_ybraf4">Lobsters reader abbeyj pointed

#248</a> if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-reading-bios-source">Bonus: reading BIOS source</h2>
<p>There are actually a couple of BIOS implementations that we can look into to get
a better understanding of how Move Memory Block works.</p>
<p>We can look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOSBox">DOSBox</a>, an open source
DOS emulator. Its <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/code-0/HEAD/tree/dosbox/branches/0_74_3/src/ints/bios.cpp#l663">Move Memory Block
implementation</a>
does seem to support 32 bit addresses:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>PhysPt dest	<span>=</span> (<span>mem_readd</span>(data<span>+</span><span>0x1A</span>) <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x00FFFFFF</span>) <span>+</span>
</span></span><span><span>              (<span>mem_readb</span>(data<span>+</span><span>0x1E</span>)<span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>24</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Another implementation is <a href="https://www.seabios.org/SeaBIOS">SeaBIOS</a>. Contrary
to DOSBox, SeaBIOS is not just used in emulation: The PC Engines apu uses
coreboot with SeaBIOS. QEMU also uses SeaBIOS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qemu/seabios/blob/ea1b7a0733906b8425d948ae94fba63c32b1d425/src/system.c#L72">The SeaBIOS <code>handle_1587</code> source
code</a>
is a little harder to follow, because it requires knowledge of Real Mode
assembly. The way I read it, SeaBIOS doesn‚Äôt truncate or otherwise modify the
descriptors and just passes them to the CPU. On 386 or newer, 32 bit addresses
should work.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
<p>While it‚Äôs great to understand the limitation we‚Äôre running into, I wanted to
unblock the pull request as quickly as possible, so I needed a quick mitigation
instead of investigating if <a href="#speculation">my speculation</a> can be developed into
a proper fix.</p>
<p>When I started router7, we didn‚Äôt support loadable kernel modules, so everything
had to be compiled into the kernel. We now do support loadable kernel modules,
so I could have moved functionality into modules.</p>
<p>Instead, I found an even easier quick fix: <a href="https://github.com/rtr7/kernel/commit/304a623297fe3b7ae303811ac097c01fcca901e0">switching from gzip to zstd
compression</a>. This
saved about 1.8 MB and will buy us some time to implement a proper fix while
unblocking automated new Linux kernel version merges.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wanted to share this debugging story because it shows a couple of interesting lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being able to run older versions of various parts of your software stack is a
very valuable debugging tool. It helped us isolate a trigger for the bug
(using an older GCC) and it helped us set up a debugging environment (using
an older QEMU).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up a debugger can be annoying (symbol files, learning the UI) but
it‚Äôs <em>so worth it</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be on the lookout for wrong turns during debugging. Write down every
conclusion and challenge it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BIOS can seem mysterious and ‚Äútoo low level‚Äù but there are many blog
posts, lectures and tutorials. You can also just read open-source BIOS code
to understand it much better.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy poking at your BIOS!</p>
