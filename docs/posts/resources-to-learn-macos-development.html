    <h1>Ask HN: Resources to Learn macOS Development?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Almost 25 years ago before I went down the rabbit hole of backend programming - I did some windows app development. I want to get into macOS programming now (I have been using a mac for the past 5 years and want to get to a place where I can build some hobby apps - I don&#39;t need to make money - I just need the damn machine to do what I want it to) - but I am having difficulty figuring out the right resources.</p><p>I am not interested in API documentation or how-to recipes. I am looking for explanations that will help me build a conceptual understanding of macos UI development. What is the equivalent of the event loop under macos? Do events bubble up through the hierarchy? What is the right way to persist user configuration?</p><p>In the windows era there was a very famous book called &#34;Programming Windows&#34; by Charles Petzold. I am hoping that I can find similar book for macOS programming.</p><p>Please do point me to the resources that have helped you.</p><p>I am not interested in non-native frameworks like Electron or PyQt. If I am developing an app for myself I don&#39;t want to deal with daily irritation of working with a non native framework.</p></div></div></div>
