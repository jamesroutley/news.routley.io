<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> has now begun testing solid-state EV batteries in its Tesla Model 3-rivalling Seal. Initial tests suggest that the total driving range could reach nearly 1,200 miles (1,875 km).</p>

<p>It has been over a decade since BYD first began researching and developing the promising new EV battery technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the company reached a milestone by testing its first solid-state battery cells with capacities of 20 Ah and 60 Ah. We knew BYD was planning to launch its first vehicles powered by the new batteries in 2027 after Sun Huajun, the CTO of BYD’s battery business, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/byd-confirms-evs-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/">confirmed the timeline</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>At the 2025 China All-Solid-State Battery Innovation and Development Summit, Sun stated that BYD has officially installed solid-state batteries in its popular Seal EV and is now testing them on roads.</p>	
	



<p>Once testing is finalized, which is expected to occur in 2027, BYD plans to begin installing solid-state batteries in its production vehicles.</p>

<p>Between 2027 and 2029, production will be limited during the first two years. However, in 2030, BYD plans to begin mass production. BYD has previously said that by the end of the decade, it expects “liquid and solid to be the same price.” In other words, solid-state batteries will be about the same cost as current liquid lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>The Seal, BYD’s Tesla Model 3-rivalling electric sedan, is expected to be the first EV available with solid-state batteries, starting in 2027. Other models will begin to hit the market in 2028 and the following years.</p>

<p>BYD’s solid-state batteries have an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, or nearly twice that of current lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://post.smzdm.com/p/a0zp33or/">local reports</a>, BYD’s solid-state EV batteries set a record by gaining 1,500 km (932 miles) range in just 12 minutes of charging. </p>

<p>The test charged the battery to just 80%, meaning total EV range could reach upwards of 1,875 km (1,165 miles). Keep in mind, that is CLTC range. On the EPA scale, it would be closer to 1,300 km (808 miles), which is still way more than enough.</p>



<p>BYD’s Seal currently starts at just 175,800 yuan in China, or about $25,000. When it initially hits the market in 2027 with solid-state batteries, the Seal will likely be priced higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>BYD is already dominating the global EV market. It just surpassed Tesla in Europe and the UK in monthly registrations for the first time, and this could be just the start.</p>



<p>With several new batteries and plenty of other EV technologies, including ultra-fast chargers, smart driving features, and advanced new platforms, BYD is laying the groundwork for more growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Not only that, BYD is already known for its low-cost cars like the Seagull (Dolphin Surf in Europe), priced under $10,000 in China. The new tech is expected to unlock longer driving range, faster charging, and lower costs.</p>



<p>BYD will compete with CATL, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Nissan, and several others that are also aiming to launch their first EVs with solid-state batteries around 2027 or 2028. Nissan’s director of product planning in Europe, Christop Ambland, confirmed the company’s timeline this week with <em><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/nissan/367112/nissan-deliver-solid-state-battery-tech-production-car-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auto Express</a></em>, saying, “We will be ready for SSB (solid-state batteries) in 2028.”</p>
