One fine day during my years at engineering school I was walking 
down the stairs between two floors in the chemistry building. <b><i>
Bang!</i></b> It sounded like a gunshot, and close at hand. I was 
alone in the stairwell, and a quick inventory showed no punctures, 
so I shrugged it off and continued down the stairs. Just one of 
those things….
</p>

<p>
A few steps later, <b><i>bang!</i></b>  By the time I reached the 
landing, there had been two additional loud reports. It&#39;s then that 
I noticed there were dark splotchy purple-red stains on some of the 
stairs. I went back up a couple of stairs and deliberately stepped 
on one: <b><i>bang</i></b>, and a purple cloud shot from around my 
shoe and started to disperse.
</p>

<p>
This was my first encounter with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_triiodide" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">nitrogen triiodide</a>
(NI<sub>3</sub>), a 
compound formed by reacting elemental
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">iodine</a>
with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_hydroxide" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">ammonium hydroxide</a>.
(The terminology for these chemicals can be confusing. 
Iodine is a crystalline solid at room temperature; the liquid 
“iodine” used to disinfect wounds is properly referred to as 
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincture_of_iodine" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">tincture of iodine</a>”
and is composed of iodine and iodine salts 
dissolved in alcohol and water.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">Ammonia</a>
(NH<sub>3</sub>) is a gas at room 
temperature. The “ammonia” used as a cleaning agent is actually 
ammonium hydroxide, ammonia gas dissolved in water.)
</p>
	

<p>
In nitrogen triiodide, due to the structure of the electron shells 
of nitrogen, the three iodine atoms all bond to one side of the 
nitrogen atom. Since the iodine atoms are about twice the size of 
the nitrogen, they don&#39;t “fit” well in the limited space, and this 
creates what is called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steric_effects" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">steric strain</a>”:
the iodine atoms repel one 
another and thus are only very loosely bonded to the central atom of 
nitrogen. This is a high energy configuration, whose energy can be 
dramatically reduced by rearranging the atoms in a sample of NI<sub>3</sub> so 
that nitrogen atoms are bonded to one another to form nitrogen gas 
(N<sub>2</sub>) and elemental iodine. This leaves lots of left-over energy, 
whence the bang. The cloud of purple is iodine escaping from the 
reaction.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
NI<sub>3</sub> is just barely stable. If kept isolated from all forms of 
disturbance, it will remain in that form, but the application of 
only a tiny amount of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">activation energy</a>
of almost any kind will 
cause some molecules to break down, releasing energy which will 
trigger the breakdown of adjacent molecules in a chain reaction 
until the entire sample has detonated. The detonation proceeds at 
the speed of sound in the material, which is on the order of 3 
kilometers per second.
</p>

<p>
So small is the activation energy that NI<sub>3</sub> can be detonated by just 
about anything: being tickled by a feather, the impact of balloon, 
an air current, an insect landing on it, or a loud noise. It can 
even be set off by an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">alpha particle</a>
emitted by a radiation 
source—it is the only explosive known to be this sensitive. In 
practice, in the real world, sometimes it just blows up and you&#39;re 
not sure why. I can assure you that my size 45 clodhopper landing on 
it will get the job done.
</p>

<p>
When NI<sub>3</sub> is synthesised, it precipitates out from the ammonium 
hydroxide solution and can be separated by filtration. It will 
initially be kept wet by the solution and, while wet, is relatively 
stable, especially if kept cold and in the dark (but that&#39;s 
“relatively”: with this stuff you never know). It&#39;s only when it 
dries out that it becomes hyper-sensitive, so pranksters can mix up 
a batch and then pour it out, say on the steps of a staircase, then 
leave it to dry to await an unsuspecting victim.
</p>

<p>
NI<sub>3</sub> has no practical applications whatsoever. It is so sensitive 
that it will always blow up before you intend it to. Once it dries, 
you can&#39;t even move it without it going <em>blooie!</em> To be useful, an 
explosive has to have an activation energy sufficiently high that it 
can only be set off by a stimulus you can control, such as the 
firing pin of a firearm, heat, or electricity. There is no risk of 
terrorists using NI<sub>3</sub> because anybody who made it in sufficient 
quantities to do serious damage would succeed only in blowing 
themselves up: those who do so are humorous, not terrible.
</p>

<p>
This is good because the stuff is very easy to make, and when I was 
a kid you could buy the ingredients at most pharmacies (pro 
tip—don&#39;t ask for both at the same time; old-time pharmacists have 
seen it all), and they&#39;re available in almost any inorganic 
chemistry lab. I don&#39;t recommend you fool with the stuff, however. 
Enjoy the videos of those who take proper precautions to demonstrate 
it safely.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve never been superstitious about stepping on or avoiding cracks 
in sidewalks, but ever since that day I&#39;ve been suspicious of 
red-purple stains, especially when visiting college campuses.
</p>

<p>
(Now I&#39;m going to go into some chemical detail to avoid quibbles. If 
you&#39;re not interested in such, skip ahead to the videos at the end.) 
There&#39;s an additional bit of sloppy terminology associated with 
nitrogen triiodide. When one makes what is called “nitrogen 
triiodide” from iodine and ammonium hydroxide, what is 
actually produced is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct" rel="Target:FourmilabAux">adduct</a>
of NI<sub>3</sub> and ammonia 
which is written [NI<sub>3</sub> · NH<sub>3</sub>]. The presence of 
ammonia raises the sublimation point of the substance. The adduct 
was discovered in 1812, and is usually called just “nitrogen 
triiodide” because it is that component which gives it its 
bang. Pure NI<sub>3</sub> was only synthesised in 1990 by a route 
not involving ammonia. It sublimes to a gas at a temperature of 
−20° C and spontaneously decomposes at 0° C, 
often blowing up. Little is known of its physical and chemical 
properties because it is difficult to study a substance that 
explodes whenever you try to do an experiment with it, and because 
modern chemists are fond of their fingers and eyes.
</p>

<p>
Here are two videos by The Royal Institution demonstrating 
detonation of NI<sub>3</sub> and discussing why it is so unstable.
