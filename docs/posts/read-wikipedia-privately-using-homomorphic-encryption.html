          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a page is a demo of the work featured in our paper, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368.pdf">&#34;Spiral: Fast, High-Rate Single-Server PIR via FHE Composition&#34;</a>. 
            The code for our system is available <a href="https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This demo allows private access to 6 GB (~30%) of English Wikipedia.
            In theory, even if the server is malicious, it will be unable to learn which articles you request.
            All article title searches are performed locally, and no images are available.
          </p>

          <h2>What costs are associated with running the demo?</h2>
          <p>
            When making your first query, this demo will upload 18 MB of data; each later query requires only 28 KB of upload. 
            The server response to each query is 250 KB.
          </p>

          <h2>Should I use this in production?</h2>
          <p>
            No! This is research-quality software built for demonstration purposes; it is not intended to be 
            side-channel resistant and has not undergone any kind fo security review. Don&#39;t use this code in production.
          </p>

          <h2>Who made this demo?</h2>
          <p>
            Samir Menon, a (currently) independent researcher in PIR and lattice-based cryptography.

            The scheme that this demo uses is &#34;Spiral&#34;, which is a joint work with Prof. David Wu at UT Austin.
