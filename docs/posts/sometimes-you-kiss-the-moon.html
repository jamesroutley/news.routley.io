    <p>Your day must have been full of abundance under the blue sky, scattered with tufts of cloud. The sun must have illuminated the late fall lavender blooms, wafting sweet gratitude over the garden. For tonight, as the air started to cool and the sun released its hold on the last leaves, you turned and graced the crescent moon with the fine point of your beak. Sometimes you kiss the moon.</p>
