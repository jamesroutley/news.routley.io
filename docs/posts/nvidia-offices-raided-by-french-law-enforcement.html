			<p>NVIDIA France offices were raided by French law enforcement and antitrust authorities over suspected engagement of anti-competitive practices.</p>
<h2>NVIDIA France Is Suspected of Engaging In &#34;Anticompetitive Practices&#34; According To French Law Enforcement, Offices Raided</h2>
<p>In a report by <a href="https://twitter.com/markets/status/1707474287433552258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1707474287433552258%7Ctwgr%5Ea3cd0945a1f00f40e9a20af0f9f5d55c83c4135e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisqus.com%2Fembed%2Fcomments%2F%3Fbase%3Ddefaultf%3Dwccftecht_i%3D146813020http3A2F2Fwccftech.com2F3Fp3D1468130t_u%3Dhttps3A2F2Fwccftech.com2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-50-blackwell-flagship-gb202-gpu-up-to-192-sm-units-512-bit-bus-rumor2Ft_d%3DNVIDIA20GeForce20RTX205020E2809CBlackwellE2809D20Flagship20Reportedly20Features20GB20220GPU20With20Up20To2019220SM20Units202620512-bit20Bust_t%3DNVIDIA20GeForce20RTX205020E2809CBlackwellE2809D20Flagship20Reportedly20Features20GB20220GPU20With20Up20To2019220SM20Units202620512-bit20Buss_o%3Ddescversion%3D62db764f4f0426e1eaaed71de8896900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, it is highlighted that the French antitrust authorities have raided a business that was suspected to have been engaged in anticompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-french-offices-raided-in-cloud-computing-competition-inquiry-97c094ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> was able to confirm that the specific company whose offices were raided is NVIDIA on a suspicion that the company may have its hands involved in anti-competitive practices within the graphics card sector. NVIDIA isn&#39;t cited by name and the company has declined to make any statement on the matter, reports Bloomberg.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Raids do not presuppose the existence of a breach of the law,” France’s competition authority said in a statement on its website, “which only a full investigation into the merits of the case could establish, if appropriate.”</p>
<p>via Bloomberg</p></blockquote>
<p>WSJ further adds that the French authorities showed concern about NVIDIA&#39;s dominance within the tech sector which could exclude smaller businesses and startups. The company is now a subject of inquiry.</p>
<p>There&#39;s currently limited information regarding what actually happened and the suspected anti-competitive practices might be nothing more than just a false alarm. NVIDIA has recently gained lots of traction in the GPU segment, and more importantly the AI ecosystem. The green team is rolling in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ceo-jensen-huang-visits-dennys-the-beginning-of-nvidia-trillion-dollar-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trillions</a> and demand for their GPUs is at an all-time high which has prompted the competition such as<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-a-non-believer-in-ai-moat-says-next-10-years-to-be-very-different-from-last-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AMD &amp; Intel</a> to fill up the space that NVIDIA can&#39;t fulfill due to its<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ai-gpu-shortage-could-last-till-2025-due-to-supply-constraints-says-tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inability to meet the huge AI chip orders</a>.</p>
<p>AI sure has propelled NVIDIA into the big leagues but there are now more eyes watching the green team as it moves forward. This might be the start of several such cases that we might see in the future or just one such instance that blows away in thin air.</p>
