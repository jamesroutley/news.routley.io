    <h1>Radicle: Peer-to-Peer Collaboration with Git (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> is a new, peer-to-peer,
MIT/Apache-licensed collaboration platform written in Rust and built on top
of Git. It adds support for issues and pull requests (which Radicle calls
&#34;patches&#34;) on top of core Git, which are stored in the Git repository
itself. Unlike GitHub, GitLab, and similar forges, Radicle is distributed;
it doesn&#39;t rely on having everyone use the same server. Instead, Radicle
instances form a network that synchronizes changes between nodes.

</p><p>As a new project, Radicle is not fully featured compared to the
mature and centralized forges. That said, the Radicle developers are using
Radicle itself to collaborate on the software, along with a Zulip chat
system.  The <a href="https://radicle.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/409174-announcements/topic/1.2E0.2E0-rc.2E1">first
1.0.0 release candidate</a> was announced on March 26.

</p><p>
(Note that I am paid to help develop Radicle.)

</p><h4>Overview</h4>
<p>In Radicle, each user runs their own node on each computer
they use for collaboration. The node stores copies of the repositories
the user is interested in, regardless of whether they&#39;re created by the user or
cloned from another node. The node process runs in the background to
fetch changes from peers and serve repositories to peers that want
them. To the user, the node acts like a local Git server. You clone
from, pull from, or push to the node and it coordinates with other
nodes.

</p><p>There is a web interface for browsing repositories, issues, and
patches, and it also allows opening and managing issues. The web
interface can be opened for the local node, or on a suitably configured server,
for any other node. Thus you can inspect any public node to see if
it is in sync with yours.

</blockquote>

<p>The web interface looks a lot like the more mainstream forges, and is
meant to feel instantly familiar. You can browse the code, issues, and
existing patches. However, unless you run your own Radicle node and
open its web interface, you can&#39;t currently make changes: you can&#39;t
report issues, comment on issues, etc.


</p><p>If you want to clone a repository locally, the web interface provides
two ways: either using normal Git (<tt>git clone</tt>) and an HTTPS URL, just
like other forges, or having your Radicle node fetch it and clone from
that using the <tt>rad</tt> command-line tool. You don&#39;t need to use
Radicle to get a copy of a repository from Radicle.

</blockquote>

<p>Creating issues and patches — and commenting on them — happens using your
own Radicle node. There is a command-line interface, and a web user
interface. The Radicle project is also working on a full-screen terminal
user interface, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">Midnight
Commander</a> but for Git, and there is integration with Visual Studio Code
and IntelliJ IDEs, among others.

</p><h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The motivation for Radicle is similar to that of the overall
decentralization movement. The centralized Git forges are popular
for good reasons: they&#39;ve put in a lot of effort into being easy to
use and efficient, and to provide the kinds of features their users
need. However, they are also not always great for everyone. There is
some truth in the joke that when GitHub is down, the world stops
developing software.
Git was the first popular distributed version control system. Then, the
popularity of GitHub made it the most <i>centralized</i> version control
system.

</p><p>With a peer-to-peer system, if your node is down, you may have to stop
working, but nobody else needs to. More importantly, you don&#39;t need
permission to run a Radicle node. Your access can&#39;t be revoked. Your
repositories can&#39;t be deleted from your node by others.
Nobody will force you to accept an &#34;updated&#34; set of terms and conditions.

</p><p>Radicle stores issues and patches
in the Git repository itself. You can create,
comment, and manage them while offline. Radicle is local-first
software: network access is only required for operations that
inherently require communicating with other computers, such as
retrieving or sending changes. Everything else works without the
network.

</p><p>Radicle repositories are self-signing, a necessary feature in a
distributed system. While a GitHub repository can be authenticated by
location (it&#39;s on GitHub with a given name), a Radicle repository is
associated with a small set of cryptographic signing keys, which
allows its identity and contents to be authenticated regardless of
where the repository is stored.

</p><p><a href="https://radicle.xyz/history">Radicle&#39;s origin traces back to
2017</a>.  Its development is funded by Radworks, an organization that
coordinates on the Ethereum blockchain using a token called RAD.  However,
Radicle does not use any blockchain or cryptocurrency technology.
Radicle is not the only approach to decentralized collaboration over
Git. <a href="https://forgefed.org/">ForgeFed</a> is a protocol built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> to support
a federated network of Git servers.

</p><h4>Architecture</h4>

<p>
Nodes communicate with each other using two different protocols.  First,
there is <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">a gossip
protocol</a>, where nodes tell each other about the nodes and repositories
they know about, and about changes to the repositories. Second, they use
the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Smart-HTTP">Git v2
smart transfer protocol</a> to exchange repository content.

</p><p>Each node stores copies of the repository as it exists on each other
node it knows about, using the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitnamespaces">Git namespace feature</a> and
the node identifier as a name. Each node has nearly identical content, so
this is an efficient way to store the data.
To Git, a Radicle repository is a perfectly normal repository. Radicle
uses standard Git mechanisms to add a persistent repository identity,
issues, and patches. These are stored in special Git refs.

</p><p>
Every repository stored in Radicle has an identity that is the same in
every Radicle node where the repository appears.  If there are multiple
copies of a repository stored in a node, each copy has the same identity,
and can thus be identified as a version of the same repository.  This
identity is created by committing an &#34;identity document&#34; that contains
metadata about the repository; an example identity document is:
</p><pre>    {
      &#34;payload&#34;: {
        &#34;xyz.radicle.project&#34;: {
          &#34;defaultBranch&#34;: &#34;master&#34;,
          &#34;description&#34;: &#34;Radicle Heartwood Protocol &amp; Stack&#34;,
          &#34;name&#34;: &#34;heartwood&#34;
        }
      },
      &#34;delegates&#34;: [
        &#34;did:key:z6MksFqXN3Yhqk8pTJdUGLwATkRfQvwZXPqR2qMEhbS9wzpT&#34;,
        &#34;did:key:z6MktaNvN1KVFMkSRAiN4qK5yvX1zuEEaseeX5sffhzPZRZW&#34;,
        &#34;did:key:z6MkireRatUThvd3qzfKht1S44wpm4FEWSSa4PRMTSQZ3voM&#34;
      ],
      &#34;threshold&#34;: 1
    }
</pre>
<p>
The document includes a description of the repository and its default
branch.  The <tt>delegates</tt> list contains the public Ed25519 keys of
the delegate(s) that are empowered to change the identity document or
commit to the main branch.  This document is stored behind the
<tt>rad/id</tt> ref in the repository.  It must be signed by one of the
delegate&#39;s private keys.
Each repository has a short ID that is calculated from a hash of the
<i>initial</i> version of the identity document.  This ID will not change
as the identity document is modified, and can thus be used to identify the
repository over time.

</p><p>There is no way to prevent anyone from changing the identity document
on their own node and signing it with their own key, bypassing
Radicle. However, other nodes won&#39;t accept the change, since it is not
signed by a delegate&#39;s key, making such
changes pointless.
Radicle also signs the branch and tag refs. The signatures are
refreshed whenever a node changes anything in the repository. This
means that other nodes can verify another node&#39;s repository content
without inspecting the other node directly. This helps prevent
forgeries and related attacks.

</p><p>Issues and patches are stored using an implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">conflict-free
replicated data type</a>, which Radicle calls a &#34;collaborative object&#34;, or
COB. Any node can append data to a COB, and changes from different nodes
can be merged without conflict. (Normal git conflict management applies to
the rest of the content of the repositories, however: the user needs to
resolve them.)  The COB mechanism in Radicle is generic, and can be used to
build further collaboration tools.

</p><h4>Seed nodes</h4>
<p>Any node can synchronize data with any other node, but only if they
can communicate directly. With
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">network
address translation (NAT)</a> being
prevalent, this is often not possible. Radicle does not yet have &#34;NAT
punching&#34;, but relies on third-party, publicly accessible seed nodes.
This is safe thanks to the repositories being self-signed: the seed
node can&#39;t modify the data.

</p><p>Thus, if Alice and Bob are both behind NAT networks, they
can collaborate via a seed node on the Internet that they both can
access. Unlike with centralized forges, anyone can set up a seed node.
This works especially well for open-source projects that don&#39;t need to
keep repositories hidden.

If hiding is necessary, a private seed node and Radicle private
repositories can be used. A private repository is one that&#39;s
configured to only be shared with specific other nodes. However,
Radicle is not yet a good solution for truly confidential material:
the private nodes are still rather rudimentary.

</p><h4>Missing features and other challenges</h4>
<p>Radicle does not yet have mature support for continuous-integration
systems, although work on that is underway. There is also only
rudimentary support for code review, but that is also being worked
on.

</p><p>Currently, Radicle has a simple identity system: each node has its own
public key. A challenge for the future is to evolve this into a more
versatile identity system. For example, a developer with both a laptop
and a desktop system would benefit from being able to certify that
both nodes are theirs. Support for groups or organizations is also
missing.

</p><p>Perhaps a more fundamental challenge is that interacting with a
Radicle repository, even just to report issues, requires using
Radicle. With a centralized forge, all you need is an account and a
web browser. This may be a problem for projects that would like to use
Radicle, but whose users can&#39;t be expected to use it.

</p><h4>Conclusion</h4>
