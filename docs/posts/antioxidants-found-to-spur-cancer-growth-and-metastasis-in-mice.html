            <p>“Many clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors, but the results have not been as successful as anticipated,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/ting-wang">Ting Wang</a>, doctoral student in Professor Bergö’s group at Karolinska Institutet. “Our study opens the door to more effective ways of preventing angiogenesis in tumours; for example, patients whose tumours exhibit high levels of BACH1 might benefit more from anti-angiogensis therapy than patients with low BACH1 levels.”</p>

<p>The researchers used a range of cell-biological methods and concentrated most of their work on lung cancer tumours by studying organoids – small cultivated microtumours from patients. But they also studied mice and samples of human breast and kidney tumours. Tumours in which BACH1 was activated, either via ingested antioxidants or by overexpression of the BACH1 gene, produced more new blood vessels and were highly sensitive to angiogenesis inhibitors.</p>

<p>“The next step is to examine in detail how levels of oxygen and free radicals can regulate the BACH1 protein, and we will continue to determine the clinical relevance of our results,” says Ting Wang. “We’ll also be doing similar studies in other cancer forms such as breast, kidney and skin cancer.”</p>

<p>The study was conducted in close collaboration with KI researchers Susanne Schlisio, Staffan Strömblad and Eckardt Treuter and researchers at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The research was financed primarily by grants from the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Research Council, the Sjöberg Foundation, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Centre for Innovative Medicine (CIMED) and Karolinska Institutet. There are no reported conflicts of interest.</p>
