    <h1>Ship Something Every Day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><p><span>Jun 10, 2024</span></p><article><p>I don&#39;t feel particularly qualified to give advice (I blame imposter syndrome),
but I do have one tip to share that I think has been useful for me.
It applies both to professional software dev and personal projects.</p>
<p>You probably guessed it from the title: <strong>ship something every day</strong>.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t need to be a major feature or even a bug fix. It just needs to be something you can
point to.</p>
<p>Why? A few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dopamine rush of your code being shipped</li>
<li>Your team (and manager) sees you&#39;re working<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s more to this than just performance reviews; with remote work, it&#39;s easy for you and coworkers to feel isolated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your git commit streak looks good<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Yes, people say this doesn&#39;t matter. But I&#39;m sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn&#39;t a great look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done</li>
</ul>
