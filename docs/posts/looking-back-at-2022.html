<p>The last time I did a yearly update was <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/the-path-foward-2020-to-2021/">before the pandemic</a>. A lot has changed since then, but I won’t be going into 2021 (that’s lost to covid), but let’s talk about 2022!</p>
<p>The Gregorian new year is just a milestone which I use to look back in retrospect and look forward and plan. Today I plan to just look back and reflect. I will follow up with another post about what’s in store for me in 2023 (or rather, what I plan to do in 2023).</p>

<p>After spending the beginning of the year in India, we (my wife <a href="https://nayak.io/posts/looking-back-at-2022/kavyasahithi.com/">Kavya</a> and me) were back to Germany mid-January, unfortunately we caught covid on the way back. This was the second time we caught covid. Luckily it was much milder than the first, slight fever for a couple of days. Probably due to the antibodies we’d developed from vaccinations + prior covid. We took a few days to rest and recover and back to work within a week.</p>
<p>In March, we had a wonderful trip in visiting France (Nice, Cannes, Marseille). Travel was one of the primary reasons for us to move to EU, and it was everything we’d hoped for.</p>

<p>Apr-May we did a quick trip to India during to my sister-in-law’s wedding, it was a quite the contrast from the general big Indian wedding (mine had around 1500 guests ─.─||). It was a lot more intimate and much more enjoyable (this could probably be because it wasn’t my wedding). But, I was closely involved in the planning of the wedding. Overall, we had a blast!</p>
<p>The summer of 2022 we decided to spend our time in Berlin and not travel, the idea was to explore local parks and just relax. It was an excellent decision in hindsight, because we were able to spend a lot of time together just cycling and having a picnic.</p>
<p>This also allowed us to walk our neighbor’s dog whenever we could. We’ve been thinking about getting a dog someday and having a first-hand experience was really nice. Generally my interaction with dogs was just petting them, so walking a dog and picking up poop was definitely an insight into owning one.</p>
<p><img src="https://nayak.io/2022/kavyawithdog.jpg" alt="Kavya with dog"/></p><p>I also got a new gravel cycle which I had been eyeing for a while. This was my first cycle purchase (as an adult, and with my own hard-earned $$). <em>Unfortunately it got stolen within 3 months</em>. Sadly this is a common occurrence in Berlin. Funnily, I went to the basement to get the frame number to apply for bike insurance, and it wasn’t there…sigh!</p>
<p><img src="https://nayak.io/2022/cycle1.jpg" alt="Cycle trip"/></p><p>We also moved closer to the center of Berlin. Finding an apartment in <em><a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#is-it-hard-to-find-an-apartment">https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#is-it-hard-to-find-an-apartment</a>super hard</em> in Berlin. We got lucky as a friend of ours noticed an apartment was emptied out and contacted the caretaker on our behalf. The contrast between the old and new apartment was immense, the old house was in a residential area and was closer to parks and the river. This meant with a lack of public transport connectivity, lack of restaurant options and being farther away from the city.</p>
<p>The new house though was tinier, but very well-connected, close to a bunch of restaurants. The driving force was mostly around how previously we didn’t have much of a social life since going anywhere would take 40-60m and that meant we couldn’t really make a lot of plans on the weekdays. Moving to the new house made a lot of difference, I was able to use <a href="https://nayak.io/posts/looking-back-at-2022/urbansportsclub.com/">USC</a> a lot more. We had a much more active social life, and we really got to experience Berlin. We’ve been liking it a lot so far.</p>
<p>Also, previously we had furnished our apartment with the bare necessities (cough! cough! Ikea), this was mid-pandemic when physical stores were closed, and we really wanted to personalize our house, this gave us a fresh start. We also tried our hand at painting, and it turned out much better than expected!</p>
<p><img src="https://nayak.io/2022/painting.jpg" alt="Painting the bedroom"/></p><p>Overall we were really happy how it turned out :) Kavya was the brains behind this whole setup, while I helped with the drilling and procurement of furniture. I’d never done a house setup before and while it was exhausting, the end product was quite rewarding. Almost all the furniture was thrifted or bought second hand which was cost-effective and environment friendly.</p>
