about whether it&#39;s a good idea or not to run a database on Kubernetes. This
happened to be incredibly timely for me, since we at QuestDB are about to launch
<a href="https://questdb.io/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own cloud database service</a> (built on top of
k8s)!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="rubbing-kubernetes-on-postgres-wont-turn-it-into-cloud-sql"></a>&#34;Rubbing Kubernetes on Postgres won&#39;t turn it into Cloud SQL&#34;<a href="#rubbing-kubernetes-on-postgres-wont-turn-it-into-cloud-sql" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Kelsey Hightower&#39;s tweet " height="467" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-02/tweet.png" width="650"/><figcaption>Tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelsey Hightower</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>You can run databases on Kubernetes because it&#39;s fundamentally the same
as running a database on a VM. The biggest challenge is understanding that
rubbing Kubernetes on Postgres won&#39;t turn it into Cloud SQL. ðŸ§µ</p><a href="https://t.co/zdFobm4ijy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zdFobm4ijy</a></blockquote><p>One of the biggest takeaways from this discussion is that there seems to be a
misconception about the features that k8s actually provides. While newcomers to
k8s may expect that it can handle complex application lifecycle features
out-of-the-box, it in fact only provides a set of cloud-native primitives (or
building blocks) for you to configure and use to deploy your workflows. Any
functionality outside of these core building blocks needs to be implemented
somehow in additional orchestration code (usually in the form of an operator) or
config.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="k8s-primitives"></a>K8s Primitives<a href="#k8s-primitives" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When working with databases, the obvious concern is data persistence. Earlier in
its history, k8s really shined in the area of orchestrating stateless workloads,
but support for stateful workflows was limited. Eventually, primitives like
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StatefulSets</a>,
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PersistentVolumes</a>
(PVs), and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) were developed to help orchestrate
stateful workloads on top of the existing platform.</p><p><img alt="K8s Component Diagram" src="https://questdb.io/assets/images/db-on-k8s-diagram-d7ea06ddf1be4d42ec75daffd5de8844.png"/></p><p>PersistentVolumes are abstractions that allow for the management of raw storage;
ranging from local disk to NFS, cloud-specific block storage, and more. These
work in concert with PersistentVolumeClaims that represent requests for a pod to
access the storage managed by a PV. A user can bind a PVC to a PV to make an
ownership claim on a set of raw disk resources encompassed by the PV. Then, you
can add that PVC to any pod spec as a volume, effectively allowing you to mount
any kind of persistent storage medium to a particular workload. The separation
of PV and PVC also allows you to fully control the lifecycle of your underlying
block storage, including mounting it to different workloads or freeing it
all together once the claim expires.</p><p>StatefulSets manage the lifecycles of pods that require more stability than
what exists in other primitives like Deployments and ReplicaSets. By creating a
StatefulSet, you can guarantee that when you remove a pod, the storage managed
by its mounted PVCs does not get deleted along with it. You can imagine how
useful this property is if you&#39;re hosting a database! StatefulSets also allow
for ordered deployment, scaling, and rolling updates, all of which create more
predictability (and thus stability) in our workloads. This is also something that seems
to go hand-in-hand with what you want out of your database&#39;s infrastructure.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="what-else"></a>What else?<a href="#what-else" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>While StatefulSets, PVs, and PVCs do quite a bit of work for us, there are still
many administration and configuration actions that you need to perform on a
production-level database. For example, how do you orchestrate backups and
restores? These can get quite complex when dealing with high-traffic databases
that include functionality such as WALs. What about clustering and high
availability? Or version upgrades? Are these operations zero-downtime? Every
database deals with these features in different ways, many of which require
precise coordination between components to succeed. Kubernetes alone can&#39;t
handle this. For example, you can&#39;t have a StatefulSet automatically set up your
average RDBMS in a read-replica mode very easily without some additional
orchestration.</p><p>Not only do you have to implement many of these features yourself, but you also
need to deal with the ephemeral nature of Kubernetes workloads. To ensure peak
performance, you have to guarantee that the k8s scheduler places your pods on
nodes that are already pre-tuned to run your database, with enough free
resources to properly run it. If you&#39;re dealing with clustering, how are you
handling networking to ensure that database nodes are able to connect to each
other (ideally in the same cloud region)? This brings me to my next point...</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="pets-not-cattle"></a>Pets, not cattle<a href="#pets-not-cattle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><figure><img alt="Pets vs Cattle" height="467" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-02/pexels-helena-lopes-4783413.jpeg" width="650"/><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/golden-retriever-and-cows-in-field-under-sky-at-dusk-4783418/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helena Lopes</a> via <a href="https://pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><p>Once you start accounting for things like node performance-tuning and
networking, along with the requirement to store data persistently in-cluster,
all of a sudden your infrastructure starts to grow into a set of carefully
groomed pet servers instead of nameless herds of cattle. But one of the main
benefits of running your application in k8s is the exact ability to treat your
infrastructure like cattle instead of pets! All of the most common abstractions
like Deployments, Ingresses, and Services, along with features like vertical and
horizontal autoscaling, are made possible because you can run your workloads on
a high-level set of infrastructure components so you don&#39;t have to worry about
your physical infrastructure layer. These abstractions allow you to focus more
on what you&#39;re trying to <em>achieve</em> with your infrastructure instead of <em>how</em>
you&#39;re going to achieve it.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="then-why-even-bother-with-k8s"></a>Then why even bother with k8s?<a href="#then-why-even-bother-with-k8s" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Despite these rough edges, there are plenty of reasons to want to run your
database on k8s. There&#39;s no denying that k8s&#39; popularity has increased
tremendously over the past few years across both startups and enterprises. The
k8s ecosystem is under constant development so that its feature set continues to
expand and improve regularly. And its operator model allows end users to
programmatically manage their workloads by writing code against the core k8s
APIs to automatically perform tasks that would previously have to be done
manually. K8s allows for easy GitOps-style management so you can leverage
battle-tested software development practices when managing infrastructure in a
reproducible and safe way. While vendor lock-in still exists in the world of
k8s, its effect can be minimized to make it easier for you to go multi-cloud (or
even swap one for another).</p><p>So what can we do if we want to take advantage of all the benefits that k8s has
to offer while using it to host our database?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="what-do-you-need-to-build-an-rds-on-k8s"></a>What <em>do</em> you need to build an RDS on k8s?<a href="#what-do-you-need-to-build-an-rds-on-k8s" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Towards the end of the live chat, someone asked Kelsey, &#34;what <em>do</em> you actually need to
build an RDS on k8s?&#34; He jokingly answered with expertise, funding, and
customers. While we&#39;re certainly on the right track with these at QuestDB, I
think that this can be better phrased in that you need to implement Day 2
Operations to get to what a typical managed database service would provide.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="day-2-operations"></a>Day 2 Operations<a href="#day-2-operations" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><figure><img alt="Storage Engineer" height="467" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-02/pexels-brett-sayles-4330788.jpeg" width="650"/><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/set-of-modern-cables-and-connectors-on-shelf-4330788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Sayles</a> via <a href="https://pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><p>Day 2 Operations encompass many of the items that I&#39;ve been discussing; backups,
restores, stop/start, replication, high availability, and clustering. These are
the features that differentiate a managed database service from a simple
database hosted on k8s primitives, which is what I would call a Day 1 Operation.
While k8s and its ecosystem can make it very easy to install a database in your
cluster, you&#39;re going to eventually need to start thinking about Day 2
Operations once you get past the prototype phase.</p><p>Here, I&#39;ll jump into more detail about what makes these operations so difficult
to implement and why special care must be taken when implementing them, either
by a database admin or a managed database service provider.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="stopstart"></a>Stop/Start<a href="#stopstart" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Stopping and starting databases is a common operation in today&#39;s DevOps
practices, and is a must-have for any fully-featured managed database service.
It is pretty easy to find at least one reason for wanting to stop-and-start a
database. For example, you may want to have a database used for running
integration tests that run on a pre-defined schedule. Or you maybe have a shared
instance that&#39;s used by a development team for live QA before merging a commit.
You could always create and delete database instances on-demand, but it is
sometimes easier to have a reference to a static database connection string and
url in your test harness or orchestration code.</p><p>While stop/start can be automated in k8s (perhaps by simply setting a
StatefulSet&#39;s replica count to 0), there are still other aspects that need to be
considered. If you&#39;re shutting down a database to save some money, will you also
be spinning down any infrastructure? If so, how can you ensure that this
infrastructure will be available when you start the database backup? K8s
provides primitives like node affinity and taints to help solve this problem,
but everyone&#39;s infrastructure provisioning situation and budget are different,
and there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all approach to this problem.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="backup--restore"></a>Backup &amp; Restore<a href="#backup--restore" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>One interesting point that Kelsey made in his chat was that having the ability
to start an instance from scratch (moving from a <code>stopped</code> -&gt; <code>running</code> state),
is not trivial. Many challenges need to be solved, including finding the
appropriate infrastructure to run the database, setting up network connectivity,
mounting the correct volume, and ensuring data integrity once the volume has
been mounted. In fact, this is such an in-depth topic, that Kelsey compares
going from 0 -&gt; 1 running instance to an actual backup-and-restore test. If you
can indeed spin up an instance from scratch while loading up pre-existing data,
you have successfully completed a live restore test!</p><p>Even if you have restores figured out, backups have their own complexities. K8s
provides some useful building blocks like
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobs</a> and
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CronJobs</a>,
which you can use if you want to take a one-off backup or create a backup
schedule respectively. But you need to ensure that these jobs are configured
correctly in order to access raw database storage. Or if your database allows
you to perform a backup using a CLI, then these jobs also need secure access to
credentials to even connect to the database in the first place. From an end-user
standpoint, you need an easy way to manage existing backups, which includes
creating an index, applying data retention policies, and RBAC policies. Again,
while k8s can help us build out these backup-and-restore components, a lot of
these features are built on top of the infrastructure primitives that k8s
provides.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="replication-ha-and-clustering"></a>Replication, HA, and Clustering<a href="#replication-ha-and-clustering" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>These days, you can get very far by simply vertically scaling your database. The
performance of modern databases can be sufficient for almost anyone&#39;s use case
if you throw enough resources at the problem. But once you&#39;ve reached a certain
scale, or require features like high availability, there is a reason to enable
some of the more advanced database management features like clustering and
replication.</p><p>Once you start down this path, the amount of infrastructure orchestration
complexity can increase exponentially. You need to start thinking more about
networking and physical node placement to achieve your desired goal. If you
don&#39;t have a centralized monitoring, logging, and telemetry solution, you&#39;re now
going to need one if you want to easily diagnose issues and get the best
performance out of your infrastructure. Based on its architecture and
feature set, every database can have different options for enabling clustering,
many of which require intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the database
to choose the correct settings.</p><p>Vanilla k8s knows nothing of these complexities. Instead, these all need to be
orchestrated by an administrator or operator (human or automated). If you&#39;re
working with production data, changes may need to happen with close-to-zero
downtime. This is where managed database services shine. They can make some of
these features as easy to configure as a single web form with a checkbox or two
and some input fields. Unless you&#39;re willing to invest the time into developing
these solutions yourself, or leverage existing open-source solutions if they
exist, sometimes it&#39;s worth giving up some level of control for automated expert
assistance when configuring a database cluster.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="orchestration"></a>Orchestration<a href="#orchestration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><figure><img alt="Orchestra Conductor" height="467" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-02/pexels-nork-photography-2296100.jpeg" width="650"/><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/conductor-sitting-in-front-of-songbook-2296100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nork Photography</a> via <a href="https://pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><p>For your Day 2 Operations to work as they would in a managed database service
such as RDS, they need to not just work, but also be automated. Luckily for us,
there are several ways to build automation around your database on k8s.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="helm--yaml-tools-wont-get-us-there"></a>Helm &amp; Yaml tools won&#39;t get us there<a href="#helm--yaml-tools-wont-get-us-there" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Since k8s configuration is declarative, it can be very easy to get from 0 -&gt; 1
with traditional yaml-based tooling like Helm or cdk8s. Many industry-leading
k8s tools install into a cluster with a simple <code>helm install</code> or <code>kubectl apply</code>
command.</p><p>These are sufficient for Day 1 Operations and non-scalable deployments. But as
soon as you start to move into more vendor-specific Day 2 Operations that
require more coordination across system components, the usefulness of
traditional yaml-based tools starts to degrade quickly, since some imperative
programming logic is required.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="provisioners"></a>Provisioners<a href="#provisioners" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>One pattern that you can use to automate database management is a provisioner
process. We&#39;ve even used this approach to build v1 of our managed cloud
solution. When a user wants to make a change to an existing database&#39;s state,
our backend sends a message to a queue that is eventually picked up by a
provisioner. The provisioner reads the message, uses its contents to determine
which actions to perform on the cluster, and performs them sequentially. Where
appropriate, each action contains a rollback step in case of a <code>kubectl apply</code> error to
leave the infrastructure in a predictable state. Progress is reported back to
the application on a separate gossip queue, providing almost-immediate feedback
to the user on the progress of each state change.</p><p>While this has grown to be a powerful tool for us, there is another way to
interact with the k8s API that we are now starting to leverage...</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="operators"></a>Operators<a href="#operators" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>K8s has an extensible
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operator pattern</a>
that you can use to manage your own
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Resources</a>
(CRs) by writing and deploying a controller that reconciles your current cluster
state into its desired state, as specified by CR yaml spec files that are
applied to the cluster. This is also how the functionality of the basic k8s
building blocks are implemented, which just further emphasizes how powerful this
model can be.</p><p>Operators have the ability to hook into the k8s API server and listen for
changes to resources inside a cluster. These changes get processed by a
controller, which then kicks off a reconciliation loop where you can add your
custom logic to perform any number of actions, ranging from simple resource
existence to complex Day 2 Operations. This is an ideal solution to our
management problem; we can offload much of our imperative code into a native k8s
object, and database-specific operations appear to be as seamless as the
standard set of k8s building blocks. Many existing database products use
operators to accomplish this, and more are currently in development (see the
<a href="https://dok.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data on Kubernetes community</a> for more information on
these efforts).</p><p>As you can imagine, coordinating activities like backups, restores, and
clustering inside a mostly stateless and idempotent reconciliation loop isn&#39;t
the easiest. Even if you follow best practices by writing a variety of simple
controllers, with each managing its own clearly-defined CR, the reconciliation
logic can still be very error-prone and time-consuming to write. While
frameworks like <a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operator SDK</a> exist to help
you with scaffolding your operator, and libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubebuilder</a> provide a set of
incredibly useful controller libraries, it&#39;s still a lot of work to undertake.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="k8s-is-just-a-tool"></a>K8s is just a tool<a href="#k8s-is-just-a-tool" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>At the end of the day, k8s is a single tool in the DevOps engineer&#39;s toolkit.
These days, it&#39;s possible to host workloads in a variety of ways; using managed
services (PaaS), k8s, VMs, or even running on a bare metal server. The tool that
you choose depends on a variety of factors including time, experience,
performance requirements, ease of use, and cost.</p><p>While hosting a database on k8s might be a fit for your organization, it just as
easily could create even more overhead and instability if not done carefully.
Implementing the Day 2 features that I described above is time-consuming and
costly to get right. Testing is incredibly important, since you want to be
absolutely sure that your (and your customers&#39;) precious data is kept safe and
accessible when it&#39;s needed.</p><p>If you just need a reliable database to run your application on top of, then
maybe all of the work required to run a database on k8s might be too much for
you to undertake. But if your database has strong k8s support (most likely via
an operator), or you are doing something unique (and at-scale) with your storage
layer, it might be worth it to look more into managing your stateful databases
on k8s. Just be prepared for a large time investment and ensure that you have
the requisite in-house knowledge (or support) so that you can be confident that
you&#39;re performing your database automation activities correctly and safely.</p><p>We&#39;ve spent the past year building our own managed database service on top of
k8s. If you want to check out what we&#39;ve built, you can visit
