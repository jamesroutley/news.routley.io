    <h1>Ask HN: How to move from dev role to management/team lead role?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I feel like I achieved almost everything I wanted as a frontend developer (even moved from just working with UI/react/etc to pure R&amp;D, researching and working with browser api for innovarive/obscure tasks) and while backend looks  interesting for me, I know that I will have to take a paycut if I would move there.
Becoming a team leader or moving to other management position looks more promising from salary and work enjoyment (for me) purposes, so what are my next steps are?</p><p>Is there any good reads, courses, videos, lectures etc I should know of? I work in small startup for the past year so I don&#39;t have anything to take example of nor I have any opportunity to lead a team (except one guy I&#39;m mentoring)</p></div></div></div>
