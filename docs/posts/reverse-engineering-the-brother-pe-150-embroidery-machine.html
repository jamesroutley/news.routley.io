<p>The Brother PE-150 is an old and affordable computerized embroidery machine.
This kind of embroidery machine is pretty much just a sewing machine that can
move the fabric around precisely according to instructions in a computer so the
stitches it makes form predetermined patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/embroidered-smiling-sun.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>It has a satisfying amber LCD screen with a touch interface. There are many
different patterns that are baked into it, like the smiling sun above.</p>

<p>I want to make designs on my computer using software like
<a href="https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider">PEmbroider</a> and then send them
to the PE-150. But out of the box the only way to do that is with CompactFlash
(CF) cards and proprietary software that is more expensive than the machine
itself. So instead I’m going to take the machine apart and figure out how it
works, and then design a new controller which runs my own software that can read
instructions in whatever formats I care to implement.</p>

<h2 id="taking-it-apart">Taking it Apart</h2>

<p>About a year ago during my first <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">RC</a> batch I took
the first steps by disassembling the machine and poking around to see what I
could figure out. There is quite a lot going on in there!</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/pe-150-guts-overall-notes.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a big heavy cast frame in there providing a rigid mounting point for
everything.</li>
  <li>A drive shaft runs through the whole top and comes out one end in a knob that
lets the user turn it by hand if needed. A belt connects it to a motor that can
rotate it in normal operation. Everything on top is driven off of this shaft.
It’s providing both energy and synchronization for the mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Various break-beam sensors and microswitches are used by the electronics to
understand the state of the machine. For example: to see if the thread is in
tension or not.</li>
  <li>The motion control happens with a simple XY gantry. Each axis has a stepper
motor and a belt drive. There are limit switches at the ends so the machine can
move them to a known position when it starts up (and then it just knows where
they are afterwards because they go where the machine tells them to).</li>
  <li>There are three optical wheels near the center of the shaft (not visible in
the photo) which are likely used together to determine the precise angular
position or speed and have absolute reference points for certain angles.
The machine at least needs to know when the needle is up and it is safe to move
the gantry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-controller">The Controller</h2>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/pe-150-pcb-notes.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The controller could be replaced just by understanding how the downstream parts
govern the behavior of the machine. But let’s see what we can understand about
it just for the sake of curiosity.</p>

<h3 id="connectors">Connectors</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of connectors at the edges, which are labeled on the silk
screen. Here’s what I think they do:</p>

<h3 id="chips">Chips</h3>

<p>Moving inwards, let’s take a tour of the chips. What should we expect to find?
There must be some kind of computer that is orchestrating the whole show. And
this is an old machine, so we might find that it is made up of multiple chips
that need to work together instead of an SoC with everything integrated. In
that case there would be an MCU, some RAM for keeping track of different
temporary results, some ROM to store the code and built-in stuff like LCD
graphics/fonts and designs. We also know there’s an LCD and a touch screen, so
there might be controller chips for those things. Ditto for the CF card
interface. And there will need to be motor drivers for the XY gantry. Some sort
of electronically controlled switch is needed to turn the big drive shaft motor
on and off. Finally, miscellaneous electronics will be needed for getting
whatever supply voltages are needed and conditioning various signals.</p>

<p>So what do we actually find? Some surprises! Here are the chips and my guesses
about their roles:</p>

    <tr>
      <td>K3N5C1X04D6012</td>
      <td>Mask ROM?</td>
      <td>No datasheet found using the number on the chip.  The identical unpopulated footprint below it is labeled as TC5316200CF, which is a 2Mx8 Mask ROM. And it looks like some of the traces extend to the CF card connector, which would make sense if this is a memory interface. So the guess is that there is an option to have two ROMs but only one is populated, and these might each be an addressable memory bank along with the CF card. So no extra controller for the CF card is needed (or found).</td>

<h2 id="the-screen">The Screen</h2>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-front.jpg" alt=""/>
<img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-back.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Everything except the screen is very simple - switches and motors (ignoring the
CF card interface since I’m not going to use that). The screen is a graphical
LCD with a resistive touch panel on top.</p>

<p>Getting the touch screen working shouldn’t be too bad so I am going to ignore it
until a later stage. Maybe I’ll describe the details in a future post after I’ve
dug into it. But I expect that it works something like keyboard matrices do.
It’s not like a touch screen on a modern smartphone where you can get the exact
position of multiple fingers, instead there is a discrete grid of touch
switches. The controller will just figure out which one of these switches you’ve
touched. In a keyboard this is usually done by having a grid of signals which
are connected at the crossing points when a key is pressed. The controller scans
through them by activating one row at a time and seeing which column input goes
high. Then it knows the key at that row and column is pressed. The 15 conductors
in the ribbon cable for this touch screen are probably used like that and I’ll
be able to map them out for use later.</p>

<p>Now onto the fun part, displaying graphics!</p>

<h3 id="displaying-graphics">Displaying Graphics</h3>

<p>The output side of the screen is a lot more complicated. On the back there are 4
big chips which we can assume run the show. The connector for that PCB has 10
conductors, so we can assume that the graphics that the controller wants to be
shown must somehow flow through those wires to these 4 big chips and then they
translate them into the actual drive signals for the LCD.</p>

<p>The LCD actually also works kind of like the touch screen in the sense that
there are rows and columns and you get something to happen at a particular spot
by doing something with the row and column that intersect at that spot.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-drive-traces.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Here I took the glass part off of the screen so we can see the traces that
connect to it underneath. You can see there are very many traces which all
terminate in a row of vertical copper lines at the bottom where they will be
connected up to the display glass via a squishy conductive bus (I guess this is
some kind of stack of independent columns made of carbon-impregnated rubber?).</p>

<p>Inside the glass there are also electrical traces which are made of a material
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide">Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)</a>,
which is transparent but also conductive. Those traces go to the actual pixel
cells which have liquid crystal squished in them. When a column and row are
driven an electric field is formed in that little space which causes the liquid
crystal molecules to rotate and change the polarization of light coming through.
If it’s rotated such that it gets filtered out in another part of the screen
then we see that pixel as black.</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-misaligned.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>When I took it all the way apart the first time I put it back together with the
rubber connector between the PCB and the glass part of the display shifted a
little bit. So some of the drive signals didn’t get there, and some of them
drove an extra row or column. Resulting in the dead or shifted lines / pixels
you see here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lcd-drivers">The LCD Drivers</h2>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-back.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>So how do the 10 signals coming in over that connector turn into the bazillion
signals going to the rows and columns of pixels in the glass part? To answer
that we need to figure out what those big chips are doing.</p>

<p>The three on the left are the same part, the LC7941ND dot-matrix LCD driver. The
last one on the right (closest to the connector) is an LC794<b>2</b>ND, which is
also a dot-matrix LCD driver. These are members of a little family of parts from
Sanyo which are intended to work together to drive a display like this. The
LC7980 that we saw on the controller PCB above is also a member of this family.</p>

<p>From reading the datasheet for these parts I know that each of them has 80
outputs which can go to an LC display. The application architecture diagram from
the LC7942ND datasheet gives a hint that that last part is meant to drive the
rows and the other three are meant to drive the columns. Just considering the
outputs of the column drivers, 80x3=240, so we probably have 240 columns, which
passes the gut check of just looking at the display aspect ratio (it’s not too
far off from being 3 times wider than it is tall). Maybe we have 80 rows then,
but also maybe less.</p>

<p>Another thing we know from the datasheets is that these chips have
shift-registers in them, which basically just means that they are connected in a
line and you just feed data into the first and it will get passed down the line
to the end. A common way to send the data is to have a data signal that can be
high/low (1/0) and a clock signal which tells the chip when to read the value on
the data signal. So the 10 pin connector should include at least these two
signals: data and a clock. We also know the rows and columns need to be treated
separately somehow, so maybe there will be a separate data and clock for each of
them. Additionally, in the LC7941ND datasheet I saw that there is a LOAD signal
which tells the chip to take the data that it has in its shift register and
actually put it out in the drive signals to the display. So we might expect a
LOAD for the column drivers and the row driver in the 10 pin connector. And
power must be coming through too which is another 2 pins at least. 3x2+2 = 8,
which is less than 10, so there are still some extra hypothetical pins. Let’s
gather more info.</p>

<p>With the machine plugged in and the screen displaying some graphics I probed
each of the 10 signals with an oscilloscope and found the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>0-5V digital signal that varies fast and kind of “randomly”, but with a clear
larger scale repeating pattern. This is probably a data signal.</li>
  <li>0-5V digital signal that pulses every 12.2ms for 6.4us. Maybe LOAD?</li>
  <li>Toggles every 12.2ms. I poked around with a multimeter and found that this
terminated in an unpopulated jumper and didn’t go anywhere else. So maybe
this was meant to be used for a feature in another version of the product? We
can safely ignore it.</li>
  <li>0-5V digital signal that pulses every 190.4us for 480ns. Another LOAD?</li>
  <li>0-5V digital signal 1.256 MHz clock.</li>
  <li>Constant 5V. Likely power.</li>
  <li>Ground.</li>
  <li>-7.6V. Maybe this is used for driving the LCD, because they usually need a
centered drive signal so components of the liquid crystal don’t migrate to
one side/electrode, which degrades them over time.</li>
  <li>9V. I see the trace goes to the LEDs, which means this is backlight power.</li>
  <li>Ground for the LEDs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Next I connected the digital signals to my Saleae logic analyzer and captured a
trace:</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-signal-trace-overview.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Mapping these 4 signals to the pins above (we skip #3 because it is not used):</p>
<ol>
  <li>#1 the likely data line</li>
  <li>#2 maybe LOAD?</li>
  <li>#4 another LOAD?</li>
  <li>#5 the likely data clock</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole image we see on the display must be carried by these 4 signals, which
is kind of intimidating. How do we find a picture in these wiggles? Let’s start
again with what we know.</p>

<p>The pixels are either black or “white” (amber/blank) so each one probably
corresponds to 1 bit in the data coming in. If I use my logic analyzer to count
the number of transitions in the likely-clock in between the fast pulses (the
third row in the logic analyzer trace) I see there are 240 transitions. Great!
That lines up with our 80x3=240 column count guess from earlier. So there is
probably 1 row of pixels in-between each of these fast pulses. And that also
implies that the fast pulse is probably our LOAD signal, because you would want
to LOAD after sending a complete row so it shows up on the screen.</p>

<p>But what about the row driver? It must have something to do with the remaining
signal - the second row in the trace. If I count the LOAD pulses that happen
between the pulses in the row 2 signal I see that there are 64 of them. Maybe
that means there are 64 rows? That matches up with the display aspect ratio
perfectly, if we say there are 240 columns. Also computers like the number 64.
So row 2 is probably the data line for the row driver. But something is weird.
Where is the clock for the row driver? We have used up all of our signals.</p>

<p>To figure this out I went back to the physical circuit board and buzzed out the
connections with a multimeter. For each of the 4 signals I put one probe on the
connector pin and then dragged the other probe along the pins on the chips until
I got a beep indicating a connection. By doing this I confirmed that pin 1 is
serial data in (SDI) on the driver chip furthest from the connector. Pin 2 is
the data input on the row driver (called DIO1 in the datasheet). Pin 5 is the
clock (CP) on all of the 3 column drivers.</p>

<p>Pin 4 had a surprise. It’s connected to LOAD on all of the column drivers like
we expected. But it’s also connected to the clock (CP) on the row driver. Now
everything makes sense! Here are the steps to update the display:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clock in the columns for a row of pixel data (240 bits). For these chips,
data is sampled when the clock transitions from high to low.</li>
  <li>If this is the first row, set the row driver’s data input (DIO1) to 1.
Otherwise set it to 0. Pulse pin 4 (LOAD &amp; row CP). This will shift in a new
active row at 0, or shift the active row down 1. It will also activate the
LOAD signal for the column drivers and cause the row of data that was
previously loaded to be shown on the screen.</li>
  <li>Loop for 64 rows. The active row will get shifted down each time (we are
clocking in 0 for the row data, so the 1 we sent at the start is just moving
on down the shift register).</li>
  <li>All the crystals in the pixels of our desired image have been wiggled! But uh
oh - they’re fading fast now. Better do it all again! Every 12.2ms forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>With our newfound understanding we have some new powers. First, we can take the
data about the signals the logic analyzer captured, dump it to a CSV, and then
use
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jmpinit/5fdc73f9f54c3155681a95afe67f29cd">a Python script</a>
to turn it into an image:</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-screen-dump.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Second, we can build our own driver electronics to put an image on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://owentrueblood.com/assets/brother-pe-150-lcd-smiley.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>In a future post I’ll get into implementing the driver for my control
electronics, but the current status is that I built a PoC using an Arduino Uno
to render the smiley doodle above. Then I used my
<a href="https://glasgow-embedded.org/">Glasgow Interface Explorer</a> to build a better
FPGA version which doesn’t flicker and has a nicer interface for the eventual
control MCU to use to display graphics.</p>
