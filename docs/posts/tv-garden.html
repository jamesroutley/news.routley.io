There&#39;s no cost or subscription—just click on a channel and start watching.</p><h3>What is IPTV?</h3><p>IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) means watching TV content over the internet instead of through cable or satellite. We aggregate free, publicly available IPTV streams, letting you explore local and international news, movies, live sports, and more, wherever you are.</p><h3>How do you select TV channels for tv.garden?</h3><p>Our channel listings come straight from the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPTV-org community on GitHub.</a> We don&#39;t add or maintain channels ourselves, but rely on their fantastic directory. If you&#39;d like to learn more or contribute, visit their GitHub repository.</p><h3>Can I suggest a TV channel to be added?</h3><p>Absolutely! While we don&#39;t manage the channel database ourselves, you can send channel suggestions to the <a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPTV-org team.</a> Your input helps to keep the lineup fresh and exciting.</p><h3>How often is the channel list updated?</h3><p>Thanks to the IPTV community&#39;s ongoing efforts, new channels are added regularly.

For more details, see our Legal Disclaimer in the “About” section.</p><h3>Why are some IPTV channels not available on tv.garden?</h3><p>We prioritize your safety and privacy. We only list channels that meet HTTPS requirements and permit external streaming as defined by their own settings (such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing rules). If a channel&#39;s configuration doesn&#39;t allow embedding or doesn&#39;t meet our security standards, we can&#39;t (and won&#39;t) list it.</p><h3>How can I report a problem with a channel or link?</h3><p>If a channel is temporarily down, check back later. If the issue persists, let the <a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPTV-org team on GitHub</a> know. They maintain the directory to keep streams running smoothly.</p><h3>Are there geographic restrictions on channels?</h3><p>Yes, some channels are licensed for specific regions and might show a globe lock icon to indicate limited access.</p><h3>How does tv.garden protect my privacy?</h3><p>Your privacy is our priority.
