<h2>Abstract</h2>
	Strawberry Pop Tarts may be a cheap and inexpensive source of
	incendiary devices.  Toasters which fail to eject Pop Tarts
	cause the Pop Tarts to emit flames 10-18 inches in height.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Last year, an article by well-known newspaper columnist
	<em>Dave Barry</em> noted that <em>Kellogg&#39;s Strawberry
	Pop Tarts</em> (SPTs) could be made to emit flames &#34;like a 
	blow torch&#34; if left in a toaster too long.  Given previous 
	work in the field of food-entertainment (see 
	<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/grape/">
	<em>Fun With Grapes - A Case Study</em></a>), it was obvious
	that this was a new frontier that requires further exploration.  
	The present work describes our independent verification and 
	experience with SPT-based combustion.

<h2>Materials Used</h2>
	Only two basic materials are needed to cause SPT-combustion:
	a (hopefully inexpensive) toaster and some Strawberry Pop Tarts
	(Figure 1).
	In this work, the authors used <em>Kellogg&#39;s Strawberry Pop Tarts
	with Real Smucker&#39;s Fruit</em>.  SPTs can be obtained either with
	or without frosting; the non-frosted variety were used for this
	experiment.

    </p><p>
	In addition to the basic materials, a number of safety-related
	items were needed to conduct this experiment.  First, a suitable
	location for the experiment was required, it being expected that
	the kitchen was not the appropriate place for blow-torching SPTs.
	The author&#39;s driveway was chosen as a suitable site.  Second,
	an appropriate means for extinguishing the SPTs would be needed;
	a research assistant brought along some baking soda for the
	purpose.

</p><h2>Experiment Preparation</h2>
	The toaster and SPT both had to be properly prepared for this
	experiment.  In order to guarantee that the SPT would receive
	sufficient heat to begin combustion, the toaster was set to
	its highest setting and the lever was jammed in the &#34;down&#34;
	position using adhesive cellophane.  A SPT was removed from
	the box and its protective packaging and carefully placed into
	the toaster slot (Figure 2).
    <p>

    </p><p>
	Next, the toaster and SPT were taken to the driveway, and an
	extension cord was arranged to provide power to the toaster.
	At this point, we were ready to begin the experiment.

</p><h2>The Experiment and Observations</h2>
	The toaster was plugged in.  First the toaster went through a
	normal &#34;toasting&#34; cycle (approximately 60 seconds), 
	which more than thoroughly cooked the SPT (since the toaster 
	was set to its darkest setting).  By this point we could
	definitely detect a burnt SPT aroma.
	The toaster then attempted to eject the SPT, but was prevented from
	doing so by the adhesive cellophane.  The toaster then began
	emitting loud rattling and buzzing noises due to its inability
	to eject the SPT.
    <p>
	(At this point the researchers became somewhat concerned that
	the noise from the toaster would wake the neighbors and
	attract undue attention.  However, we decided that we were
	already committed to the experiment and that the neighbors
	would be able to sacrifice some sleep in the name of science.)
    </p><p>
	Soon thereafter, large amounts of smoke began pouring out of
	the toaster.  The researchers noticed that some of the neighbors
	down the street were beginning to get a little curious, but
	the experiment proceeded nonetheless.  Approximately 40 seconds
	later, small flames began licking their way out of the toaster.
	The flames steadily grew larger and larger until reaching a
	maximum height of about 18 inches above the top of the toaster.
	Figure 4 presents a time-series collage of the flames emitted
	from the SPT.

    </p><p>
	As the flames were reaching their maximum height, the toaster
	abruptly stopped making buzzing noises.  We speculate that the
	flames had by this point shorted the electronics within the
	toaster.  The toaster was quickly disconnected from the primary
	electrical source to avoid any potential damage to the author&#39;s
	house.  At this point, the researchers also realized that the
	heat could inadvertently melt the adhesive cellophane and
	cause the flaming SPTs to suddenly eject from the toaster.
	Unfortunately, this did not occur.  The flames continued 
	for several minutes.
    </p><p>
	At this point there was some slight concern that the flames
	might take considerable time to diminish.  We then enlisted the
	help of a reluctant research assistant to sprinkle baking soda
	on the flames.  (The reluctance was understandable given the
	potential for premature SPT ejection described in the above
	paragraph.)  The baking soda quickly extinguished the flames
	and produced still further smoke (Figure 5a).

    </p><p>
	Once the flames were extinguished, the researchers noted an
	unanticipated problem: what to do with the (now defunct)
	toaster and the spent SPT.  It became obvious that the toaster
	could not be returned to the author&#39;s house due to both a 
	continued potential fire hazard and the smell of burnt
	strawberries.  In addition, it was noted that the toaster was
	still &#34;too hot to handle,&#34; necessitating the use of a nearby
	garden hose to cool the toaster off.  This is illustrated
	in Figure 5b.  Finally it was decided to just leave the toaster
	by the curb for the sanitation experts to pick up the next
	morning (Figure 6.)

    </p><h2>Summary and Recommendations</h2>
	In summary, overcooking the SPT did produce a good size flame.
	The effect was not as pronounced as the researchers had hoped, but
	was satisfying nonetheless.  The research assistant noted that
	the flames produced did appear to have some color variation.
	We believe that frosted SPTs may successfully produce even
	larger torches.  Further research in this area is warranted.
    <p>
	We did desire to repeat the experiment with the remaining five
	SPTs, but we could not do so because there were no more suitable
	toasters available for further experiments.  In the future, we recommend
	that toasters be sold in six-packs to accomodate important
	SPT research.  Instead, the remaining SPTs were sacrified over
	the course of the next several days in private, undocumented
	consumption experiments.
