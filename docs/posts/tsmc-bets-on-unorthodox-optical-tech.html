    <h1>TSMC bets on unorthodox optical tech</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="TSMC Bets On Unorthodox Optical Tech"><div><p>In the race to an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/optics-gpu" target="_self"><span>all-optical</span></a> AI data center, a major player has now placed a bet on a different horse. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/semiconductor-manufacturing">Semiconductor manufacturing</a> giant <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250422988144/en/Avicena-Works-with-TSMC-to-Enable-PD-Arrays-for-LightBundle-MicroLED-Based-Interconnects" target="_blank"><span>TSMC announced</span></a> that it will work with Sunnyvale startup <a href="https://avicena.tech/" target="_blank"><span>Avicena</span></a> to produce microLED-based <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/interconnects">interconnects</a>. The technology is a pragmatic twist on replacing electrical connections with optical ones to meet the high needs of communication among an increasing number of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpus">GPUs</a> in a low cost, energy efficient way. <strong></strong></p><p>Thanks to the computational demands of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models">large language models</a> and their cousins, AI clusters are facing unprecedented requirements regarding amounts of data, bandwidth, latency, and speed. Sooner or later, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/copper-wires">copper wires</a> that connect <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/processors">processors</a> and memory within a single AI data center rack will have to be <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-interconnects" target="_self"><span>replaced with optics</span></a>. “There’s a huge push to get optical connections as close to the board as possible,” says Lucas Tsai, a vice president at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/tsmc">TSMC</a>.</p><p>Avicena offers a unique approach, using hundreds of blue <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microleds">microLEDs</a> connected through imaging-type fibers to move data. The company’s modular <a href="https://avicena.tech/avicena-announces-modular-lightbundle-optical-interconnect-platform-with-1tbps-mm-i-o-density-and-1pj-bit/" target="_blank"><span>LightBundle platform</span></a> avoids problems with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lasers">lasers</a> and their associated complexity that threaten the reliability, cost, and power consumption of other optical <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chiplets">chiplets</a>. Tsai says “it’s very unorthodox!” But it is ideal for these short distance applications, and that’s precisely what makes it interesting.</p><h2>Laser-free</h2><p>Optical connections today carry vast amounts of data tens to hundreds of meters across <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers">data centers</a> at very high <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-rates">data rates</a>. Traditionally, a pluggable module connects the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/optical-fiber">optical fiber</a> to the rack, where it converts between electrical and optical signals. Companies are making strides toward getting rid of these energy inefficient pluggable <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transceivers">transceivers</a> using co-packaged <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/optics">optics</a> (CPO), which instead perform electrical-optical transformations adjacent to the silicon chip itself. Commercial versions exist for the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics" target="_self"><span>network switch</span></a>, and prototypes are making strides <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-interconnects" target="_self"><span>toward the GPU</span></a>. The most prominent optical chiplet designs encode electronic bits onto multiple wavelengths of light using lasers and modulators.</p><p>However, the main challenge for laser-based <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/optical-interconnects">optical interconnects</a> is the laser itself. The laser and fiber attachments have caused the biggest problems in terms of reliability, manufacturing, and cost. Moreover, a single optical fiber that hosts dozens of GPU-to-switch links in the form of multiple wavelengths suffers from computational overhead: it’s far simpler to pipe each data lane down a separate physical channel than to electronically parse one big channel later on. <strong></strong></p><p>That’s where <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/photonics-and-ai" target="_self"><span>Avicena comes in</span></a>. Instead of sending a multi-wavelength laser down an optical fiber and then parsing it into individual channels, the LightBundle interconnect links hundreds of blue microLEDs to a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/photodetector">photodetector</a> array via multi-core imaging fibers—one for each 10 GB/s data lane. The transmitter acts like a miniature display screen and the detector like a camera. “We’re doing optical interconnects without the complexity of lasers,” says Avicena CEO Bardia Pezeshki.</p><p>A simple optical link with just 300 pixels at 10Gb/s per lane can extend over a 10m distance, carrying a net total of 3 Tb/s. Since displays and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cameras">cameras</a> can scale to millions of pixels, the technology can scale to much higher data rates at much lower energy and much higher density than copper wiring. </p><h2>Mature industry</h2><p>One major advantage touted by Avicena is that their technology harnesses <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/leds">LEDs</a>, cameras, and displays: all mature industries. “We can scale our approach to the volumes and costs required much more rapidly than if we were developing new building blocks,” says Pezeshki. Even though <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-photonics">silicon photonics</a> has a thirty-year head start on optical interconnects, they have to develop new components like ring <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/resonators">resonators</a> and comb lasers. “It takes a lot of time for these things to mature,” he says. In contrast, the LightBundle interconnects design requires only minor modifications to existing camera and display technologies.</p><p>That’s one main reason that TSMC signed up to produce the photodetector arrays for Avicena’s optical chiplets. “LEDs is a mature industry already, there are a lot of consumer products,” Tsai says. LEDs are of course lower power than lasers—but for, say, 10-meter distances within and across a rack, that’s enough. “There’s a potential that it will be a lot cheaper, and by nature you have a lot of redundancy,” says Tsai.</p><p>Avicena’s results are already “blowing away” what silicon <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/photonics">photonics</a> can do, according to Pezeshki. The LightBundle prototype has already demonstrated sub-pJ/bit energy use for the whole link, where other optical approaches “are struggling to show” 5 pJ/bit energy consumption. <strong></strong></p><p>Pezeshki acknowledges that Avicena has a ways to go to build and scale the product. But “the combination of showing great results together with using mature building blocks is winning over converts,” he says.</p></div></div></div>
