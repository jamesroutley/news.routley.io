You can easily clean data, model data, and explore data using a Painting Tool, which turns the complex Exploratory Data Analysis process visual and simple.</p><p>Data painter is especially good at explaining complex visual patterns which can be difficult to describe by simple statistics indicators.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djqePNyhz7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites" title="Direct link to Prerequisites">​</a></h2><p>The following data visualization from the &#34;College&#34; dataset shows the relationship between <code>AverageFacultySalary</code> and <code>AverageCost</code>. We want to study why the data is not evenly distributed, but rather split into two parts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/edit-with-data-painter.png" alt="Edit with Data Painter"/></p><p>Click on the <strong>Data Painter</strong> button to explore this chart.</p><h2 id="explore-data">Explore data<a href="#explore-data" aria-label="Direct link to Explore data" title="Direct link to Explore data">​</a></h2><h3 id="case-1">Case 1.<a href="#case-1" aria-label="Direct link to Case 1." title="Direct link to Case 1.">​</a></h3><p>On the Data Painter tab, we can paint the dots which represent the data we want to explore with your mouse cursor.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Search</strong> button to automatically analyze your data painting. RATH can automatically detect your intent and recommends a data visualization for a possible explanation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/explore-data-with-data-painter.gif" alt="Explore data with Data Painter"/></p><p>The auto-generated result explains why the data is distributed unevenly: it was caused by the <code>FundingModel</code> variable. The blue dots on top of the chart are private schools, while the red dots on the lower side of the chart are public schools.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/data-exploration-result-with-data-painter.png" alt="Data Exploration Result with Data Painter"/></p><div><p><span><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</p><p>For more suggested results, you can click on the &#34;Next&#34; and &#34;Last&#34; buttons to navigate through all the generated results.</p></div><h3 id="case-2">Case 2.<a href="#case-2" aria-label="Direct link to Case 2." title="Direct link to Case 2.">​</a></h3><p>In the following case, we are about to explore an interesting pattern that is more complex.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. We are about to analyze a chart with a complicated pattern. The chart demonstrates the relationship between <code>SOC</code> and the <code>Maximum battery voltage</code>.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/data-exploration-pattern-soc.png" alt="Data Exploration - patterns about battery SOC"/></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> We can use the Data Painter to study the unusual pattern in the chart. Click on the Data Painter button under the chart, and color the pattern by dragging your mouse cursor. </p><p>Click on the <strong>Search</strong> button. RATH can automatically detect your intention. Here, RATH suggests the deciding factor is the Vehicle Condition. The pattern represents the vehicle engine is in a flameout condition.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/data-painter-pattern-soc.gif" alt="Explore SOC patterns with Data Painter"/></p><h2 id="erase-unwanted-data">Erase unwanted data<a href="#erase-unwanted-data" aria-label="Direct link to Erase unwanted data" title="Direct link to Erase unwanted data">​</a></h2><p>You can use Data Painter to remove unwanted parts of data, or remove anomalies.</p><p>To erase data in Data Painter, click on the <strong>Erase</strong> button, and wipe out the unwanted data.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/data-painter-remove-unwanted-data-1.gif" alt="Erase data with Data Painter"/></p><p>After removing the unwanted parts of the data, you can focus on the data that you want to anslysis.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/data-painter-remove-unwanted-data-2.gif" alt="Erase data with Data Painter"/></p><h2 id="explore-patterns-in-data">Explore patterns in data<a href="#explore-patterns-in-data" aria-label="Direct link to Explore patterns in data" title="Direct link to Explore patterns in data">​</a></h2><p>You might spot some patterns in the data. However, there are no available variables or features that could accurately describe the patterns in the original data.</p><p>In this case, you can create new variables and features with Data Painter, by painting the data in different colors. Each color represents a different subset or group.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/explore-patterns-in-data.gif" alt="Explore patterns in data"/></p><p>You can also visualize the patterns in your data by building customized charts. Click on the <strong>Explore</strong> button and use a Tableau-like User Interface to build customized charts by dragging and dropping.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/img/data-painter/customized-charts-with-data-painter.gif" alt="Build customized charts in Data Painter"/></p></div></div>
