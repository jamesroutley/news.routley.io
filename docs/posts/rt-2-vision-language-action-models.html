                    Abstract
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robotic trajectory data and Internet-scale vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering. In contrast to other approaches, we propose a simple, general recipe to achieve this goal: in order to fit both natural language responses and robotic actions into the same format, we express the actions as text tokens and incorporate them directly into the training set of the model in the same way as natural language tokens. We refer to such category of models as vision-language-action models (VLA) and instantiate an example of such a model, which we call RT-2. Our extensive evaluation (6k evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables RT-2 to obtain a range of emergent capabilities from Internet-scale training. This includes significantly improved generalization to novel objects, the ability to interpret commands not present in the robot training data (such as placing an object onto a particular number or icon), and the ability to perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user commands (such as picking up the smallest or largest object, or the one closest to another object). We further show that incorporating chain of thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, for example figuring out which object to pick up for use as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best suited for someone who is too sleepy (an energy drink).

            <h3>
                Approach Overview
            </h3>
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/fig1.png"/>
            </p>

            <p>
               To make RT-2 easily compatible with large, pre-trained vision-language models, our recipe is simple: we represent robot actions as another language, which can be cast into text tokens and trained together with Internet-scale vision-language datasets. In particular, we co-fine-tune (a combination of fine-tuning and co-training where we keep some of the old vision &amp; text data around) an existing vision-language model with robot data. The robot data includes the current image, language command and the robot action at the particular time step. We represent the robot actions as text strings as shown below. An example of such a string could be a sequence of robot action token numbers: “1 128 91 241 5 101 127 217”.
  

            </p>    
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/fig3.png"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Since actions are represented as text strings, one can think of them as another language that allows us to operate the robot. This simple representation makes it straightforward to fine-tune any existing vision-language model and turn it into a vision-language-action model </p>

            <h3>
                Results
            </h3>
            
            <p>
               We start the evaluation of RT-2 with testing the emergent properties of the model. Since we can&#39;t fully anticipate the extend of RT-2&#39;s generalization, we present a number of previously unseen objects to the robot and evaluate its performance on tasks that require semantic understanding that goes far beyond the robot data that the model was fine-tuned on. You can see qualitative examples of successful tasks that we found surprising below: 
            </p> 
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/mosaic.png"/>
            </p>

            <p>
               To quantify the emergent properties of RT-2, we categorize them into: symbol understanding, reasoning and human recognition and evaluate two variants of RT-2:
               </p><ul>
                <li> RT-2 trained on top of <a href="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/palm-e.github.io">PaLM-E</a> (12B parameters),</li>
                <li> RT-2 trained on top of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18565">PaLI-X</a> (55B parameters) </li>
               </ul><p>
             against its predecessor - <a href="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/robotics-transformer1.github.io%22">RT-1</a> and another visual pre-training method - <a href="https://eai-vc.github.io/">VC-1</a>. The results below demonstrate a significant improvement of RT-2 compared to the baselines (3x).
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/rt2_emergent.png" width="400"/>
            </p>
            
            <!--<p class="text-justify">
               To further test the generalization capabilities of RT-2, we evaluate it across similar generalization axes as done in <a href=robotics-transformer1.github.io">previous</a> <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03659">studies</a>: 
            </p>   
            
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="img/generalization_eval.png" class="img-responsive">
            </p>-->
            
             <p>
               We evaluate the two variants of RT-2, together with more baselines in a blind A/B study and present the results across multiple generalization axes below. The resulting generalization improvement of RT-2 is approximately 2x.
            </p>   
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/main.png"/>
            </p>
            
             <p>
               To better understand how different design choices of RT-2 impact the generalization results we ablate the two most significant design decisions: 
               </p><ul>
                <li>the model size: 5B vs 55B for the RT-2 PaLI-X variant,</li>
                <li> training recipe: training the model from scratch vs fine-tuning vs co-fine-tuning. </li>
                </ul><p>
                The results below indicate the importance of the pre-trained weights of the vision-langauge model as well as the trend of the model generalization improving with the model size.
            </p>   
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/ablations.png" width="400"/>
            </p>
            
           <p>
               We also evaluate RT-2 on an open-source <a href="https://github.com/google-research/language-table">language-table benchmark</a> where we train RT-2 on simulation and real language-table data. In addition to achieving the state-of-the-art result on the simulation benchmark (90% vs 77% of the previous SoTA), we evaluate the resulting model in the real world. We demonstrate RT-2&#39;s generalization capabilities with the objects never seen in language table datasets before such as ketchup bottle, banana and others:
            </p>   
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/langtable.png"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Lastly, since the resulting RT-2 PaLM-E version of the model is a vision-language-action model that can act as an LLM, VLM and a robotic controller all in a single neural network, we demonstrate that RT-2 can perform chain-of-thought reasoning for control. In the examples below RT-2 first outputs a few reasoning steps in natural language which are then followed by the string: `Action:` and the resulting action tokens. 
            </p>   
            
            <p>
                <img src="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/img/CoT5.png"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
               This shows the promise of fully integrated VLA models that can transfer not only some of the semantic concepts across different modalities (e.g. generalize robot actions to new semantic categories) but also some of the properties of the underlying models (e.g. chain-of-thought reasoning).
