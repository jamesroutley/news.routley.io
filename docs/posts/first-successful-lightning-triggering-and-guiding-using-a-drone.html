<p><span>TOKYO - April 18, 2025 - </span>NTT Corporation (Headquarters: Chiyoda, Tokyo; President and CEO: Akira Shimada; hereinafter &#34;NTT&#34;) has become the first in the world to successfully trigger and guide lightning using a drone. This experiment also demonstrated, under natural lightning conditions, the effectiveness of both the drone&#39;s lightning protection technology and the electric field-based lightning triggering method. These results are expected to contribute to further research on the still-mysterious mechanisms of lightning and to help reduce lightning-related damage to cities and people.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>Lightning strikes are one of the most destructive natural phenomena affecting human society. While the NTT Group has implemented various lightning protection measures for critical infrastructure—including telecommunications facilities—lightning-related damage remains a persistent issue. In Japan alone, the estimated annual cost of lightning damage ranges from 100 to 200 billion yen<sup>1</sup>. Building on its long-standing expertise in protecting communications equipment from lightning, NTT is now working to advance this technology further, with the aim of eliminating lightning strikes on infrastructure and urban areas altogether.</p>

<h3>Overview and Key Findings of the Experiment</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>From December 2024 to January 2025, a lightning-triggering experiment using drones was conducted at an elevation of 900 meters in a mountainous area of Hamada City, Shimane Prefecture. In this experiment, a device called a field mill<sup>3</sup> was used to monitor the electric field at ground level. When the electric field strength increased due to the approach of a thundercloud, a drone equipped with a custom-designed lightning protection cage was launched to attempt lightning triggering (Figure 1).</p>

</p>
<!-- [/c-img-4] -->

<p>On December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).</p>

<h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>To successfully trigger lightning using a drone, the drone must remain operational even after being struck. Moreover, simply flying a drone under a thundercloud is not sufficient to attract lightning; an active triggering method is required. To address these challenges, we proposed and demonstrated the following two key technologies:</p>
<!-- [/c-txt-1] -->

<h4>(1) Lightning Protection Technology for Drones</h4>
<!-- [/c-ttl-3] -->

<p>We developed a lightning protection cage design that prevents malfunction or damage even if the drone is directly struck by lightning. This cage, which can be mounted on commercially available drones, is made of conductive metal and functions as a shield. It redirects the high current from the lightning strike away from the drone&#39;s internal components, preventing it from flowing through the drone itself. Additionally, the cage is designed to distribute the lightning current radially, which cancels out the strong magnetic fields generated by the current and minimizes electromagnetic interference with the drone (Figure 5).</p>

</p>

<h4>(2) Electric Field–Based Lightning Triggering Technology</h4>
<!-- [/c-ttl-3] -->

<p>To actively trigger lightning, we devised a method in which a conductive wire connects the drone to the ground, with a high-voltage switch installed on the ground side. By operating this switch at the optimal moment, we can rapidly change the electric field around the drone. This sharp increase in local electric field strength encourages a lightning discharge to occur toward the drone (Figure 6).</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>
<!-- [/c-ttl-2] -->

<p>NTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones—designed to withstand direct lightning strikes—to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away. To improve the success rate of drone-based lightning triggering, we will continue to advance research and development in two key areas: high-precision lightning location prediction and a deeper understanding of lightning mechanisms. In addition, we aim to not only trigger and control lightning, but also to harness its energy. Future efforts will focus on developing technologies for capturing and storing lightning energy for potential use (Figure 7).</p>
