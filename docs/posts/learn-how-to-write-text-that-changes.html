    <p>Happy 2022, friends!</p>

<p>Over the past couple months I’ve been hard at work on the chance text programming language behind my recent <a href="https://weareinvitedtoclimb.org/">book</a> and projects, <strong>BML</strong>, and today I’m thrilled to announce it’s ready for others to start using. Some of the highlights of recent work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bml-lang.org">bml-lang.org</a> now contains extensive and approachable documentation for the language, with an eye toward accessibility to non-programmers.</li>
  <li>You can now easily play around with BML online at <a href="https://bml-lang.org/sandbox/">bml-lang.org/sandbox</a>, complete with syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>I’ve also released a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bml-lang.bml-vscode">VS Code extension</a> for the language which lets you easily edit BML documents offline with full syntax highlighting and a built-in runner.</li>
  <li>Many parts of the language have been overhauled to make it more intuitive and powerful, including a system for context-aware choice references. I’m fairly confident I’ve now worked out all the major breaking changes needed in the foreseeable future.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in dipping your toes into the great fun of writing words that change, please let me know! I’m looking for a few people—programmers and non-programmers alike—who are interested in going through the website and trying to learn the language. I would love to hear your feedback on the language and ways I can make it easier to learn, and I would <em>love</em> to see what you write with it!</p>

<p>Until next time, stay warm out there! &lt;3</p>
