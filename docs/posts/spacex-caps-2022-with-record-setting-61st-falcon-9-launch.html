<p>Closing out a record-setting year, SpaceX launched a $186 million Israeli Earth-imaging satellite early Friday, the California rocket builder&#39;s 61st and final Falcon 9 launch of 2022 and its seventh this month, both modern-day records.</p><p>Since the rocket&#39;s debut in 2010, SpaceX has chalked up 194 Falcon 9 launches overall â€” 198 including four triple-core Falcon Heavies â€” putting together a string of 179 straight successful flights since the company&#39;s only in-flight failure in 2015.</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/30/175803e8-54ee-4815-a534-e08b9ccfd969/thumbnail/620x362/f977884ea8f2b9ef84430db2d99096df/123022-launch.jpg#" alt="123022-launch.jpg " height="362" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/30/175803e8-54ee-4815-a534-e08b9ccfd969/thumbnail/620x362/f977884ea8f2b9ef84430db2d99096df/123022-launch.jpg 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/12/30/175803e8-54ee-4815-a534-e08b9ccfd969/thumbnail/1240x724/7dd8b9f32aa1203add7379efbd4be9a1/123022-launch.jpg 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D&#39;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg&#39;%20viewBox%3D&#39;0%200%20620%20362&#39;%2F%3E"/></span>

</figure><p>The year&#39;s final mission got underway at 2:38 a.m. EST when the Falcon 9&#39;s first stage engines roared to life, smoothly pushing the 229-foot-tall rocket away from launch pad 4-East at Vandenberg Space Force Base northwest of Los Angeles.</p>

    

<p>The first stage, making its 11th flight, propelled the rocket out of the lower atmosphere before falling away and flying itself back to a successful touchdown near the launch pad. It was SpaceX&#39;s eighth California landing and its 160th successful recovery overall.</p><p>The single engine powering the second stage, meanwhile, fired for seven minutes and 15 seconds, releasing the EROS C-3 satellite into its planned orbit about 15 minutes after liftoff.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s official! We&#39;re pleased to announce that #EROSC3 was successfully launched into orbit by @SpaceX!&#34; tweeted satellite operator ImageSat International.</p><figure data-require="third-party/twitter-widgets"><div>

</figure><p>The Earth Resources Observation Satellite â€” EROS â€”Â was built by Israel Aircraft Industries and is owned by ImageSat International. EROS C-3 s equipped with redundant camera systems capable of resolving surface features less than one foot across.</p>

    
    

<p>The new satellite joins two others already in orbit that are believed to be &#34;commercialized&#34; Israeli spy satellites. Additional satellites, including radar imaging spacecraft, are planned as part of a next-generation constellation.</p><p>&#34;In today&#39;s military reality, intelligence gathering is based on speed, accuracy and quality,&#34; ImageSat says on its website. &#34;Meet EROS C, the next generation of remote sensing technology and the core of the EROS NG constellation, one of the world&#39;s most powerful intelligence collection assets.</p><p>&#34;Through ISI&#39;s advanced ground control segment, it enables defense and intelligence organizations to conduct operations under complete confidentiality and data protection, as well as independent mission execution.&#34;</p><p>Company documents valued the EROS C-3 satellite at $186 million, according to Spaceflight Now.</p>
