It supplies pre-departure and arrival tests for travellers, with walk-in centres at sites including Gatwick and Heathrow.</p><p>The company’s “research programme information sheet” reveals it keeps hold of data including “biological samples… and the DNA obtained from such samples”.</p><p>It adds that it may share DNA samples and other personal information with “collaborators” – including universities and private companies – and that it “may receive compensation” in return.</p><h2><strong>‘Full compliance’</strong></h2><p>ICO deputy commissioner Steve Wood said the watchdog would look “carefully” at the firm.</p><p>“There is no personal data more sensitive than our DNA. People should be told about what’s happening to it in a clear, open and honest way so they can make informed decisions about whether they want to give it up,” he said.</p><p>A Cignpost spokesperson said it was in “full compliance” with data privacy laws, adding: “We have invested significantly in robust systems and processes to ensure we protect our customers.</p><p>“Because we are testing our customers for a potentially serious condition, protecting that data is paramount.”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/business-economics/shareholder-win-covid-contracts-drive-serco-to-bumper-profits-and-revenues-301226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shareholder win!
