The fastest human spaceflight remains 39,937.7 kilometers per hour (24,816.1 miles per hour), and at those speeds, it would take 3,730 hours to travel just 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance between the Earth and the Sun. </p><p>At around 155 days, that&#39;s an unacceptable travel time to (for example) slam into the Sun. And while it takes you 155 days to get wherever it is you went, light and communications from Earth would reach you in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds, really rubbing it in how great it is to be massless. </p><p>But we will get a real reminder of the vast distance and incredible speed of light in late 2026, when Voyager 1 becomes the first human-made object to reach one light-day away from Earth. </p><p><span contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pGqwfl_KBgE?&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></iframe> </span></p><p>This spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has been traveling ever since. At the time of writing, it is around <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/where-are-voyager-1-and-voyager-2-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">169.5 AU</a> from the Earth, having become the first spacecraft to go beyond the heliosphere, <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/nasas-voyager-spacecraft-found-a-30000-50000-kelvin-wall-at-the-edge-of-our-solar-system-79454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross the heliopause</a>, and enter interstellar space. At its current position, it takes 23 hours, 29 minutes, and 27 seconds for signals from Earth to reach the spacecraft. At its current speed of about 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 miles per hour), it will still take over a year to widen that light-distance to a full 24 hours.</p><p>When it does reach 25.9 billion kilometers (<a href="https://scaleofuniverse.com/en/universe/light-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted">16 billion miles</a>) from Earth, a journey that took nearly 50 years, it will finally be the distance that light can travel in a day. </p><p>According to calculations from IFLScience&#39;s resident astronomer, <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/dr-alfredo-carpineti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Alfredo Carpineti</a>, using data from <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/sc_voyager_1/distance?time=2027-01-28T23:18:05.504+00:00&amp;rate=0&amp;to=sun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA&#39;s Eyes on the Solar System</a>, this will occur on November 13, 2026. After this date, the probe will not fall within 24 light-hours from Earth again, despite the Earth-to-Voyager distance changing as we orbit the Sun.</p><p>After that, it will continue on its course, guided by NASA until it runs out of power, likely in the early 2030s. But its journey will be far from over. First, it will leave the Solar System, passing through the Oort cloud, before having at least one close encounter with another star, Gliese 445, in the foreseeable future.</p><p>&#34;The distant Oort cloud marks the gravitational edge of the Solar System, in a vast region of undiscovered objects,&#34; <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/690/solar-system-tour/Oort.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA explains</a> of the Oort cloud, first hypothesized by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. &#34;Short-period comets may originate in the scattered disk, inner, part of the Oort cloud, while long-period comets likely come from the spherical, outer portion of the Oort cloud. These comets only pass the Sun on rare occasions, possibly when disturbed by distant passing stars or galactic tides. There is speculation of other large planets in this region that may disturb comets in their vicinity, but none have yet been discovered.&#34;</p><p>At the lower range of estimates, the Oort cloud could begin around 1,000 AU from the Sun. If the Oort cloud does begin here, Voyager could reach it in just a few centuries. However, given the sheer scale of the cloud, it will be there for tens of thousands of years.</p><p>&#34;Much of interstellar space is actually inside our Solar System,&#34; <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA explains</a>. &#34;It will take about 300 years for Voyager 1 to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000 years to fly beyond it.&#34;</p><p><span contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/btDHVnEmKqU??t=8&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></iframe></span></p><p>Assuming that the Voyager probes make it through the cloud undamaged (a likely outcome, given that space is not the asteroid-dodging exercise sci-fi would have us believe), they could go on relatively unscathed for many, many years beyond that. </p><p>For a long time, Voyager will not be near any astronomical objects, drifting on its own through the cosmos, far from sources of heat and light. But in 40,000 years, it will get a brief close encounter with another star, coming closer to it than home.</p><p>&#34;It took 35 years to reach interstellar space, but it will take 40,000 years for Voyager 1 to be closer to the star AC +79 3888 than our sun,&#34; NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/reaching-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>. &#34;Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our own right now, but because stars are moving, Voyager 1 will actually get within 1.7 light years of AC +79 3888 (aka Gliese 445) in 40,000 years.&#34;</p><p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> examining the future stellar flybys of probes on an escape velocity from the Solar System puts the figure at more like 44,000 years. Gliese 445 is an M-type main-sequence star with around a third of the mass of our Sun. At the moment, it is around 17,000 light-years from Earth, but by the time the encounter with Voyager happens, it will be around <a href="https://www.astronomyhouston.org/newsletters/guidestar/shallow-sky-object-month-gliese-445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.5 light-years</a> away from us. It will not be the spacecraft&#39;s final encounter with another star.</p><p id="isPasted">&#34;Statistically, a spacecraft will encounter stars within a given distance at approximately the same rate as the Sun does, which Bailer-Jones et al. [...] inferred to be one star within 1 pc every 50 kyr,&#34; the study explains, adding that more-distant encounters are difficult to predict due to uncertainty in the data. &#34;This rate scales quadratically with encounter distance (i.e. one star within 0.1 pc every 5 Myr [million years]). As the spacecraft are not leaving the Galaxy, it is inevitable that the spacecraft will pass much closer to some stars on longer timescales.&#34;</p><p>Nevertheless, the team was able to predict the closest approach that Voyager will have in the not-too-distant future, astronomically speaking. They found that the spacecraft will encounter TYC 3135-52-1, a main-sequence star, in around 303,000 years. At this point, it will be around 0.965 light-years from the star, so still quite wide of it. Looking at the data, it is unlikely Voyager 1 will be captured by a star any time soon, and will continue to drift through the cosmos with only the <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-is-what-youd-hear-if-you-listened-to-voyagers-golden-record-nasa-sent-to-interstellar-space-79799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted">Golden Records</a> for company.</p><p id="isPasted">&#34;The timescale for the collision of a spacecraft with a star is of order 10<sup>20</sup> years,&#34; the team concludes, &#34;so the spacecraft have a long future ahead of them.&#34;</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article was published in </em><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/in-november-2026-a-human-made-object-will-reach-a-light-day-from-earth-for-first-time-in-history-79691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>June 2025</em></a><em>.  </em></p></span></p></div></article><div><hr/><div><p><img alt="clock-icon" width="16" height="16" src="https://assets.iflscience.com/svg/Clock_grey.svg"/></p><p><span>ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED</span><span>November 4, 2025</span></p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.iflscience.com"><img src="https://assets.iflscience.com/badges/google_preferred_source_badge.png" alt="Google prefered source badge" width="150" height="50" loading="lazy"/></a></p></div></div></div>
