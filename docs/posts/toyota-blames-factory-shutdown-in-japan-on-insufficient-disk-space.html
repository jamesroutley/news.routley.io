    <h1>Toyota blames factory shutdown in Japan on ‘insufficient disk space’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/toyota" data-link-name="in body link">Toyota</a> has blamed a recent shutdown of all of its factories in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan" data-link-name="in body link">Japan</a> on a system malfunction caused by “insufficient disk space”.</p><p>The Japanese carmaker said the stoppage on 29 August at all 14 of its domestic plants occurred after servers that process orders for vehicle parts broke down following a maintenance procedure carried out the previous day.</p><p>During this operation, “data that had accumulated in the database was deleted and organised, and an error occurred due to insufficient disk space, causing the system to stop”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/toyota" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Toyota</a> said on Wednesday.</p><p>The world’s top-selling automaker reiterated that the incident had not been caused by a cyber-attack. “We would like to apologise once again to our customers, suppliers, and related parties for any inconvenience caused by the suspension of our domestic plants,” it said.</p><p>Toyota said the system had been restored after the data was transferred to a server with a bigger capacity, enabling it to restart production at the plants – which together account for about a third of the automaker’s global production – the following day.</p><p>“We will review our maintenance procedures and strengthen our efforts to prevent a recurrence, so that we can deliver as many vehicles to our customers as soon as possible,” it added.</p><p>Toyota is known for its “just-in-time” production system of providing only small deliveries of necessary parts and other items at various stages of the assembly process.</p><p>This minimises costs and improves efficiency, and is studied by other manufacturers and at business schools around the world. However, as last month’s technical glitch proves, it comes with risks.</p><p>Toyota had to shut down the same 14 factories for a day in February last year when one of its suppliers said one of its file servers had been infected with a virus, raising questions about the cybersecurity of Japan’s supply chains.</p></div></div></div>
