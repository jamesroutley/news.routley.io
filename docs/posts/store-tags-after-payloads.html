    <h1>Store tags after payloads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>The short version of this shower thought: storing the tags for sum types after the payload rather than before can save a surprising amount of space.</p>
<p>The long version needs some context.</p>
<p>A pointer has alignment <code>A</code> if <code>ptr % A == 0</code>. Eg a pointer to address 564 has alignment 4, because <code>564 % 4 == 0</code>. But it does not have alignment 8 because <code>564 % 8 == 4</code>.</p>
<p>This matters because load/store instructions on cpus usually have alignment requirements. Loading a 4 byte value requires a pointer with alignment 4, and loading an 8 byte value requires a pointer with alignment 8. The penalty for using a pointer that does not satisfy the alignment requirements ranges from worse performance (on x86) to crashing the program (on most arm).</p>
<p>When you allocate a value on the heap or stack, the allocator has to make sure that any pointers to that value will have the correct alignment. Eg if you allocate a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) then it must be allocated at an address with alignment 4, so that any loads/stores of that value are correctly aligned.</p>
<p>This is more complicated when the value you are allocating is a struct:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Foo </span><span>{
</span><span>    a</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
</span><span>    b</span><span>: </span><span>u64</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>How much space should we allocate for this struct, and what alignment does it require? That depends on how the compiler choose to layout the struct.</p>
<p>A common choice is to loop through the fields in order. For each field, we roundup the offset to the required alignment and then add the size of the field. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with offset 0.</li>
<li><code>a</code> needs alignment 1, so it can go at offset 0, and the next available offset is 1.</li>
<li><code>b</code> needs alignment 8, so we round up the offset from 1 to 8, and the next available offset is 16.</li>
<li>That&#39;s all the fields, so the total size of the struct is 16 bytes.</li>
<li>The alignment of the struct is the maximum alignment of its fields - in this case 8.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we need to allocate 16 bytes at an alignment of 8.</p>
<p>(A complication I&#39;m ignoring here is that some compilers will reorder struct fields to reduce the size of the struct. It&#39;s not relevant to the main point below.)</p>
<p>There is one more complication. Here&#39;s another struct:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Bar </span><span>{
</span><span>    a</span><span>: </span><span>u64</span><span>,
</span><span>    b</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You might expect this struct to end up with a size of 9 and alignment of 8, and if we were just allocating one struct that would be fine.</p>
<p>But what if we allocate an array of 2 structs, using 9 bytes for each? The first <code>Bar</code> starts at offset 0, so its <code>a</code> field has alignment 8. But the second <code>Bar</code> starts at offset 9, right after the first <code>Bar</code> ends, so its <code>a</code> field starts at offset 9 from the base address, which does not have alignment 9.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, most languages round up the size of a struct to its alignment. So the size of <code>Bar</code> would be rounded up from 9 to 16.</p>
<p>But this can be pretty wasteful when we&#39;re nesting structs!</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Quux</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    a</span><span>:</span><span> T,
</span><span>    b</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Quux&lt;u64&gt;</code> has size 16 and alignment 8, which means that <code>Quux&lt;Quux&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code> has size 24 and alignment 8, and <code>Quux&lt;Quux&lt;Quux&lt;u64&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> has size 32 and alignment 8. Most of that is wasted space.</p>
<p>Swift has a slightly better layout algorithm. It doesn&#39;t round up the size of structs, but instead does the rounding up in a separate measurement called the &#39;stride&#39;. Individual struct allocations use the size, and only arrays of structs care about the stride.</p>
<p>With swift-style layout, <code>Quux&lt;u64&gt;</code> would have size 9, stride 16, aligment 8. <code>Quux&lt;Quux&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code> would have size 10, stride 16, aligment 8. <code>Quux&lt;Quux&lt;Quux&lt;u64&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> would have size 11, stride 16, aligment 8. That saves a lot of space!</p>
<p>So now we can talk about sum types, like this classic:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span>Some</span><span>&lt;T&gt;</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>None</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The way <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is laid out in most languages is like:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    tag</span><span>:</span><span> OptionTag,
</span><span>    payload</span><span>:</span><span> OptionPayload,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>enum </span><span>OptionTag </span><span>{ 
</span><span>    </span><span>Some</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>None</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>union OptionPayload&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span>Some</span><span>&lt;T&gt;</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>None</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s work out the size of <code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size and alignment of a union is just the maximum of the sizes and alignments of its possible values. So <code>OptionPayload&lt;u64&gt;</code> has size 8, stride 8, alignment 8.</li>
<li><code>OptionTag</code> only has two possible values, so it can fit in a single byte - size 1, stride 1, alignment 1.</li>
<li><code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code> has to make sure the payload field is aligned, so it ends up with size 16, stride 16, alignment 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>That means that <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code> has size 24, <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> has size 32 etc. Mostly wasted space!</p>
<p>But what if we just reverse the order of the fields, putting the tag at the end.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    payload</span><span>:</span><span> OptionPayload,
</span><span>    tag</span><span>:</span><span> OptionTag,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now this gets laid out just like <code>Quux&lt;T&gt;</code> above. <code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code> has size 9, <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code> has size 10, <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> has size 11 etc. No wasted space.</p>
<p>(The allocator itself might waste some space, but still probably not as much as the original layout. Eg I believe jemalloc with the default config will round all of the above to 16 bytes.)</p>
<p>The only language I know of that lays out sum types this way is swift, and I couldn&#39;t find any discussion or documentation of it, so I thought it was worth highlighting.</p>
<p>P.S. If you tried to follow along with examples above in rust you&#39;ll have found that while the size of <code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code> is 16, the size of <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code> is also 16. This is because of a totally different optimization where the compiler notices that the tag in <code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code> has 256 possible values but is only using 2 of them, so 2 of the unused values can be poached for the tag in <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;</code>. To match the size calculations above you&#39;ll have to explicitly ask for a stable layout:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>repr</span><span>(u8)]
</span><span>enum </span><span>MyOption</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span>Some</span><span>(T)</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>None</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Swift has a similar optimization for unused values in pointers, but not for unused values in enum tags. So <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;Option&lt;u64&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is 17 bytes in swift but only 16 bytes in rust.</p>
