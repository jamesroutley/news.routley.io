      <p>The WasmFX project extends WebAssembly
          (abbreviated <i>Wasm</i>) with <i>effect handlers</i> as a
          unifying mechanism to enable efficient compilation of
          control idioms, such as async/await, generators/iterators,
          first-class continuations, etc.

            <h3>Efficient and fast</h3>
            <p>WasmFX provides a general and flexible instruction set
            for fast stack switching, paving the way for efficient
            implementations of various non-local control flow
            abstractions, which would otherwise have to be implemented
            using whole-program transformations such as continuation
            passing style. WasmFX is carefully designed to enable Wasm
            to maintain backwards-compatible performance for legacy
            programs.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Modular and composable</h3>
            <p>WasmFX provides a modular and composable basis for
            implementing non-local control flow abstractions via
            delimited control, as the design draws heavily
            on <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/Effect_Handlers.pdf">Plotkin
            and Pretnar&#39;s handlers for algebraic effects</a>. As such
            the design is based on strong and well-understood
            theoretical foundations; at the same time it also
            incorporates the practical lessons learnt during the
            previous 30 years of research on delimited control.</p>

            <h3>Debuggable and profilable </h3>
            <p>WasmFX is designed to preserve the debugging and
            profiling experience of WebAssembly. The structure of
            WasmFX stacks offers excellent compatibility with popular
            formats such as <a href="https://dwarfstd.org/">DWARF
            stack unwind tables</a>, enabling WebAssembly
            implementations to maintain compatibility with standard
            debugging and profiling tools.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Minimal and compatible</h3>
            <p>WasmFX is designed as a minimal and compatible
            extension to WebAssembly for structured non-local control
            flow. The extension is minimal in the sense that it
            leverages WebAssembly&#39;s existing instruction set and type
            system. It extends the instruction set with six new
            instructions and the type system with a new reference
            type.</p>
