    <h1>ProjectM: LGPL Reimplementation of Ryan Geiss&#39; Milkdrop from Winamp/Kodi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>projectM - The most advanced open-source music visualizer</h2>
<p><strong>Experience psychedelic and mesmerizing visuals by transforming music into equations that render into a limitless array of user-contributed visualizations.</strong>
</p>
<p>projectM is an open-source project that reimplements the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilkDrop" referrerpolicy="origin" rel="nofollow noopener">Winamp Milkdrop</a> by Ryan Geiss in an open-source, cross-platform reusable library.
</p>
<p>Its purpose in life is to read an audio input and to produce mesmerizing visuals, detecting tempo, and rendering advanced equations into a limitless array of user-contributed visualizations.
</p>
<p>Visuals are read from files called &#34;presets&#34;, of which there have been created many thousands in the last two decades. Presets are simple text files, containing settings, math equations and GPU shaders from which projectM creates moving, always-changing patterns that react to the playing music in different ways.</p>
<p>The full source code of the projectM library, the frontends and additional preset collections are also available on GitHub:</p>

<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>A number of download options are available, depending on your needs you might want to use different files:</p>
<ul><li>Most users will want the standalone visualizer, which is called projectM-SDL. It comes with a minimalistic, text-based menu to select presets and can be controlled via keyboard shortcuts. Press F1 to display a help screen. This version is available for all major desktop operating systems.</li><li>An Apple Music app plug-in for macOS, which runs as a built-in visualizer in Music.</li><li>Pre-built 64-bit development library packages for a number of operating systems and platforms, e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS (native code for both Intel and M1) and the Raspberry Pi 3/4.</li><li>Source code packages from GitHub for both the latest development version and stable release of the projectM library and the standalone SDL visualizer.</li></ul>
