    <h1>Mistakes as a new manager</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="8e08">Moving from an Individual Contributor (IC) to a manager is a significant career step. This is especially true in the ever-evolving tech industry. This change brings new challenges and opportunities to learn.</p>



<p id="e661">Reflecting on my first couple of years as an Engineering Manager, I realized that the lessons I learned are not unique to me; many new managers face similar experiences. That’s why I want to share these insights with you. My goal is to support and connect with other new managers who are going through this exciting yet demanding transition.</p>



<h3 id="c84d">🤝 Delegation</h3>



<p id="8c34">The most common trap you’ll probably fall into is the (many times, subconscious) reluctance to delegate. Transitioning from an IC to a manager, I found myself attached to old responsibilities, unable to trust my team with tasks I used to do.</p>



<p id="bdc9">You’ll rationalize it, “they won’t be able to do it the same way I’d do it,” but even if this is true (it’s not), long-term thinking you want your team to be able to tackle the things you used to do. Otherwise, they won’t grow — and neither will you.</p>



<p id="aadf">Remember that delegation isn’t about randomly distributing tasks; it’s about empowering your team, trusting them, and stepping into your new role as a leader.</p>



<h3 id="bfd2">🧠 Where’s my dopamine?</h3>



<p id="ce25">For over a decade, my dopamine (from work) came from a very predictable place: shipping new things. As a manager, those direct rewards will simply disappear, leaving you feeling unfulfilled for weeks (months in my case).</p>



<p id="0680">I won’t lie; this isn’t a solved problem for me yet, but I think I got into a much better shape by (trying to) rewire my brain into getting satisfaction from other places: giving feedback, seeing my reports grow, writing a very thorough performance review, etc.</p>



<p id="394e">Keep in mind that we’re not the stars anymore; we’re facilitators. Yes, it’s true that we don’t ship <em>a</em> project directly anymore, but we’re helping our team ship <em>all</em> projects.</p>



<h3 id="8297">🔍 Quality over quantity</h3>



<p id="e10b">It’s easy for new managers to equate the growth of their team size with personal and professional success. In my early days, I found myself desiring more team members or even additional teams, believing it’d reflect my management skills — and, of course, lead to a salary raise.</p>



<p id="9ff3">However, I soon learned that this was a mistake. True growth comes from the quality of your team’s output, not from the quantity of its members. Focus on pushing your team to the next level; create a place where they can come up with new ideas and do great work. This not only leads to higher quality work but also to a more cohesive and happier team. Remember, a smaller team that works well together can do better than a bigger team that doesn’t.</p>



<h3 id="4f4f">⚖️ The level of engagement</h3>



<p id="b384">The right amount of engagement that you should have in your team’s projects is also a tricky subject. Lean in too much, and you’re micromanaging; lean out too much, and you appear disengaged.</p>



<p id="d5d5">To find the right balance, consider the concept of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guided-autonomy-empowering-teams-act-jim-kalbach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Guided Autonomy</a>. This means setting clear goals and expectations, then stepping back and letting your team figure out how to achieve them. Your role becomes less about directing every action and more about providing guidance. This approach promotes responsibility and growth within your team while ensuring alignment with project objectives.</p>



<p id="ad1c">In my journey, I’ve learned that effective engagement means being present without being overbearing. It’s about creating an environment where your team feels supported but also free to innovate and take ownership. The key is to offer guidance and support without taking away your team’s independence.</p>



<h3 id="5138">👁️ Managing perception</h3>



<p id="b7f1">As an individual contributor (IC), your work spoke for itself; people could easily see it. Plain and simple. As a manager, it’s less black and white, and surprisingly, for many new managers, part of your job now involves managing how others see you.</p>



<p id="51f4">With your team members, it’s about making sure they understand and appreciate your role as a facilitator of their success. You’re no longer directly creating the product, but you play a crucial role in guiding the process, overcoming obstacles, and creating an environment where creativity and productivity thrive. It’s important for your team to recognize and value this shift in your contribution — from individual accomplishments to team successes.</p>



<p id="d958">Externally, the challenge is different but equally important. Stakeholders, other departments, and senior management may not see the day-to-day impact you have on your team. Here, managing perception involves actively communicating your team’s achievements and how your leadership contributes to these successes. It’s not about taking credit for the work, but about highlighting your role in empowering your team to excel. It’s a delicate balance of showcasing the team’s work while making your leadership and its positive effects visible to those outside of your immediate group.</p>



<p id="0e84">I understand how controversial this can be, and it’s one of the reasons why ICs often hesitate to transition into management (“all that politics!”). But it is what it is, so it’s important to adapt. Perception management is about clarity and visibility, not just for your own benefit but also to accurately represent your team’s efforts.</p>



<h3 id="c52b">🌟 Redefining success</h3>



<p id="6c93">It’s quite common for ICs to have impostor syndrome, but for managers — especially new ones — this will reach a whole new level.</p>



<p id="757a">You’ll often question your work or even if there’s any value in anything that you’re doing. I’ve been there, and from what I learned, success for you is as simple as asking yourself two questions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Is my team shipping?</li>



<li>Are they happy?</li>
</ol>



<p id="fa4c">If the answer is “yes” to both, don’t worry; you’re crushing it. 🎉</p>



<hr/>



<p id="514f">Every new manager makes mistakes, but each one is an opportunity to grow. Embrace these challenges as part of the learning process. Becoming a skilled manager takes time and continuous learning. Keep pushing forward, and soon, your mistakes will become milestones in your management career.</p>
