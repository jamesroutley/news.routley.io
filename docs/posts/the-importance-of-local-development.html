        Local development is crucial for efficient software development, it enables faster iteration, better debugging and ensures consistency between local and production environments.

        <p>A good developer experience (DX) increases productivity, reduces cognitive load, and improves developer satisfaction,
leading to higher code quality, faster onboarding, and talent retention.
An easy-to-use local development environment might be the foundation for good DX.</p>
<p>I regularly think back to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkNkSQ42jg4">hilarious discussion, where Elon Musk proposed to rewrite Twitter</a> reminding
me about the following statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest problems is that you can’t run Twitter locally. When I was at Facebook, you could run all of Facebook on a laptop. There is no way to run Twitter outside of a very bespoke configuration in a datacenter and it makes it nearly impossible to build anything new on it. <cite>George Hotz</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of a good developer experience seems to correlate with the number of people working on a project.
As a lone fighter, it’s quite simple to spin-up a bespoke setup, because its configuration is known to a single person.</p>
<p>I was a lone fighter myself for much of the research journey during my PhD, which might be the reason why I
previously neglected developer experience, except for my own experience.</p>
<p>It’s common to think about technical debt when adding new tools or features, but that is possibly not the
entire story. The concept of <mark>DX-debt</mark> is equally relevant, yet it is not sufficiently discussed, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are options such as <a href="https://github.com/Azure/draft/">Draft</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold">Skaffold</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt">Tilt</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/garden-io/garden">Garden</a> to spin-up entire clusters locally, or provide
<a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/developer-onboarding">pseudo-local</a> development environments.
It’s never been easier to provide a great developer experience. What do you think?</p>
