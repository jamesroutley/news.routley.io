    <h1>Mouse filmed tidying man&#39;s shed every night</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>A mouse has been filmed secretly tidying up a man’s shed almost every night for two months.</p><p>Wildlife photographer Rodney Holbrook noticed that objects he left out of place were being mysteriously put back where they belonged overnight.</p><p>Holbrook, from Builth Wells in Powys, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Wales</a>, set up a night vision camera on his workbench to find out what was happening, and captured footage reminiscent of the 2007 animated movie Ratatouille, where a rodent secretly cooks at a restaurant.</p><p>Holbrook, 75, told the BBC: “It has been going on for months. I call him Welsh Tidy Mouse. At first, I noticed that some food that I was putting out for the birds was ending up in some old shoes I was storing in the shed, so I set up a camera.”</p><figure id="4d4b8c92-04dc-4c2b-b4cd-be42b935c094" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf1c5bb742820a1b218f6dc34ce892106c2f32/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Rodney Holbrook in his shed.

I don’t bother to tidy up now, as I know he will see to it. I leave things out of the box and they put it back in its place by the morning. Ninety-nine times out of 100 the mouse will tidy up throughout the night.”</p><p>A similar incident occurred in 2019, when a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47625283" data-link-name="in body link">viral video showed a mouse “stockpiling” items in a man’s shed near Bristol.</a></p><p>Steve Mckears told reporters he thought he “was going mad” when screws and metal objects kept reappearing in a box containing bird feed. He set up a camera and captured footage of the mouse putting screws and other metal objects in the container.</p></div></div></div>
