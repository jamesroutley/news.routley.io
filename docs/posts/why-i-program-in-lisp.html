    <h1>Why I Program in Lisp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3404727118065375102" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Lisp is not the most popular language.  It never was.  Other
  general purpose languages are more popular and ultimately can do
  everything that Lisp can (if Church and Turing are correct).  They
  have more libraries and a larger user community than Lisp does.
  They are more likely to be installed on a machine than Lisp is.</p>

<p>Yet I prefer to program in Lisp.  I keep a Lisp REPL open at all
  times, and I write prototypes and exploratory code in Lisp.  Why do
  I do this?  Lisp is easier to remember, has fewer limitations and hoops you
  have to jump through, has lower “friction” between my
  thoughts and my program, is easily customizable, and, frankly, more
  fun.</p>

<p>Lisp&#39;s dreaded Cambridge Polish notation is uniform and
  universal.  I don&#39;t have to remember whether a form takes curly
  braces or square brackets or what the operator precedency is or some
  weird punctuated syntax that was invented for no good reason.  It is (operator
  operands ...) for everything.  Nothing to remember.  I basically stopped
  noticing the parenthesis 40 years ago.  I can indent how I
  please.</p> 

<p>I program mostly functionally, and Lisp has three features that
  help out tremendously here.  First, if you avoid side effects, it
  directly supports the substitution model.  You can tell Lisp
  that when it sees this simple form, it can just replace it with that
  more complex one.  Lisp isn&#39;t constantly pushing you into thinking
  imperatively.  Second, since the syntax is uniform and doesn&#39;t depend on
  the context, you can refactor and move code around at will.  Just
  move things in balanced parenthesis and you&#39;ll pretty much be
  ok.</p>

<p>Third, in most computer languages, you can abstract a specific value by
  replacing it with a variable that names a value.  But you can perform a further
  abstraction by replacing a variable that names a quantity with a
  function that computes a quantity.  In functional programming, you often downplay
  the distinction between a value and a function that produces that
  value.  After all, the difference is only one of time spent waiting for the
  answer.  In Lisp, you can change an expression that denotes an
  object into an abtraction that computes an object by simply wrapping
  a <code>lambda</code> around it.  It&#39;s less of a big deal these
  days, but properly working <code>lambda</code> expressions were only
  available in Lisp until recently.  Even so, <code>lambda</code>
  expressions are generally pretty clumsy in other languages.</p>

<p>Functional programming focuses on functions (go figure!).  These
  are the ideal black box abstraction:  values go in, answer comes
  out.  What happens inside?  Who knows!  Who cares! But you can plug
  little simple functions together and get bigger more complex
  functions.  There is no limit on doing this.  If you can frame your
  problem as &#34;I have this, I want that&#34;, then you can code it as a
  functional program.  It is true that functional programming takes a
  bit of practice to get used to, but it allows you to build complex
  systems out of very simple parts.  Once you get the hang of it, you
  start seeing everything as a function.  (This isn&#39;t a limitation.
  Church&#39;s lambda calculus is a model of computation based on
  functional composition.)</p>

<p>Lisp lets me try out new ideas as quickly as I can come up
  with them.  New programs are indistinguishable from those built in to
  the language, so I can build upon them just as easily.  Lisp&#39;s
  debugger means I don&#39;t have to stop everything and restart the world
  from scratch every time something goes wrong.  Lisp&#39;s safe memory
  model means that bugs don&#39;t trash my workspace as I explore the
  problem.</p>

<p>The REPL in lisp evaluates <em>expressions</em>, which are the
  fundamental fragments of Lisp programs.  You can type in part of a
  Lisp program and see what it does immediately.  If it works, you can
  simply embed the expression in a larger program.  Your program takes
  shape in real time as you explore the problem.</p>

<p>Lisp&#39;s dynamic typing gives you virtually automatic ad hoc
  polymorphism.  If you write a program that calls +, it will work on
  any pair of objects that have a well-defined + operator.  Now this
  can be a problem if you are cavalier about your types, but if
  you exercise a little discipline (like not defining + on
  combinations of strings and numbers, for example), and if you avoid
  automatic type coercion, then you can write very generic code that
  works on a superset of your data types.  (Dynamic typing is a
  two-edged sword.  It allows for fast prototyping, but it can hide
  bugs that would be caught at compile time in a statically typed
  language.)</p>

<p>Other languages may share some of these features, but Lisp has them all
  together.  It is a language that was designed to be used as a tool
  for thinking about problems, and that is the fun part of
  programming.</p>
