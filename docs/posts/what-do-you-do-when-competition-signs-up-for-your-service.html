    <h1>Ask HN: What do you do when competition signs up for your service?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m founder of robusta.dev which automates day 2 operations and monitoring on kubernetes. In recent months we&#39;ve seen a close competitor sign up for our SaaS service (using email addresses and names that clearly identify who they are) and experiment with the platform. This is a similar sized startup in the exact same market as us, competing over the exact same customers.<p>Is there anything we should or even can do about this? Or is this form of competitive research simply unavoidable?</p><p>We also have an open source offering which obviously everyone can try and even reuse. We&#39;re ok with that, of course</p></td></div></div>
