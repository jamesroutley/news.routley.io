<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>So, big exciting news for me - <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-programming-with/9781492097068/">I&#39;m writing a book!</a>  Not a novel, I&#39;m not that talented.  It&#39;s a tech book on how to write Functional style C#.  If it were a novel though, you can be sure that the Butler would turn out to have done it at the end!  I was lucky enough to get accepted to speak at NDC Porto this year, and while I was there, took the opportunity to announce the book&#39;s (hopefully) upcoming release.  I&#39;ve had a few people since then, asking me questions about how I got the book deal, and what it&#39;s like working with O&#39;Reilly.  The book itself is far from finished, but I thought I&#39;d write an ocasional blog article about how this all started and what the process is like.</p>


<h4>How Did I Get the Book Deal?</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve been speaking publically for a while now, mostly on the subject of .NET and Functional Programming, with a few other random interests thrown in.  I started at the Developer! Developer! Developer! (DDD) conferences held around the UK, branched into local user group meetups, then from there I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to get accepted for a few international conferences too.  My point is my  name had been out there.  You&#39;ll find quite a few videos of me on YouTube (apologies for the dodgy accent, there&#39;s nothing I can do about it!) and my name has turned up on the agenda for quite a few events.  I&#39;ve got this website as well, for keeping track of the stuff I do.  </p><p>It was off the back of all of this that O&#39;Reilly approached me via my website email address.  They said they&#39;d been wanting a book out on Functional C#, and they thought I might consider submitting one.  I&#39;d been thinking of submitting a book around to one of the other publishers, and I&#39;d actually previously ruled out O&#39;Reilly, assuming they&#39;d be after smarter, more famous people than me!</p>

<p>The proposal took the form of a short word document, containing details of what the book would be about, who it would be aimed at, why I&#39;m OK to write it, and a detailed chapter break-down.  The final part was a few notes on how long the book is likely to take me to finish.</p>

<p>The plan at the start was a prologue and 12 chapters, each taking around a month or so to write, meaning I&#39;d be done by the end of 2022.  After a few meetings over the internet with the nice people at O&#39;Reilly, I was eventually told that my proposal was accepted.  </p>

<h4>Was I excited?</h4>

<p>No.  Not because I wasn&#39;t grateful, or that I didn&#39;t think it would be an amazing opportunity - far from it.  I have a horrible tendency not to let myself get excited about things when there&#39;s a lot to be done.  I love going on holiday, but I don&#39;t usually let myself enjoy them until the travel is over and we&#39;re relaxing post-journey in our lodgings.  Same with the book, there are hundreds of pages to be written, reviews, quality gates, any number of things that could go wrong for reasons - some in my control, some out.</p>

<p>When the book is finally available physically I think I&#39;ll finally allow myself a little excitement.</p>

<h4>How is it written?</h4>

<p>O&#39;Reilly have a Git-based source control system with a build system attached that converts AsciiDoc format files into PDFs or EPUB docs.  AsciiDoc is a text-based format, a little like Mark-down, with all sorts of extra styling mark-up for rendering source code, etc.  It&#39;s pretty easy to use, and there&#39;s something kind of awesome about being able to build a PDF from it, and have my words with all of the O&#39;Reilly styling I&#39;m used to.</p>

<p>I tend to do the work very late at night.  I&#39;ve got 2 kids, and looking after them takes up an awful lot of my evening, plus I really need a bit of quiet, distraction-free time to work properly.  It does mean that falling asleep at my keyboard is an occupational hazard now, mind!.  By and large though, I&#39;m finding a chapter a month fairly do-able, aside from a weirdly busy April, where I seemed to spend most of it travelling.</p>

<p>It helps that I&#39;ve been giving talks on Functional Programming in C# for long enough that I&#39;ve got a pretty decent grip on the subject matter already, so the amount of research required is fairly minimal.  The harder part I find is coming up with the right wording for an explanation, or trying to decide on an amusing example function to show code for.  </p>

<p>Me being me, I&#39;ve also put plenty of terrible jokes in.  To my surprise, with one exception, none of them have been removed by the editors.</p>
 
<h4>What are O&#39;Reilly like to work with?</h4>

<p>Really nice, actually - and I&#39;m not just saying that.  Jill, my editor, meets me once a fortnight to check in on how I&#39;m doing, and provide editorial feedback.  She&#39;s lovely, and our meetings are pretty informal.  There&#39;s no real sense of an intense deadline, although that would probably change if I stopped providing regular updates.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard tell some publishers can be a bit over-bearing with regards deadlines and expected progress, but so far at least, O&#39;Reilly don&#39;t appear to be one of them.</p><p>The process for the monthly release has gone something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I work on Chapter N+2</li>
	<li>The editors at O&#39;Reilly look at chapter N+1</li>
	<li>Chapter N is released to the Learning site</li>
</ul>
	  
<p>The biggest issue I have in editing is that the official language of the book is American English, and I&#39;m British, so I&#39;m having to constantly correct my spellings.  Changing &#39;s&#39; for &#39;z&#39;, removing silent &#39;u&#39;s, that sort of thing.  They did let me get away with a reference to the 90s British Fantasy gameshow/RPG &#39;Knightmare&#39; though.  I&#39;m chuffed to have managed that.</p>
	  
	  <h4>What Animal Will I Get?</h4>
	  <p>I have no idea, and neither does anyone else.  The editing team have no say in which animal goes with which book.  Aparently there&#39;s a team somewhere in O&#39;Reilly whose job is to make the Animal selection. It&#39;ll be determined close to release date - some time next year.</p>
	  
	  <p>I don&#39;t get any say, but if I could choose I&#39;d go with either a Eurasian Wren or a Eurasian Robin.  I&#39;m a keen birdwatcher, and those two are among my paricular favourites.  If nothing else, the Robin would be nice, since it&#39;s the national bird of my home country - the UK.</p>
	  
	  
<h4>Will you make any money off this?</h4>

<p>I have no idea, in all honesty.  Probably not.  I get 10% of the royalties on paper copies and something like 25% on e-copies.  I couldn&#39;t tell you what that&#39;ll equate to, but really and truely I&#39;m not in this for the money.  If I get a 50p piece sellotaped to a bit of cardboard in the post from O&#39;reilly once a month I probably still won&#39;t feel too hard done by.   A few months of that and I can even treat myself to a beer!</p>

<p>It has been suggested I could self-publish and keep 90% of the profit for myself.  That might well be true, but the O&#39;Reilly brand has a lot of pull in the market, and they have international contacts that I couldn&#39;t hope to make use of, so I can&#39;t help but think that 10% skimmed off the surface of O&#39;Reilly&#39;s profits are probably still more than 90% of whatever I could hope to achieve as an almost completely unknown author.  Maybe for the next book, who knows... I&#39;ve not honestly planned that far ahead.</p>
	  
<h4>What&#39;s next?</h4>

<p>Keep my head down and write as much as I can the rest of this year.  I&#39;ve reached chapter 4 in draft, and I&#39;ve got another 8 chapters still to do.  that&#39;s really quite a lot of work.  The pre-release version is available on the O&#39;Reilly learning platform now, and they&#39;re hoping to update it with another chapter every month, going forward.</p>

<p>Tech review is ongoing right now, so I&#39;m hoping for my first professional feedback in the next week or two, most likely followed by a late night of frantic alterations.  I&#39;m not sure they ever have enough reviewers, so do get in touch if you&#39;re interested in reading the early version of this book &amp; helping me with feedback.  You don&#39;t have to already be an expert, I&#39;d love to hear what anyone from any level of skill has to say about what I&#39;m writing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably write a follow-up article once there have been further developments.  Maybe towards the end of the year.  I&#39;ll see how it goes...</p>

<p>I&#39;m half tempted to spend a year learning painting when this is all over.  I&#39;m aware I&#39;ve got a slightly ironic surname, but it is actually something I fancy learning to do.  Would make a nice contrast with a solid year of tech stuff.</p>
