    <h1>Roll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I developed an old roll of film and the photos are pretty decent!</p><p>My <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/olympus/xa.htm">Olympus XA-2</a> is my default walking-around camera. I love it, but its age is showing and I’m envious of the crisp photos that people get out of later-era SLR film cameras. Thinking about getting a lightweight viewfinder for my monstrous Nikon F, or buying something like a Nikon FM2. There’s a paradox to this gear, though, and I don’t want to delude myself into thinking that I’d use a slightly different camera more when really the issue is that I’m not shooting many photos regardless.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-waves.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Waves" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-waves.jpg"/></picture></p><p>These were shot with <a href="https://santa1000.com/santacolor-100">SantaColor</a>, which produces the strong green &amp; red channels. It’s interesting? I chose not to “correct it” all the way back to natural lighting. Or I couldn’t find a way to do that without ruining the look.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-sky.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Sky" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-sky.jpg"/></picture></p><p>Getting film developed is harder than ever, but most major cities have an option.</p><ul><li>In New York, I use <a href="https://gelatinlabs.com/">Gelatin</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkfolderfilmhouse.com/">Pink Folder Film House</a></li><li>In DC, I used <a href="https://dodgechrome.com/">Dodge Chrome</a></li><li>In San Francisco, I used <a href="https://www.photoworkssf.com/">Photoworks</a></li></ul><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-chicago-tour.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Chicago tour" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-chicago-tour.jpg"/></picture></p><p>I’m still using <a href="https://www.captureone.com/en/products/capture-one-pro">Capture One</a> to manage my photos, which is expensive and vastly overkill but really nice, focused, “pro” software.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-prospect-park.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Prospect park" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-prospect-park.jpg"/></picture></p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-chicago.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Chicago" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-chicago.jpg"/></picture></p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-11-10-roll-navy-yard.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Navy Yard" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-11-10-roll-navy-yard.jpg"/></picture></p></div></div>
