                    Synthea<sup>TM</sup> is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to provide high-quality, synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions, enabling research with Health IT data that is otherwise legally or practically unavailable.

                                    The models used to generate synthetic patients are informed by numerous academic publications. Our synthetic populations provide insight into the validity of this research and encourage future studies in population health.

                                    Synthetic data establishes a risk-free environment for Health IT development and experimentation. This includes the evaluation of new treatment models, care management systems, clinical decision support, and more.

                                    The effects of healthcare policy can be simulated, quickly and repeatably, in a synthetic population. Using this iterative approach, Synthea can guide policy with patient models at the state and county level that are free from privacy restrictions.

                        <p>
                            Synthea’s Generic Module Framework (GMF) enables the modeling of various diseases and conditions that contribute to the medical history of synthetic patients. Each patient is simulated independently from birth to present day. Their diseases, conditions and medical care are defined by one or more generic modules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each module models events that could occur in a real patient’s life,  describing a progression of states and the transitions between them. These modules are informed by clinicians and real-world statistics collected by the CDC, NIH, and other research sources. Synthea started with modules for  the top ten reasons patients visit their primary care physician and the top ten conditions that result in years of life lost.

                            For each synthetic patient, Synthea data contains a complete medical history, including medications, allergies, medical encounters, and social determinants of health. This data can be used without concern for legal or privacy restrictions. To support developers, clinicians and researchers alike, Synthea data is exported in a variety of data standards, including <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/" onclick="trackOutboundLink(&#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/&#39;); return false;">HL7 FHIR®</a>, <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/consolidated-cda-overview" onclick="trackOutboundLink(&#39;https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/consolidated-cda-overview&#39;); return false;">C-CDA</a> and CSV.
