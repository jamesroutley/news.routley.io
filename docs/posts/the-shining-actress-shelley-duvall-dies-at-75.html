film roles included Terry Gilliam&#39;s Time Bandits and Roxanne with Steve Martin.<!-- --></p><p>She also set up her own production companies, and made and hosted beloved 1980s children&#39;s TV show Faerie Tale Theatre.<!-- --></p><p>Her acting roles diminished in the 1990s, with Jane Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady the pick of the crop, and she dropped off the radar in 2002.<!-- --></p><p>The New York Times attributed her apparent disappearance to the impact of a 1994 earthquake that damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stress of her brother having cancer.<!-- --></p><p>Discussing her prolonged absence from the screen, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/style/shelley-duvall.html">she told the paper<!-- --></a> in May she had been the victim of a
