    <h1>Tell HN: DuckDuckGo Search Not Returning Results</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For the last several hours, DuckDuckGo has not been returning search results.  Rather, after a brief delay, it returns only the text:
&gt;There was an error displaying the search results. Please try again.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this appears to be affecting both mobile and desktop search.</p><p>AFAICT, there hasn&#39;t been an official announcement from DDG although there is a reddit thread[0] just noting the above information.</p><p>Hopefully DDG will be back soon, as I&#39;m loathe to go back to Google for search.</p><p>[0] https://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/1cylyuf/is_ddg_down/</p></div></div></div>
