    <h1>Ask HN: Am I crazy or is Android development awful?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>TL;DR - what I can do in 10 minutes on a desktop python app (windows or Linux, both worked fine) seems near impossible as an Android app.</p><p>I have a simple application to prototype: take a wired USB webcam, display it on the screen on a computer device (ideally a small device/screen), and draw a few GUI elements on top of it.</p><p>Using Python scripting and OpenCV, I had a working cross-compatible script in 10 minutes, for both Linux and Windows.</p><p>Then I realized I&#39;d love this to work on an Android phone. I have devices with USB OTG, and a USB-C hub for the webcam. I confirmed the hardware setup working using someone else&#39;s closed source app.</p><p>However the development process has been awful. Android Studio has so much going on for a &#39;Hello World&#39;, and trying to integrate various USB webcam libraries has been impossible, even with AI assistants and Google guiding me. Things to do with Gradle versions or Kotlin versions being wrong between the libraries and my Android studio; my project not being able to include external repos via dependencies or toml files, etc.</p><p>In frustration I then tried a few python-to-android solutions, which promise to take a python script and make an APK. I tried: Kivy + python for android, and then Beeswax or Briefcase (may have butchered names slightly). Neither would build without extremely esoteric errors that neither me nor GPT had any chance to fix.</p><p>Well, looks like modern mobile phones are not a great hacker&#39;s playground, huh?</p><p>I guess I will go for a raspberry pi equivalent. In fact I already have tested my script on a RPi and it&#39;s just fine. But what a waste, needing to use a new computer module, screen display, and battery, when the smartphone has all 3 components nicely set up already in one sleek package.</p><p>Anyways that&#39;s my rant, wanted to get others&#39; takes on Android (or smartphone in general) dev these days, or even some project advice in case anyone has done something similar connecting a wired webcam to a smartphone.</p></div></td></div></div>
