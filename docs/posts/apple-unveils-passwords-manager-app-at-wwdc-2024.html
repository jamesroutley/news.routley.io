It helps that the app is powered by iCloud Keychain, an existing Apple service that saves and syncs passwords across different devices. That should make user adoption a little more seamless. </p><p>The Passwords app is free to download, available across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and MacOS 15, and will also work with the Vision Pro and Windows computers, says Apple. Only time will tell if it ultimately dethrones the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/" rel="follow">best password managers</a> on the market today.</p></div></div> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/editorial-guidelines/" rel="follow"><svg><use xlink:href="#file" aria-hidden="false"></use></svg><span>Editorial standards</span></a> <!---->  <!----></div></div>
