<p>
Good role models are hard to find nowadays. In this valley of dying
stars who do you point your kids to and say &#34;There&#39;s someone to admire
and emulate!&#34;. When it comes to science and technology the cupboard
looks barer each day. Our media lionises fakes, frauds, impostors,
witty and beautiful science &#34;presenter personalities&#34;, or greedy,
sinister clown technologists who call themselves laughable things like
&#34;thought leaders&#34; or &#34;amoral business investors&#34;. This freak show of
colossal bellends doesn&#39;t leave much to write home about.
</p>

<p>
So why not choose a fictional plasticine dog? He&#39;s more real than any
&#34;AI&#34;, or any tepid human who defers to one. I&#39;d like to nominate
Gromit as an unlikely hacker hero.
</p>

<p>
Gromit the dog is what Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill
Gates and all those screwball US billionaires would like to be, but
never will. Despite that time Preston the robot dog attempted to frame
him for mistreatment of sheep, Gromit has never been involved in any
sex scandals, Bond-villain paedophile island romps, or running
Dickensian child-slave factories, unlike his human counterparts in the
technology industry. Gromit is simply a decent engineer.
</p>

<p>
To understand Gromit we must start with his owner, Wallace. Gromit
plays straight-man to Wallace the <i>techno tragedian</i>. Wallace is an
inventor, a credulous neophyte, whose over-egged Heath-Robinson
solutions to everyday non-problems cause endless trouble. His life is
spent thinking about and attending to gadgets, whether it be creation,
maintenance, purchase, or fleeing from those that run amok. Wallace is
always in pursuit of &#34;convenience&#34;, &#34;embracing technology&#34; and &#34;saving
money&#34;.
</p>

<p>
No doubt there is much to unearth about (creator) Nick Park&#39;s
ambivalent relation to technology, but we won&#39;t go there. Compared to
aforementioned broligarchs, Wallace is an ordinary and likeable
character. In a light, humorous way, Park makes him a container for
everything that&#39;s wrong with modern tech thinking and solutionism.
</p>

<p>
By contrast Gromit is suspicious of tech and a less reckless
engineer. His vigilant, sceptical eye spots faults, dodging dollops of
jam from misaligned breakfast machines, or pulling the correct lever
just in the nick of time. Gromit anticipates techno-tragedy and cleans
up the mess. There is a Laurel and Hardy type relation - or perhaps
like Hong-Kong Phooey and Spot the cat - in which Gromit always saves
Wallace from his own inventions. Gromit is Wallace&#39;s common-sense and
conscience.
</p>

<p>
Gromit is no throwback. He&#39;s well educated and well rounded. He&#39;s an
expert at <i>Electronics for Dogs</i> and after a session with highbrow
literature like Fido Dogstoyevsky, he&#39;s equally at home with practical
tasks, sawing, drilling, welding or other jobs as befit an inventors
assistant. Whatever the canine word for Greek <i>Arete</i> is, Gromit has
it.
</p>

<p>
Gromit cannily anticipates the tragic unfolding of technology going
wrong. With a slight, slow shake of the head, he often wears an
expression of disappointed disbelief while looking at Wallace&#39;s
plans - an expression that perfectly sums up my own feelings about
most technology today.

<p>
Now, much as I eschew namedropping and cozying-up to the rich and
famous, I can hardly resist hinting at my own humble connection,
having lived in the <i>same house</i> as Gromit! When I lived in Bristol
the previous occupant of my room, a friend of a friend, worked at
Aardman as Gromit&#39;s cleaner. In fact there were several &#39;Gromits&#39;, to
different scales and detail. After each stop-motion shoot, her job was
to meticulously erase the fingerprints and restore his coat to shiny
health. Gromit had his own wooden box and often came home to Windmill
Hill to get a good nights sleep before filming the next day. (Of all
my tenuous associations with plasticine fictional characters this is
the one I&#39;m most proud of.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, as scientists, engineers and hackers we should look up to
Gromit the dog. I hope that one day Gromit will write a book on
&#34;Technology for Humans&#34; shining a light on the many lessons learned
during his adventures with Wallace. Meanwhile we&#39;ll have to endure the
manky fruits of lesser minds, like that hopeless boner Musk, and hope
it all goes just a little bit less haywire and evil than Wallace&#39;s
contraptions.
