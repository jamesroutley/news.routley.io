It first began broadcasting at the close of the Cold War, when communism was in decline. Today it’s transmitted from two locations – the St Petersburg site and a location near Moscow. Bizarrely, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, rather than shutting down, the station’s activity sharply increased.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>There’s no shortage of theories to explain what the Buzzer might be for – ranging from keeping in touch with submarines to communing with aliens. One such idea is that it’s acting as a “Dead Hand” signal; in the event Russia is hit by a nuclear attack, the drone will stop and automatically trigger a retaliation. No questions asked, just total nuclear obliteration on both sides.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>There are clues in the signal itself</span></p></div></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>This may not be as wacky as it sounds. The system was originally pioneered in the Soviet era, where it took the form of a computer system which scanned the airwaves for signs of life or nuclear fallout. Alarmingly, many experts believe it <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/russias-dead-hand-system-may-still-be-active-2014-9?IR=T&amp;">may still be in use<!-- --></a>. As Russian president Vladimir Putin <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/putin-warns-nobody-would-survive-us-russia-conflict-622276">pointed out<!-- --></a> himself earlier this year, “nobody would survive” a nuclear war between Russia and the United States. Could the Buzzer be warding one off?<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>As it happens, there are clues in the signal itself. Like all international radio, the Buzzer operates at a relatively low frequency known as “shortwave”. This means that – compared to local radio, mobile phone and television signals – fewer waves pass through a single point every second. It also means they can travel a lot further.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>While you’d be hard pressed to listen to a local station such as BBC Radio London in a neighbouring county, shortwave stations like the <!-- --><a target="_self" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2x9tqt6mc05vB2S37j8MWMJ/global-short-wave-frequencies">BBC World Service<!-- --></a> are aimed at audiences from Senegal to Singapore.

Higher frequency radio signals can only travel in a straight line, eventually becoming lost as they bump into obstacles or reach the horizon. But shortwave frequencies have an extra trick – they can bounce off charged particles in the upper atmosphere, allowing them to zig-zag between the earth and the sky and travel thousands, rather than tens, of miles.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Which brings us back to the Dead Hand theory. As you might expect, shortwave signals have proved extremely popular. Today they’re used by ships, aircraft and the military to send messages across continents, oceans and mountain ranges. But there’s a catch.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>The lofty layer isn’t so much a flat mirror, but a wave, which undulates like the surface of the ocean. During the day it moves steadily higher, while at night, it creeps down towards the Earth. If you want to absolutely guarantee that your station can be heard on the other side of the planet – and if you’re using it as a cue for nuclear war, you probably do – it’s important to change the frequency depending on the time of day, to catch up. The BBC World Service already does this. The Buzzer doesn’t.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Another idea is that the radio station exists to “sound” out how far away the layer of charged particles is. “To get good results from the radar systems the Russians use to spot missiles, you need to know this,” says Stupples. The longer the signal takes to get up into the sky and down again, the higher it must be.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>There is a station with some striking similarities</span></p></div></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Alas, that can’t be it either. To analyse the layer’s altitude the signal would usually have <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwk_A2DPCk&amp;">a certain sound<!-- --></a>, like a car alarm going off – the result of varying the waves to get them just right. “They sound nothing like the Buzzer,” says Stupples. <!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Intriguingly, there is a station with some striking similarities. The “Lincolnshire Poacher” ran from the mid-1970s to 2008. Just like the Buzzer, it could be heard on the other side of the planet. Just like the Buzzer, it emanated from an undisclosed location, thought to be somewhere in Cyprus. And just like the Buzzer, its transmissions were just plain creepy.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>At the beginning of every hour, the station would play the first two bars of an English folk tune, the Lincolnshire Poacher.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>“Oh ‘tis my delight on a shining night <!-- --></i></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>In the season of the year<!-- --></i></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire<!-- --></i></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>‘Twas well I served my master for nigh on seven years…”<!-- --></i></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>After repeating this 12 times, it would move on to messages read by the disembodied voice of a woman reading groups of five numbers – “1-2-0-3-6” – in a clipped, upper-class English accent.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>To get to grips with what was going on, it helps to go back to the 1920s. The All-Russian Co-operative Society (Arcos) was an important trade body, responsible for overseeing transactions between the UK and the early Soviet Union.

The basement had been rigged with anti-intruder devices and they discovered a secret room with no door handle, in which workers were hurriedly burning documents.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>It may have been dramatic, but the British didn’t discover anything that they didn’t already know. Instead the raid was a wake-up call to the Soviets, who discovered that MI5 had been listening in on them for years.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>“This was a blunder of the very first order,” says Anthony Glees, who directs the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham. To justify the raid, the prime minister had even read out some of the deciphered telegrams in the House of Commons.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>The upshot was that the Russians completely reinvented the way messages are encrypted. Almost overnight, they switched to “one-time pads”. In this system, a random key is generated by the person sending the message and shared only with the person receiving it. As long as the key really is perfectly random, the code cannot be cracked. There was no longer any need to worry about who could hear their messages.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Enter the “numbers stations” – radio stations that broadcast coded messages to spies all over the world. Soon even the British were doing it: if you can’t beat them, join ‘em, as they say. It’s quite difficult to generate a completely random number because a system for doing so will, by its very nature, be predictable – exactly what you’re trying to avoid. Instead officers in London found an ingenious solution.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>They’d hang a microphone out of the window on Oxford Street and record the traffic. “There might be a bus beeping at the same time as a policeman shouting. The sound is unique, it will never happen again,” says Stupples. Then they’d convert this into a random code.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Of course, that didn’t stop people trying to break them. During World War Two, the British realised that they could, in fact, decipher the messages – but they’d have to get their hands on the one-time pad that was used to encrypt them. “We discovered that the Russians used the out-of-date sheets of one-time pads as substitute toilet paper in Russian army hospitals in East Germany,” says Glees. Needless to say, British intelligence officers soon found themselves rifling through the contents of Soviet latrines.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>Now North Korea are getting in on the act, too</span></p></div></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>The new channel of communication was so useful, it didn’t take long before the numbers stations had popped up all over the world. There was the colourfully named “Nancy Adam Susan”, “Russian Counting Man” and “Cherry Ripe” – the Lincolnshire Poacher’s sister station, which also contained bars of an English folk song.

When a signal is carrying information, instead of neat, evenly spaced waves like ripples on the ocean, you’re left with a wave like the jagged silhouette of an ECG.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05b8wkt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy During the Cold War, Soviet spies were instructed via shortwave radio (Credit: Alamy)"/><span>Alamy</span></p></section><section data-component="caption-block"><span>During the Cold War, Soviet spies were instructed via shortwave radio (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></span></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>This isn’t the Buzzer.
