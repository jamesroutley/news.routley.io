    <h1>Taiga: A free and open-source project management tool</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Z659KMm9DbXh6r9Fw6ioIPfdTe2eG715"><p>Taiga is an open-source project management software for multidisciplinary teams that work agile across both scrum and Kanban frameworks.</p><p>Taiga&#39;s birth goes back to a <a href="https://kaleidos.net/" target="_blank">Kaleidos</a> hackathon in 2013. The team at Kaleidos, filled with frustration, couldn&#39;t find an intuitive and visually appealing tool to facilitate agile methodologies for both developers and designers. So, we did what was right. We decided to come up with a better tool and that&#39;s how Taiga&#39;s journey began!</p></div><div id="UgIZwuBykhPe2TOuVgsvt66z0gMZ7U3q"><p><span>In only a couple of years later, Taiga was rolled out and immediately won &#34;The Best Agile Tool‚Äù in the 2015 Agile Awards. Most recently, it was cited as one of the Top 7 project management tools for 2020 by OpenSource.com and it continues to be cited as one of the best agile project management tools with a worldwide footprint.</span><br/></p><p>We are now busy working on the next iteration of Taiga, something we codenamed <i><a href="https://community.taiga.io/t/announcing-taiganext-and-much-more/" target="_blank"><i>TaigaNext</i></a></i>, and it will showcase the Kaleidos vision around lean and design processes, connecting our two products, both Taiga and <a href="https://penpot.app/" target="_blank">Penpot</a> together.</p><p>By the way, in case you&#39;re wondering, the name of Taiga comes after the boreal forest which lies across the subarctic region. It&#39;s strikingly beautiful from a distance but deadly if you enter the Taiga unprepared. A new project is like the Taiga forest, so we created our unique Taiga where you can start any project without any worry at all, we&#39;ve got you covered. Just enjoy the Taiga!<br/></p></div></div>
