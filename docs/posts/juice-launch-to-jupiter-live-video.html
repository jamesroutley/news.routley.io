				<h3>Space for our climate</h3>
								
				
				<p>The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2023, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic.</p>

				<p>How do you develop a spacecraft in the midst of a global pandemic? In this film, director Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called JUICE. It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2023, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic.</p>

Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.</p>

In this programme, we take you to the Concordia research station in Antarctica to meet the people spending their winter months in total isolation. We follow ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on an expedition to retrieve meteorites from the ice. And a leading climate scientist delves into how and why the ice is melting fast not just in Antarctica, but all around the world.</p>

				<h3>Space for our climate</h3>
								
				
				<p>The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.</p>

				<h3>Space for our climate</h3>
								
				
				<p>The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

				<h3>On the hunt for the riskiest asteroid</h3>
								
				
				<p>What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.</p>

Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

				<h3>Back from the stars with Thomas Pesquet</h3>
								
				
				<p>After spending almost 200 days on the International Space Station and setting a new European record for spacewalks, Thomas Pesquet returned to Earth in November 2021, bringing his Alpha Mission to an end. In this programme, we look back on his second mission in space and get an exclusive interview with Thomas, freshly landed on European soil. Highlights also include the conversations he held from space with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as with the rock band Coldplay. What’s next for Thomas? We hear from David Parker, ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, to discuss upcoming missions, including sending humans back to the Moon. </p>

				<h3>An astronaut at mission control</h3>
								
				
				<p>Andreas Mogensen is busy training these days: he is the next ESA astronaut to fly to the International Space Station in summer 2023. Despite his busy schedule, he agreed to come and meet the experts who are flying our satellites and spacecrafts at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Why does an astronaut need to know about the handrails of the International Space Station before every spacewalk? What happens if a spacecraft is on a collision course with a faraway planet? How can sun radiation impact astronauts and…our electricity grids? Andreas’ encounters at ESOC will tell you all about it.</p>

				<h3>Next-generation launchers</h3>
								
				
				<p>The next generation of Europe’s vehicles to space is taking to the skies! After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023. Finally, we take you on a tour of Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, where both Vega-C and the Ariane rockets are being launched.</p>

				<h3>CaSSIS. Mars demystified</h3>
								
				
				<p>Every day, the CaSSIS camera takes dozens of spectacular images of the red planet, from an orbit of 400 km above the surface. The ‘Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System’ (CaSSIS) is a camera onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft which was launched in 2016. This high-resolution camera enables scientists to enhance their understanding of the red planet&#39;s surface. So, who left these dark curly tracks on Mars? Are there giant worms or devils? Follow this award-winning programme to investigate some of Mars’ fascinating mysteries.</p>

				<h3>ExoMars - Back on track for the Red Planet</h3>
								
				
				<p>A year has passed since the launch of the rover to the Red Planet was put on hold, and then cancelled, because of events on Earth. But the work has not stopped for the ExoMars teams. In this programme we travel back to Turin, Italy to talk to the teams involved. New tests are being conducted on the rover’s Earth twin, while the real rover remains carefully stored in its ultra-clean room – where ultra-precise procedures remain in place, as our cameraman Francesco finds out once more. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin mission has now a target launch date of 2028 for the trip to Mars.</p>

				<h3>On the hunt for the riskiest asteroid</h3>
								
				
				<p>What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.</p>
