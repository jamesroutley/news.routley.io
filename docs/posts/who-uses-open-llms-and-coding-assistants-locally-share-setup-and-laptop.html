    <h1>Ask HN: Who uses open LLMs and coding assistants locally? Share setup and laptop</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Dear Hackers,
I’m interested in your real-world workflows for using open-source LLMs and open-source coding assistants on your laptop (not just cloud/enterprise SaaS). Specifically:</p><p>Which model(s) are you running (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, or others) and which open-source coding assistant/integration (for example, a VS Code plugin) you’re using?</p><p>What laptop hardware do you have (CPU, GPU/NPU, memory, whether discrete GPU or integrated, OS) and how it performs for your workflow?</p><p>What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short).</p><p>I&#39;m conducting my own investigation, which I will be happy to share as well when over.</p><p>Thanks!
Andrea.</p></div></div></div>
