You can actually finish work at five, rather than finishing at five spending 45 minutes trying to get home.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">As corporate leaders from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to Tesla and Twitter boss Elon Musk call for an end to pandemic-era remote work arrangements, unions in Australia are setting a precedent and fighting back, taking to court the country&#39;s biggest bank and wrangling with the federal government to demand WFH, as it is known, to become the norm.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;All the deep changes in the Australian labour market have come out of crises. When you have a jolt, you never return to the way the world was,&#34; said John Buchanan, head of the University of Sydney&#39;s Health and Work Research Network.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;We&#39;re always ahead of the pack in the English-speaking world, say compared to the UK, US, New Zealand.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Empowered by the lowest unemployment rate in half a century, staff at Commonwealth Bank of Australia <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CBA.AX" target="_blank">(CBA.AX)</a> took the A$170 billion ($114 billion) lender to the industrial tribunal to challenge a directive to work from the office half of the time.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">In April, the CEO of Australia&#39;s third-largest bank, National Australia Bank <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NAB.AX" target="_blank">(NAB.AX)</a>, ordered 500 senior managers back to the office full-time. In July, NAB agreed to a union deal that gives all employees, including the 500 managers, the right to request WFH, with limits on grounds of refusal.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">That same week, the public sector union struck a deal the which lets Australia&#39;s 120,000 federal employees request work-from-home an unlimited number of days.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">By comparison, Canada&#39;s federal workers ended a two-week strike in May with a <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-public-workers-reach-contract-agreement-with-federal-govt-ending-strike-2023-05-01/">wages agreement</a> that came without the WFH protections they wanted. And in the European Union, lawmakers are still negotiating updates to decades-old &#34;telework&#34; protections to fit a post-lockdown economy, where actual office attendance is down on 2019 levels anywhere from a fifth in Tokyo to more than half in New York, according to global real estate company Jones Lang Lasalle <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/JLL.N" target="_blank">(JLL.N)</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">&#34;The genie&#39;s out of the bottle: working from home is something that is staying well beyond COVID and the pandemic,&#34; said Melissa Donnelly, the Community and Public Sector Union secretary who negotiated the Australian federal agreement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">&#34;What was possible around working from home has absolutely been transformed,&#34; she added. &#34;This is what this deal achieves. It will have a flow on effect across different industries.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">CBA and NAB say that even before the union deals, their policies allowed flexible working arrangements, which were widely used.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">&#39;HISTORIC CONFRONTATION&#39;</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Though the number of remote-work days sought by employees differs between country and industry, the gap between employee WFH demands and their bosses&#39; return-to-office orders is a global constant, said Mathias Dolls, deputy director of the ifo Center for Macroeconomics and Surveys in Hamburg which polled 35,000 workers and employers in 34 countries as part of a project with Stanford University.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Among employees with WFH experience, 19% wanted to return to the office full-time, the survey found. Workers wanted two days a week of WFH, double what bosses wanted, and &#34;the gap is not shrinking,&#34; said Dolls. &#34;I don&#39;t think we will see WFH levels going back to pre-pandemic levels.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute, a think tank, said individual union deals would not necessarily end the stalemate since employers would get more bargaining power if unemployment rose, a widely-expected by-product of rising interest rates.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">&#34;The overall weight of opinion among workers is strongly they&#39;d like to keep doing it and I think an emerging majority of employers are thinking, no, they want people back to work,&#34; Stanford said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">&#34;That sets the stage for a historic confrontation.&#34;</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">CHANGED WORKFORCE</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-18">The shift to remote work, from as little as 2% of Australian hours worked in 2019 to a standard of white-collar employment, has already disrupted the business model of office landlords who report <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-office-landlords-face-price-reckoning-amid-buyer-impasse-2023-07-19/">declining building valuations</a> amid concerns about reduced floorspace being rented by companies.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">About one-sixth of Australian capital city office space is vacant, a multi-year high, industry data shows, as in-person attendance remains at least a third below pre-pandemic levels.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">While WFH spells pain for <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/commercial-real-estate-investors-banks-buckle-up-perfect-property-storm-2023-07-30/">investors in bricks and mortar</a>, employees like drone operator Coomber can only see benefits: flexible work arrangements recently allowed him and his wife to keep working for two weeks when their children were too sick to attend childcare.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">&#34;It just helps get through life a little bit easier,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">($1 = 1.4932 Australian dollars)</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Miral Fahmy</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
