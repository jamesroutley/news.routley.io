<p>We introduce <em>Aquila</em>, an experimental datacenter network fabric built with ultra-low latency support as a first-class design goal, while also supporting traditional datacenter traffic. Aquila uses a new Layer 2 cell-based protocol, GNet, an integrated switch, and a custom ASIC with low-latency Remote Memory Access (RMA) capabilities co-designed with GNet. We demonstrate that Aquila is able to achieve under 40 microseconds tail fabric Round Trip Time (RTT) for IP traffic and sub-10 microseconds RMA execution time across hundreds of host machines, even in the presence of background throughput-oriented IP traffic. This translates to more than 5x reduction in tail latency for a production quality key-value store running on a prototype Aquila network.</p></div></div></div><div id="node-paper-full-group-open-access-content"><h2><span>Open Access Media</span></h2><p>USENIX is committed to Open Access to the research presented at our events.
