 <p>Every distro is tailored for a range of purposes. Some are configured to work on <a href="https://itsfoss.com/lightweight-linux-beginners/">old computers</a>, some aim to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/beautiful-linux-distributions/">great user experience</a> and some focus on security.</p><p>Immutable distributions were not what users wanted a couple of years back. But, recently, more projects are focusing on the immutability aspect as a core feature of the Linux distribution.</p><p>Why is that? And, what are all the options available? Before you get to the list, let me briefly tell you more about immutability:</p><h2 id="what-is-an-immutable-linux-distro">What is an immutable Linux distro?</h2><p>An immutable distro ensures that the operating system&#39;s core remains unchanged. The root file system for an immutable distro remains read-only, making it possible to stay the same across multiple instances. Of course, you can change things if you would like to. But, the ability remains disabled by default. </p><p>How is it useful?</p><p>Traditionally, immutable distributions existed to allow for easier testing and container-based software development. Furthermore, immutability provides you with better security and reliable updates for your operating system. </p><p>Back then, the focus on such features was limited to distros aimed for professionals and developers. Now, it is being incorporated for daily desktop users.</p><div><p>ðŸ“‹</p><p>The list is in no particular ranking order. And, some options are still in their early phases of development.</p></div><h2 id="1-carbonos">1. carbonOS</h2><figure><img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2023/03/carbon-os-screenshot.png" alt="carbon os screenshot with gnome menu" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="750" srcset="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/carbon-os-screenshot.png 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/carbon-os-screenshot.png 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2023/03/carbon-os-screenshot.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p><a href="https://carbon.sh/?ref=itsfoss.com">carbonOS</a> is an upcoming independent Linux distro (at the time of writing this).
