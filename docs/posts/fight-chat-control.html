                        The &#34;Chat Control&#34; proposal would mandate scanning of <strong>all</strong> private digital communications,
                        including encrypted messages and photos. This threatens <strong>fundamental privacy rights</strong> and digital security
                        for all EU citizens.

                <h2>You Will Be Impacted</h2>
                <p>
                    Every photo, every message, every file you send will be automatically scanned‚Äîwithout your consent or suspicion. This is not about catching criminals. It is mass surveillance imposed on all 450 million citizens of the European Union.

                        <h3>Mass Surveillance</h3>
                        <p>Every private message, photo, and file scanned automatically: no suspicion required, no exceptions*, even encrypted communications.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>üîìÔ∏è</p>
                        <h3>Breaking Encryption</h3>
                        <p>Weakening or breaking end-to-end encryption exposes everyone‚Äôs communications‚Äîincluding sensitive financial, medical, and private data‚Äîto hackers, criminals, and hostile actors.</p>

                        <h3>Fundamental Rights</h3>
                        <p>Undermines your fundamental rights to privacy and data protection, as guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter‚Äîrights considered core to European democratic values.</p>

                        <h3>False Positives</h3>
                        <p>Automated scanners routinely misidentify innocent content, such as vacation photos or private jokes, as illegal, putting ordinary people at risk of false accusations and damaging investigations.</p>

                        <h3>Ineffective Child Protection</h3>
                        <p>Child protection experts and organisations, including the UN, warn that mass surveillance fails to prevent abuse and actually makes children less safe‚Äîby weakening security for everyone and diverting resources from proven protective measures.</p>

                        <h3>Global Precedent</h3>
                        <p>Creates a dangerous global precedent enabling authoritarian governments, citing EU policy, to roll out intrusive surveillance at home, undermining privacy and free expression worldwide.</p>
                    </div>

                    *EU politicians exempt themselves from this surveillance under &#34;professional secrecy&#34; rules.
                    They get privacy.</p>
