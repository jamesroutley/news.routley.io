    <h1>Statistics made simple</h1>
    
    
<p>I have a weird relationship with statistics: on one hand, I try not to look at it too often. Maybe once or twice a year. It’s because analytics is not actionable: what difference does it make if a thousand people saw my article or ten thousand?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, you might try to guess people’s tastes and only write about what’s popular, but that will destroy your soul pretty quickly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel nervous when something is not accounted for, recorded, or saved for future reference. I might not need it now, but what if ten years later I change my mind?</p>
<p>Seeing your readers also helps to know you are not writing into the void. So I really don’t need much, something very basic: the number of readers per day/per article, maybe, would be enough.</p>
<p>Final piece of the puzzle: I self-host my web projects, and I use an old-fashioned web server instead of delegating that task to Nginx.</p>
<p>Static sites are popular and for a good reason: they are fast, lightweight, and fulfil their function. I, on the other hand, might have an unfinished gestalt or two: I want to feel the full power of the computer when serving my web pages, to be able to do fun stuff that is beyond static pages. I need that freedom that comes with a full programming language at your disposal. I want to program my own web server (in Clojure, sorry everybody else).</p>
<h1 id="existing-options">Existing options</h1>
<p>All this led me on a quest for a statistics solution that would uniquely fit my needs. Google Analytics was out: bloated, not privacy-friendly, terrible UX, Google is evil, etc.</p>

<p>Some other JS solution might’ve been possible, but still questionable: SaaS? Paid? Will they be around in 10 years? Self-host? Are their cookies GDPR-compliant? How to count RSS feeds?</p>
<p>Nginx has access logs, so I tried server-side statistics that feed off those (namely, Goatcounter). Easy to set up, but then I needed to create domains for them, manage accounts, monitor the process, and it wasn’t even performant enough on my server/request volume!</p>
<h1 id="my-solution">My solution</h1>
<p>So I ended up building my own. You are welcome to join, if your constraints are similar to mine. This is how it looks:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/clj-simple-stats/screenshot@2x.webp"></figure>
<p>It’s pretty basic, but does a few things that were important to me.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Extremely easy to set up. And I mean it as a feature.</p>
<p>Just add our middleware to your Ring stack and get everything automatically: collecting and reporting.</p>
<pre><code>(def app
  (-&gt; routes
    ...
    (ring.middleware.params/wrap-params)
    (ring.middleware.cookies/wrap-cookies)
    ...
    (clj-simple-stats.core/wrap-stats))) ;; &lt;-- just add this</code></pre>
<p>It’s zero setup in the best sense: nothing to configure, nothing to monitor, minimal dependency. It starts to work immediately and doesn’t ask anything from you, ever.</p>
<p>See, you already have your web server, why not reuse all the setup you did for it anyway?</p>
<h2 id="request-types">Request types</h2>
<p>We distinguish between request types. In my case, I am only interested in live people, so I count them separately from RSS feed requests, favicon requests, redirects, wrong URLs, and bots. Bots are particularly active these days. Gotta get that AI training data from somewhere.</p>
<p>RSS feeds are live people in a sense, so extra work was done to count them properly. Same reader requesting <code>feed.xml</code> 100 times in a day will only count as one request.</p>
<p>Hosted RSS readers often report user count in User-Agent, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Feedly/1.0 (+http://www.feedly.com/fetcher.html; 457 subscribers; like FeedFetcher-Google)

Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; BazQux/2.4; +https://bazqux.com/fetcher; 6 subscribers)

Feedbin feed-id:1373711 - 142 subscribers</code></pre>
<p>My personal respect and thank you to everybody on this list. I see you.</p>

<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>
<p>Visualization is important, and so is choosing the correct graph type. This is wrong:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/clj-simple-stats/goat@2x.webp"></figure>
<p>Continuous line suggests interpolation. It reads like between 1 visit at 5am and 11 visits at 6am there were points with 2, 3, 5, 9 visits in between. Maybe 5.5 visits even! That is not the case.</p>
<p>This is how a semantically correct version of that graph should look:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/clj-simple-stats/graph@2x.webp"></figure>
<p>Some attention was also paid to having reasonable labels on axes. You won’t see something like 117, 234, 10875. We always choose round numbers appropriate to the scale: 100, 200, 500, 1K etc.</p>
<p>Goes without saying that all graphs have the same vertical scale and syncrhonized horizontal scroll.</p>
<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
<p>We don’t offer much (as I don’t need much), but you can narrow reports down by page, query, referrer, user agent, and any date slice.</p>
<h2 id="not-implemented-yet">Not implemented (yet)</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have some insights into “What was this spike caused by?”</p>
<p>Some basic breakdown by country would be nice. I do have IP addresses (for what they are worth), but I need a way to package GeoIP into some reasonable size (under 1 Mb, preferably; some loss of resolution is okay).</p>
<p>Finally, one thing I am really interested in is “Who wrote about me?” I do have referrers, only question is how to separate signal from noise.</p>
<p>Performance. DuckDB is a sport: it compresses data and runs column queries, so storing extra columns per row doesn’t affect query performance. Still, each dashboard hit is a query across the entire database, which at this moment (~3 years of data) sits around 600 MiB. I definitely need to look into building some pre-calculated aggregates.</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get">How to get</h2>
<p>Head to <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/clj-simple-stats">github.com/tonsky/clj-simple-stats</a> and follow the instructions:</p>

<p>Let me know what you think! Is it usable to you? What could be improved?</p>
<p>P.S. You can try the live example at <a href="https://tonsky.me/stats">tonsky.me/stats</a>. The data was imported from Nginx access logs, which I turned on and off on a few occasions, so it’s a bit spotty. Still, it should give you a general idea.</p>
