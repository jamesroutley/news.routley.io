    <h1>PicoMEM by FreddyV – All in One 8-Bit ISA Expansion Card</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tab-description" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-title-description">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The PicoMEM is an 8-bit ISA expansion card based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller.  It offers a ton of features and aims to be an all-in-one solution for ISA-based vintage PCs.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An integrated bootable ROM allows in-system configuration and booting from any vintage system with Option ROM support. Press S at boot to configure and select disk images, memory settings and more.</li>
<li>Built-in MicroSD card reader to store multiple floppy and hard drive images (disk .img files).</li>
<li>Up to 128Kb of conventional RAM with no wait state. Up to 1MB conventional RAM with 6-wait states.</li>
<li>4MB of EMS memory supported by current drivers.</li>
<li>USB Mouse &amp; Joystick Support – USB support requires a Micro USB OTG hub, such as this one: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVXVLSNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVXVLSNS</a></li>
<li>NE2000 Network Support emulation is now in Beta! It works through the integrated Wi-Fi module on the RP2040.  No external antenna is supported, so some computer cases may greatly reduce the signal strength.</li>
<li>Easily updgrade the firmware as updates come out. Copy a single file over to the PicoMEM with a Micro USB cable, and it will automatically reboot and run the updated firmware.</li>
<li>Cards are preset to ROM address 0xD000 to allow them to coexist with XTIDE BIOS on existing CF adapters.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the PicoMEM is in an advanced and functioning state, it is still a work in progress.  There are several caveats and known issues on various systems.  Notably, the Tandy 1000 series of machines is currently not compatible.  Please check the Github link below before ordering, changes are happening frequently and the list is being updated as issues are found and resolved.</p>
<p>The project is under active development by a great number of contributors, as well as the projects’ originator, the very talented Freddy Vetele.</p>
