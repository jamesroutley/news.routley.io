      <span>Abstract:</span>  Data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, require websites and
embedded third-parties, especially advertisers, to seek user consent before
they can collect and process user data. Only when the users opt in, can these
entities collect, process, and share user data. Websites typically incorporate
Consent Management Platforms (CMPs), such as OneTrust and CookieBot, to solicit
and convey user consent to the embedded advertisers, with the expectation that
the consent will be respected. However, neither the websites nor the regulators
currently have any mechanism to audit advertisers&#39; compliance with the user
consent, i.e., to determine if advertisers indeed do not collect, process, and
share user data when the user opts out.
