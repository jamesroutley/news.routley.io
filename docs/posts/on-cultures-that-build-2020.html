<p><span><strong><span>E</span>nding his decade of silence,</strong> the voice of Marc Andreessen rises from the dust, trumpeting forth a rousing <i>cri de coeur</i>: “<b><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It is time to build</a>.”</b></span></p>



<blockquote><p><span><span>Already an important part of the public health agenda, organizing the state and local public health communities and their resources quickly became a vital component in the struggle against the epidemic. Again, the local populace often responded to these needs, creating new bodies or enhancing the authority of those already in existence in order to allow them to manage the epidemic crisis effectively.<b> One common mechanism was the establishment of an emergency committee— sometimes at the state level, other times at the level of the county or city— to deal with the overwhelming need for organization, communication, and cooperation among individuals, agencies, and organizations</b>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>In Illinois, for instance, the Council of National Defense organized the Illinois Influenza Commission, which included representatives from the state and city health departments, the USPHS, the Red Cross, the military, and others. They met regularly, indeed nearly every day, until the worst of the epidemic was over.  In Pennsylvania the State Department of Health created nineteen Epidemic Emergency Districts in the state and mobilized and coordinated the actions of countless “Health, Patriotic, Civic, Religious, Business and Social organizations” as well as the State Guard. </span></span></p><p><span><span>In Washington, D.C., the USPHS Medical Officer in Charge was appointed to oversee the work of a Central Office and four Medical Districts, each with its own Medical Officer, Assistant Directing Nurse, Supervising Nurse, and nursing staff. Cooperating agencies included the District Health Department, the Board of Education, the Visiting Nurse Society, the Washington Diet Kitchen Association, the National Organization for Public Health Nursing, the Children’s Bureau, the Red Cross, other governmental departments, and local churches. </span></span></p></blockquote>



<p><span>Nancy Bristow’s account of the emergency committees created to deal with the flu is much shorter than we would like it to be, as<a href="https://amzn.to/340sdx8"><b> her book</b></a> is not a history of institutions, but public attitudes and perceptions. She makes clear however that the effectiveness of the various committees at disease prevention varied widely (and all were hampered by poor understanding of the flu virus itself). But the effectiveness of the committees is besides the point. <b>When the America of the 1910s faced a national crisis, America responded by creating dozens and dozens of emergency response committees at the local level. </b>These committees included membership of both local governments, federal public health officials, and the leaders of local business, social and religious organizations. They did this <b>fast. </b>And finally, they set these committees up as temporary instruments to address a temporary problem. For the Americans of 1918, this was the obvious response demanded by crisis. <b>Crises demanded organizing at the local level to try and meet the problem head on.</b></span></p>



<blockquote><p><span><span>Anyone living in the United States learns from birth that he must rely on himself to combat the ills and obstacles of life; he looks across at the authority of society with mistrust and anxiety, calling upon such authority only when he cannot do without it. This begins to become apparent when school starts and children, even in their games, submit to the rules they have established and punish offenses following their own definitions. The same spirit prevails in all the affairs of social life. <b>Should an obstacle appear on the public highway and the passage of traffic is halted, neighbors at once form a group to consider the matter; </b>from this improvised assembly an executive authority appears to remedy the inconvenience before anyone has though of the possibility of some other authority already in existence before the one they have just formed…. <b>[In America] there is nothing the human will despairs of attaining through the free action of the combined powers of individuals</b>.</span> </span></p></blockquote>



<p><span>Tocqueville contrasts this unfavorably to the subjects of European kings:</span></p>



<blockquote><p><span><span>There are European nations where the inhabitant sees himself as a kind of settler, indifferent to the fate of the place he inhabits.<b> Major changes happen there without his cooperation, he is even unaware of what precisely has happened; he is suspicious, he hears about events by chance</b>. Worse still, the condition of his village, the policing of his roads, the fate of the churches and the presbyteries scarcely bothers him; <b>he thinks that everything is outside his concern and belongs to a powerful stranger called government.</b> He enjoys what he has as a tenant, without any feeling of ownership or thought of possible improvement.<b> This detachment from his own fate becomes so extreme that, if his own safety or that of his children is threatened, instead of trying to ward off the danger he folds his arms and waits for the entire nation to come to his rescue.</b> </span></span></p></blockquote>



<p><span>Which of these two caricatures sounds more like the Americans of the modern day? </span></p>



<blockquote><p><span><span><span>Problems once handled at lower levels of society by self-governing citizens were passed upwards to impersonal bureaucracies. The largest of these bureaucracies is the federal government. But the problem is not limited to the federal government—these bureaucracies dominate large swaths of American life, from the global conglomerates that dominate our economy to the universities that crown our education system. One of my favorite ways of tracking this has been to </span><a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-decline-of-american-democracy-in.html">look at the ratio of students:school boards.</a><span> School boards used to be as close and as responsive to the interested citizen as politics could get, but many school boards now manage the education of hundreds of thousands of students. At this scale, citizen voice is diminished.</span> </span></span></p><p><span><span><span>While this was happening, the civic and religious institutions that Americans traditionally relied on to manage their own affairs were quietly disappearing. Some organizations, like religious boards, unions, and bowling clubs, declined in number; others, like charities and NGOs, switched from a model of mass participation to a model of mass donations. Add it all together and you find that the percentage of Americans expected to be familiar with </span><i>Robert’s Rules of Order</i><span> shrunk precipitously.</span><span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>



<p><span>It is striking to me how many of the old Silicon Valley builders—people of Andreeson’s generation—were social outcasts in their youth. These people felt estranged from the established <i>corsus honorum </i>of American society. They might not have spent their summer days building tree houses, but they did spend them building things (computers, code, networked communities, etc) on their own initiative. One wonders if their building spirit can long persist now that San Fransisco is flooded with young men and women whose values and experience are more closely tied to the established <i>corsus honorum </i>of the American upper class.</span></p>



<blockquote><p><span><span><b> In the 21st century, the main question in American social life is not “how do we make that happen?” but “how do we get management to take our side?</b> </span></span></p></blockquote>



<p><span><a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2015/09/honor-dignity-victimhood-and-death-of.html">You see this in the difference quite clearly between Black Lives Matters on the one hand and the Civil Rights Movement on the other</a>, but if you reflect on this distinction you will quickly start to see it everywhere. </span></p>



<p><span>6. So why then is China, et. al. able to build things? Am I seriously arguing that they are less managed and bureaucratized than we are?</span></p>



<p><span>7. The real question is whether <i>we </i>will be able to rebuild a building culture. I believe it is possible; Silicon Valley has shown that building sub-cultures can persist even in the face of general malaise. I am afraid this is a long term project. It may involve wrenching cultural authority out of the hands of existing arbiters and pulling it towards places like Silicon Valley, where men and women have not forgotten how to get things done. This may require building up the sort of cultural, media, and political infrastructure that exists along the Acela Corridor, just divorced from the patronage networks that currently keep things anchored in Washington and New York. Tech titans who care about these things should begin thinking seriously about what it would take to begin political and social experiments in the places closest to them: San Fransisco and its metro, other towns and cities in the state, perhaps California itself.</span></p>



<p>This post is already long; more thoughts on what it takes to build new cultures will be reserved for the future.</p>
