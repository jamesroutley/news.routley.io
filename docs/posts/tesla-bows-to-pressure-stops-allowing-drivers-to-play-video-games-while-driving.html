    <h1>Tesla bows to pressure, stops allowing drivers to play video games while driving</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p>Under pressure from US auto safety regulators, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Tesla</a> has agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.</p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the company will send out a software update over the internet so the function called “Passenger Play” will be locked and won’t work while vehicles are in motion.</p><p>The move comes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/22/us-investigates-claim-tesla-video-games-driving" data-link-name="in body link">one day after</a> the agency announced it would open a formal investigation into distracted driving concerns about Tesla’s video games, some of which could be played while cars are being driven.</p><p>An agency spokeswoman said in a statement Thursday that the change came after regulators discussed concerns about the system with Tesla.</p><p>The statement says NHTSA regularly talks about infotainment screens with all automakers. A message was left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.</p><p>The agency says its investigation of Tesla’s feature will continue even with the update.</p><p>“The Vehicle Safety Act prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including technologies that distract drivers from driving safely,” NHTSA’s statement said.</p><p>The agency said it assesses how manufacturers identify and guard against distraction hazards due to misuse or intended use of screens and other convenience technology.</p><p>The agency announced Wednesday that it would formally investigate Tesla’s screens. The probe covers about 580,000 Tesla Models S, X, Y and 3 from the 2017 through 2022 model years.</p></div></div></div>
