<p>The <b>Cacowards</b> are an annual feature at <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doomworld" title="Doomworld">Doomworld</a>, released on <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Timeline#1993" title="Timeline">Doom&#39;s birthday</a>, to recognize the year&#39;s best <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Modifications" title="Category:Modifications">mods</a>.  <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Stephen_Browning_(Scuba_Steve)" title="Stephen Browning (Scuba Steve)">Stephen Browning (Scuba Steve)</a> is credited with the original concept.  The series started in 2004 with the so-called 11th edition, which attempted to replicate the success of similar articles in the previous year&#39;s <i>10 Years of Doom</i> celebration, the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Top_100_WADs_of_All_Time" title="Top 100 WADs of All Time">Top 100 WADs of All Time</a> and the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Top_10_Infamous_WADs" title="Top 10 Infamous WADs">Top 10 Infamous WADs</a>.  The 28th (actually 18th) installment appeared in 2021.
</p><p>The award categories have gradually evolved.  As of 2016, all years have included:
</p>
<ul><li> At least ten overall <b>Winners</b>.</li>
<li> One or more <b>Multiplayer Awards</b> (formerly <i>Best DM Level</i>) for outstanding <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Multiplayer" title="Multiplayer">multiplayer</a> maps.</li>
<li> The <b>Mapper of the Year</b>.</li>
<li> The <b>Mordeth Award</b> for a major release with a long development cycle (named after the notoriously delayed <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Top_10_Infamous_WADs#The_list" title="Top 10 Infamous WADs">Mordeth E2</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Most editions have also included:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Runners-Up</b> lists of varying lengths.</li>
<li> The <b>Mockaward</b> for an outstanding <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Joke_WAD" title="Joke WAD">joke WAD</a> (named after <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Mockery" title="Mockery">Mockery</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Until 2014, the awards also included a one-off honorable mention with a name matching the WAD&#39;s theme, such as the <i><a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Cacowards_2006#Escher_Award" title="Cacowards 2006">Escher Award</a></i> in 2006 and <i><a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Cacowards_2012#What_The_Pope.3F.21" title="Cacowards 2012">What The Pope?!</a></i> in 2012.
Each publication is five to nine pages long, including a foreword with a title card parodying a recent piece of popular media or event.  Various year-in-review notes usually appear in sidebars, such as <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Memorial" title="Category:Memorial">epitaphs</a>, or sardonic &#34;anniversaries&#34; involving the writers&#39; own projects.
</p><p>A nomination thread at the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doomworld_forums" title="Doomworld forums">Doomworld forums</a> runs all year long, listing and discussing candidates.  However, there is no formal voting and the article writers make the ultimate decisions on all recipients.

<p>The first Cacowards was the idea and creation of <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Stephen_Browning_(Scuba_Steve)" title="Stephen Browning (Scuba Steve)">Stephen Browning (Scuba Steve)</a>, with assistance from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Mike_Lightner_(Mancubus_II)" title="Mike Lightner (Mancubus II)">Mike Lightner (Mancubus II)</a> who hosted a voting forum and created the graphics, and a foreword by <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Mike_Watson_(Cyb)" title="Mike Watson (Cyb)">Mike Watson (Cyb)</a>. The result is an article of five pages, listing, in no particular order, ten mods deemed to have been the best of the year, and completing it with some additional awards: <b>Best DM Level</b>, <b>Mordeth Award</b> for longest development time, <b>Mockaward</b> for the &#34;best comedy wad of the year&#34;, a <b>Mapper of the Year</b> for the map author whose contributions were the most significant this year, three <b>Runners-Up</b>, one <b>Honorable Mention</b>, and the controversial award of the <b>Worst Wad</b>. To fill space in the side column which contains the navigation links to the other parts of the article and presents the runners-up, some &#34;Did you know?&#34; factoids were inserted on the last page.

<p>The second Cacowards followed the formula of the first, still written by Steven Browning and illustrated by Mike Lightner. The foreword was this time written by <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Bill_Koch_(Bloodshedder)" title="Bill Koch (Bloodshedder)">Bill Koch (Bloodshedder)</a>. There were only two runners-up this year, and no honorable mention, but one mod was given the <b>What the Hell!?</b> mention. Some additional content started to make its way to the side-column, such as a &#34;WAD scramble&#34;, and the &#34;Did You Know?&#34; started making a tradition of marking the anniversaries of <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Action_Doom" title="Action Doom">Action Doom</a> and pointing out that Mordeth and Millennium were still not released.

<p>Continuing on the formula honed by the second and third Cacowards, the fourth of the series had two runners-up and no extra category this time. The &#34;Best DM Level&#34; category was renamed <b>Best Multiplayer Level</b>. It was the first where Scuba Steve would announce that this installment was probably the last he wrote, and the first where he was joined by another writer for the awards themselves, in this case <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Dean_Joseph_(deathz0r)" title="Dean Joseph (deathz0r)">Dean Joseph (deathz0r)</a>.

<p>The eighth Cacowards was the first not to be written by Scuba Steve; instead it was written by Ryan Nematollahi (hobbs), with a couple of contributions by Sarah Mancuso. With this came a few changes, notably the disappearance of the &#34;Worst Wad&#34; category because it was considered inappropriate to appear to reward people for uploading low-quality work. The &#34;Mockaward&#34; category also disappeared this year. Instead, a new category for <b>Best Gameplay</b> was introduced, echoing the &#34;Boomstick&#34; mention from the 2008 awards; and a new mention was made for <b>Honoring a Newcomer</b>. In addition, a <b>Consolation Prize</b> was given for <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom64_EX" title="Doom64 EX">Doom64 EX</a>, a work that could not fit any category.

<p>The ninth installment of the Cacowards was delayed by Steven Browning&#39;s successor having left without writing them or even warning anybody that he would not write them. After some discussion on the Doomworld forums, the community selected a team made of <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Xaser" title="Xaser">Xaser</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Alfonzo" title="Alfonzo">Alfonzo</a>, and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Kmxexii" title="Kmxexii">kmxexii</a> to take the hold.

<p>The tenth episode of the series saw more changes. The &#34;Best Multiplayer&#34; category turned into its own page with three <b>Multiplayer Awards</b>, and before the awards themselves a new page was inserted for the <b>Espi Award for Lifetime Achievement</b>, which honors someone for their contributions over an extended time, instead of a single year. To write all that, the team from the ninth Cacowards were joined by Sarah Mancuso (esselfortium) and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Boris_Klime%C5%A1_(dew)" title="Boris Klimeš (dew)">Boris Klimeš (dew)</a>. &#34;Honoring a newcomer&#34; was renamed <b>Most promising newcomer</b> and was awarded to three different persons.
