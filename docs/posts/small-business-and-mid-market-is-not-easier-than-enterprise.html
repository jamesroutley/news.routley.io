  <p>It&#39;s a widely held misconception that targeting small and mid-market sectors is inherently &#39;easier&#39; than engaging with enterprise clients.</p><p>While this holds some truth regarding acquiring customers, it overlooks the grave significance of maintaining them. Both — acquiring and maintaining — are essential to demonstrate proof of product/market fit.</p><p><em>Let me explain …</em></p><p><strong>Small Business: Easy Come, Easy Go</strong></p><p>In this sector, <strong>the user and the buyer are often the same</strong> – facilitating rapid sales cycles and product feedback.</p><p>However, small businesses require a high-velocity motion due to their smaller budgets (usually ~$10K/year). This approach demands an ‘unfair advantage’ in a net-new marketing tactic, word-of-mouth, community access, etc.</p><p>The product is under more scrutiny since companies where the user and buyer are the same tend to be less forgiving.</p><p>It&#39;s not often discussed, but small businesses exhibit significant diversity. Their smaller team sizes typically lead to fewer rules, processes, and structures (i<em>.e., wild, wild west</em>). Additionally, business owners optimize for various motivations, including lifestyle, growth, and acquisition, creating a diverse and dynamic environment.</p><p><strong>Identifying repeatable market themes and insights is the most challenging here.</strong></p><p>Additionally (and most obviously), the high churn rate, driven by cash flow volatility and business closures, adds unpredictability to this sector.</p><p><em>It&#39;s worth noting that serving venture-backed startups differs from typical small businesses as they have somewhat clearer growth/speed incentives and ‘timelines but certainly similar churn challenges.</em></p><p><strong>Mid-Market: The Muddled Middle</strong></p><p>In the mid-market, <strong>the user and the buyer are typically one step removed from one another (N-1)</strong>.</p><p>Spend enough time in the mid-market, and you&#39;ll realize it’s more or less a fork in determining if your approach leans more towards <strong>higher-end small businesses</strong> — or — <strong>lower-end enterprises</strong>.</p><p>For example, sales cycles can vary widely ~60 days to 6+ months, as do contract values $15K-$50K.</p><p>Startups must initially focus on <strong>high velocity</strong> or <strong>high contract value</strong> (i.e., multimillion-dollar expansions) to grow at venture speed.</p><p>Mid-market companies often operate with more limited expansion budgets, fewer technical resources (<em>which are often outsourced - again depending on company size</em>), and less defined clarity on roles and responsibilities, making it harder to navigate than in small businesses or enterprises (i.e., the bookends).</p><p><span data-text-attribute-id="44cb21ff-41a1-4439-b397-0af4993928cc">In short, the mid-market is an amalgamation, often best approached by dividing the group into two buckets — (1) upper-end of small businesses OR (2) lower-end enterprise.</span></p><p><strong>Enterprise: Where Buying Processes and Speed to Traction <em>Can</em> Conflict At Early Stages</strong></p><p>There are several <strong>layers between the user and the buyer</strong> in the enterprise segment, which complicates the sales process, making it labyrinthine.</p><p>Enterprises promise high initial deal values ($75K - $200K) and substantial $MM expansion opportunities — making the effort very much worth it!</p><p>Their well-established brand names lend social credibility, and their tolerance for slight product imperfections (to a certain extent) allows for more time to sort and nail.</p><p>Of course, the lengthy buying process can conflict with the fast-paced experimentation characteristic of early-stage startups. Moreover, there is an expected need for custom services and support. </p><p><strong>What&#39;s often overlooked are the two layers of product/market fit in enterprises: (1) buyer and (2) user. This makes onboarding and ongoing support critical for unlocking user value. Without close management, expansion beyond the initial group is unlikely.</strong></p><p>Many startups struggle to exceed the initial contract value of ~$100K/year following ‘the land’, making capturing the true value of $MM expand from this market very challenging.</p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p><p>Whether targeting small business, mid-market, or enterprise, it&#39;s imperative to acknowledge and address each segment&#39;s dynamics.</p><p>Success is not about finding an &#39;easier&#39; path but mastering the distinct games and deciding which is best for you, your market skills, and the product you’ve built.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>For small businesses, the game revolves around rapid learning, unlocking high velocity, and understanding how to ascend into enterprise over time.</p></li><li><p>For the mid-market, the strategy can be somewhat confusing, but it is crucial to determine where the pull falls on the spectrum. Are they a closer fit with higher-end small business OR lean more towards lower-end enterprises?</p></li><li><p>For enterprises, the emphasis is on unlocking $MM expansion by around year 3.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, on a long enough time horizon, every startup evolves into an &#39;enterprise startup,&#39; which means they either</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>render the incumbent enterprise obsolete </p><p>OR</p></li><li><p>ensure the enterprise doesn&#39;t become obsolete</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://www.jjellyfish.com/articles/breakdown-of-us-businesses" target="_blank"><strong><em>HERE’s</em></strong></a><em> a link going deeper into the total count of U.S. small business, mid-market, and enterprise data.</em></p>
