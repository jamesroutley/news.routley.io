Even ULA&#39;s details about the launch are limited, with the info provided comparable to when the rocket company flies classified spy satellites for the U.S. government.</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107053273"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107053273" data-vilynx-id="7000244303" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106870221-1618839940004-AmazonInSpace.jpg?v=1666892498&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="How Amazon&#39;s Project Kuiper is taking on SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellite internet"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Last year, Amazon announced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/amazon-signs-rocket-deal-with-blue-origin-arianespace-ula-for-project-kuiper-internet-satellites.html">the biggest corporate rocket deal in the industry&#39;s history</a> to launch Kuiper satellites, signing launch contracts with ULA, Arianespace, and Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin. As part of that deal, Amazon expects to pay about $7.4 billion for Kuiper launches over the next five years. </p><p>It has booked 77 launches – deals that include options for more launches when needed – from that trio of companies to deploy the satellites fast enough to meet regulatory requirements. That massive purchase has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/bezos-snubbed-musk-spacex-satellite-contract-lawsuit.html">come under scrutiny from an Amazon shareholder lawsuit</a>, which alleges the company snubbed SpaceX for valuable satellite launch contracts because of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/">Jeff Bezos&#39;</a> personal rivalry with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>Amazon is playing catch up to SpaceX, which has grown its Starlink satellite internet service to more than 2 million customers. Crucially, SpaceX says it is<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/13/spacex-no-longer-taking-losses-to-produce-starlink-satellite-antennas.html"> no longer absorbing the cost of the Starlink antennas</a> it sells with the service, and the more than 5,000 satellites its launched so far now serve consumer, enterprise, and government customers.</p><p>Earlier this week, Amazon reiterated that its first production Kuiper satellites are on track to launch in the first half of next year – with plans to begin beta testing the network with customers by the end of 2024.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107208191" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>The &#34;ultra-compact&#34; version of the Project Kuiper</p><p>Amazon</p></div></div></div><div><p>Protoflight represents an &#34;end-to-end&#34; test of Kuiper.
