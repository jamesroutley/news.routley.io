            <p><b>TL;DR:</b> A native 3D generative model built on a <i><b>unified Structured Latent representation</b></i> and <i><b>Rectified Flow Transformers</b></i>,

            <div id="abstract"><p>
                We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation.
                The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (<span>SL</span><span>AT</span>) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes.
                This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model,
                comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding.</p></div>
            <p>
                <i><b>NOTE:</b> The appearance and geometry shown in this page are rendered from 3D Gaussians and meshes, respectively.
                GLB files are extracted by baking appearance from 3D Gaussians to meshes.</i>

                We introduce Structured LATents (<span>SL</span><span>AT</span>),
                a unified 3D latent representation for high-quality, versatile 3D generation. <span>SL</span><span>AT</span>
                marries sparse structures with powerful visual representations. It defines local latents on active voxels intersecting the object&#39;s surface.
                The local latents are encoded by fusing and processing image features from densely rendered views of the 3D asset, while attaches them onto active voxels.
                These features, derived from powerful pretrained vision encoders, capture detailed geometric and visual characteristics, complementing the coarse structure provided by the active voxels.
                Different decoders can then be applied to map <span>SL</span><span>AT</span> to diverse 3D representations of high quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building on <span>SL</span><span>AT</span>, we train a family of large 3D generation models, dubbed <span>T</span><span>RELLIS</span>, with text prompts or images as conditions.
                A two stage pipeline is applied which first generates the sparse structure of <span>SL</span><span>AT</span>, followed by generating the latent vectors for non-empty cells.
                We employ rectified flow transformers as our backbone models and adapt them properly to handle the sparsity in <span>SL</span><span>AT</span>.
                We train Trellis with up to 2 billion parameters on a large dataset of carefully-collected 3D assets.
                <span>T</span><span>RELLIS</span> can create high-quality 3D assets with detailed geometry and vivid texture, significantly surpassing previous methods.
                Moreover, it can easily generate 3D assets with different output formats to meet diverse downstream requirements.
