    <h1>The percentage of Show HN posts is increasing, but their scores are decreasing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Last update: 2026-01-14</p>
<p>Recently, I felt like I was seeing more “Show HN” stories, and many of which were generated with LLMs. So I analyzed the data to see if that was true. Also I included the average score per month to see if people enjoy seeing them (because I don’t :P).</p>
<h2 id="charts">Charts</h2>
<p>Stories in 2026 was omitted. 1) It’s only 13 days, 2) Scores are not stable yet.</p>
<p>Left axis: <code>show_hn_ratio</code>(<code>show_hn / story * 100</code>)</p>
<p>Right axis: <code>average_show_hn_score</code> and <code>average_story_score</code></p>

<h3 id="percentage">Percentage</h3>
<p>For about ten years (2012~2022), the percentage of Show HN stories was around 2-3%. Then, with the appearance of LLMs that can code, it’s been increasing. Claude Code and Cursor 1.0 accelerated it even more. As of December 2025, over 12% of all stories are Show HNs. It’s safe to say that there is a correlation between the increase in Show HN posts and LLM. People can create great things even if they don’t know how to code at all.</p>
<h3 id="scores">Scores</h3>
<p>Show HN stories used to receive similar scores (around 15-18) to those of all stories until 2023~2024. However, it’s been declining while percentage of them are going up. As of December 2025, the average Show HN score is 10 points lower (9.04 vs 19.53).</p>
<p>Does it mean LLM-generated Show HNs are lower quality? I’m not sure. Maybe people are tired of seeing too many Show HNs.</p>
<p>Also I have no idea why the average score was increased in 2022. A lot of new users?</p>
<h2 id="data-and-codes">Data and codes</h2>
<p>You can find python code and csv in <a href="https://github.com/plastic041/hackernews">https://github.com/plastic041/hackernews</a>.</p>
<p>I exported <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news">BigQuery hacker news data</a> to csv using this query:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>SELECT</span></span>
<span><span>  `time`</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  `title`</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  `type`</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  `score`</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  `id`</span></span>
<span><span>FROM</span></span>
<span><span>  `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full`</span></span>
<span><span>WHERE</span></span>
<span><span>  (</span><span>`type`</span><span> IN</span><span> (</span><span>&#39;story&#39;</span><span>)) </span><span>and</span><span> title </span><span>IS NOT NULL</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>type</code> field in BigQuery does not have a <code>show_hn</code> attribute like the Algolia API, so I lowercased titles and filtered using <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/dev/reference/expressions/api/polars.Expr.str.starts_with.html"><code>starts_with(&#34;show_hn: &#34;)</code></a> to determine if a post is a Show HN story.</p>
<p>I didn’t commit to the repo the original CSV because it was too big (~400 MB) but you can download it from BigQuery for free (I didn’t set billing account). I ran SQL above, exported it to google drive, and downloaded it.</p>
<p>I would like to analyze the percentage of Show HN stories generated with LLMs but I couldn’t find the way to do this, because many Show HN stories don’t mention that they’ve used LLMs in their text.</p>
<p>I’ll try to update this article every few months.</p> </div></div>
