    <h2>LLM data</h2>

    <p>
      It is well understood that LLMs thrive on high-quality data. We have the largest collection of books, papers, magazines, etc in the world, which are some of the highest quality text sources.
    </p>

    <h3>Unique scale and range</h3>
    
    <p>
      Our collection contains over a hundred million files, including academic journals, textbooks, and magazines. We achieve this scale by combining large existing repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of our source collections are already available in bulk (Sci-Hub, and parts of Libgen). Other sources we liberated ourselves. <a href="https://annas-archive.org/datasets">Datasets</a> shows a full overview.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our collection includes millions of books, papers, and magazines from before the e-book era. Large parts of this collection have already been OCR’ed, and already have little internal overlap.
    </p>

    <h3>How we can help</h3>

    <p>
      We would love to help you train or finetune your LLMs. We can help with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>High-speed access to our collection</li>
      <li>OCR</li>
      <li>Removing overlap (deduplication)</li>
      <li>Text and metadata extraction</li>
      <li>Advice from domain experts</li>
    </ul>
