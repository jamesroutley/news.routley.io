Creed said, &#39;Great.&#39; Astrud wasn&#39;t a professional singer, but she was the only victim sitting there that night.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Although she had little time to prepare, Gilberto&#39;s detached but sultry vocals perfectly captured the vibe of a &#34;tall and tan and young and lovely&#34; girl who turns the heads of everyone she passes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The song was an instant hit and went on to win the Grammy Award for record of the year. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gilberto wasn&#39;t credited on the track (which was released under the name Stan Getz and João Gilberto) and she only received the standard $120 session fee for her performance.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, it was the springboard for a successful solo career, beginning with 1965&#39;s The Astrud Gilberto Album, where she re-joined Ipanema&#39;s co-writer, Antonio Carlos Jobim, to record a suite of Brazilian standards.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/astrud-gilberto-girl-from-ipanema-b2006879.html">Speaking to The Independent last year</a>, her son Marcelo claimed that Gilberto struggled with the objectification she received from the press, and often had to fight misogyny in the music industry.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Writing on her website in the early 2000s, Gilberto recalled how several people had claimed responsibility for her success with Ipanema, with Stan Getz saying he had rescued her from being a &#34;housewife&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Nothing is further from the truth,&#34; she wrote. &#34;I guess it may them look &#39;important&#39; to have been the one that had the &#39;wisdom&#39; to recognize talent or &#39;potential&#39; in my singing… I suppose I should feel flattered by the importance that they lend to this, but I can&#39;t help but to feel annoyed at the fact that they resorted to lying!&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the 1970s, she began writing her own songs, as showcased on albums like Astrud Gilberto Now (1972) and That Girl From Ipanema (1977). </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On the latter, she achieved a lifetime ambition by recording one of her songs, Far Away, as a duet with legendary jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alongside recording, she developed a second strand to her career, acting in the films The Hanged Man and Get Yourself a College Girl and recording the soundtrack for The Deadly Affair, arranged by Quincy Jones.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the early 1980s, Gilberto formed a group that featured her son Maeclo on bass and toured the world, but she largely avoided playing in Brazil, where she felt she had not been afforded the recognition she deserved.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Brazil turned its back on her,&#34; Marcelo told The Independent. &#34;She achieved fame abroad at a time when this was considered treasonous by the press.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In Europe, she recorded an album of samba classics with James Last; and George Michael sought her out to duet on a version of Desafinado for charity album Red Hot + Rio in 1996.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She recorded her final album, Jungle, in 2002, after which she announced an indefinite hiatus from public performance, having previously said that being &#34;close to the public was frightening&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The singer devoted most of her later years to campaigning against animal cruelty, but the legacy of her first recording lived on, with everyone from Frank Sinatra and Madonna to Amy Winehouse and Nat King Cole offering their own interpretations of Gilberto&#39;s performance.</p></div></article></div></div>
