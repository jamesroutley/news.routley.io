    <h1>Type 2 diabetes rates in US youth rose 62% after Covid pandemic began</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span><span>Rates of new-onset type 2 diabetes climbed 62%—and type 1 diabetes increased 17%—among US youth after the COVID-19 pandemic began, especially in Black and Hispanic children, according to a </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809781"><span><span>study</span></span></a><span><span> published yesterday in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For the study, Kaiser Permanente researchers tracked rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among health system members aged 0 to 19 years in southern California with no history of diabetes from January 2016 to December 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&#34;Youth-onset diabetes is a serious chronic health condition, placing individuals at risk for early complications, comorbidities, and excess mortality, in particular among those who develop type 2 diabetes and those from racial and ethnic minority groups such as non-Hispanic Black individuals,&#34; the study authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Kids aged 10 to 19 years especially affected</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Over the study period, 1,200 youth were diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, 1,100 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 63 patients with &#34;other&#34; diabetes. Type 1 diabetes rates climbed from 18.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2016 to 2019 to 22.4 per 100,000 person-years from 2020 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Relative to 2016 to 2019, in 2020 to 2021, the incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes was 17% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.17). The incidence was higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR,1.17), boys (IRR, 1.18), and Hispanic patients (1.21). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates of type 2 diabetes were 62% higher (IRR, 1.62) in 2020 to 2021 than in 2016 to 2019. The incidence of type 2 diabetes rose from 14.8 to 24.7 per 100,000 person-years over that time.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates were higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR, 1.63), girls (IRR, 1.44), boys (IRR, 1.83), Black patients (IRR, 1.95), Hispanic patients (IRR, 1.61), and other/unknown racial groups (IRR, 2.96). The incidence rate differences followed similar patterns for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Black, Hispanic patients had heavy diabetes burden</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>By quarter, rates of type 1 diabetes fluctuated seasonally but climbed among patients aged 10 to 19 years in Q1 of 2021. Among youth with type 2 diabetes, a spike in incidence occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, especially among Black and Hispanic patients, which the researchers said suggests that they bore a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>Diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods.</span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span>Sociodemographic factors, average body mass index, fasting and random glucose levels, and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> concentrations didn&#39;t change from 2016 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The authors noted that research has shown that coronavirus-binding via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors damages islet cells in the pancreas and may lead to diabetes. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&#34;Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been noted in patients with COVID-19 infection without prior indicators of diabetes risk,&#34; they wrote. &#34;Additionally, diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods.&#34; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The findings, they added, point to the need for future research on physiologic and behavioral risk factors for new-onset diabetes before and during the pandemic.</span></span></span></p></div></div>
