    <h1>Launch HN: Recall.ai (YC W20) – API for meeting recordings and transcripts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we&#39;re David and Amanda from Recall.ai (<a href="https://www.recall.ai">https://www.recall.ai</a>). Today we’re launching our Desktop Recording SDK, a way to get meeting data without a bot in the meeting: <a href="https://www.recall.ai/product/desktop-recording-sdk">https://www.recall.ai/product/desktop-recording-sdk</a>. It’s our biggest release in quite a while so we thought we’d finally do our Launch HN :)</p><p>Here’s a demo that shows it producing a transcript from a meeting, followed by examples in code: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4croAGGiKTA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4croAGGiKTA</a> . API docs are at <a href="https://docs.recall.ai/">https://docs.recall.ai/</a>.</p><p>Back in W20, our first product was an API that lets you send a bot participant into a meeting. This gives developers access to audio/video streams and other data in the meeting. Today, this API powers most of the meeting recording products on the market.</p><p>Recently, meeting recording through a desktop form factor instead of a bot has become popular. Many products like Notion and ChatGPT have added desktop recording functionality, and LLMs have made it easier to work with unstructured transcripts. But it’s actually hard to reliably record meetings at scale with a desktop app, and most developers who want to add recording functionality don’t want to build all this infrastructure.</p><p>Doing a basic recording with just the microphone and system audio is fairly straightforward since you can just use the system APIs. But it gets a lot harder when you want to capture speaker names, produce a video recording, get real-time data, or run this in production at large scale:</p><p>- Capturing speaker names involves using accessibility APIs to screen-scrape the video conference window to monitor who is speaking at what time. When video conferencing platforms change their UI, we must ship a change immediately, so this keeps working.</p><p>- Producing a video recording that is clean, and doesn’t capture the video conferencing platform UI involves detecting the participant tiles, cropping them out, and compositing them together into a clean video recording.</p><p>- Because the desktop recording code runs on end-user machines, we need to make it as efficient as possible. This means writing highly platform-optimized code, taking advantage of hardware encoders when available, and spending a lot of time doing profiling and performance testing.</p><p>Meeting recording has zero margin for failure because if anything breaks, you lose the data forever. Reliability is especially important, which dramatically increases the amount of engineering effort required.</p><p>Our Desktop Recording SDK takes care of all this and lets developers build meeting recording features into their desktop apps, so they can record both video conferences and in-person meetings without a bot.</p><p>We built Recall.ai because we experienced this problem ourselves. At our first startup, we built a tool for product managers that included a meeting recording feature. 70% of our engineering time was taken up by just this feature! We ended up starting Recall.ai to solve this instead. Since then, over 2000 companies use us to power their recording features, e.g. Hubspot for sales call recording, Clickup for their AI note taker. Our users are engineering teams building commercial products for financial services, telehealth, incident management, sales, interviewing, and more. We also power internal tooling for large enterprises.</p><p>Running this sort of infrastructure has led to unexpected technical challenges! For example, we had to debug a 1 in 36 million segfault in our audio encoder (<a href="https://www.recall.ai/blog/debugging-a-1-in-36-000-000-segfault-in-our-audio-encoder">https://www.recall.ai/blog/debugging-a-1-in-36-000-000-segfa...</a>), we encountered a Postgres lock-up that only occurs when you have tens of thousands of concurrent writers (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44490510">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44490510</a>), and we saved over $1M a year on AWS by optimizing the way we shuffle data around between our processes (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42067275">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42067275</a>).</p><p>You can try it here: <a href="https://www.recall.ai">https://www.recall.ai</a>. It&#39;s self-serve with $5 of free credits. Pricing starts at $0.70 for every hour of recording, prorated to the second. We offer volume discounts with scale.</p><p>All data recorded through Recall.ai is the property of our customers, we support 0-day retention, and we don’t train models on customer data.</p><p>We would love your feedback!</p></div></td></div></div>
