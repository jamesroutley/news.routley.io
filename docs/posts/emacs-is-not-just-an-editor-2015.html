The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">editor war</a> between users of the vim editor and the Emacs editor exists since decades. Here is my comment on that as somebody who is using vim <b>and</b> GNU/Emacs intensive on a daily basis.

</p>

<p>

In my opinion, the most dominant advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a> is that it&#39;s not just an editor: it&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">LISP</a> interpreter and thus a very capable highly dynamic platform.

</p>

<p>

The consequence of this fact is dramatically: Emacs runs a very large number of <a href="https://marmalade-repo.org/">third</a> <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/">party</a> <a href="http://melpa.org/">packages</a>. Those packages provide top-of-the-art features for editing but also for non-editing stuff like file management, games, project management, email management, calendar, data processing and visualization, version management, spreadsheets, drawings, or even composing music.

<p>

Other &#34;editors&#34; do offer some few non-editing features as well. However, only Emacs is even used by people who don&#39;t need an editor at all. <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an excellent example of functionality which has almost nothing to do with editing per se and whose enormous capabilities are not matched by any other software solution.

</p>

<p>

Apparently, the <a href="https://eu.startpage.com/do/search?q=%22emacs+is+not+an+editor%22">well known quote</a> &#34;Emacs is not an editor, it&#39;s an operating system&#34; is not just a funny phrase to make you smile - it&#39;s perceived as an opererating system (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iprvi6/mario_lang_emacs_is_very_special_regarding_uis/g4o1fmp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">in a non-technical sense</a>). People like <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/07/transcript-emacs-chat-john-wiegley/">John Wiegley</a> (and <b>many</b> more) are not using many features from applications related to one specific operating system or any other software at all. They basically &#34;live&#34; within Emacs only. They&#39;ve added another abstraction layer on top of their classic operating system. This does provide great abilities whose benefits can&#39;t be understood by most people unfortunately. It&#39;s impossible to explain colors to people who can not see (yet).

</p>

<p>

So: comparing Emacs to an editor is like comparing GNU/Linux to a word processor. It&#39;s an unfair and inadequate comparison for both sides. Those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">stupid editor flame-wars</a> are not worth the time at all.

</p>

<p>

If you need only an editor, great power-tools like <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> are fine as well. Don&#39;t complain that Emacs can be so much more than just an editor.

</p>

Simply use <a href="https://Karl-Voit.at/apps-I-am-using">the best tool for each job</a> <b>deliberately</b>.
