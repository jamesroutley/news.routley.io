    <h1>Ask HN: How to find mentors?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>How do you find mentors? I&#39;m a 30 something engineer who has never had great technical mentors mostly because of working in startups with few experienced engineers. I&#39;ve had many business people mentors over the years but not as many engineering mentors as I&#39;d have liked.</p><p>So how does one go about finding mentors when you do not work closely with them? Is there a better strategy than simply reaching out on email/linkedin and hope for the best?</p></div></div></div>
