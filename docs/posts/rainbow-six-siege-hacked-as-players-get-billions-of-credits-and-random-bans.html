Ubisoft states that issues are being investigated, but has not provided a timeline for recovery.</p><p data-start="1200" data-end="1314">The scale of the outages has further fuelled claims that this is far more serious than routine server instability.</p><h2 data-start="1316" data-end="1360">Ubisoft’s Statement Draws Heavy Criticism</h2><p data-start="1362" data-end="1573">Earlier, the official Rainbow Six account acknowledged that it was aware of an incident affecting the game and said teams were working on a resolution. No mention was made of a security breach, hack, or exploit.</p><blockquote data-theme="dark"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re aware of an incident currently affecting Rainbow Six Siege. Our teams are working on a resolution.</p><p>We will share further updates once available.</p><p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><p data-start="1575" data-end="1835">That wording has been met with heavy backlash from players, many of whom believe Ubisoft is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation. Community responses have accused the publisher of calling it a server issue while core systems appear compromised.</p><p data-start="1837" data-end="1952">Some players also questioned why the game remained online for hours while accounts were being altered in real time.</p><h2 data-start="1954" data-end="2017">Players Report Billions of Credits, Dev Skins, and Ban Chaos</h2><p data-start="2019" data-end="2241">As the incident unfolded, players reported logging in to find their accounts flooded with billions of R6 Credits and Renown, thousands of Alpha Packs, and access to exclusive cosmetics such as developer skins and Glaciers.</p><blockquote data-theme="dark"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Why is nobody talking about what is happening on Siege right now?

Thousands of accounts were reportedly banned and unbanned at random, including those belonging to streamers and high profile players.</p><blockquote data-theme="dark"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rainbow Six is fucked <a href="https://t.co/OZpDXzttOZ">pic.twitter.com/OZpDXzttOZ</a></p><p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004921104721477963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><p data-start="2490" data-end="2752">Prominent Siege creator <strong data-start="2514" data-end="2555"><span><span>KingGeorge</span></span></strong> described the situation as completely broken, warning players not to log in and strongly advising against spending any currency, as it could lead to bans or rollbacks once Ubisoft regains control.</p><blockquote data-theme="dark"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Btw as a side note I would not login right now, definitely don’t spend any credits or renown could lead to a ban.</p><p>— KingGeorge (@KingGeorge) <a href="https://twitter.com/KingGeorge/status/2004906746071191796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><h2 data-start="2754" data-end="2802">Community Expects Rollbacks, Fears Punishment</h2><p data-start="2804" data-end="3087">With authentication and account systems affected, many players now expect Ubisoft to roll accounts back to a previous state. However, fears remain that innocent players could still face penalties, especially those who unknowingly spent credits thinking the issue was a visual glitch.</p><p data-start="3089" data-end="3253">Others argue that banning a significant portion of the active player base would be disastrous, adding further pressure on Ubisoft to handle the aftermath carefully.</p><p data-start="3255" data-end="3386">The lack of clear communication has only intensified frustration, with players demanding transparency about what actually happened.</p><h2 data-start="3388" data-end="3423">What Players Should Do Right Now</h2><p data-start="3425" data-end="3625">Until Ubisoft confirms the issue is fully resolved and explains the cause, players are strongly advised to stay offline, avoid logging in, and do not spend any credits or Renown if access is restored.</p><p data-start="3627" data-end="3891">With Rainbow Six Siege’s core services offline worldwide and player accounts potentially compromised, this incident could have lasting implications for the game if not handled properly. Ubisoft is expected to provide further updates as its investigation continues.</p> </span></section></article></div>
