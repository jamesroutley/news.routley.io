<p>This updated analysis is based on StatusGator outage data collected from January 1 to December 9, 2025. We decided to review our <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/is-north-virginia-aws-region-the-least-reliable-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">AWS analysis of outages in 2022</a> due to several new AWS incidents, especially another widely discussed AWS outage in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) that occurred on October 20, 2025.</p>



<p>We’ve expanded the report with fresh 2025 regional data as well as a new breakdown of affected AWS services.</p>

<h3><span id="Key_Findings"></span>Key Findings<span></span></h3>



<p>N. Virginia (us-east-1) is once again the least reliable AWS Region.</p>



<p>It leads the dataset in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total number of outages (10)</li>



<li>Total downtime (33 hours, 49 minutes)</li>



<li>Total components affected (126)</li>
</ul>



<p>No other region even comes close. Stockholm ranks second in downtime (11+ hours). Despite only 2 outages, each incident had a massive regional impact.</p>



<p>Regionless outages were unusually high. This category recorded <strong>12 outages</strong> and <strong>32 hours of downtime</strong>, indicating:</p>



<ul>
<li>More widespread AWS service disruptions in 2025</li>



<li>More failures affecting multiple regions simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<p>AWS doesn’t just experience regional outages. Service-level incidents are just as impactful.</p>

<h3><span id="Key_Findings-3"></span>Key Findings<span></span></h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OpenSearch, EMR Serverless, and CloudWatch</strong> each exceeded <strong>24+ hours</strong> of cumulative downtime.</li>



<li>Mission-critical systems like <strong>STS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and ELB</strong> saw prolonged disruptions.</li>



<li>EMR appears in <strong>both</strong> spreadsheets, indicating it experienced frequent <strong>and</strong> long-lasting ones.</li>
</ul>



<p>Across Tables 1–3 above, we see a consistent pattern emerge:</p>



<p><strong>1. Many of the affected components were concentrated in N. Virginia</strong></p>



<p>With 126 components affected, us-east-1 experienced the widest service disruption footprint.</p>



<p><strong>2. Region-level outages and service-level outages are correlated</strong></p>



<p>Major incidents involving:</p>



<ul>
<li>EC2</li>



<li>SageMaker</li>



<li>EMR</li>



<li>CloudWatch</li>



<li>OpenSearch</li>



<li>STS</li>
</ul>



<p>…almost always touch N. Virginia due to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Higher customer density</li>



<li>More service deployment fronts</li>



<li>More inter-service dependency points</li>



<li>Heavier API traffic</li>



<li>Higher multi-AZ coordination complexity</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>3. The longest-running outages disproportionately affected us-east-1</strong></p>



<p>Duration-heavy outages (CloudWatch, OpenSearch, EMR Serverless) frequently included N. Virginia, driving up the region’s total downtime.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>



<p>N. Virginia is not only the region with the most outages, but it is also the region where service outages cascade the widest and run the longest.</p>



<h2><span id="AWS_Outage_on_October_20_2025"></span>AWS Outage on October 20, 2025<span></span></h2>



<p>On October 20, 2025, AWS experienced one of the <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/statusgator-october-20-2025-outage-postmortem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">most significant cloud outages</a> in its history. 76 individual AWS components in the N. Virginia region alone showed disruption, by far the most heavily affected region.</p>



<p>Portions of Amazon Web Services were down for nearly 15 hours, causing cascading failures across thousands of SaaS platforms.</p>



<p>StatusGator’s <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/october-2025-early-warning-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Early Warning Signals</a> detected the incident approximately ten minutes before AWS officially acknowledged it, ultimately identifying outages across more than 2,000 of the 6,000 services in our monitoring network.</p>



<p>However, the magnitude of the event meant StatusGator was also impacted, experiencing two periods of dashboard and status page downtime due to a surge in global traffic and failures in upstream infrastructure.</p>



<p>Despite these disruptions, StatusGator delivered over 100,000 outage notifications throughout the incident and has since implemented architectural improvements to strengthen reliability during future large-scale cloud failures.</p>



<h2><span id="Why_Is_N_Virginia_Still_the_Least_Reliable_Region_in_2025"></span>Why Is N. Virginia Still the Least Reliable Region in 2025?<span></span></h2>



<p>We revisited the three common theories from our <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/is-north-virginia-aws-region-the-least-reliable-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">2023 AWS outage analysis</a> and compared them against this year’s dataset.</p>



<h3><span id="Assumption_1_%E2%80%9CN_Virginia_Has_More_Services_So_More_Things_Can_Break%E2%80%9D"></span>Assumption 1: “N. Virginia Has More Services, So More Things Can Break”<span></span></h3>



<p>In 2023, we found this explanation to be weak. But the 2025 “Components Affected” numbers tell a new story:</p>



<ul>
<li>N. Virginia affected 126 components</li>



<li>Next highest: Stockholm with 81</li>



<li>Most regions affected ≤ 20 components</li>
</ul>



<p>This indicates:</p>



<ul>
<li>Broader blast when outages occur in N. Virginia</li>



<li>More interconnected or high-density service dependency</li>



<li>More potential points of failure</li>
</ul>



<p>Still, high service count alone doesn’t explain the full scale:</p>



<p>So the number of components contributes to complexity, but not the root cause.</p>



<h3><span id="Assumption_2_%E2%80%9CN_Virginia_Is_the_Most_Used_and_Most_Heavily_Loaded_Region%E2%80%9D"></span>Assumption 2: “N. Virginia Is the Most Used and Most Heavily Loaded Region”<span></span></h3>



<p>This remains the strongest and most likely explanation. StatusGator <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/amazon-web-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">monitoring AWS status</a> data historically shows:</p>



<ul>
<li>N. Virginia is monitored by <strong>almost 2× as many users</strong> as Oregon</li>



<li>And <strong>over 3× as many</strong> as many other U.S. and global regions</li>
</ul>



<p>More customers → heavier load → more real-world stress → more outages that reach public visibility.</p>



<p>So this assumption is very likely true, and reinforced by 2025 data.</p>



<h3><span id="Assumption_3_%E2%80%9CN_Virginia_Is_Older_and_Built_Differently%E2%80%9D"></span>Assumption 3: “N. Virginia Is Older and Built Differently”<span></span></h3>



<p>AWS provides no evidence that us-east-1 uses a fundamentally different architecture. And our 2025 numbers don’t suggest “old region issues”:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tokyo and Sydney (both older) had minimal downtime</li>



<li>Newer regions, like Zurich and Hyderabad, had multi-hour outages</li>
</ul>



<p>Like in 2023, we still see no evidence supporting this theory.</p>



<h2><span id="Summary_AWS_Reliability_in_2025"></span>Summary: AWS Reliability in 2025<span></span></h2>



<p>With only weeks left in 2025, the data is clear:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Us-east-1 (N. Virginia) remains the least reliable AWS Region</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul>
<li>Most outages</li>



<li>Most downtime</li>



<li>Most components affected</li>
</ul>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Compute, analytics, and AI/ML services were the most outage-prone</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>EC2, SageMaker, Glue, EMR, and ECS led the list.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Several AWS services experienced extremely long-running disruptions</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>OpenSearch, CloudWatch, EMR Serverless, and STS had <strong>over 24 hours</strong> of cumulative downtime.</p>



<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Multi-region outages increased</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The Regionless category shows a notable rise in cross-region or global incidents in 2025.</p>
