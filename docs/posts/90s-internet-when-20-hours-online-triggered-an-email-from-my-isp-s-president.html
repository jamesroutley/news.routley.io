<p>&#34;When checking the system this morning, I noticed your account logged in for over 20 hours,&#34; begins a December 1998 email from the president of my dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) at the time. &#34;Our service is unlimited, but we ask that you actually be using the connection while logged in.&#34;</p>

<p>Today, when it seems like everyone is online 24/7 through smartphones and broadband, I&#39;d be weird if I <em>wasn&#39;t online</em> for 20 hours straight. But 1998 in Raleigh, North Carolina, was different. In an age of copper telephone lines and dial-up modems, Internet access wasn&#39;t usually an always-on situation for a home user in the US. Each occupied telephone line meant another ISP customer couldn&#39;t use it—and no one could call you, either.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself—why do I have an email from 1998?</p>

<p>I save everything. It&#39;s just <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">what I do</a>.</p>
<p>Being an amateur data archivist has served me well during my <a href="https://benjedwards.com/works.php">career</a> writing about tech. About eight years ago, I decided to search my archives for old email files and import them all into Apple Mail for OS X, organizing them chronologically so I could look at them all in one place. I found Internet emails going as far back as 1995, when I started using a POP3 client instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_(email_client)">Pine</a>. While browsing emails from 1998, I found a curious nugget from another era that blew me away.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember getting this email and thinking it was ridiculous because the connection was supposedly &#34;unlimited.&#34; My family paid NetWorks a monthly fee (a $24.95 &#34;Family Plan&#34; for three user IDs) that allowed me, my dad, and my brother to connect to the Internet as much as we wanted—or so I thought. I showed the email to my father, who shrugged it off.</p>                                            
                                                        

<p>Between 1995 and 2000, I used a dial-up ISP, which meant that I had to call in to the ISP using a regular copper phone line and a dial-up modem running at anywhere between 14.4Kbps to 56Kbps over the years. Since most people also used their telephone lines for talking with their voice, there was a basic assumption that most calls to the ISP would be temporary. If your line was occupied, you would miss incoming calls. In my situation, my parents had set up a second phone line exclusively for my BBS in 1993 so I could spend as much time online as necessary without worrying about blocking incoming phone calls to my family.</p>
<p>A key issue I had with the email was the implication that I wasn&#39;t using my Internet connection during those 20 hours. I&#39;m pretty sure I was using it, and not just for automatically checking my email every 30 minutes, as the email suggests.</p>
