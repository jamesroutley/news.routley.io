<p dir="auto">I&#39;m not hurt by it, but, like, <em>wow</em>, that&#39;s a rude way to talk to someone! So rude, I feel that it will be worth my taking a minute to answer<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-056dd48234a2e22682842ebb36e3b7f2" id="user-content-fnref-1-056dd48234a2e22682842ebb36e3b7f2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> your post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Abandoned PRs or automatically deleted PRs is very leftish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I don&#39;t know what this sentence means.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes contributors submit a PR which is not of acceptable quality, e.g. no docs or tests. Then, they do not respond to review. Therefore, the PR is abandoned.</p>
<p dir="auto">I can&#39;t say that I know what &#34;leftish&#34; means, but if that&#39;s a mistake or stand-in for &#34;leftist&#34; (as in, socially progressive, standing against fascism, pro-human-rights, etc etc), then sure I guess. I&#39;ll happily accept a label of being &#34;leftish&#34;. I don&#39;t really think my opinion about this topic, as voiced in the original post, has very much to do with my broader political views.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-056dd48234a2e22682842ebb36e3b7f2" id="user-content-fnref-2-056dd48234a2e22682842ebb36e3b7f2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p dir="auto">Who gives rights to the GitHub to close a PR after the weekend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I never said anything about closing PRs after any specific timeframe.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if I had... If I run a project hosted on GitHub, I can close PRs whenever I damn well please. I can configure stalebot to close and lock all PRs and issues after a period of inactivity, if I so choose. It&#39;s my project, after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If you are not able to communicate with people then you would simply discard their hard work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">🤣</p>
<p dir="auto">Being told that I&#39;m &#34;not able to communicate with people&#34; by someone who didn&#39;t even read the post they&#39;re replying to is very rich.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>title</em> of this discussion is about &#34;Low-Quality Contributions&#34;. We&#39;re talking about a high-volume attack on FOSS maintainers&#39; ability to concentrate, tend to their projects, and grow the surrounding communities. By definition, these are <em>non-contribution</em> contributions and net negative for the various projects and maintainers.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is a project maintainer&#39;s responsibility to decide when to reject contributions. If you can&#39;t reject work as being of unacceptably poor quality, you probably can&#39;t maintain a FOSS project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is not fair!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">What is not fair, and to whom?</p>
<p dir="auto">If a &#34;contributor&#34; spends 5 minutes asking an LLM to make a PR against my project, and I have to spend 1 hour reviewing it and offering feedback, then I&#39;m spending 12x more time and effort than the contributor. If I felt that 5 minutes of asking a chatbot to make a PR was a good way to advance my project <em>I would have already done that.</em> I could probably do it better than someone throwing YOLO PRs at random projects to see what sticks.</p>
<p dir="auto">My time on FOSS projects is voluntarily donated. That includes the time it takes to assess that a PR is total junk and close it. It&#39;s not unfair to dispose of spam emails -- those come from spammers. Similarly, it&#39;s not unfair to dispose of spam PRs -- those come from spammers.</p>
