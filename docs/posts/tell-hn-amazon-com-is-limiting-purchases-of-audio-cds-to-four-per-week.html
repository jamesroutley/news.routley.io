    <h1>Tell HN: Amazon.com is limiting purchases of Audio CDs to four-per-week</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>According to customer service, all customers are limited to buying four Audio CDs <i>per week</i> from any seller, in any combination, on Amazon.com.<p>This is not a per-title nor a per-seller limit, nor is it related to Amazon Prime or FREE Shipping or whatever. It&#39;s across all titles and sellers, in any combination (including 3rd party sellers), with any form of shipping, Prime or non-Prime.</p><p>Talking with customer support over the weekend, they claimed it was an error and would be fixed today, but as of this posting, the four-per-week purchase limit is still active.</p><p>The specific error message (during checkout) is:</p><p><i>There was a problem with some of the items in your order (see below for more information):</i></p><p><i>You have reached the purchase limit for this item. We have changed the quantity to the maximum allowable.</i></p><p><i>If the quantity has been set to 0, please delete the item (below the item details) to proceed.</i></p><p>More info on the problem here: https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/anyone-having-troubles-ordering-from-amazon.1143712/</p><p>The problem first appeared on Friday, April 22, 2022. If anyone at Amazon can get this fixed, that would be great.</p></td></div></div>
