    <h1>Writing a file system from scratch in Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt=""/>
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt=""/>
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt=""/>
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>&#34;10 GiB&#34;</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

    <img src="https://blog.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/gotenksfs-mount.png"/>
    <figcaption>File system after mounting</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>magic</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>libc</span><span>::</span><span>mode_t</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>block_count</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>// should be in 512 bytes blocks</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>created_at</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>accessed_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>modified_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>changed_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>direct_blocks</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>u32</span><span>;</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>],</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>indirect_block</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>double_indirect_block</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.

<h3 id="reading-and-writing-to-files">Reading and writing to files</h3>

<p>Now that the “disk” is set up, we can start writing and reading files from it. Creating a new directory using <code>mkdir</code>:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/mkdir.gif" alt=""/>
    <figcaption>Creating a directory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The process that occurs is the following: the system searches for the inode of
the root directory, looks up in which data block the contents are being written
to, allocates a new inode and data block for the new directory, writes the entry
to the root directory, and finally, writes the new directory to its data block.</p>

<p>Writing a new file follows a similar method. The system traverses the given path
until the final directory is reached and adds an entry representing the new
file.</p>

<p>The write function provides the path, buffer with the data, offset, and a file
info struct that may hold a file handle along with extra information about the
file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Path</span><span>,</span> <span>buf</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>],</span> <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>file_info</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>fuse_rs</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>WriteFileInfo</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, instead of traversing the path again to find the inode, the system
uses the file handle (the FS previously sets it when creating the file). With
the inode in hand, the FS can build the struct by seeking to the exact location
where the <code>Inode</code> is written:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>inode_offsets</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>u64</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>inodes_per_group</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.superblock</span><span>()</span><span>.data_blocks_per_group</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>inode_bg</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>inodes_per_group</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>bitmap_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>inodes_per_group</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>(</span><span>inode_bg</span><span>,</span> <span>bitmap_index</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>inode_seek_position</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>group_index</span><span>,</span> <span>bitmap_index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.inode_offsets</span><span>(</span><span>index</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>block_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.superblock</span><span>()</span><span>.block_size</span><span>;</span>
    <span>group_index</span> <span>*</span> <span>util</span><span>::</span><span>block_group_size</span><span>(</span><span>block_size</span><span>)</span>
        <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>block_size</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span>
        <span>+</span> <span>bitmap_index</span> <span>*</span> <span>INODE_SIZE</span>
        <span>+</span> <span>SUPERBLOCK_SIZE</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that the FS has information about which data blocks are currently allocated
to the <code>Inode</code>, it can use them to find the exact location where to write the
data, in a process similar as shown above. New blocks are first added to the
<code>Inode</code> direct blocks array, and if the file size exceeds <code>(12 * BLOCK_SIZE)</code>,
the FS allocates an <code>indirect_block</code> that holds the numbers identifying other
blocks containing user data. And in the case the file is even bigger requiring
more blocks, the system adds an extra layer of indirection using the
<code>double_indirect_block</code> field which points to more indirect blocks. Reading from
a file follows the same method. You can see it running here:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The idea behind a file system is to define a structure for the contents on disk
which then allow the system to operate on top of it when creating, writing and
reading from files and directories.</p>

<p>We learned some of the concepts used for the on-disk format, how directories and
files are represented. One interesting aspect is the usage of indirect pointers
to allow storing large files. If you are interested in learning more about file
systems, I would recommend reading more about other techniques that are used
such as journaling, copy-on-write, log-structured file systems, and also how
modern file systems apply these and other techniques. Maybe start learning about
the one you are using right now.</p>
