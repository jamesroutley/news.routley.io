    <h1>My Current Approach To Reducing My COVID Risk</h1>

<h2 data-block-key="8gtyr">Principles</h2><p data-block-key="ejn91">My overall approach:</p><p data-block-key="5mnh8"><b>Shared air</b></p><p data-block-key="26p90">I avoid sharing indoors air, especially unfiltered air, with people outside my household. I mask in those shared spaces; &#34;one-way masking&#34; (I&#39;m masking but they aren&#39;t) is less effective than all-way masking, but it&#39;s still something. When possible I substitute alternative ways of interacting with others, such as meeting outdoors, or (if one of us has had a recent exposure) phone or videocalls. Sometimes I avoid a subway or bus ride by bicycling instead.</p><p data-block-key="7ol66">If I&#39;m meeting others indoors, I try to <a href="#ventilation">increase filtration and ventilation</a> with air filters, open windows, and fans, and I wear high-filtration <a href="#masking">masks</a>.</p><p data-block-key="89v58"><b>Checking my safety and raising precautions</b></p><p data-block-key="491nc">I use safety assessment tools to determine appropriate precautions; sometimes I am willing to do more work and take on more inconvenience when the danger is greater. Factors I consider include <a href="https://biobot.io/data/">wastewater surveillance testing data in the US overall and in my region</a>, test positivity rates, and carbon dioxide levels in indoor spaces (as a proxy for unventilated exhalations). I sometimes play with <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/">microcovid.org&#39;s calculator</a> to better understand what I can do to make a situation relatively safer.</p><p data-block-key="aepug"><b>Protecting myself over unmasked people</b></p><p data-block-key="2ggh4">I sometimes am willing to wear a valved <a href="#masking">mask</a> (that is, a mask where the air I inhale is filtered, but the air I exhale is not). Sometimes a valved mask can provide me with higher protection with less discomfort than can a nonvalved mask. Criteria: I am in a large public group, nearly no one around me is wearing a mask, masks are not mandated, and I am not in a healthcare setting. (I am not 100% committed to this reasoning. In particular, one person I know who takes pretty similar precautions to mine is very interested in preventing transmission to others, on the theory that he particularly wants to do his bit to prevent the mutation of the virus into harder-to-fight variants. That seems pretty sensible!)</p><p data-block-key="a6ij4">A similar principle also applies to how much time I spend protecting myself and my circle of loved ones directly versus how much time I spend on advocacy or similar work to try to protect the general public. I do, for instance, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/conferences-ask-your-venues-and-hotels-about-ventilation/">contact event organizers in my industries and hobbies to ask about ventilation and air filtering</a>. But I have not been spending time on, e.g., calling my federal representatives to lobby for unlikely policy changes.</p><p data-block-key="727n7"><b>Spending money</b></p><p data-block-key="ck7ef">Some additional protections cost money, and I have decided that it&#39;s worth maybe a few thousand dollars per year to not catch COVID, or delay catching it for a few more years as we discover and refine treatments. I do not want to catch COVID nor pass it on to others. Even mild cases lead to increased risk of <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/heart-attacks-and-strokes-late-after">heart attack, stroke</a>, <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/new-diabetes-post-acute-covid-pasc">type II diabetes</a>, <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-heightened-risk-of-autoimmune">autoimmune diseases</a>, and probably other conditions. <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1798618.html">The virus can stick around in the body for years.</a> I especially do not want to develop Long COVID; I have a few friends with Long COVID and it has been extraordinarily damaging to their lives (including in some cases their careers), and we are just now learning some ways to reduce the risk of Long COVID among people who get infected. So the investment is worth it. I am lucky to be able to make this investment.</p>
