<h3 data-block-key="hd5ht">Self-testing (antigen and NAAT/molecular) and PCR</h3><p data-block-key="79mp3">If I&#39;m feeling symptoms, I&#39;ll take a rapid home test, usually an antigen test but sometimes a higher-accuracy NAAT (a.k.a. &#34;molecular test&#34;).</p><p data-block-key="dhl6t">If I&#39;m not feeling symptoms then my testing is generally before or after seeing other folks indoors.</p><p data-block-key="7dsud">Prior to seeing someone else indoors in a private space: I self-test at home.</p><p data-block-key="a8mbl">If I am travelling to a public group event such as a convention, I bring several tests. I self-test before leaving my home and every day, or every alternate day, of the event. Then, about five days after returning from travel, I get a free PCR test, which is the gold standard for accuracy, via <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-rapid-testing.page">New York City&#39;s COVID Express sites</a>.</p><p data-block-key="ac7lm">Since antigen tests are cheaper than NAATs, I use antigen tests most of the time. I use NAATs when the stakes are higher or when I consider my likelihood of infection or transmission to be higher, e.g., if I&#39;m about to see someone who&#39;s immunocompromised, or have had a lot of indoors exposure to strangers recently, or want to unmask indoors with someone in a low-ventilation room.</p><p data-block-key="c10ic"><b>Free and subsidized testing</b>: In the US there are still ways to get tested for free. Here&#39;s <a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/">the CDC&#39;s test locator</a>. And: if you bought at-home tests before May 11th, 2023, you can likely <a href="https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free">submit receipts for reimbursement to your health insurer</a>.</p><p data-block-key="dicfl"><b>Your old tests may still be good</b>: If you have rapid tests that say they&#39;ve expired, check <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list">this FDA updates page</a> to see if their expiration dates have been extended!</p><p data-block-key="14g20"><b>Buying antigen tests on sale</b>: You can order <a href="https://www.bettymills.com/search?q=covid%20test">big multi-packs of antigen tests from Betty Mills</a> for pretty cheap. And a friend passed on a deal from their friend K:</p><blockquote data-block-key="etmf6">&#34;The cheap rapid tests are at <a href="https://maskwholesale.eu">maskwholesale.eu</a>. The more tests you buy, the cheaper shipping comes out to be, so if you order over 120 tests, they end up being around $1 each. My friend J recommends Green Spring brand tests based on the data they have found.&#34;</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="fqedi">J is immunocompromised, so K trusts their research into this stuff, but you can of course verify. The shipping may be a bit high for individuals, but it worked out well for the bulk order for our house.</blockquote><p data-block-key="efpqb">As <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1814478.html">siderea further wrote up</a>: &#34;They ship world-wide via DHL. They&#39;re selling, e.g. Flowflex for EUR 0.83 each (less for bulk orders!) while shipping to the US or Canada is about EUR 50 for up to 10kg (EUR 20 within the EU, EUR 35 to the UK, EUR 65 to AU). They have many, many brands and types of tests, including combined Covid + Influenza A/B tests(!).&#34;</p><p data-block-key="c4i82"><i>[Edited 21 June 2023 to add]</i>: <b>Check again at the end of the results window</b>: Home antigen tests often instruct you that the soonest you can check results is 15 minutes, and that the longest you should wait to check the results is 30 minutes. I check at the 15-minute mark and then again at the 30-minute mark, because very early positive results sometimes take more than the minimum results time to show up. I read <a href="https://twitter.com/jessgrieser/status/1482003988321030144">Jessi Grieser&#39;s experience last year</a>: &#34;my home test ... took almost a half an hour to turn up the very faint positive line. 15 minutes was not enough to test positive--had I been using the test to determine &#39;can I walk in the house to see grandma&#39; I would&#39;ve been wrong.&#34;</p><p data-block-key="bardm"><i>[Edited 21 June 2023 to add]</i>: <b>Consider swabbing throat + nose</b>: In some countries the rapid antigen test procedure includes doing a throat swab. I get the sense that <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1743355.html">adding a quick swipe of the back of the throat before swabbing the nostrils</a> is likely to help catch the more recent variants (since early 2022). If I need to do an antigen test and I haven&#39;t eaten or drunk anything in the last hour or so, I also swab my throat. It seems to make the control line a little fainter but otherwise doesn&#39;t get in the way.</p>
