<p data-block-key="0gfvj">Last month, <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency-details-on-health-coverage-and-access/">the US ended the public health emergency and national emergency declarations regarding COVID-19</a>. Many of the subsidies, protections, and other supports that helped us prevent COVID-19 transmission have gone away. Masks are optional on <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/planning-booking/policies/coronavirus.html">Amtrak</a>, on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-rules-mask-mandate-transport-unlawful-overturning-biden-effort-2022-04-18/">airplanes in the US</a>, and on <a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus">my (New York City&#39;s) transit system</a>. And -- anecdotally -- many people have stopped masking in other shared indoor spaces or otherwise trying to reduce their exposure.</p><p data-block-key="802v0">Some of us are still trying to avoid catching COVID-19, and we are, more than ever, on our own.</p><p data-block-key="19e2m">I&#39;m writing this post to describe my overall approach to reducing infection risk.

<h2 data-block-key="8gtyr">Principles</h2><p data-block-key="ejn91">My overall approach:</p><p data-block-key="5mnh8"><b>Shared air</b></p><p data-block-key="26p90">I avoid sharing indoors air, especially unfiltered air, with people outside my household. I mask in those shared spaces; &#34;one-way masking&#34; (I&#39;m masking but they aren&#39;t) is less effective than all-way masking, but it&#39;s still something. When possible I substitute alternative ways of interacting with others, such as meeting outdoors, or (if one of us has had a recent exposure) phone or videocalls. Sometimes I avoid a subway or bus ride by bicycling instead.</p><p data-block-key="7ol66">If I&#39;m meeting others indoors, I try to <a href="#ventilation">increase filtration and ventilation</a> with air filters, open windows, and fans, and I wear high-filtration <a href="#masking">masks</a>.</p><p data-block-key="89v58"><b>Checking my safety and raising precautions</b></p><p data-block-key="491nc">I use safety assessment tools to determine appropriate precautions; sometimes I am willing to do more work and take on more inconvenience when the danger is greater. Factors I consider include <a href="https://biobot.io/data/">wastewater surveillance testing data in the US overall and in my region</a>, test positivity rates, and carbon dioxide levels in indoor spaces (as a proxy for unventilated exhalations). I sometimes play with <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/">microcovid.org&#39;s calculator</a> to better understand what I can do to make a situation relatively safer.</p><p data-block-key="aepug"><b>Protecting myself over unmasked people</b></p><p data-block-key="2ggh4">I sometimes am willing to wear a valved <a href="#masking">mask</a> (that is, a mask where the air I inhale is filtered, but the air I exhale is not). Sometimes a valved mask can provide me with higher protection with less discomfort than can a nonvalved mask. Criteria: I am in a large public group, nearly no one around me is wearing a mask, masks are not mandated, and I am not in a healthcare setting. (I am not 100% committed to this reasoning. In particular, one person I know who takes pretty similar precautions to mine is very interested in preventing transmission to others, on the theory that he particularly wants to do his bit to prevent the mutation of the virus into harder-to-fight variants. That seems pretty sensible!)</p><p data-block-key="a6ij4">A similar principle also applies to how much time I spend protecting myself and my circle of loved ones directly versus how much time I spend on advocacy or similar work to try to protect the general public. I do, for instance, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/conferences-ask-your-venues-and-hotels-about-ventilation/">contact event organizers in my industries and hobbies to ask about ventilation and air filtering</a>. But I have not been spending time on, e.g., calling my federal representatives to lobby for unlikely policy changes.</p><p data-block-key="727n7"><b>Spending money</b></p><p data-block-key="ck7ef">Some additional protections cost money, and I have decided that it&#39;s worth maybe a few thousand dollars per year to not catch COVID, or delay catching it for a few more years as we discover and refine treatments. I do not want to catch COVID nor pass it on to others. Even mild cases lead to increased risk of <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/heart-attacks-and-strokes-late-after">heart attack, stroke</a>, <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/new-diabetes-post-acute-covid-pasc">type II diabetes</a>, <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-heightened-risk-of-autoimmune">autoimmune diseases</a>, and probably other conditions. <a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1798618.html">The virus can stick around in the body for years.</a> I especially do not want to develop Long COVID; I have a few friends with Long COVID and it has been extraordinarily damaging to their lives (including in some cases their careers), and we are just now learning some ways to reduce the risk of Long COVID among people who get infected. So the investment is worth it. I am lucky to be able to make this investment.</p>

It has an e-ink screen to display the current reading and what range it&#39;s in, and you can configure it to audibly buzz if it goes over a particular threshold. The sensor also measures humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure.

The idea is to help people who need to read lips to better understand what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m not sure how effective the JelliM has been at this goal. I think there is a little tendency to fog up, and bright stage lighting can cause glare and block the view of my lips, and the sound of my voice can get a bit echoey or muffled (as in the audio for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_AzIVnlim0&amp;list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvY2zhJ9AMUa_Z6dtMGF3gtb&amp;index=113">the &#34;Argument Clinic&#34; recording</a>).</p>

            <p data-block-key="j5s05">My default mask is an N95, but for airports, airplanes, and crowded public places I bring my Aranet 4 CO2 monitor, check it, and graduate to more protective respirators if the CO2 levels go dangerously high. If CO2 is in the yellow range I often go up to a disposable valved N99 <a href="https://www.bettymills.com/ffp3-n99-dust-mask-with-valve-facial-fit-20-masks-bsc-153329">(USD$26.15 for 20 masks at Betty Mills)</a>.</p><p data-block-key="3fnem">An N99 has individually adjustable elastic straps, and soft material around the mouth and nose area, ensuring a closer fit than I usually get with an N95. It is also valved, meaning that it filters incoming air but not outgoing exhalations. (I believe I&#39;ve seen some headlines saying that the level of filtering for outgoing breath is not zero, maybe at about the level of a surgical mask.) So, when I wear an N99, I&#39;m choosing to protect myself over others; see my <a href="#principles">principles</a> for when I might do this.</p><p data-block-key="e3o51">As with N95s, I reuse an N99 till the straps start giving out.

            <p data-block-key="j5s05">If the CO2 is in the red range, I wear a P100-level respirator. I use a <a href="https://www.protectly.co/products/3m-6000-half-face-respirator-kit-p100-filter-cartridges?variant=36146027659432">3M half-face which cost USD$35</a>. Like all P100s (I think), it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomeric_respirator">elastomeric</a>, which means that it has soft bits around the mouth-and-nose area to form a good seal with the skin, and has replaceable filters.</p><p data-block-key="2p6dh">This P100 has an exhalation valve, which I have <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/blog/masks#modified-p100-respirators">covered up with a piece of KN95 or surgical mask material and some tape</a> so that I am protecting others by filtering my exhalations. I keep meaning to buy <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v101254496/">the official 3M exhalation valve filter</a> and install it (about USD$10 each but seems to only come in a pack of 6).</p><p data-block-key="3q85c">I&#39;ve had this P100 for going on 2 years now, and have replaced the filters a few times (maybe USD$10-20 per pair). I find it comfortable enough that I have slept many hours while wearing it on trains and airplanes. I do make sure to do a quick positive and negative fit test each time I put it on (inhaling and exhaling while covering the filters and exhalation valve) to ensure good fit. Sometimes I do adjust the straps too tight and get a bit of a headache after 40 minutes, and then need to carefully loosen them an iota.</p><p data-block-key="ca7hn">I am thinking about getting a smaller P100. I&#39;d like for the filters to not block as much of my vision, and for the entire kit to pack up smaller in my handbag. And it may be occasionally helpful to wear something that isn&#39;t quite as attention-catching, although I don&#39;t mind being eye-catching. A friend likes the <a href="https://www.projectn95.org/products/dentec-comfort-air-p100-half-mask-style-respirator-package-of-1-black/">Comfort-Air Nx (USD$31.25)</a>, which does filter outgoing breath. Another friend likes <a href="https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/respirators/p100-half-mask-respirator-sm#Product%20Media">this low-profile Klein P100 (about USD$30)</a> , but warns that the replacement filters can be harder to find.</p>

I figure that is likely because of a fumble made when placing the vial (I did see a drop of fluid spill into the aperture), or possibly because I attempted to use the same pair of AA batteries for the 3rd test in a row, instead of using a fresh pair each time (each kit comes with a fresh pair of AA batteries to use, but a battery tester demonstrates that running the test once still leaves plenty of charge on the batteries).</li><li data-block-key="1ueh3">I once got a positive result, which was later that day demonstrated to be erroneous by two separate PCR tests (including a deep nasal passages swab). This of course royally screwed up the course of my morning, and now I am a little suspicious about whether that particular batch of tests might be especially susceptible to false positives. Maybe Vault didn&#39;t store them correctly, or maybe I left them someplace too hot as I schlepped them around the Bay Area in my luggage, or maybe the extended expiration date comes with sensitivity degradation.</li><li data-block-key="cc5lg">Maybe 1/4 of the kits had a minor issue: when I was peeling the seal off the test tube, the tiny plastic handle wasn&#39;t adhering very well to the foil seal, so I had to carefully find a way to peel the foil off with my fingernails or something. Possibly some adhesive degraded over the months.</li></ol><p data-block-key="bg27h">Lucira&#39;s other distributor is <a href="https://www.peachmedical.com/shop">Peach Medical</a>, which does have some of their NAAT/molecular COVID tests in stock at USD$34-$45 each ($34 for ones that expire in August, $45 for ones that expire in October).

<h3 data-block-key="8nqvc">In case I catch it</h3><p data-block-key="4stme">If I catch COVID, I want to reduce the chances of transmission to others, and I want to <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/preventing-long-covid">reduce the chances of developing Long COVID</a>. Therefore:</p><ol><li data-block-key="2nvr6"><b>Isolation</b>: I&#39;d get into a room as isolated from others&#39; air as possible, and ventilate and filter the air to keep viral load low.

For instance, if I had tested positive while in Madison for WisCon, I would have used <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/telehealth.htm">Wisconsin&#39;s telehealth system</a> to get a Paxlovid prescription ASAP.</li><li data-block-key="dmcbb"><b>Metformin</b>: We now know that <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/long-covid-shows-card">metformin, when taken during the acute phase of COVID infection, significantly reduces the chances of developing Long COVID.</a> (<a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-break-from-covid-waves-and-a-breakthrough">Eric Topol writes</a>: &#34;unless or until there are data to the contrary, if I got Covid, I’d take metformin for 2 weeks at the doses used in this trial&#34;) So I would request my physician prescribe me metformin.</li><li data-block-key="6fv7u"><b>Enovid</b>: I&#39;d snort <a href="#nasal-spray">Enovid nasal spray</a> to reduce the duration and intensity of infection.</li><li data-block-key="ave9s"><b>Rest</b>: To help prevent developing Long COVID, I&#39;d try to physically and mentally rest as much as possible for the first two weeks of the infection.</li></ol><p data-block-key="8lqtg">I would also probably follow up on crowdsourced recommendations such as <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@vickyvdtogt/110283419811503439">an alkaline diet</a> and <a href="https://tylik.dreamwidth.org/1037851.html">dietary supplements</a>.</p>

<h3 data-block-key="8nqvc">Returning from a trip</h3><p data-block-key="1qoel">I don&#39;t want to transmit COVID to my spouse. So, when I return from high-exposure travel (such as airplane trips), we use isolation, ventilation and filtration, and testing to reduce transmission risk.</p><p data-block-key="14cbc">For about the first 5 days after I return, I mask in shared spaces with an N95; Leonard often masks with a KN95. We open the windows as much as possible, and/or use multiple standalone air filters/purifiers (we&#39;ve bought a few, ranging from about USD$20-150 each). We sleep in separate beds, or I keep an N95 mask on and we ensure good ventilation while we sleep. Often we eat together outdoors, or I eat in a separate room with the door closed. For some meals, if I have no symptoms and the CO2 level is under 600ppm, we&#39;ll take off our masks to eat together in shared indoors air.</p><p data-block-key="8chos">During those 5 days, if I develop any symptoms, I take a rapid test.</p><p data-block-key="9n3bh">About five days after returning, I get a free PCR test via <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-rapid-testing.page">New York City&#39;s COVID Express sites</a>. That result comes back within 24 hours -- often in just 2-5 hours -- and I consider that a &#34;we&#39;re clear&#34; signal. We unmask and smooch!</p><p data-block-key="4142h">Also: When I return home from going outside, I wash my hands, and try to scrub for 20 seconds each time. We now know that transmission of COVID via surfaces is pretty rare, but it&#39;s a good habit for avoiding various other germs so I&#39;m keeping it up anyway. Similarly, I&#39;d already had a bit of a pre-pandemic practice of switching from &#34;clothes I&#39;ve worn while sitting on trains or other public furniture&#34; to &#34;home clothes&#34; upon coming home from outside, and now it&#39;s somewhat more rigorous. This is more about mpox, and a general feeling of domesticity, than about COVID.</p>

<h2 data-block-key="owpqz">Further reading &amp; concluding thoughts</h2><p data-block-key="8j614">Till I <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2023/the-memex-mirage/">move off Pinboard</a>, I do <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:brainwane/t:covid-19/">bookmark a bunch of resources and tips using the covid-19 tag there</a>. For instance, <a href="https://wiscon.net/2022/06/18/wiscon-2022-post-con-covid-19-report/">WisCon&#39;s 2022 post-con report</a> details the many steps they took to mitigate spread, including buying and building air purifiers. And just today <a href="https://mstdn.social/@kissane/110549293744947445">I saw Erin Kissane point to some promising mouthwash research</a>.</p><p data-block-key="caof0">I feel fortunate that I can learn from so many researchers and educators about how to keep myself safe, and that people like me form enough of a market that vendors continue to create and sell us tools. It seems more constructive to concentrate on that gratitude and self-efficacy than to focus on how awful it is that we&#39;re missing the opportunity to collectively, as a civilization, protect ourselves en masse.</p><p data-block-key="d9bd6">By <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.19.22282525v1">some estimates</a>, only 6% of the US population had not yet been infected by COVID by mid-November 2022. Others suggest it&#39;s <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-break-from-covid-waves-and-a-breakthrough">more like 15% of US residents</a> who have been able to avoid infection so far. I aim to continue to be one of this fraction. I hope these tips can help you avoid getting infected or reinfected. I know I&#39;ve written a freaking tome here but it really usually doesn&#39;t take up more of my life than any of the other bits of regular hygiene do; once the gear and the habits are in place, it&#39;s a fairly small marginal cost. And I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s worth it.</p>
