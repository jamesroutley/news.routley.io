<h4>Juice

Michael Franz (franz@uci.edu) and Thomas Kistler (kistler@ics.uci.edu), University of 
California, Irvine, U.S.A., 17th June 1996 
 

</p><h5>Introducing Juice 
</h5><p>
Juice is a new technology for distributing executable content across the World Wide 
Web. In this respect, it is similar to Java from Sun Microsystems. However, as we will try 
to explain in the following, Juice differs from Java in several important aspects that 
allows it to outperform Java in many &#34;downloadable Applets&#34; applications. The 
advantages of Juice become even more pronounced when the &#34;Applets&#34; are large. Java, 
on the other hand, has an advantage in the area for which it was originally invented: 
embedded applications in consumer electronics and household appliances. Juice is 
intended to be a complement to Java, giving users a choice: Java or Juice. 
</p><p>
Java is a trademark owned by Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
</p><p>
Juice is a trademark owned by the Regents of the University of California. 

 

</p><h5>A Little History To Start With 
</h5><p>
Juice isn&#39;t simply a Java-lookalike; that we have created in quick reaction to Sun 
Microsystems&#39; Java announcement. Quite to the contrary, work on Juice has preceded 
Java by several years, but it all happened in an academic environment with more limited 
resources than available at Sun. The only part of Juice that has been influenced by Java 
is the food-related name. 
</p><p>
Juice grew out of a research project headed by Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of the Pascal 
and Modula programming languages. His aim was to invent a language that was at once 
simple and safe to use. The new language should also support the object-oriented 
programming paradigm, be efficiently compilable, and applicable to a wide range of 
programming tasks from systems programming to teaching. A language with these 
properties was defined by Wirth in 1988 and given the name Oberon 
<a href="http://caesar.ics.uci.edu/oberon/intro.html">
   http://caesar.ics.uci.edu/oberon/intro.html</a>. 
</p><p>
At first sight, Oberon and Java seem to be as different as two languages can possibly be. 
Oberon looks a lot like Pascal (not very surprising, since they were both invented by the 
same person), and Java looks a lot like C (thereby appearing &#34;familiar&#34; to many 
programmers). A closer comparison of Oberon and Java, however, yields surprisingly 
many similarities: both languages 
</p><p>
* are strongly typed while permitting the definition of extended types that are 
backward-compatible with their ancestors, 
</p><p>
* prohibit pointer arithmetic and mandate the presence of a garbage collector in their 
run-time environment, and 
</p><p>
* provide the notion of modular packages that are compiled separately and dynamically 
linked at run-time 
</p><p>
Juice is to the Oberon language what the Java Virtual Machine 
(http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/whitePaper.Platform/JavaPlatform.doc2.html#6978) 
is to the Java language: the means of distributing portable software. Work on what has 
now become Juice started in 1989 and contributed to Michael Franz&#39;s Ph.D. degree in 
1994 (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz). The title of his 1994 dissertation, almost a year 
and a half before the announcement of Java, was &#34;Code-Generation On-The-Fly: A Key 
to Portable Software&#34;. 

 

</p><h5>What Is Juice and How Does It Differ From Java 
</h5><p>
Juice encompasses three key components 
</p><p>
- an architecture-neutral software distribution format, 
</p><p>
- a compiler that translates from Oberon into the Juice portable format, and 
</p><p>
- a &#34;plug-in&#34; that enables the Netscape browser (http://home.netscape.com) to run Juice 
applets. 
</p><p>
To the technical layman, the most notable difference between comparable Juice and 
Java applets is probably that the Juice version of any applet is likely to run a lot faster 
than its Java counterpart. Rather than being interpreted, as Java applets normally are, 
Juice always compiles each applet into the native code of the target machine before it 
begins execution. Once that an applet begins executing, it runs at the full speed of 
compiled code. Juice&#39;s on-the-fly compilation process is not only exceptionally fast, but it 
also generates object code that is comparable in quality to commercial C compilers. In 
contrast, even the latest just-in-time compilers for Java that have been announced by 
major vendors are not yet trying to compete with regular compilers. 
</p><p>
Further, the portable Juice representation is denser than Java byte-codes. Users with 
slow connections to the Internet save time by downloading Juice applets rather than 
Java applets of the same functionality. In fact, the time saved by the faster downloading 
normally more than compensates for the on-the-fly compilation phase. 
</p><p>
How then, do a few academic researchers manage to come up with a better on-the-fly 
compiler than a whole industry of software companies? Well, the key to Juice&#39;s 
effectiveness isn&#39;t really found in the compiler technology embedded within the Netscape 
plug-in, but in the Juice software distribution format itself: Behind the scenes, Juice and 
Java differ by far more than one might expect. 
</p><p>
Java&#39;s distribution format is a sequence of so-called byte-codes: the inventors of Java 
thought up an &#34;ideal&#34; processor designed specifically for running Java programs and use 
the instruction set of this ideal processor as the &#34;intermediate language&#34; in which Java 
programs are shipped. Hence, on the programmer&#39;s side, a Java compiler translates the 
source into a byte-code sequence, and on the side of the eventual consumer, a 
byte-code interpreter simulates the ideal Java processor. It is entirely conceivable that 
the ideal Java processor can actually be implemented in hardware, and Sun has actually 
already announced such processors. 
</p><p>
Juice&#39;s distribution format, on the other hand, is far more complex. It is based on a 
tree-shaped program representation as is typically used transiently within optimizing 
compilers. Rather than containing a linear code-sequence that can be interpreted 
byte-by-byte, a Juice-encoded applet contains a compressed tree that describes the 
actions of the original program. The tree preserves the control-flow structure of the 
original program, which makes it much easier to perform code optimization while the tree 
is translated into the native instruction set of the target machine. 
</p><p>
As an example of what kinds of optimizations may be beneficial, consider a modern 
processor that has several functional units. These require a certain instruction-mix in 
order to operate at top speed. By re-ordering certain mutually independent instructions, 
a better instruction-mix may be achieved. A tree-based encoding maintains the notion of 
a basic block and makes it relatively easy to decide if two instructions are mutually 
independent. This is not so simple with a linear instruction stream, such as Java 
byte-codes, in which any instruction can potentially be the target of a branch. 
</p><p>
Further, our tree-based encoding avoids many of the security issues that are difficult to 
solve in Java, or in any virtual-machine representation for that matter. By the very 
definition of our tree-encoding scheme, it is impossible to encode a tree that violates 
scoping rules of our source language. Such an &#34;illegal&#34; program cannot even be 
constructed by hand. Java&#39;s byte-code instructions, on the other hand, are at a much 
lower semantic level. Although it is possible to verify that a given byte-code sequence 
doesn&#39;t perform any illegal action, this requires data-flow analysis and a partial repetition 
of the compiler&#39;s integrity checks. The tree-based Juice distribution format in effect 
makes this particular data-flow analysis unnecessary. It also allows for highly efficient 
load-time integrity checking, as every node in the encoded tree is fully typed. 

 

</p><h5>How to Obtain Juice 
</h5><p>
The easiest way to learn more about Juice is by simply having a look at it. The 
Juice-homepage which contains an introduction to Juice, the plug-in 
download-instructions, and demo applets can be found on the Internet at: 

<a href="http://caesar.ics.uci.edu/juice">
         http://caesar.ics.uci.edu/juice</a>
</p><p>
In order to see the demos, you need to install the Netscape Juice plug-in. This plug-in is 
available for the following platforms: 
</p><p>
* Apple PowerPC Macintosh 
</p><p>
* PC-compatible running Windows 95 

</p><h5>Conclusion 
</h5><p>
We believe that Juice is a better technology than Java for bringing executable content to 
the World Wide Web. Juice allows substantial amounts of software to be encoded 
space-efficiently, and to be compiled on-the-fly into high-quality code. The Juice 
architecture-neutral distribution format has a variety of properties that make it inherently 
better suited for applications that require the speed of optimized object code. 
</p><p>
Java, on the other hand, is the better choice in the domain for which it was originally 
created: embedded applications in consumer electronics and household appliances. 
Aided by a hardware implementation of the Java virtual machine, this creates a standard 
run-time architecture for embedded software that requires a small memory footprint.

<h4>The ModulaTor Forum 
</h4><h5>AlphaOberon News: Oberon-text to LaTex Converter 
</h5><p>
by Guenter Dotzel, ModulaWare 
</p><p>
An Oberon to LaTex converter called Edit2LaTex is now available for the Oberon System 
V4. Source code of course. Developed by Joerg Derungs. 
</p><p>
Edit2LaTex can handle Oberon texts, graphics- and table-elements. Its OO-architecture 
makes extensions to support custom hypertext-elements very easy. Skeleton texts are 
included. They show how the paragraph controls (parcs) of Oberon texts serve to 
determine the LaTex document structure. 
</p><p>
Edit2LaTex is very easy to use, but unfortunately, the documentation is in German only 
(Edit2LaTex_Docu.Text). 
</p><p>
Edit2LaTex was added to ModulaWare&#39;s AlphaOberon distribution. 
</p><p>
With one further step, using the LaTex2Html converter, you can generate your HTML 
files (e.g. for the world wide web) automatically from the Oberon wysiwyg-text/graphics 
editor.
