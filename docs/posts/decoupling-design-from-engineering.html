                        <p>Often when you work as an engineer on a small team, you don&#39;t have dedicated designers on staff. How can you deliver beautiful, intuitive software, without designers? Here&#39;s a trick that helps me: decoupling my design work from my engineering work.</p>
<p>But first: I love designers! An expert designer is one of the most vital people in an engineering organization. I&#39;m not a designer. Great designers are rare, which is why, for much of my career, I haven&#39;t had one.</p>
<p>Decoupling design from engineering means turning off your engineering brain and turning on your designing brain, directing all your power there during an isolated phase of work.</p>
<p>A popular model for brain activity is &#34;left brain&#34; vs. &#34;right brain&#34;. The left side of your brain handles the analytical and logical, and the right side handles the creative and emotional. It points to a truth: you can&#39;t lay bricks and paint a fresco simultaneously. </p>
<p>But we as engineers try to do both. We&#39;re already in the code, we have the CSS and components, so we start designing and engineering at the same time. When I hear about a feature request, my brain starts churning: can I build this? How does it align with the code I already have? I start estimating the work, and like any engineer, I begin to think about how I can do the work faster by cutting scope.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t how designers work. Designers care about velocity, but it&#39;s not where they&#39;re starting from. When you try to design and build at the same time, you&#39;re coupling how something <em>looks</em> to how it <em>works</em>. You&#39;re forcing yourself into a box where the sides are your engineering ability and the codebase you have.</p>
<p>But what if you didn&#39;t? What if you decoupled the work?</p>
<p>First, you&#39;re going to produce better designs. Letting yourself be creative means you&#39;re starting outside that box. Maybe you don&#39;t keep everything you imagined, but it&#39;s still valuable.</p>
<p>Second, it will make you better as an engineer because you&#39;re reaching beyond your grasp. You aren&#39;t designing just things you know you can build. You&#39;re designing the right thing for the task at hand.</p>
<p>So, how do we practice this approach? Here&#39;s how I do it.</p>
<p>When I&#39;ve been tasked to design <em>and</em> build something, I stop coding and walk away from my workstation.</p>
<p>Next, I try to turn on that &#34;right brain&#34; by putting on some music and going somewhere new, like a coffee shop or a desk by a window. </p>
<p>Then, I start designing! With a large notebook, pencil, and eraser, I set a timer and keep drawing until the timer is up. Hand drawing is ideal because everyone can do it, it&#39;s fun, it encourages simplicity, and it&#39;s easy to start over. When the timer ends, I show the work to someone or wait a while and review it with fresh eyes. The result is consistently better than something I would have built while staring at the code.</p>
<p>Finally, I build my design. No cheating! Resist talking yourself out of a detail you drew because it&#39;s hard to build. Honor the design just like a designer would expect.</p>
