    <h1>Inflation is at a 40 year high. What can history teach us?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="sectionPara"><div><p>Inflation measures the change in cost of living from one year to the next. So ideally, inflation would be low and stable. But economic shocks, like the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause inflation to increase sharply.</p><p>While today&#39;s inflation is high, we&#39;ve seen it worse before. Lessons from previous shocks could indicate how this period might play out.</p></div></div></div></div>
