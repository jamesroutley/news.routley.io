    <h1>Why I recommend Renovate over any other dependency update tools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you&#39;ve read my blog before, or interacted with me at work or in the Open Source world, you&#39;re likely to know that I&#39;m a huge fan of <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/">Renovate</a>.</p><p>For those that aren&#39;t aware, Renovate is one of the big players in dependency updating tooling, commonly seen in comparisons with Dependabot or Snyk.</p><p>I&#39;ve been using Renovate for the last ~5 years, alongside a mix of Dependabot and Snyk to keep me grounded. I <em>absolutely love</em> Renovate, and make a point of making it so I can run Renovate where possible.</p><p>I&#39;ve also had the experience operating Renovate in self-hosted mode as well as used <a href="https://developer.mend.io">the hosted Renovate app by Mend</a> and the Mend Enterprise SAAS, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/jvt.me/-/issues/1349">plan to</a> blog about the lessons learned self-hosting Renovate.</p><p>Renovate has some really key features that set it apart from the competition, and I&#39;m sure in the time it&#39;s taken me to write this, they&#39;ve shipped some new ones üòª</p><p>(Aside: I&#39;m largely writing this blog post now, as I&#39;ve recently been shouting the benefits of Renovate, and instead of writing another internal-only document at work (as I did at Deliveroo), I wanted to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/">write it as a form of blogumentation</a>).</p><h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2><p>A few years back, I wrote about <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/09/26/whitesource-renovate-tips/">some tips for using Renovate</a> to make keeping your software up-to-date easier, which I still stand by.</p><p>Since then, I&#39;ve worked across a number of different ecosystems, repository sizes, and levels of comfort merging dependency updates, and have learned a few more things about effectively using Renovate - but through it, I&#39;m still very sure of Renovate being the best tool in the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="configurability">Configurability</h2><p>Renovate is <em>extremely</em> configurable, with <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/">dozens of configuration options</a> to tune your experience. But Renovate doesn&#39;t end up being &#34;too&#34; configurable, where you end up spending more time tweaking config than doing the changes, but configurable enough that it&#39;s very likely you can do what you need to with it.</p><p>This is something that really hit me when we were rolling out Dependabot at Deliveroo, where my team owned ~30 repositories, and so for each of these repos, we needed to hand-craft a <code>dependabot.yml</code>, as Dependabot needs to be told which directories contain which dependencies, and how often to update them.</p><p>After we&#39;d had about a week of usage, we started needing to tweak the configuration in a few of them to reduce the noise, which then required us to raise PRs across all the repos and get them updated.</p><p>Because Dependabot requires a bit of a snowflake configuration per repository, this wasn&#39;t easily automatable, even with <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/01/21/bulk-git-repo-changes/">great tools available to automate some of the bulk updates</a>, which made this a rather onerous and frustrating process.</p><p>Compare this to Renovate, where there&#39;s an excellent first-class support for <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/">shareable config presets</a>, in which you can &#34;extend&#34; multiple configuration(s).</p><p>This allows a team that wants to have consistency (i.e. in how often they receive updates to the AWS and Google Cloud SDKs, or which labels they want on PRs) to create a shared preset for their team that defines this. Then, each of their repositories can &#34;extend&#34; this configuration, as well as defining their own configuration on top of it at a repo-specific level.</p><p>This also makes it possible to provide good guardrails for your organisation, providing a good set of defaults, such as a <code>base.json</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This then allows defining a somewhat opinionated good starting point for teams with a <code>default.json</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>&#34;$schema&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json&#34;</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, teams only need to set the following in their repos&#39; <code>renovate.json</code>, and they&#39;ll have the benefits of onboarding with a lot of the hard work done with starting:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And that&#39;s it üëè</p><h2 id="good-defaults">Good defaults</h2><p>Linking back to the comment about having to hand-craft <code>dependabot.yml</code>s, the great thing about Renovate is that there&#39;s some great defaults, and that it can autodetect the ecosystems your repo uses, and appropriately raises PRs.</p><p>This ease of onboarding is truly excellent, and you can even have <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/#repository-onboarding">an onboarding PR</a> raised to your repos to make it even simpler.</p><p>For instance, at Deliveroo, we made it so <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/01/30/renovate-global-defaults/">there was a default set of configuration for all repos</a> to give us an easy means to update Docker images, but then if teams wanted to manage everything, they could add a <code>renovate.json</code>, and it&#39;d be more fully featured.</p><p>Additionally, Renovate comes with some great inbuilt configuration in the form of presets, including <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/">a &#34;best practices&#34; guide</a> and associated preset, which makes it easier to keep on top of community best practices, without needing to bikeshed about what you think is best.</p><p>If you find that <code>config:best-practices</code> is a little too much, there&#39;s <code>config:recommended</code> as a starting point, and you can always downgrade or exclude rules you&#39;d prefer not to follow. Or if you <em>really</em> want to control things <code>config:base</code> is the minimum you should pull in.</p><h2 id="grouping">Grouping</h2><p>As suggested above, it&#39;s possible to tune how different packages get updated, where you can <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/noise-reduction/#package-grouping">group multiple updates into a single PR</a>.</p><p>For instance, let&#39;s say that you use 9 different AWS services in your application, and instead of receiving 9 PRs every time there are updates across the SDKs, you want a single one. In this case, you could craft the following Renovate configuration:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>&#34;$schema&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json&#34;</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>      <span>&#34;groupName&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;aws-sdk-go&#34;</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What&#39;s great about this is that you can also bundle things like all patch updates into a single PR:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>

Something I find great about Renovate is that, as well as managing <code>Dockerfile</code>s, <code>build.gradle</code>s, <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>, etc, it will <em>also</em> manage things your <code>.ruby-version</code> or configuration for the ASDF version manager.</p><p>But what about some of the non-standard, or organisation-specific means for tracking versions?</p><p>For instance, installing the <code>golangci-lint</code> linting tool recommends using <code>curl | sh</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="makefile"><span><span><span>$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>	curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh <span>|</span> sh -s -- -b <span>$(</span>GOBIN<span>)</span> v1.57.2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And it&#39;s common for <code>Dockerfile</code>s to have a definition of the version of dependencies:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="docker"><span><span><span>ARG</span> <span>MONGODB_VERSION</span><span>=</span><span>6</span>.0.4<span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or what if you have a custom deployment configuration like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span># this is an (imaginary) company specific deployment configuration file</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>application</span><span>:</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It&#39;s very unlikely that you have these supported by other tools out-of-the-box, and Renovate is the same.</p><p>But Renovate <em>does</em> give you the ability to manage these versions yourself.</p><p>Using Renovate&#39;s <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/regex/">custom managers</a> we can craft a configuration file such as:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>

However, if you&#39;re not getting to your updates as often as changes are going in, you may have a tonne of PRs constantly building, which is a waste of energy and CI minutes.</p><p>Instead, you can use the Dependency Dashboard for its ability to i.e. <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/dashboard/#require-approval-for-major-updates">require major bumps be gated behind a manual approval</a>, as it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll need some human interaction for that PR, and can then only raise it when you&#39;re actually ready to deal with it.</p><h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2><p>A very important factor to me is that Renovate is Open Source, and open to community contributions.</p><p>Although it&#39;s probably best to be split into another article, I love the AGPL3, and it&#39;s a great way of making sure that anyone hosting Renovate as a platform makes sure that their users get the access to the source code.</p><p>Alternatively, Snyk is proprietary, and Dependabot is source available (or at a stretch &#34;open source&#34; not &#34;Open Source&#34;) with <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core?tab=readme-ov-file#license">a license</a> that doesn&#39;t even appear on the SPDX license list.</p><p>Renovate is also brilliantly set up as a community project, where they&#39;re shipping hundreds of PRs a month, alongside managing the community really well. I&#39;ve seen a few things change in the last few years I&#39;ve been more actively contributing, and it&#39;s a really well run project and an indication of something I&#39;d love to be able to replicate at some point!</p><p>It also helps that <a href="https://mend.io">Mend</a>, the company behind Renovate, invests a fair bit of time and money into development of the project, as well as their commercial offerings on top of it, which continue to make the project sustainable and remain Free and Open.</p><h2 id="great-documentation">Great documentation</h2><p>Following on from the excellent community and maintainer contributions alike, there&#39;s also some really excellent work on a technical writing and documentation point of view, which makes a lot of tasks straightforward to solve.</p><p>If there&#39;s something a little more complex or custom than the docs can offer, it&#39;s usually something that can be answered by the community in a GitHub Discussion, and likely could turn into a docs improvement, if necessary.</p><p>There&#39;s even a great <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/bot-comparison/">comparison table between Renovate and other dependency update bots</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/">tips on how best to update your projects</a>.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently discovered a few pages and features that I wasn&#39;t aware, just by going through the docs.</p><h2 id="overall">Overall</h2><p>In summary, there&#39;s just so much that makes Renovate a greater choice than any of the alternatives, and I&#39;m sure I could talk about more things that make it great.</p><p>Whether you self-host it for maximum control (such as being able to access internal artifact registries), or run the hosted app for ease of operations, or just run it from the command-line once in a while, it can be hugely useful to your experience as an engineer.</p><p>I hope you&#39;ll check it out!</p></div></div>
