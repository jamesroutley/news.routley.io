    <h1>Ask HN: I just want to have fun programming again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve written in many very different languages in a professional full-time capacity in my many-year career. Now I&#39;m interested in building something new and I have a clear idea in mind with some code already in C++ to proof-of-concept it for myself, but I&#39;m struggling to find a direction forward that would be... fun. I don&#39;t mind challenging work, but I like an environment that feels sane and logical and where I am not facing loads of incidental complexity along the way. I&#39;m also attracted to implementing my app cross-platform.</p><p>I just want to have some fun writing something without headaches, and that is seemingly less and less easy to achieve today. I&#39;m not a fan of the complexity of either JavaScript or C++, and while I very much like Swift and working in the UIKit world, it&#39;s not so portable to platforms that many use.</p><p>I feel like there aren&#39;t really any good options in software development any more. It&#39;s always one big compromise with lots of possible decision fatigue. Every direction has drawbacks.</p><p>If I could write an app in a good static-compiled language that did not require extraneous expertise in CSS but that shipped on a web page and looked good using tools only in that language, with good interop with an HTML Canvas, that would be one possibility, but it is again a compromise -- no <i>easy</i> multithreading, dealing with all the front-end baggage to bundle or deploy such an app, etc.</p><p>Any recommendations? I&#39;m not afraid of learning an entirely new language too.</p></div></div></div>
