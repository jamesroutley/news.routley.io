      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>My dad got really sick a few months ago. I was shocked but also panicked about the idea of him dying without me knowing him well. He was a great dad but didn&#39;t talk much.<p>Fortunately, he got better for a short time. I seized the opportunity to ask him as much as he could answer and film him. Of course, his memory wasn&#39;t perfect but I got the big picture.</p><p>Now that he passed away, I&#39;m both devastated and glad that I got to know him more and kept a record so I can see his face and listen to his voice for more than the usual family video. I wish I had done it sooner though.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard multiple people tell me they don&#39;t know their parents&#39; or grandparents&#39; life, or they&#39;ve heard it  but they&#39;ve eventually forgotten so I thought I&#39;d share. I hope this will help some of you.</p><p>Thank you blood donors</p><p>Thank you dad</p></td></tr>
