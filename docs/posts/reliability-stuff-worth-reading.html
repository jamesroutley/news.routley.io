<p>
Just a short note: I'm not 
<a href="https://nitter.net/MosquitoCapital/status/1593541177965678592">Mosquito Capital</a>,
and I'm not sure who it is.  I can make some educated guesses based on 
the lingo, and I'm pretty sure I worked with them in the past.

It doesn't really matter who they are though, since what they are saying 
is spot-on and you should pay attention if you're in this kind of 
business.

Go read.  It's good.  Be sure to hit "more replies" when you get to
