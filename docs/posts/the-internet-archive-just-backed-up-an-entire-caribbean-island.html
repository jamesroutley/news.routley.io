    <h1>The Internet Archive Just Backed Up an Entire Caribbean Island</h1>

There were works to be scanned across the world, including in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and other islands like Curaçao. Establishing a hub to find the documents online has been especially helpful, Scholing notes, for researchers located abroad, who no longer have to travel to Aruba to physically dig through archives.</p><p>It’s unusual for a country to outsource this sort of project to a foreign nonprofit. “In a dream world, every national library would have enough funds to bring on an amazing team of people,” says University of Waterloo history professor Ian Milligan, who is writing a book on the Internet Archive’s origins, and was not involved in the Aruba project. “Governments often don&#39;t have that.”</p><p>The Internet Archive has not previously acted as custodian of a country’s whole collection, although it has worked with a number of national and regional libraries around the world. Back in 2011, it partnered with the Culture Office of Bali, an island province of Indonesia, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/brewster-kahle/">preserve</a> what the office described at the time as “90 percent of Bali’s literature.” (This now makes up the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/Bali">Balinese Digital Library</a> collection.)</p><p>Aruba’s archivists hope other nations will follow in its digital footsteps. “It’s a really feasible model that could be applied to a lot of small islands, developing states, even bigger countries with limited means,” Scholing says.</p><p>Partnering with the Internet Archive looks like an obvious solution for cash-strapped archivists. Potential partners do need to think, though, about what it means to rely on another country’s private organization, one with its own challenges.</p><p>“When we think about digital preservation, we often think of the technical challenges,” says Milligan of Waterloo. “But I think the biggest challenges are the social challenges, the human challenges. How can you set up an organization that will be here in 50 years?”</p><p>He credits the Internet Archive with a very “sustainable structure,” in terms of future-proofing. But that doesn’t make it wholly invulnerable. The Archive is currently facing a number of serious legal challenges, including <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/music-labels-sue-internet-archive-over-digitized-record-collection-2023-08-12/">a lawsuit</a> from major record labels, including Universal Music Group, Capitol, and Sony, that poses an existential threat—the labels are asking for damages that could amount to over $400 million.</p><p>The Internet Archive sees Aruba’s endorsement as especially timely. “It&#39;s been really empowering to see that the nation of Aruba is continuing to add materials and upload content at the same time that we&#39;re facing this,” Freeland says. “We’re in this for the long haul.”</p></div></div></div></div>
