          <p>A lawyer representing MyPillow and its CEO Mike Lindell in a defamation case admitted using artificial intelligence in a brief that has nearly 30 defective citations, including misquotes and citations to fictional cases, a federal judge said.</p>
<p>&#34;[T]he Court identified nearly thirty defective citations in the Opposition. These defects include but are not limited to misquotes of cited cases; misrepresentations of principles of law associated with cited cases, including discussions of legal principles that simply do not appear within such decisions; misstatements regarding whether case law originated from a binding authority such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; misattributions of case law to this District; and most egregiously, citation of cases that do not exist,&#34; US District Judge Nina Wang wrote in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.309.0.pdf">order to show cause</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wang ordered attorneys Christopher Kachouroff and Jennifer DeMaster to show cause as to why the court should not sanction the defendants, law firm, and individual attorneys. Kachouroff and DeMaster also have to explain why they should not be referred to disciplinary proceedings for violations of the rules of professional conduct.</p>
<p>Kachouroff and DeMaster, who are defending Lindell against a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.4.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by former Dominion Voting Systems employee Eric Coomer, both signed the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.283.0.pdf">February 25 brief</a> with the defective citations. Kachouroff, representing defendants as lead counsel, admitted using AI to write the brief at an April 21 hearing, the judge wrote. The case is in the US District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>
<p>&#34;Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation, or suggested that it was a &#39;draft pleading,&#39;&#34; Wang wrote. &#34;Not until this Court asked Mr. Kachouroff directly whether the Opposition was the product of generative artificial intelligence did Mr. Kachouroff admit that he did, in fact, use generative artificial intelligence.&#34;</p>
