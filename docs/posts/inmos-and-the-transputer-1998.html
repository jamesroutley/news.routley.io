    <h1>Inmos and the Transputer (1998)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>This is an edited version of part of the talk given by <b>Iann Barron</b> to the Computer Conservation Society of the British Computer Society in 1998.</p>

<hr/>
<div>
<p>It&#39;s the story of the UK&#39;s attempt to become a force in the emerging microprocessor industry of the 1970s, told by the man who was the driving force behind it.</p>
<p>In the first part Iann Barron describes how Inmos came into being and the thinking behind the revolutionary transputer.</p>
</div>
<hr/>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

<p>My story starts before Inmos. After working on the Modular One 
computer, I retired gracefully when I was 37. That was in 1974. I stayed 
retired for four weeks before I decided that I ought to do something else. 
I set myself three objectives.</p>

<p>The first was fairly ambitious. I didn&#39;t think much of the team at the 
Department of Industry and I decided it would be nice to get a new one. </p>

<p>The second was even more ambitious; I decided that what we really 
needed was a Minister for Information Technology, so I went around 
advocating this vociferously for several years.  We did eventually get one, 
although it proved to be just the one - Kenneth Baker was our only 
Minister for Information Technology. Fortunately he was around at just 
about the right time for Inmos. I don&#39;t know what he did for the rest of the 
world, but he was quite helpful to me.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it seemed clear to me that microprocessors were the future, so I 
wanted to become an expert in that field. I eventually ended up doing 
consultancy for Intel, Motorola and Texas Instruments, which fairly well 
covered the waterfront.</p>

<p>At the same time, I became interested in parallel processing and models of 
parallel processing. I spent some time at Queen Mary College and other 
places looking at how one might split up computations and implement 
them more effectively.</p>

<p>It was out of that work that the idea of the transputer grew, so the 
transputer was around before Inmos. I&#39;m going to move backwards and 
forwards between the transputer and Inmos because it is necessary to 
take the two together in order to understand what happened.</p>

<p>Inmos was a complete accident, as far as I was concerned. It started when 
I was asked to organise a session on the future of computing for a 
conference in Toronto in 1977. I decided to ask experts from each of 
several different areas of computing to give their vision of the future.</p>

<p>I realised I needed someone to talk about semiconductors, which were 
clearly the driving force for computing at the time. I found a man called 
Petritz who had been at Texas Instruments and who had subsequently 
written a series of what I thought were very good papers looking at how 
the technology might develop. So I invited him to come along and talk.</p>

<p>Much to my embarrassment he never responded to my increasingly 
frantic communications. By the time I told the organising committee, it 
was a serious problem - they had already printed the programmes with his 
name among the speakers. Right up to the conference Petritz never made 
contact with me.</p>

<p>Just before the conference started, there was an air traffic controllers&#39; 
strike in Canada. So I got to Canada, as did many other people, by a 
devious route; I flew to Buffalo and was bussed from there to Toronto. I 
arrived at 3.30 in the morning.</p>

<p>The conference was due to start at 12 o&#39;clock that day. None of my 
speakers had arrived - it was complete chaos - and by this time I&#39;d been on 
my feet for some 30 hours. The conference had opened before my speakers
eventually arrived, but they did include this man Petritz, whom I&#39;d 
asked to lecture and who had never contacted me.</p> 

<p>My session was immediately after the opening ceremony and was really 
exciting. I had never managed such a large audience before - there were 
some 7,000 people. The hall was packed, the aisles were packed, the seats 
were packed - there were people everywhere.  And then Edsger Dijkstra 
made some very provocative comments about microprocessors; there was 
pandemonium; people were fighting in the aisles trying to get to the 
microphones.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I invited my speakers for a drink. We went out, found a 
darkened bar and settled down. I just wanted to go to sleep. Petritz sat 
next to me and after a few minutes he said &#34;Pssst! Want to start a new 
semiconductor company?&#34;</p>

<p>Petritz explained that he was planning to start a semiconductor company. 
He had hired someone to handle the memory side of the business, and he 
wanted me to handle the microprocessor side. I never said anything - after 
36 hours without sleep, I was dead.</p>

<p>I did not see Petritz again for the rest of the conference. When it was time 
to leave Canada, the planes were flying again - the air traffic controllers&#39; 
strike had been declared illegal by the Government.</p> 

<p>I wanted to go to Austin, Texas.  Now, the way US Customs are handled 
in Canada, you have to go through US Customs in Toronto or Montreal, 
rather than when you reach your US destination. I was dressed fairly 
casually, and the US Customs people wouldn&#39;t let me through. They asked 
for evidence that I was going to Austin, and I didn&#39;t have any because it 
was in my case and my case was on the plane.</p>

<p>So they refused to let me on the plane. Impasse! Then Petritz turned up 
and said &#34;I know him! You let him on the plane&#34;. So we got on the plane 
and sat down together, and he explained his idea for a semiconductor 
company.  I said no, I wasn&#39;t all that interested, because I didn&#39;t want to 
leave the UK. His parting line was &#34;If you can raise the money in the UK 
you can have part of the company there&#34;. I thought, &#34;Maybe I can&#34;. That 
is how Inmos started.</p>

<p>In the UK I had been consulting for the National Enterprise Board (NEB). 
This was the vehicle set up by the Labour government to improve 
industrial performance. I&#39;d done various jobs for them. They had asked 
me to look at reorganising the minicomputer industry and I told them it 
was a waste of time. They had also asked me to look at reorganising the 
semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>When I got back to the UK I told them, &#34;Maybe I do have an idea how 
you can do something for the semiconductor industry. We could set up 
an operation in the US. We could acquire the technology, bring it back to 
the UK and, hey presto, you&#39;ve got a semiconductor company.&#34; That idea 
turned into a two hour presentation two days after I had come back from 
the US. The Chairman of the NEB said, &#34;Fine! Produce a credible 
business plan and we&#39;ll back you&#34;. So that was a pretty good start.</p>

<p>However, I had difficulty in producing a business plan. I had to go back to 
Dick Petritz, because he had the basic understanding of the costs of the 
business. And again, he went incommunicado - I couldn&#39;t get any 
information out of him. It wasn&#39;t until the end of November that I 
eventually made contact and he started to take an intelligent interest. He 
sent over a business plan, but it wasn&#39;t terribly good.</p>

<p>He was asking for $12,500,000, which didn&#39;t seem to be enough. So on 
the general principle that you need twice as much as you think, I doubled 
his figure; I also turned it into pounds for good luck. So, when I went to 
the NEB I asked for £25 million. They looked at me and said &#34;No, people 
always get it wrong, you should ask for twice as much&#34;. </p>

<p>If you start off with a plan for $12.5 million and have to convert it into a 
plan for £50 million, it&#39;s quite difficult to find a way to spend all that 
additional money. Fortunately, just before I produced the plan a new piece 
of equipment had been announced called a wafer-stepper, which replaced 
the original technique for exposing the photographic patterns on wafers. 
The merit of a wafer-stepper, as far as I was concerned, was that it cost a 
million dollars as opposed to $50,000, so I put them into the plan.</p><p>

It proved a great technical decision. That was the way the industry went, 
and we were there first. We not only had wafer-steppers, we actually 
cornered the market. When the other companies realised they wanted 
them, our orders filled the world&#39;s production capacity, so they couldn&#39;t 
get them.

</p><p>So a $12.5 million business plan was escalated into a £50 million plan, 
which I happily constructed over Christmas while playing Monopoly with 
my children. The NEB read the plan and agreed to back it.</p>

<p>There was still the minor problem of convincing the Labour Government 
that they ought to back the idea, because it was obviously politically very 
sensitive. It took three months to square the system. The person who 
objected most was Tony Benn, the MP for Bristol - a bit ironic in view of 
what happened subsequently. He objected to Americans getting rich out of 
the British Government. Eventually what happened was simply that Jim 
Callaghan said &#34;We&#39;ll do it&#34;. And they did.</p>

<p>So the funding arrived just a year after the original discussions in August 
1977. The first thing that happened was that I was given a £5,000,000 
cheque to put into the bank. I went home with it, and my kids rifled my 
wallet that night and found the cheque inside. They assumed it was my 
money; sadly, it wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>That was how Inmos started, completely by accident, although there was 
a clear rationale about what we were trying to do.</p>

<p>Now, one of main the elements of the Inmos plan was the transputer. As I 
have said, this concept had arisen out of the work that I had been doing on 
parallel processing. It was an attempt to create a thoroughly modern 
microprocessor.</p>

<p>Strategically, I was trying to sidestep the two principal competitors in the 
market: Motorola and Intel. I knew that if we went head-on with them we 
wouldn&#39;t have a hope because the market dynamics favoured de facto 
standards. </p>

<p>At that time both Intel and Motorola operated in a very predictable way. 
They each had two microprocessor development teams; it took four years 
to develop a microprocessor chip; so there was a new generation 
microprocessor every two years. Everybody knew pretty much what the 
performance would be because the progress of the technology was so well 
understood.  I also knew what the microprocessors were going to be like 
because both Intel and Motorola were locked into supporting machine 
code and they didn&#39;t have any manoeuvrability to change the underlying 
architecture or instruction set. </p>

<p>So I knew exactly what was the competition would do. What I was 
aiming to do with the transputer was to find new markets which would 
straddle the market that Intel and Motorola controlled, so that when we 
got ourselves properly established we could swing back in and attack 
them in their established market.</p>

<p>I aimed to compete in two areas. One was embedded applications, the 
second was parallel processing. These have a common theme because 
they both require a chip which is concerned with interacting with things 
outside itself. What I was trying to do was to find better ways to make 
chips that could interact with external events, and particularly to try to do 
this more consistently and more formally, so there would be fewer errors 
in the programs that were written.</p>

<p>The intention with the transputer was to make improvements on all fronts. 
We didn&#39;t intend to do anything revolutionary. Instead we wanted to get 
the odd 10%-20% gain from many different areas, although we probably 
went a good deal further than 20% in a number of areas.</p>

<p>The first thing that we decided, which was at that time revolutionary, was to 
use CMOS technology. Microprocessors had originally been implemented 
using p-channel technology and then using n-channel technology.</p>

<p>CMOS gave us a number of advantages. It gave us an important power advantage 
- chips at that time were getting pretty hot and power management was 
important. It gave us much easier design methods, and it gave us much greater 
predictability of the way the circuits worked. (The n-channel circuits of the day 
were pretty analogue in their behaviour, whereas CMOS contained real digital 
circuits which behaved in a predictable and controllable fashion, so you could put 
lots together without getting electrical problems).</p>

<p>The second thing we decided was to use a formal design process.  People 
were having a great deal of difficulty in designing microprocessors and 
getting them correct. Most microprocessors did not work as intended, 
while a lot of them had serious design flaws. That meant that the 
development process had a lot of iterations. We figured that if we went to 
a formal design process we could get a useful development cycle 
advantage over the competition.</p> 

<p>The third decision was to use a proper CAD system to design 
microprocessors. The way it was done at the time was largely using a 
circuit analysis tool which only did the analogue design. It didn&#39;t tell you 
anything about large scale digital circuitry. The only trouble was that 
there were no commercial design tools available.</p>

<p>So one of things Inmos did, which has never been visible to the outside 
world, was to develop a major suite of CAD software which designed 
everything down to the transistor level. That was the fundamental thing 
that enabled us to deliver our microprocessors.</p>

<p>We had to do even more than this because, at the time, workstations were 
not available. So, we had to design our own around the Motorola 68000 
to provide us with the necessary computing power to put on the desk of 
the designer and deliver each aspect of the design process.</p>

<p>Sadly, about two years after we started, CAD workstations emerged in 
the marketplace. Had they been there earlier we would have been 
delighted to buy them. By the time they came out, we were locked into our own 
custom systems which we had to stick with for several years thereafter.</p>

<p>We were worried about clock speeds, so we employed a system where we 
generated clocks internally on a free-running oscillator. That was synched into an 
internal clock which ran at a much slower speed. This was an essential part of the 
design concept; if there are a large number of interconnected chips disseminated 
across multiple boards, we had somehow or other to design a system which was 
coherent in spite of the fact that we could not fully synchronise the clocks.</p>

<p>We also decided to do something about microcode. Typical microcode, which 
was the way that control systems and microprocessors were implemented 
at the time, was very sparse and essentially had a set of wires going one way 
saying &#34;this is an event&#34; and another set going at right angles saying &#34;this is a 
control signal&#34;. This meant that the microcode was mostly space with nothing 
useful in it. We devised a method of compacting the microcode so that we could 
make a microcode ROM which was about a fifth the size of any of our competitors. 
That was a big space advantage. </p>

<p>Also, because the transputer was a computer on a chip, it was going to have a 
processor and memory, and so we had the enormous advantage that we had an 
internal memory interface.  If you look at a microprocessor system, the thing 
that slows it down is moving information off the chip and into the 
memory system and then from the memory back onto the chip. If you can 
get the memory system onto the same chip as the microprocessor, you 
can run the two at a very much higher speed. So we were able to go a lot 
faster than anyone else because we put as much memory as we could onto 
the chip itself.</p>

<p>The last technical thing we did was to go to the idea of a Reduced 
Instruction Set (Risc), though it wasn&#39;t called that at the time. We went 
away from the Complex Instruction Sets (Cisc) that were in 
microprocessors at the time to something very much simpler and therefore 
very much faster and very much cheaper to implement. This also had the 
advantage that it reduced the size of the chip. </p>

<p>Essentially all of those techniques worked and we were successful in what 
we were trying to do.</p>

<p>There was a similarly well thought out strategy for the memory business.</p>

<p>Our first objective was to make static RAM, the high performance 
memory which made the computers of the time and subsequent 
microprocessors really work. This was an interesting market because 
there was only one company, Intel, making static RAMs. Intel controlled 
the market, and made an enormous amount of money out of their 4K 
devices. There were a number of Japanese companies looking at the 
market. We thought we could get in there and do a good job. Another 
factor was that it was much easier to design a static RAM, and required 
less process development, so that we could get to market more quickly.  
So our fundamental aim was to hit the 16K static RAM market first, 
before Intel or the Japanese. We thought the static RAM market was going 
to grow enormously with the computer business, as indeed it did.</p>

<p>Subsequently we intended to introduce specialised high performance 
dynamic RAMs, and then to have a third round of products based on 
innovative non-volatile memory technology. </p>

<p>However, as a business, what we were trying to do was severely 
misunderstood. At that time the next &#39;great challenge&#39; was the 64K 
dynamic RAM. So everyone, particularly the UK press, assumed the 
objective of Inmos was to make 64K dynamic RAMs. Then, as now, this 
wasn&#39;t regarded as a very profitable sort of business so everybody 
wondered what the hell we were doing. We had the problem that we were 
being slated in the UK for our stupid policy, and yet we did not want to 
reveal what we were actually doing.</p>  

<p>Our overall business strategy was to introduce a sequence of memory 
products and finally some five years out to introduce a microprocessor. 
Five years, because that is the length of time it really takes to produce a 
microprocessor, I&#39;m afraid. It was a pretty good business plan which 
convinced everyone.</p>

<p>The intention was to build a pilot plant in the US, develop the process 
technology there, and then build a large-scale plant in the UK, transfer the 
process technology across, and build the UK expertise in a viable way 
thereafter. I inadvisedly described this as a technology pump from the US 
to the UK - that got me into a lot of trouble with a lot of Americans.</p>

<p>Good as the business plan might be, it had weaknesses that were to cause 
Inmos continuing grief over the years.  The problems were to do with 
motivation and human nature.  What we were trying to create was not one 
but two start up companies, one in the US for memory products, and one 
in the UK for microprocessor products.  Starting one company is hard 
enough, starting two which need to be integrated in terms of 
management, technology and objectives is virtually impossible.</p>  

<p>It might not be obvious to an outsider, but there is very little commonality 
between a memory business and a microprocessor business. The process 
technology is different, the design philosophy is different (one involves 
analogue circuit design, the other involves the management of 
complexity), and the marketing is different (memory is sold to the 
purchasing organisation, microprocessors are sold to the design group).  
Even in well established companies like Intel, there were continual 
conflicts between the memory and the microprocessor businesses; so you 
can imagine what it was like for Inmos.</p>

<p>Then there are the cultural differences between the US and the UK.  Two 
nations divided by a common language is an understatement.  These 
cultural differences affected Inmos in all sorts of ways.  The most serious 
was the matter of expectation.  Americans are taught to be positive, they 
sell themselves and their achievements, often talking about what is 
intended to happen as though it is already achieved.  The British, by 
contrast, tend to be cautious, identifying all the potential problems and 
not making claims until they are entirely certain these are justified.  This 
meant that the Americans continually underestimated the achievements of 
the British, and the British continually overestimated the achievements of 
the Americans.</p>

<p>There was enormous conflict between the US and UK.  It was an 
underlying structural problem that went on for years. My US partners 
regarded the UK company as a tax on the investment capital they had 
received, and they wanted to lose the UK company as fast as they could. 
Clearly my motivation was somewhat different.</p>

<p>Now you would think that the motivation of the UK shareholders would 
have been the same as mine. Unfortunately both the NEB and the 
Government took the view that the Americans knew best, that the British 
didn&#39;t know anything about semiconductors and that we had to defer to 
them in every respect. That made my life extremely difficult. I had a 
continuing battle to stop production, resources and money moving from 
the UK to the US, and I wasn&#39;t getting any support from my seniors.  This 
was made more difficult because the microprocessor business was much 
longer term than the memory business, so there was a natural tendency to 
direct the available resources to the memory business, which meant to the 
US.</p>

<p>Initially there was a big debate about where Inmos should go in the UK 
and there was lots of political in-fighting about this. My basic 
management position was that it had to be somewhere near Heathrow 
because we were going to go backwards and forwards to the US every 
week. The political view was that the north-east or Scotland or 
somewhere like that would be better.</p>

<p>By the time the first recruitment advertisement was due to go out it had 
been agreed, very reluctantly, that we should locate in Bristol. I had been 
authorised to put the advertisement out, but on the evening before it was 
due to appear, I received a call from the Chairman of the NEB telling me 
the agreement had been withdrawn. I explained that the advertisement 
was already going out, so the Government machine went in motion and 
stopped the publication of the newspapers. The advertisement had been 
due to go into three or four newspapers; new copies were printed with a 
blank space where the advertisement should have been.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the good old <i>Guardian</i> didn&#39;t quite receive the instruction 
properly and they printed some papers containing the advertisement. Even 
more unfortunately, those papers were distributed in Newcastle and the 
surrounding areas. All hell was let loose! The cat was really out of the 
bag, but the company did end up in Bristol.</p>

<p>The advertisement headline was &#34;Go West young man&#34;, which led to 
further problems. Firstly, the sex equality people came along and said I 
should not be using the word &#34;man&#34;. Secondly, we had asked for 
&#34;computer architects&#34;; the Royal Institute of British Architects pointed out 
that the word &#34;architect&#34; was controlled by an Act of Parliament passed in 
1933, which specified that architects could design houses, landscapes or 
ships, but not computers.</p>

<p>We had a thousand replies to that advertisement. There were just three of 
us to sort them out, and that&#39;s how we got our original nucleus of 10 
people.</p>

<p>But we really built the company on new graduates. I had done the same 
with Computer Technology previously; it&#39;s the best way to build a 
company because new graduates are keen and enthusiastic, and they do 
not know what is impossible. You can ask them to do anything and they 
just go away and do it.</p>

<p>The plan had been to set up a prototype semiconductor plant in the US 
which was due to cost $12,500,000 (you might recognise that number!). 
The same thing happened; it turned into £12,500,000, and before you 
knew it there was £25,000,000 going into this US facility.</p>

<p>Well, that was not too bad. Sadly, something else happened during this 
time. We&#39;d set the company up in 1978; within six months the Labour 
Government which had funded us was no more and Mrs Thatcher was in 
control. Mrs Thatcher took a very dim view of Inmos. It was an 
embarrassment and a nuisance to her and she didn&#39;t want to know 
anything about it.</p>

<p>I need to go back slightly to explain a detail of our funding. When it had 
been agreed that £50,000,000 was the sum of money which should be 
invested in Inmos, the NEB put in a clause which they explained was 
perfectly reasonable ...  &#34;Look, we know that it has no effect, but we are 
going to split the investment into two tranches of £25,000,000 because it 
would look more prudent to the Government if we had control over the 
second £25,000,000. We, the NEB, understand very well that there will be 
no measurable results after the expenditure of the first £25,000,000 so 
we will have really no discretion but to give you that second 
£25,000,000. However it will look good politically.&#34; We agreed quite 
happily.</p>

<p>We were not so happy when the Government changed. We hadn&#39;t 
received the second £25,000,000 by then, and the Thatcher Government 
immediately said &#34;We&#39;re not going to provide it&#34;, which left poor Inmos 
with rather a nice US operation, some people in the UK thinking about 
microprocessors, but no other benefits or assets in the UK.</p>

<p>It took something like 18 months of very high profile argument before we 
got our second £25,000,000, and that severely damaged the UK aspect of 
Inmos because it delayed its progress by over a year while its US 
company was up, running and doing good things. However, we did 
eventually get the money.</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>We then had to build a semiconductor plant in the UK. The Thatcher 
Government said &#34;We&#39;re hands off. We don&#39;t involve ourselves with 
industry at all. We certainly wouldn&#39;t want to involve ourselves in any 
conflicts about where you locate the plant, but it had better be in South 
Wales&#34;! So that&#39;s where it went.</p>

<p>We got the facility up, we got the process in, and then we hit trouble. We 
couldn&#39;t make the process work. We could make integrated circuits but they 
were unreliable and when we did tests on them we found they suffered from 
metal fatigue, and a small proportion didn&#39;t function correctly.</p>

<p>We identified a particular piece of process equipment which we didn&#39;t think 
worked very well. However the American company insisted that the fault 
must lie with the management of the operation - no problem with their 
process - it was the people who were running it in the UK.</p>

<p>Then, three or four months later, at Christmas 1982, we had a severe 
disaster. A semiconductor plant depends upon using copious quantities of 
very pure water and has enormous de-ionising facilities for the water to get 
to absolute, or very near absolute purity. I was rung up on Christmas Day 
with news that the water was anything but pure and was getting worse.</p>

<p>Even though we were now almost in full production, we had to close the 
whole plant down. It was not at all clear what had gone wrong. Eventually, 
after about three days, we identified that the problem lay with the resins 
which were used for the de-ionisation process - basically chemicals in huge 
&#39;tin cans&#39;. The tin cans were about three metres in diameter and eight metres 
high. Something had gone wrong with them.</p>

<p>What we had to do - and this was all across the holiday period - was to 
physically dig out all this resin and get another lot trucked in and loaded. 
Virtually everybody in the company, including me, had shovels, and was 
standing in these great big tin cans shovelling resin.</p>

<p>The result was that the Americans said, &#34;These Brits don&#39;t know what 
they&#39;re doing. Get rid of them!&#34;. The semiconductor facility was taken away 
and put under the control of the Americans who were deemed to understand 
these things.</p>

<p>What had actually happened, as we found out three months later, was that on 
Christmas Eve the engineers at the local reservoir decided to celebrate. They 
were supposed to stay on site, so what they did was to dump 100 times the 
standard level of chlorine into the water supply, then go off and have a 
Christmas party. That chlorine totally ruined our semiconductor plant.</p>

<p>We had many further problems. One was with money, because the pound 
collapsed and so my original £50 million had halved in value by the time we 
got around to spending the second half of it. So we ran out of money. We 
then had another highly protracted and visible round of arguments with the 
Government before we managed to extract another £15 million which was 
necessary to compensate for the fact that the second £25 million had been 
delayed.</p>

<p>We had just one staunch ally in the Thatcher Government - Keith Joseph. 
He consistently supported Inmos, consistently argued our case, and went to 
the Cabinet three times to get this money. While he was doing this he was 
being slated in the UK press for his lack of support for Inmos. A sad thing.</p>

<p>We eventually got our money. We got our process up. We got our SRAM 
out and Inmos became very successful. We were making a lot of money, 
and we had very good prospects. But Mrs Thatcher decided she didn&#39;t want 
Inmos, so it was politically unacceptable to recognise that we had been 
successful.</p>

<p>We suffered a succession of press and parliamentary statements about how 
unsatisfactory Inmos was. We also had the requirement placed upon us as 
management that we try to buy the company. I can tell you that it is 
extremely difficult to find a buyer for a company when your major 
shareholder is the Government and is saying that you&#39;re no good.</p>

<p>Our American partners did actually find an American company, which 
offered to take Inmos off the Government&#39;s hands for a fee of £15 million. 
Incredibly, this was agreed. So I went to the then chairman of Inmos and 
said, &#34;Look this is totally wrong. We have a company that is doing 
extremely well and we have a deal which is being stitched up between an 
American company and our American partners to take it off the UK 
Government. For this they want to be paid - and then they are proposing to 
make a lot of money out of the US company.&#34;</p>

<p>My chairman said &#34;Yes, I understand all that but I can&#39;t do anything about it. 
If you want to do something I will treat this conversation as privileged&#34;. So I 
went to see Mrs Thatcher and I told her that if the deal went through, in six 
months there would be so much mud on the face of the Tory Government 
that it would do them no good. That stopped it!</p>

<p>Back at the ranch, we were still trying to develop the transputer. I had the 
problem that I was trying both to direct the technical development of the 
transputer and to cope with my American partners and an unsatisfactory 
political environment. It was not a very pleasant time in many ways.</p>

<p>Going back to the transputer itself, we had two technical gurus, David May 
and Robert Milne. They were just like chalk and cheese - completely 
different in their approaches.</p>

<p>Robert was substantially more clever than David, and David&#39;s quite clever 
enough. When Robert wrote his PhD thesis in Edinburgh his supervisor 
Robin Milner, who was not lacking academically, said he couldn&#39;t 
understand a word of, it but seeing that Robert had written it, it must be 
right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Robert did have the problem that he could not communicate 
very well with mere mortals. I spent my life trying to understand what it was 
he was saying. So we had a high level conflict between two people who 
were both very clear on their views on parallelism, one of whom had a 
simple vision and one of whom had a far more complicated vision.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to decide between the two. I had no hesitation, because 
David&#39;s position was basically where I had been some time before, but it 
was very painful at the time. Robert contributed a great deal to the 
underlying ideas and architecture of the transputer and he deserves 
recognition for that. Another thing he contributed, ironically, was the name 
Occam for our programming language.</p>

<p>In terms of process technology we had Peter Cavill from Marconi and 
Jonathan Edwards from Plessey. The depth of knowledge in the UK on 
process technology fundamentals was far better than in the United States, 
and most of the process ideas which were eventually developed came out of 
the UK company&#39;s microprocessor activities.</p>

<p>The CAD system and workstations were developed by Colin Whitby-
Strevens and the actual detailed implementation and layout of the transputer 
was done by a team under Miles Chesney.</p>

<p>We made an experimental microprocessor to prove the technique, to prove 
the design system, and to prove the process. We had to test a lot of the novel 
logical techniques that were being used inside. We made a cut-down version 
of the final transputer, without the on-chip memory and many of the more 
complicated instructions that relate to processes. We built a second chip to 
go with it which enabled us to take the outputs and display them; this drove 
a CRT display.</p>

<p>It all worked! Just like that! Bingo! I think we had one minor revision, but 
essentially we had produced a complex microprocessor which worked first 
time.</p>

<p>Essentially a transputer allows a set of programs or processes which are 
independent of one another to run concurrently, so that the processor is 
shared between a set of processes. The processors communicate with one 
another by a simple channel which passes messages and provides 
synchronisation.</p>

<p>We built the instruction set hardware so that what the programmer saw was 
effectively a set of parallel processes. The microprocessor implemented 
them and scheduled them. It did the scheduling in an optimally efficient way 
in terms of the number of times one swaps from one process to another. 
Again it all worked!</p>

<p>The trick was that we made sure that the communication between the 
processes that were running on a transputer was identical from a 
programmer point of view, whether it was done within one transputer or 
between multiple transputers. This meant it was invisible to the programmer 
whether he was using one transputer or several. The program was the same; 
it was just compiled in a different way depending how many transputers 
were being used.</p>

<p>Of course there was a performance overhead, and we put a lot of effort into 
ensuring that the overhead for going from one process to another was as 
small as possible. It was equivalent to something like three basic 
instructions, so we could have lightweight processes running very short 
programs with a negligible overhead. Some transputer applications were 
written with processes as small as 10 instructions.</p>

<p>The other thing we did was to create the Occam programming language, 
which directly mirrored the structure within the transputer. Occam was not a 
one-for-one assembly language; it was a high-level language built with 
predictability in terms of the length of time taken to execute any bit of 
compiled program.</p>

<p>All that was great. Everything worked just as the theory said it should. There 
was just one thing that went wrong - and that was the compilers.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that we were moving to a situation where we were going 
to have a programming language for our own internal purposes that 
effectively replaced an assembly language, but we expected that customers 
would want to program transputers in high-level languages.</p>

<p>That was a fundamental strategic goal from the beginning. It was obvious 
that people could not go on programming microprocessors in assembly 
language. There had to be a change.</p> 

<p>We thought that if we had a chip which was designed properly to support 
high level programming languages, we would then be in a very strong 
position when that change occurred, compared to our competitor companies 
who were locked into architectures designed for hand-coding, because for 
them it would be extremely difficult to exploit compilers. We were right 
about that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we had a problem - money! We had no money to develop the 
compilers we needed. Our funds had all been used up in the US. We tried to 
get away with using a cheap untried UK solution in which we were going to 
get three compilers generated from one basic piece of code - and it didn&#39;t 
work!</p>

<p>So by the time the transputer came to market everything was there, 
everything was right, except that we didn&#39;t have the compilers necessary to 
exploit the capability we had created. We never did get those compilers.</p>

<p>Reverting to the original business plan, the proposition that went to the NEB 
was to make an investment in a semiconductor company, to get it up and 
running, and establish a viable semiconductor business in the UK. Then the 
intention was to sell it off, doing away with the need for the NEB by 
refinancing Inmos in the UK as a UK company.</p>

<p>The plan said that this would happen in 1984. I had forecast that in that year 
Inmos would have a turnover of £150 million - which it did - that it would 
have a profitability of £12 million - I think we actually made £15 million - 
that the NEB would exit during the year, and that the company would be 
valued at £125 million. That is exactly what happened.</p>

<p>I bet nobody&#39;s ever produced a business plan and got it as right as that. I 
have to admit that if you look at the forecast for any one of the preceding 
years, they were totally and utterly wrong. But 1984 I got exactly right!</p>

<p>The Government was desperate for us to be privatised in some way, but they 
had no takers. I devised something I called the white pawn strategy. You&#39;ve 
heard of white knights - white pawns are the poor man&#39;s version. There was 
no company in the UK that looked like a white knight, but I did think there 
were perhaps half a dozen companies that we might persuade to invest in 
Inmos to provide an underlying resource to support their businesses.</p>

<p>One of these was Thorn EMI. Come the middle of 1984, the then Chairman 
of Thorn EMI, Peter Laister, started to get ambitious and wanted to acquire 
something significant. He bid for British Aerospace, failed, and attracted a 
lot of criticism. One bright young man in his private office said to him &#34;Why 
don&#39;t you buy Inmos instead?&#34;, and so he did, in less than a week.</p>

<p>He paid £125 million for Inmos. It was quite sudden, totally unexpected and, 
from my point of view, very surprising. I was called up one day and told 
&#34;There&#39;s this company that wants to buy you&#34;. I went to various meetings, 
the last of them at the Department of Industry offices in Victoria Street. It 
started about midday and went on until midnight at which point the deal was 
done.</p>

<p>I was excluded from most of the meeting. I had no direct involvement, and I 
was told, &#34;Just go down the corridor and find somewhere to sit&#34;. So I did. I 
sat down in an office and after about 10 minutes I started to look round and 
realised it was rather a grand office. I looked a bit more and realised there 
were papers on the desk. I was actually sitting at the Minister&#39;s desk. That&#39;s 
security for you!</p>

<p>Eventually I was called back into the meeting and was told the deal had been 
done. Peter Laister produced a transputer chip from his pocket, waved it at 
the assembled audience, which consisted of one person from the NEB, one 
from the Government and 50 lawyers and said, &#34;Look, I&#39;ve paid £125 
million for this&#34;.</p>

<p>There was one flaw. The business plan said that in 1984 not only would the 
company be sold, but that it would be refinanced, because we knew at that 
stage we would want money put in to expand our business further. But there 
was no refinancing, and no money went into Inmos. The £125 million went 
straight to the Treasury.</p>

<p>So from that moment on we had no cash to do anything. We couldn&#39;t 
advance the technology in any way. We couldn&#39;t develop our memory 
products. It was not really Thorn&#39;s fault. They shouldn&#39;t have bought Inmos 
- it was a really stupid thing to do, and Peter Laister was ousted from that 
company within three months. Thorn did try their best to look after us. It 
was just that they didn&#39;t have the kind of cash that was necessary to fund and 
run a large-scale semiconductor company.</p>

<p>We had been doing very well. Our static RAM products, in spite of the 
technical problems, had knocked Intel out of the market. We had something 
like a 60% share of the world&#39;s market for them and our only competitors 
were Japanese companies. We had dynamic RAMs of high performance, 
and we had transputers just about coming to market. So we were in a very 
good technical position. We just didn&#39;t have the money to exploit it.</p>

<p>There was one other unfortunate occurrence at this stage. Almost 
immediately after selling the company, it started to become apparent that 
some of our customers were having failures in their static RAM memory 
chips. This problem escalated, and after about six months it became clear 
that we had a serious reliability problem.</p>

<p>The problem was due to a faulty piece of equipment. Inmos was not the only 
company to suffer at that time and two or three semiconductor companies 
actually went under as a result. Which piece of equipment was it? Yes, 
you&#39;ve guessed it; it was the problem we had identified in the UK factory 
when we started to manufacture the static RAM in 1982. At that time, not 
only had the US taken over control and management of the UK factory, but 
they had also transferred production of the static RAM back to the US - it 
was a highly profitable product, and the company making the static RAM 
automatically had the better balance sheet. Heads rolled, and much of the 
US management was dismissed.</p>

<p>So we had to cut back the company and lost half our transputer design team. 
We tried to retrench in an appropriate management fashion and to create 
something valuable out of it, so we actually hived off some of our best 
people into a new company which then went into business making parallel 
computers.</p>

<p>The story got worse. Eventually I had the ironic situation where I was in the 
US running the US company and I had to sell it off. It was actually sold to 
Seymour Cray, whom I had spent quite a long time trying to convince of the 
value of the transputer.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t all doom and gloom because we had, as I have said, good 
technology. We had developed fundamental patents for static RAMs, for 
dynamic RAMs and for microprocessors, to the extent that every static 
RAM or dynamic RAM made involved a significant patent from Inmos. 
IBM was so concerned about our patent position in microprocessors they 
gave us rights to all their patents in return for rights in our patents.</p>

<p>Eventually dear old Thorn made something like £150 million to £200 
million out of the Inmos patents, which is hardly ever mentioned. They got 
their money back all right.</p>

<p>There were two other money spinners. Our dynamic RAM technology was 
very good, and we were able to licence it to a Japanese company and set up 
an automated manufacturing facility in Japan.  The other product was the 
second test chip we had made for the transputer. We persuaded IBM to use 
this as their next generation graphic chip, and it became embedded in the PC 
as the SVGA standard. Some of the oddities in the present Windows 
operating system stem directly from the way this chip was designed to work 
with the transputer.</p>

<p>But from the point of view of the transputer we did not have the resources to 
do what was necessary. We did do one clever thing which was to add a 
floating-point unit to the existing microprocessor. We exploited the 
improved process technology to be able to put on board a floating-point unit 
and again we used formal techniques. We were able to prove what we were 
doing and we were able to design a floating-point unit better than anything 
else on the market by a very long chalk. That gave us another couple of 
years lease of life.</p>

<p>The end came in 1989 when Inmos was sold to SGS Thompson. SGS 
Thompson was essentially a semiconductor company set up by the French 
and Italian Governments to do what Inmos had planned to do in the UK.</p>

<p>The Managing Director, Pasquale Pistorio, was very enthusiastic about the 
transputer. He thought it was an extremely good product and wanted to 
revive it. He was prepared to put a substantial amount of money in this. But 
there was a fundamental problem. No work had been done on the transputer 
in terms of implementation and design since about 1985, and this was 1989.</p>

<p>There were two routes that we could go down. One was to take the existing 
design and just re-implement it again in the latest process technology, taking 
advantage of various tricks and getting more memory on the chip and things 
like that. The most favourable view was that this could be done by 1991; my 
personal belief was that it would take at least a year or two years longer and 
would not be competitive.</p>

<p>The alternative was to start from scratch and design a new transputer, 
keeping the concept and making sure it was software-compatible and 
connectable and things like that, but changing the instruction set and being 
quite radical.</p>

<p>The quite radical thing was to put four transputers onto a chip. You could 
say that we were doing much the same thing as the very long instruction 
word microprocessors. We were going to produce a system with a full 64-bit 
internal bus with 32-bit addressing, four address units, four arithmetic units, 
and two 64-bit floating-point units. We were going to put a 50 Mbps link 
between the transputers and everything was absolutely divine. The trouble is 
that this would take a long time to do, and it wouldn&#39;t have been available 
until 1992 or 1993.</p>

<p>So there was no real way for the company to survive. A decision was made 
to go the route of re-implementing the existing design in the latest 
technology, and it was a failure as expected. That was the T9000 - it never 
really saw the light of day. That was the last of the transputer and very 
recently ST Microelectronics, as SGS Thompson has become, announced 
that there will be no more transputers, which is sad.</p>

<p>If we look back now, it is clear that Inmos was a glorious failure. It had 
enormous technical successes. The static RAM technology design is the way 
that the world now designs static RAM. The same thing is true for dynamic 
RAM technology. We had the transputer which was a unique design, and we 
had, as I have said, this very strong patent base. Our problem was the 
corporate failures.</p>

<p>The underlying issue was the control of the company. There were conflicts 
between the US and UK, which led to extreme mistrust. We had an 
antagonistic shareholder. Originally there were difficulties within the Labour 
Government, because there was one minister who objected - Tony Benn. 
Later our antagonistic shareholder was Margaret Thatcher.</p>

<p>I had a number of discussions with her aides about the problem. Mrs 
Thatcher continually said her aim was to support sunrise industries, and that 
she wanted to compete with the Japanese, and Inmos, of course, was doing 
all of those things. I was told that she had a very simplistic view towards life 
and liked to get things down to one basic idea. Her one basic idea about 
Inmos could not be changed, and that was that Inmos had been started by 
Tony Benn. Madam didn&#39;t like him very much.</p>

<p>At a management level we had the quality failures. There was also the 
underlying issue, which hits UK companies time and time again, that you 
can get the money to start, but when you get market success you really need 
more and you cannot raise it. What went wrong with Inmos more than 
anything else was the failure to get that second round of finance.</p>

<p>I think you will find that microprocessors in the future look more and more 
like transputers. You won&#39;t see it from the outside but it will be embedded in 
the way that they actually do their operations.</p>

<p>For all the problems, though, it was great fun, and I&#39;m glad I did it.</p>
