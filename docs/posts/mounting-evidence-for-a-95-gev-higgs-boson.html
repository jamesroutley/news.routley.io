      <span>Abstract:</span>  In 2018 CMS reported an excess in the light Higgs-boson search in the
diphoton decay mode at about 95GeV based on Run 1 and first year Run 2 data.
The combined local significance of the excess was $2.8\,\sigma$. The excess is
compatible with the limits obtained in the ATLAS searches from the diphoton
search channel. Recently, CMS reported another local excess with a significance
of $3.1\,\sigma$ in the light Higgs-boson search in the di-tau final state,
which is compatible with the interpretation of a Higgs boson with a mass of
about 95GeV. We show that the observed results can be interpreted as
manifestations of a Higgs boson in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model with an
additional real singlet (N2HDM). We find that the lightest Higgs boson of the
N2HDM can fit both excesses simultaneously, while the second-lightest state is
such that it satisfies the Higgs-boson measurements at 125GeV, and the full
Higgs-boson sector is compatible with all Higgs exclusion bounds from the
searches at LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC as well as with other theoretical and
experimental constraints. Finally, we demonstrate that it is furthermore
possible to accommodate the excesses observed by CMS in the two search channels
together with a local $2.3\,\sigma$ excess in the $b \bar b$ final state
observed at LEP in the same mass range.
