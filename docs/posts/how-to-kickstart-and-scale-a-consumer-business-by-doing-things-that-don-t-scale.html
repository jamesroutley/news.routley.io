However, the core seven strategies account for 99% of all B2C startups’ early growth.</p><p>Like with a menu, your job is to peruse this list, pick two or three items that seem appetizing, and try them. If something works, chow down. If not, try something else. </p><p>Note, almost every startup finds the vast majority of their early growth from just one or two channels. Some see all of their early growth come from just a single channel (e.g. Udemy and PR, Etsy and online and offline communities, Twitter and influencers). So my advice is to focus. Don’t order everything on the menu.</p><p>To make your decision even easier, here’s what I’ve found to be the three common archetypes of early startup growth:</p><p><strong>Typical path to first 1,000 users for consumer startups:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Reach out to friends and colleagues (e.g. email them, post on social media, call them)</p></li><li><p>Go where your target audience hangs out, online or offline (e.g. forums, Product Hunt, college campuses, Craigslist, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Enlist influencers</p></li></ol><p><strong>If you’re a marketplace or platform (e.g. DoorDash, Cameo, Substack):</strong></p><ol><li><p>Reach out to targeted strangers (e.g. DM celebs, email owners)</p></li><li><p>Get physical placement (e.g. stickers, flyers)</p></li><li><p>Enable your supply to drive your demand</p></li></ol><p><strong>If you have a remarkable story to tell (e.g. Airbnb, Spotify, Superhuman):</strong></p><ol><li><p>Get press</p></li><li><p>Try to create viral content</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank"

users, and a large driver of early growth for about 20% of startups, is to reach out to your friends and former colleagues.</p><p>There’s little downside to giving this a shot, but just don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t bear fruit, as your friends may not be anything like your super-specific who.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ideal for:</strong><span> Products that most people will find useful (e.g. Reddit, Facebook, Lyft)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Key:</strong><span> Your friends are close to your super-specific-who definition</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Takeaway question:</strong><span> Have you asked your friends to try out your product yet?</span></p></li></ul><p>Stories that show this tactic in action:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>Inviting people from our network (mostly former coworkers from PayPal) drove our initial users.</strong><span> We asked all our network to invite their friends, and being startup people who wanted to help us, they obliged, so two degrees out, we probably got to 1K or so users. The takeaway is not to underestimate the power of one’s personal referral network and to think deeply about the incentive and mechanics.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russel-simmons-9562/" rel="">Russel Simmons</a><span>, co-founder</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“Before we launched the Lyft waitlist, we first sent </span><strong>personal email invites to our friends</strong><span>.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycwarren/" rel="">Emily Castor Warren</a><span>, early employee</span></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp" width="1456" height="1026" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1026,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:117266,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/webp&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85603956-c43e-4cdf-8184-b08fff8333ab_1456x1026.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>[Mark]</strong><span> </span><strong>Zuckerberg’s friends made up most of the 10 first Facebook sign-ups, after which the social network expanded to friends of friends across campus</strong><span>.

We asked all those folks to try the v1 product and invite their professional contacts. In total that was maybe a couple thousand individuals.</strong></p><p>During the first seven days, most of the 12,000-odd people who signed up were either 1st degree (e.g. directly knew someone on the founding team) or 2nd degree (‘friend of a friend’ of someone on the founding team) connections.

He had been publishing Sinocism as a free newsletter for five years, and I was a reader. In 2017 he started telling his readers he was going to put up a paywall. This was around the time that Chris [Best] and I were talking about starting Substack. I asked Bill if he’d be interested in being Substack’s first publisher, and he said ‘Sure!’ So we built the first version of the product to suit his needs and iterated from there. Through suggestions from friends, and friends of friends, I also recruited Kelly Dwyer, formerly of Yahoo Sports and now author of </span><a href="http://tsa.substack.com/" rel="">The Second Arrangement</a><span>, and Daniel Lavery, one of the founders of The Toast and now author of </span><a href="http://shatnerchatner.com/" rel="">The Shatner Chatner</a><span>. They were the first three publishers on Substack. And from there, I kept asking smart friends, many of whom worked in media, for writer recommendations, and then in each call or meeting with a writer, I’d ask that writer for more recommendations.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamishmckenzie/" rel="">Hamish McKenzie</a><span>, co-founder</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>Quora launched in January 2010 with a user base largely composed of [Adam] D’Angelo’s and [Charlie] Cheever’s college and high-school friends</strong><span>, meaning there was a lot of early Quora information on the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Cheever was raised.

A number of employees had sold secondary stock. We thought, well, who are the best-connected people in Silicon Valley? It’s the people who work at the social networks. So we did three or four seminars at Facebook and LinkedIn where we educated people on investment best practices. Not Wealthfront, because we wanted to get the engineer as the earliest adopter because we thought they would provide the references to the less well-educated people on investing. What we know about engineers is they hate being sold. They’re like cats; they’re not like dogs. Salespeople are like dogs: they want to be petted and loved. Engineers do not want to be sold to.</p><p>So we did this beta test, I’ll never forget, with Adam D’Angelo of Quora and a few people at Quora, and the beta test we did of the seminar to eight people was 80% education and 20% selling. At the end of the seminar, Adam said, ‘Andy, you have to decide which one it’s going to be, because it can’t be both.’ He was absolutely right. That was the surprise.

The pair [Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia] saw an opportunity to capitalize on the quadruple-overattended event that caused a massive shortage in rental housing. Finding hosts to offer up rooms in their houses was actually the easy part. Getting people to rent those rooms proved more difficult.</span></p><p>The first counterintuitive strategy was to pitch only the bloggers with the smallest audience possible.... As ridiculous as it sounds, the coverage by these bottom-feeder press was the social proof that more-prominent publications needed to piggyback on the story. Eventually, national news networks, including NBC and CBS, were interviewing the founders of the unknown startup that was housing the biggest political convention in history.</p><p><strong>The DNC bump was great for business, but it only lasted a week</strong><span>. The founders were desperate for a way to extend the impact of the event. While sitting around their kitchen table one day, still extremely broke, they came up with the idea that would bring Airbnb to profitability: cereal.</span></p><p>Both designers who graduated from the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, the pair created fictitious cereals called ‘Obama O’s, the Cereal of Change’ and ‘Cap’n McCain’s, a Maverick in Every Box.’ They designed the box artwork themselves and convinced a student at U.C. Berkeley to print 500 units of each box on the cheap. The boxes were delivered as flat rectangles that had to be cut and assembled by hand.</p><p>‘I was thinking at the time, that Mark Zuckerberg was never hot-gluing anything at Facebook—so maybe this is not a good idea,’ recalls Chesky.</p><p>The founders sent boxes to hundreds of the most well-known tech bloggers, hoping that they would proudly display them on their desks and that they, or their colleagues, would eventually write their story. Shortly thereafter, they started selling the political cereal at $40 per box. The Obama O’s sold like hotcakes, so much so that they had to give out Cap’n McCain’s for free with each purchase.”</p><p><span>—</span><a

When I landed at Southern Methodist University, I took a picture of [a female friend] and then I took a picture of one of my guy friends on campus, and I dropped them into the match like the Tinder screens. And </span><strong>I wrote a big thing on top of it saying, ‘Find out who likes you on campus.’ I saved the file and I took it to the FedEx across the street from SMU, and we printed, I think, a thousand copies.

The further out from the center the founder gets, the harder (and less likely to succeed) these strategies generally are. So in your decision of where to start, start with the easy stuff and migrate outward if nothing is working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

startups kickstart growth. Though they’re rarely used, or only useful in very specific instances, I want to make this post as complete as possible. Below I’ve outlined four, and I’ll add any new strategies and stories as I learn of them. Here’s the list so far:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Build an audience first:</strong><span> Product Hunt, Stack Overflow, Patreon</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Enable your supply to drive your demand:</strong><span> DoorDash, Etsy, Cameo, Behance, Product Hunt, Substack</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Be first to figure out an emerging platform:</strong><span> Noom, TikTok, WhatsApp</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Host a launch party:</strong><span> Hinge</span></p></li></ol><p>Hopefully this bonus list feeds your creative juices.</p><p><strong>Product Hunt</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Product Hunt, a daily leaderboard of new products, began as an email list using Linkydink, a tool for creating collaborative daily email digests. […]</p><p>Over Thanksgiving break, we designed and built Product Hunt. Meanwhile, we reached out to contributors in the MVP and other respected product people, sharing early mocks and gathering feedback. We weren’t just doing customer development; we were getting them excited and making them feel like part of the product (and they were, helping guide our design decisions).</p><p>Five days later, we had a very minimal but fully functional product. We emailed our supporters a link to Product Hunt, informing them not to share it publicly. The supporters were thrilled to join and play with a working version of something they had thought about and, indirectly, helped build. That day, we acquired our first 30 users. […]</p><p>By the end of the week, we had 100 users and felt ready to share Product Hunt with the world.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanrhoover/" rel="">Ryan Hoover</a><span>, co-founder</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Patreon</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Jack [Conte] obviously had a huge plan to launch to his whole audience. And on top of that, he had this whole network of artists and creators, and we were going to be launching on day one with just millions of fans and artists talking about how you could support them on Patreon.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samyam/" rel="">Sam Yam</a><span>, co-founder, via </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954876726/patreon-jack-conte-and-sam-yam" rel="">How I Built This</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Stack Overflow</strong></p><blockquote><p>“The founders of Stack Overflow (Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood) both had large communities of existing followers from their previous online endeavors (Joel on Software and Coding Horror, respectively). They invited members of those communities to participate in a private beta, in which they seeded the site with content so it didn’t launch with no content whatsoever.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/25111/jon" rel="">Jon</a><span>, via </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76126/how-did-stack-overflow-get-started" rel="">Stack Exchange</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>DoorDash</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Restaurants did a lot of the marketing for us. They would actually print placards and stickers and put them up in the restaurant, without our help and often without us knowing. Stickers on the windows worked extremely well. Restaurant owners are enterprising entrepreneurs and are super-creative at driving demand.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/micahmoreau/" rel="">Micah Moreau</a><span>, early growth leader</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Etsy</strong></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>Sellers were doing their own grassroots marketing</strong><span>, and that became a big growth driver. Etsy pushed sellers to promote their shops to their communities in order to drive growth of their shops, which in turn drove growth of the marketplace overall.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickeyskarstad/" rel="">Nickey Skarstad</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcfunley/" rel="">Dan McKinley</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Cameo</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Ronnie Radke was a particular inflection point. The team went on famousbirthdays.com, and Steven [Galanis] looked up the most famous person on his birthday. It was Ronnie Radke. Steven got Ronnie Radke to respond and buy in. Ronnie said, ‘I’m going to break Cameo.’ This is something they would hear a lot, but Radke actually did it. He came on Cameo for $25 and started getting booked like crazy.”</p><p><span>ー</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devspinn/" rel="">Devon Townsend</a><span>, co-founder</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Noom</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Noom’s first product (way before my time) was the fourth app in the Android store when it launched, and as a result got a lot of organic downloads. Artem [Petakov] had a connection at Google at the time, which helped getting placed. The broader lesson is getting into a new channel early to get your first users.” </p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhiljhunjhnuwala/" rel="">Nikhil Jhunjhnuwala</a><span>, early growth leader and now VP of Growth</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>TikTok</strong></p><blockquote><p>“There was a secret in the App Store. You could make the application name really, really long. And the search engine on the App Store gives more weight to the application name rather than the keywords defined. So we put a really long application name, ‘make awesome music videos with all kinds of effects for Instagram, Facebook, Messenger.’ And then traffic came from the search engine. That’s how we initially got started.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keepsilence/?originalSubdomain=cn" rel="">Alex Zhu</a><span>, founder, via </span><a href="https://news.greylock.com/productsf-2016-b753fa9159b8" rel="">Greylock</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>WhatsApp</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Help came from Apple when it launched push notifications in June 2009, letting developers ping users when they weren’t using an app. Jan [Koum] updated WhatsApp so that each time you changed your status—‘Can’t talk, I’m at the gym’—it would ping everyone in your network. [Alex] Fishman’s Russian friends started using it to ping each other with jokey custom statuses like ‘I woke up late’ or ‘I’m on my way.’ </p><p>‘At some point it sort of became instant messaging,’ says Fishman. ‘We started using it as “Hey how are you?” And then someone would reply.’ Jan watched the changing statuses on a Mac Mini at his town house in Santa Clara and realized he’d inadvertently created a messaging service. ‘Being able to reach somebody halfway across the world instantly, on a device that is always with you, was powerful,’ says Koum.”</p><p><span>—</span><em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/02/19/exclusive-inside-story-how-jan-koum-built-whatsapp-into-facebooks-new-19-billion-baby/?sh=4c661d082fa1" rel="">Forbes</a></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“We took our last $25,000 and we threw a 2,500-person launch party in D.C. We set the date and we just worked backwards from that. […]</p><p>We were just like, we’ve gotta get everyone on at once. No one’s gonna stick around if there’s not a lot of people on this thing. We’re just gonna, like, get 2,500 people in here. They’re gonna be like the coolest, trendiest people in D.C. And they’re all gonna see each other downloading the app. And so they’re gonna think it’s cool and they’re gonna keep using it. </p><p>[We had an] open bar—Tito’s vodka just like shipped us a bunch of alcohol for free.
