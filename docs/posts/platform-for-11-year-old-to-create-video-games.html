    <h1>Ask HN: Platform for 11 year old to create video games?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>My 11 year old has a lot of interest in creating games. They are a very creative kid currently experimenting with using Power Point/Google Presentations to create a crafting and turn based combat style game but is running into the obvious limitations of this setup. They have some very rudimentary understanding of coding (together we recently created a command line version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock from scratch in Python and they were able to follow along the whole way), but I don’t think their best bet is to start with a code first platform just yet. Maybe something with scripting capabilities when they need them but mostly with the ability to create a point and click interface with something specific happening on each click.</p><p>Does anyone know what’s out there that would work for them in this case? FWIW I don’t know Lua but anything with JavaScript or Python built in would make it easy for me to help them. Thanks in advance!</p></div></div></div>
