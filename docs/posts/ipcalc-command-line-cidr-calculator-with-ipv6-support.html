    <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write about impostor syndrome for a while. It&#39;s something I have lots of thoughts about, and they often feel parallel to whatever emotions people seem to be describing.</p>
<p>I&#39;d describe the feeling of impostor syndrome as: &#34;<strong>I don&#39;t belong here, the others don&#39;t realize it, and it&#39;s going to be a problem when they find out</strong>.&#34; </p>
<p>As a preface/disclaimer: my parents are from 2 different countries (and continents), and I grew up in 3 other countries, going to international schools. 
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt a sense of full cultural belonging... ever. So in a way, I feel like I can&#39;t fully relate to the discomfort of not belonging -- it feels like it&#39;s always just been a fact of life, that whatever group I&#39;m in will only be able to relate to a fraction of my experience. </p>
<p>So I&#39;m not really interested in fixing the &#34;I don&#39;t belong here&#34; part, because I think that&#39;s not a problem in and of itself. But I have a pretty handy solution for rest of the sentence, which can be summarized as: &#34;keep it factual, friend.&#34;</p>

<p>When you are describing yourself, stick to the facts.</p>

#</a>The story</h2>
<p>When I made my transition into tech in 2019, I looked for my first developer job for a few months. I did lots of coding on my side projects, interview practice, and talking to my loved ones; and I also had a <em>lot</em> of interviews. I made it to onsites with 6 different companies before getting my first offer. </p>
<p>One thing I noticed, during my time interviewing, was that I kept getting better and more confident, despite the constant rejections. It was partly because I could tell that factually, I was on the right track. I was doing well with the whiteboarding, my projects seemed to impress interviewers, I was getting good feedback. In short, I was starting to be able to let my work speak for itself, and didn&#39;t have to fill in the gaps of self-doubt with bravado. </p>
<p>Semi-consciously, I was able to shift this approach into conversation as well. When asked a qualitative question, I would respond with quantitative facts and let my interviewer decide what that meant to them.</p>
<p>For example, if asked &#34;How comfortable are you with React?&#34;</p>
<p>Instead of responding &#34;pretty comfortable, although I&#39;m sure I have a lot to learn&#34; - which is what I felt, I&#39;d simply say &#34;It&#39;s the front-end framework I&#39;m most comfortable with. I&#39;ve built 3 projects with it, including one that involved a lot of different user interactions.&#34;</p>
<p>I&#39;d eliminate words like &#34;only,&#34; &#34;somewhat,&#34; or other diminishing qualifiers. In short, I&#39;d almost robotically stick to facts.</p>
<p>Then they could ask me more about it, and I could <em>show</em> my experience, and let them determine whatever they decided from that response.</p>
<p>A few months later, at my first dev job, a coworker and I were having lunch in the break room. He asked me if I felt impostor syndrome.</p>
<p>I responded &#34;no, not at all&#34;, and I fully meant it. I remember saying something like &#34;I may be a junior, but I showed exactly my level of competence in my interviews, and was hired for my job based on that, so... it&#39;s their funeral.&#34; </p>
<p>There was no reason to feel like others didn&#39;t know my true incompetence, or that they&#39;d get mad, because hey, they saw my incompetence live, and decided to hire me regardless.</p>
<h2 id="my-plan"><a href="#my-plan" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-plan">
#</a>My plan</h2>
<p>My plan was to eliminate my own doubt about my truthfulness. </p>
<p>When I describe myself qualitatively, I am making my own assessment, which (even though I consider it to be the truth) is relative. It gives me room, when I&#39;m feeling vulnerable, to anxiously question whether other people would see me totally differently than what I&#39;ve presented. When I stick to facts, I&#39;ve done my part to make sure everyone is on the same page, which lets me be vulnerable and be myself in the moments when I am struggling.</p>
<p>Nowadays, whenevers I start to feel like I don&#39;t belong technically, I try to remind myself - &#34;have I done anything to inaccurately represent my level of competence?&#34; and if not, then... why am I worried about it?</p>

<p>This one is a little bit late. I&#39;m getting back on track. There&#39;s another scheme post in the works that I&#39;ve been turning over in my head for weeks; it&#39;s a little more difficult to write, so I ended up releasing the one I&#39;d planned for H first. It should be coming soon.</p>
