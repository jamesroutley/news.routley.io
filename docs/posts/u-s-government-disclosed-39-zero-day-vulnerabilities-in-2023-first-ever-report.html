        <p><em>What the government didn&#39;t reveal is how many zero days it discovered in 2023 that it kept to exploit rather than disclose. Whatever that number, it likely will increase under the Trump administration, which has vowed to ramp up government hacking operations. </em></p><p>In a first-of-its-kind report, the US government has revealed that it disclosed 39 zero-day software vulnerabilities to vendors or the public in 2023 for the purpose of getting the vulnerabilities patched or mitigated, as opposed to retaining them to use in hacking operations.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-29-at-1.43.47-PM-1-1-1-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="299"/><figcaption><span>One-page unclassified document released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence about zero days the government disclosed in 2023.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Katie Moussouris, founder and CEO of Luta Security and former advisor to the government’s now-disbanded Cyber Safety Review Board, says that since one of the factors guiding VEP decisions is whether the vulnerability poses a risk to U.S. critical infrastructure or the general public, this means that every other time they had been resubmitted to the VEP “the answer must have been that the risk [hadn’t] increased enough for us to stop using” the vulnerabilities.</p><blockquote><strong>This lack of transparency could become a greater issue under the Trump administration, which has vowed to ramp up the government&#39;s cyber offensive operations, suggesting that the government demand for zero-day vulnerabilities may increase over the next four years.</strong></blockquote><p>The unclassified ODNI report got little notice when it was published last month by Senator Ron Wyden (D - Oregon) after receiving it from the intelligence office as the Biden administration was coming to a close. Under the Intelligence Authorization Act, the ODNI is required to submit an annual classified report to the House and Senate intelligence committees identifying the number of vulnerabilities submitted that year for review under the VEP, the number discovered but excluded from review (the process has loopholes that allow the government to withhold some vulnerabilities from review), and the number disclosed to vendors or the public.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/content/images/2025/02/Screen-Shot-2025-02-05-at-1.55.30-PM-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="184"/><figcaption><span>2020 Amendment showing that the requirement to make the unclassified report available to the public applies retroactively to 2018 and 2019.</span></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>“[The Trump administration] could say we’re disclosing too [many vulnerabilities]. If the default [in the past] was to disclose unless there is a reason to keep, I could easily imagine the default is going to be to keep unless there is a reason to disclose.”</strong></blockquote><h3 id="vep-creation">VEP Creation</h3><p>The ODNI didn’t mention, however, that between 2010 and 2013, agencies required to follow the process failed to do so. Michael Daniel, former cybersecurity advisor to President Obama, says only the NSA was doing a review of vulnerabilities, but not in the way the VEP charter dictated.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/vulnerabilities-equities-process-january-2016?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">2010 VEP charter</a>, the review board is composed of representatives from government entities with offensive or defensive interest in software vulnerabilities. This includes the CIA, DoJ, DHS, NSA, U.S. CyberCommand, Department of Energy, State Department and others. The board reviews vulnerabilities discovered by the U.S. government, by contractors working for the government, or by foreign partner governments that share vulnerabilities with the U.S.</p><p>Updated 12pm: To clarify when Moussouris was part of the government&#39;s CSRB.</p><p><em>Thank you for reading.
