    <h1>Netflix Kills Casting from Its Mobile App to Most Modern TVs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2025/12/01/netflix-kills-casting-from-mobile-app-to-tvs/"><p>Netflix has quietly removed the ability to cast content from its mobile apps to most modern TVs and streaming devices, including newer Chromecast models and the Google TV Streamer.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/_LOnOhYyQktDvHqETtYw8XCJRaE=/400x0/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/_LOnOhYyQktDvHqETtYw8XCJRaE=/400x0/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/HlyUnHV7z-RouOttuGcq5cKw6-o=/800x0/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/iqtdeZvM9aXB5xEzmCmNs4GDSuc=/1600x0/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/X4f_o0XAeKLqDIrDvUHZobVhSMA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="Netflix Smaller 4" width="2250" height="1266"/></p>
<p>The only exception appears to apply to older Chromecast models without remotes, as well as TVs with built-in Google Cast support. However, even on these legacy devices, casting only remains for those on costlier ad-free plans, but it is unavailable for subscribers on Netflix&#39;s ad-supported plan.</p>
<p>User reports appear to suggest Netflix began removing the Cast button from its mobile apps in mid-November, but the company provided no advance warning to users. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ox7in3/comment/nrbhp1q/">One Reddit user</a> said customer service explained that devices with remotes can no longer cast, claiming the decision was made to improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>The move bears similarities to Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/05/netflix-app-no-longer-supports-airplay/">2019 decision</a> to remove AirPlay support from its iOS app, citing an inability to distinguish between different AirPlay-enabled devices (i.e., what is an ‌Apple TV‌ vs. what isn&#39;t) as Apple expanded the technology to third-party TVs.</p>
