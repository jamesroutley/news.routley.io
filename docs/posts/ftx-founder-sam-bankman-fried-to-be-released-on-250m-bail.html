The 30-year-old will face his next hearing in New York City on Jan. 3. Bankman-Fried was expected to be released from federal custody on Thursday, a prosecutor said.</p><p>A recognizance bond is a written commitment from the accused to appear in court when ordered. In return, Bankman-Fried&#39;s camp would not be required to meet the full collateral requirements on the bail.</p><p>The bond was secured by equity in his family home, and by the signatures of his parents and two other individuals with &#34;considerable&#34; assets.</p><p>In addition to the $250 million package, which prosecutors called &#34;the largest-ever pretrial bond,&#34; the former crypto billionaire would also be required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, submit to mental health counseling and restrict himself to the Northern District of California.</p><p>Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said Bankman-Fried would require &#34;strict&#34; supervision following his release to his parents&#39; home in California.</p><p>His parents, both Stanford Law professors, were present in the courtroom. Bankman-Fried was flanked by two U.S. marshals, dressed in a suit and tie.</p><p>He did not speak except when answering the judge.</p><p>The former FTX CEO would also be barred from opening any new lines of credit of more than $1,000 while awaiting trial over what federal regulators have called a &#34;brazen&#34; fraud at his bankrupt crypto empire.</p><p>Bankman-Fried was the heart of &#34;a fraud of epic proportions,&#34; Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos told the court. But he voluntarily returned to the United States, has no history of flight and has significantly reduced financial assets, Roos said.</p><p>Bankman-Fried had previously claimed that he was down to a mere $100,000, a steep fall from grace for a man who was once at the head of a $32 billion crypto empire.</p><p>Bankman-Fried stands accused of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/18/how-sam-bankman-fried-ran-8-billion-fraud-government-prosecutors.html">perpetrating a multibillion-dollar fraud</a> on his investors, using customer funds to purchase properties, fund political donations and backstop trades at his hedge fund Alameda Research.</p><p>Federal regulators <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/cftc-piles-on-with-new-charges-against-bankman-fried.html">allege</a> over $8 billion in customer funds is missing. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried&#39;s successor, CEO John Ray, said he&#39;d never seen such a &#34;complete failure of corporate control.&#34;</p><p>Two of his top lieutenants, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftxs-gary-wang-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-cooperating-with-prosecutors.html">pleaded guilty to related fraud charges</a> and are cooperating with law enforcement. Wang&#39;s and Ellison&#39;s plea deals were revealed Wednesday.</p><p>Bankman-Fried was indicted by the U.S. District Court in Manhattan on eight counts including securities fraud and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/how-ftx-founder-sbf-and-friends-quietly-donated-to-political-groups-and-relatives.html">money laundering</a>, and was rendered from the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sent-back-to-bahamas-jail-.html">Bahamas to New York</a> om Wednesday evening.</p><p>Bankman-Fried&#39;s bail dwarfs other federal white-collar bonds. Bernie Madoff posted a $10 million bond while awaiting trial on his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Jeff Skilling, former Enron CEO, posted a $5 million bond, while Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos founder, posted a scant $500,000.</p></div></div></div>
