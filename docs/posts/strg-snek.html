<p>Things that are irritating:</p>
<p>- The vertical movement feels faster than the horizontal movement because the height of the characters that make up the snake/level is greater than the width.</p>
<p>- Switching screens is not great to begin with, as the player has to reorient quickly, but this is particularly bad when changing screens vertically, especially if you&#39;re rapidly heading for a wall on the new screen.</p>
<p>- The same thing goes for the green warp world. How could you better orient the player for where the snake is going to emerge?</p>
<p>- All of the warps could do with being 2-3 characters wide. It&#39;s not fun trying to hit a single square when the movement is often not precise enough to do this easily.</p>
<p>- I would strongly consider using any screen entry point as a de-facto checkpoint or implementing some kind of fast-travel. There&#39;s nothing more frustrating than trying to get back through a tricky section and then having to traverse multiple screens to find a letter or checkpoint that will take over from the letter you grabbed earlier, when every mistake sends you back to the letter at the end of a tricky section.</p>
<p>- Invisible walls in small doses are bearable. To have two worlds built around that mechanic is a bit much.</p>
<p>- If the game design is going to require me to die a lot then get me back into the game more quickly. The pop-up message adds an unnecessary delay and it also creates a sort of visual reset, especially if you just died in the area the message obscures.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:7007444,&#34;user_id&#34;:1686552}" id="post-7007444"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/spicausis"></a><div><div dir="auto"><p>Thank you, I just finished this and had a great time!</p><p>Is there some secret magic behind the walls? With a bit of a frogger luck I managed to walk some steps astray in the magenta world and it looked like you&#39;ve been expecting the players to be able to get there, but that&#39;s too deadly for my fingers and luck.</p><p>Also, does colorswap do anything meaningful, could the color change be actually used anywhere?</p><p>(I&#39;d probably love to see the death counter at the end.
