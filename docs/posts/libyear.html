          <h2>Example 2</h2>
          <p>
            If your system has a one year old dependency and a three year old
            dependency, then your whole system is four libyears old.
          </p>
          <h2>A Healthy App</h2>
          <p>
            At <a href="https://www.singlebrook.com">Singlebrook</a> we try to
            keep our client’s apps below 10 libyears. We regularly rescue
            projects that are over 100 libyears behind.
          </p>
          <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>
            &#34;lib&#34; is short for &#34;library&#34;, the most common form of dependency.
          </p>

          <h2>Other Measurements</h2>
          <p>
            <code>libyear-bundler</code> implements some of the other metrics
            described by (Bouwers, Eekelen, Visser, 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>--versions</code> flag provides a metric for an installed
            dependency’s freshness relative to the newest release’s major, minor, and
            patch versions. Of course, this is most useful for dependencies that
            follow a consistent versioning scheme such as semver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>--releases</code> flag provides a metric for the number of
            releases between an installed version of dependency and the newest
            released version of the dependency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each metric has it’s own advantages and disadvantages, and all quantify
            the maintenance burden for an app. Taken together, they can help
            prioritize maintenance for an inherited app, or help maintain a baseline
            level of dependency freshness for an ongoing project.
