<p><span><span><span><span>Some ISS crew members make random, unscheduled, amateur radio voice contacts with earth-bound radio amateurs, often called &#34;hams&#34;. They can make radio contacts during their breaks, pre-sleep time and before and after mealtime. Astronauts have contacted thousands of hams around the world. The work schedules of the ISS crew dictate when they are able to operate the radios. The crew&#39;s usual waking period is 0730 - 1930 UTC. The most common times to find a crew member making casual periods are about one hour after waking and before sleeping, when they have personal time. They&#39;re usually free most of the weekend, as well.  </span></span></span></span><br/></p>

It all depends on what equipment is in service in space.</span></span><span>Visit the the &#34;Beginners&#34; sections of the </span><a href="http://www.amsat.org/?page_id=1869" target="_blank">AMSAT-NA</a><span> or </span><a href="http://amsat-uk.org/beginners/" target="_blank">AMSAT-UK</a><span> websites for information on </span><span>getting started with all modes of amateur radio satellite operation</span><span>.</span></p></div></div>
