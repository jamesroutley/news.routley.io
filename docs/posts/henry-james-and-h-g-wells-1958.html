<p>My mother used to say, “A snob is a person who imitates the manners of the 
class above him.” Characteristic of the snob is social ignorance and 
insecurity. Perhaps the editors of this collection, by publishing all the 
James-Wells correspondence and all their critical mentions of each other, intend 
to show how high-class James was and how low-class Wells. I am afraid they 
demonstrate quite the opposite. Wells was pretty much a man of the world, at 
home in the world at all social levels, with a keen eye for the follies and 
pretenses of foolish and pretentious people of all classes. He wrote about his 
own work with misleading modesty and with a craftsman’s natural instinct to keep 
his trade secrets from the public. He wrote about other writers with insight and 
humor. Eventually, in his correspondence with James, he was forced, by James’s 
hauteur and lengthy elementary lectures on the craft of fiction, from humor to 
badinage, and finally, to just plain pulling the pompous old man’s leg. He has 
the insouciance and arrogance of what used to be called a natural-born 
gentleman. James is always pretentious, literary and high-toned. It never occurs 
to him that this is the way literary people talk to the customers and that it is 
bad manners to hand such stuff out to one’s colleagues. In other words, he 
believes implicitly in the mask of literary society, as well as what the 
newspapers call Society with a capital letter, and he acts accordingly, in 
private, with a presumed peer. In other words, he is a snob.</p>
<p>A lot of tosh has been written about Wells as a “social” novelist, always 
trying to reform the world via preachy fiction. You would think he was a sort of 
Upton Sinclair at his worst or a bad “proletarian” novelist. It must be quite 
a shock for an innocent person, with an honestly empirical approach, to sit down 
and read his fiction from <i>The Time Machine</i> to <i>The Research 
Magnificent,</i> admittedly his best period. His novels are not social novels at 
all. True, they reflect the society of their time; Ann Veronica, for instance, 
is a feminist. But <i>Tono-Bungay</i> is no more “about” the evils of patent 
medicines than <i>Crime and Punishment</i> is “about” Russian detective 
methods. All the major Wells novels have exactly the same subject as those of a 
writer no one would dream of connecting with him — D.H. Lawrence; they are 
about matrimony, about the mysteries and difficulties and agonies and tragedies 
and — rarely — the joys of the search for a true “life of dialogue.” Wells’s 
characters seek constantly and painfully to realize each other as total persons, 
and they usually pitifully fail. It is only too true that the Social Lie is 
precisely the conspiracy of organized society to prevent precisely this, and so 
there is always implicit a running criticism and sometimes a specific criticism 
of the frauds by which men live. Wells says depreciatingly that his people are 
seldom realized. This is false modesty. They are not constructed as artistic 
artifacts. They struggle to realize each other, and so, in their success or 
failure, realize themselves poignantly for the reader.</p>
<p>There is a sort of Reform Club myth about the sort of man and writer H.G. 
Wells was. Read him and see. He wasn’t like that at all. I will let you in on a 
secret. This myth was constructed to teach him his place, to put him down. He 
was guilty of two unforgivable British sins. He was not just a Socialist, but a 
shameless <i>republican</i>. He several times printed very insulting comments, 
not about Royalty in the abstract, but about specific members of The Family in 
person. Almost as bad, he openly cohabited with members of the opposite sex 
without benefit of clerk or clergy. Furthermore, they were women one might, at 
any moment, meet socially. It is quite correct to keep a housemaid in Herts or 
retire one’s favorite tart to Twickenham. It is almost <i>de rigueur,</i> like 
the tightly rolled umbrella and the bowler, in precisely the circles that 
snubbed Wells and made up the myth of the propaganda novelist and upstart son of 
a servant girl. It must have been excruciatingly embarrassing to his very 
British colleagues when he took seriously the preachments of two centuries of 
advanced thought and lived openly out of wedlock in a flat in Hampstead with, of 
all things, another writer, who was also a lady. And after that scandal he went 
right on doing the same thing until he was an aged man, over and over again. In 
other words, he behaved much like some arrogant aristocrat whose pedigree went 
back before the War of the Roses and who had nothing but contempt for the frauds 
with which the <i>hoi polloi</i> hide their naked shames. Parenthetically, this 
is exactly the same reason why Ford Madox Ford was practically driven out of 
England — and one of the leading persecutors of Ford was Henry James. James, 
always the perfect gentleman, concentrated his venom on Ford’s mistress; he was 
physically afraid of Ford himself.</p>
<p>All the nonsense which Wells viewed with the amused contempt which comes from 
assured social and artistic position and integrity, James took utterly 
seriously. In fact, it is this nonsense which he made the major subject of his 
novels, and which, to “the well-brought-up person” who knows his way around, 
gives them their pathos. The people in his novels behave the way the Upper 
Classes tell the Lower Classes they behave. But nobody has ever behaved this 
way, which is why there are no real people in James’s novels. There can be no 
realization of each other, no life of dialogue, no realization of the individual 
character, if characters are nothing but cutouts from the Society Page of a 
third-rate newspaper. It is for this reason that James, in these letters and 
articles, describes the craft of fiction somewhat as Ben Jonson, in his theory 
of “humors,” described his plays. Fortunately, he did not write them that way. 
People are not moral types, they are people, and novels, at least the best ones, 
are about people. But for James, the Boston Brahmin, the American Millionaire 
and the British Aristocracy were not just types, they were archetypes. Because, 
alas, poor James was a provincial snob.</p>
<p>The best thing in the book is a hilarious tale in the introduction about how 
William James, on a visit to his brother, tried to peek over the garden wall and 
catch a glimpse of the next-door neighbor, G.K. Chesterton. Poor Henry was 
prostrated with terror at his very aristocratic brother’s nonchalance. He 
behaved exactly like an overrefined hypersensitive Edwardian housemaid. Wells 
and William James belong to the literary world of Huckleberry Finn or Don 
Quixote; Henry James, it must be admitted, was only a Ouida in a frock coat.</p>
