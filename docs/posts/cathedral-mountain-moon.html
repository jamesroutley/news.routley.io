<b> Cathedral, Mountain, Moon </b> </center> <p> 

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Single shots like this require planning. 

The first step is to realize that such an amazing 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150624.html">triple-alignment</a> actually takes place.

The second step is to find the best location to photograph it.

But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- 
and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest.

Five times over six years the photographer tried and found 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210613.html">bad weather</a>. 

Finally, just ten days ago, the 
<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/">weather</a> 
was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized.

Taken in 
<a href="https://youtu.be/oT5LB8wMNHI">Piemonte</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a>, 
the cathedral in the foreground is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Superga">Basilica of Superga</a>, 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Viso#/media/File:Monviso_-_panoramica_cresta_da_Ostanetta.jpg">mountain</a> in the middle is 
<a href="https://youtu.be/ViA0MrOkv_Y">Monviso</a>, and, well, 
<a href="https://post.bark.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/u4nf59H.png">you know</a> which moon is in the background.

Here, even though the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200322.html">setting Moon</a> was captured in a crescent 
<a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/">phase</a>, 
the exposure was long enough for doubly reflected 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_(astronomy)">Earthlight</a>, 
called the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190926.html">da Vinci glow</a>, to illuminate the entire top of the 
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/">Moon</a>.
