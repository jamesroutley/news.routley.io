    <h1>How to Bypass Cloudflare: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>With studies estimating that over 40% of all internet traffic originates from bots, there has been a rise in demand for software that can distinguish human activity from bot activity. A prime example of this is <i><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Cloudflare&#39;s Bot Management Solution</a></i>.</p> <div><p> If you clicked on this article, you probably want to learn how to bypass Cloudflare. You&#39;ve come to the right place! In this guide, we&#39;ll cover: </p><ul> <li>What is Cloudflare Bot Management</li> <li>How Cloudflare Detects Bots</li> <li>How to reverse engineer and bypass Cloudflare</li> </ul> </div> <p>Ready? Let&#39;s get started!</p> <h2 id="what-is-cloudflare-bot-management">What is Cloudflare Bot Management</h2> <p>Cloudflare is a web performance and security company. On the security side, they offer customers a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>. A WAF can defend applications against several security threats, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), credential stuffing, and DDoS attacks.</p> <p>One of the core systems included in their WAF is Cloudflare&#39;s Bot Manager. As a bot protection solution, its main goal is to <strong>mitigate attacks from malicious bots without impacting real users</strong>.</p> <p>Cloudflare acknowledges the importance of certain bots. For example, no site wants to deliberately block Google or other search engines from crawling its webpage. To account for this, Cloudflare maintains an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/how-to-manage-good-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">allowlist for known good bots</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately for web-scraping enthusiasts like you and me, they also assume all non-whitelisted bot traffic is malicious. So, <i>regardless of your intent</i>, there&#39;s a good chance <strong>your bot gets denied access to a Cloudflare-protected web page</strong>.</p> <div><p> If you&#39;ve tried to scrape a Cloudflare-protected site before, you may have run into a few of the following <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029779472-Troubleshooting-Cloudflare-1XXX-errors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bot-manager related errors</a>: </p><ul> <li><strong>Error 1020</strong>: Access Denied</li> <li><strong>Error 1010</strong>: The owner of this website has banned your access based on your browser&#39;s signature</li> <li><strong>Error 1015</strong>: You are being rate limited</li> <li><strong>Error 1012</strong>: Access Denied</li> </ul> </div> <p>Which are usually accompanied by a <code>403 Forbidden</code> HTTP response status code.</p> <h3 id="can-cloudflare-be-bypassed">Can Cloudflare be bypassed?</h3> <p>Thankfully, <strong>the answer is <i>yes</i>!</strong> But, developing a Cloudflare bypass is no simple feat to do on your own. First, you&#39;ll need to develop a solid understanding of how it works.</p> <h2 id="how-does-cloudflare-detect-bots">How does Cloudflare detect bots?</h2> <p>The bot detection methods used by Cloudflare can generally be classified into two categories: <strong>passive</strong> and <strong>active</strong>. Passive bot detection techniques consist of fingerprinting checks performed on the backend, while active detection techniques rely on checks performed on the client side. Let&#39;s dive into a few examples from each category together!</p> <h3 id="cloudflare-passive-bot-detection-techniques">Cloudflare passive bot detection techniques</h3> <p>Here&#39;s a non-exhaustive list of some passive bot detection techniques Cloudflare employs:</p> <h4>Detecting botnets</h4> <p>Cloudflare maintains a catalog of devices, IP addresses, and behavioral patterns known to be associated with <strong>malicious bot networks</strong>. Any device suspected to belong to one of these networks is either automatically blocked or faced with additional client-side challenges to solve.</p> <h4>IP address reputation</h4> <p>A user&#39;s IP address reputation (also known as <strong>risk score</strong> or <strong>fraud score</strong>) is based on factors such as geolocation, ISP, and reputation history. For example, IPs belonging to a data center or known VPN provider will have a worse reputation than a residential IP address. A site may also choose to limit access to a site from regions outside of the area they serve since traffic from an actual customer should never come from there.</p> <h4>HTTP request headers</h4> <p>Cloudflare uses HTTP request headers to determine if you&#39;re a robot. If you have a non-browser user agent, such as <code>python-requests/2.22.0</code>, your scraper can easily be picked out as a bot. Cloudflare can also block your bot if it sends a request that is missing headers that would otherwise be there in a browser. Or if you have mismatching headers based on your user-agent. For example, including a <code>sec-ch-ua-full-version-list:</code> header for a Firefox user-agent.</p> <h4>TLS fingerprinting</h4> <p>This technique enables Cloudflare&#39;s antibot to <strong>identify the client</strong> being used to send requests to a server.</p> <p>Though there are multiple methods of fingerprinting TLS (such as <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JA3</a>, <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JARM</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/gquic-protocol-analysis-and-fingerprinting-in-zeek-a4178855d75f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CYU</a>), each implementation produces a fingerprint that <i>is static per request client</i>. TLS fingerprinting is helpful because the <strong>TLS implementation of a browser tends to differ from that of other release versions, other browsers, and request-based libraries</strong>. For example, a Chrome browser on Windows (version 104) would have a different fingerprint than all of the following:</p> <ul> <li>A Chrome browser on Windows (version 87)</li> <li>A Firefox browser</li> <li>A Chrome browser on an android device</li> <li>The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">python HTTP requests library</a></li> </ul> <p>The construction of a TLS fingerprint happens during the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TLS Handshake</a>. Cloudflare analyzes the fields provided in the <strong>&#39;client hello&#39;</strong> message, such as <i>cipher suites</i>, <i>extensions</i>, and <i>elliptic curves</i>, to compute a fingerprint hash for a given client.</p> <p>Next, that hash is looked up in a database of <strong>pre-collected fingerprints</strong> to determine the client the request came from. Suppose the client&#39;s hash matches an allowed fingerprint hash (i.e., a browser&#39;s fingerprint). In that case, Cloudflare will then compare the user-agent header from the client&#39;s request to the user-agent associated with the stored fingerprint hash.</p> <p><strong>If they match, the security system assumes that the request originated from a standard browser</strong>. On the contrary, <strong>a mismatch between a client&#39;s TLS fingerprint and its advertised user-agent indicates obvious use of custom botting software</strong>, resulting in the request being blocked.</p> <h4>HTTP/2 fingerprinting</h4> <p>The HTTP/2 specification is the second major HTTP protocol version, published on May 14, 2015, as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RFC 7540</a>. As of the time of writing (September 2022), the protocol is supported by all major browsers.</p> <p>The main goal of HTTP/2 was to <strong>improve the performance of websites and web applications</strong> by introducing header field compression and allowing concurrent requests and responses on the same TCP connection. To accomplish this, HTTP/1.1&#39;s foundation was expanded with new parameters and values. These new internals are what the HTTP/2 fingerprint is based on.</p> <p>The <strong><a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#FramingLayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">binary framing layer</a></strong> is a new addition to HTTP/2 and is the <strong>central focus of an HTTP/2 fingerprint</strong>.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested in a more in-depth analysis of HTTP/2 fingerprinting, you should read Akamai&#39;s proposed method for fingerprinting HTTP2 clients here: <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Shuster-Passive-Fingerprinting-Of-HTTP2-Clients-wp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Passive Fingerprinting of HTTP/2 Clients</a>. But for now, here&#39;s a summary:</p> <div><p> Three main components form an HTTP/2 fingerprint: </p><ul> <li><strong>Frames</strong>: <code>SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE</code>, <code>SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</code>, <code>SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</code>, <code>SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</code>, <code>SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE</code>, <code>SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE</code>, <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code></li> <li><strong>Stream Priority Information</strong>: <code>StreamID:Exclusivity_Bit:Dependant_StreamID:Weight</code></li> <li><strong>Pseudo Header Fields Order</strong>: The order of the <code>:method</code>,<code>:authority</code>, <code>:scheme</code>, and <code>:path</code> headers.</li> </ul> </div> <p>If you&#39;re curious, you can test a live HTTP/2 fingerprinting demo by clicking <a href="https://privacycheck.sec.lrz.de/passive/fp_h2/fp_http2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p> <p>Like TLS fingerprinting, <strong>each request client will have a static HTTP/2 fingerprint</strong>. To determine a request&#39;s legitimacy, Cloudflare always verifies that the fingerprint and user-agent pair from the request matches a whitelisted one stored in their database.</p> <p><strong>HTTP/2 fingerprinting and TLS fingerprinting go hand in hand.</strong> Out of all the passive bot detection techniques Cloudflare uses, these two are the most technically challenging to control in a request-based bot. However, they&#39;re also the most important. So, you want to ensure you do them right or risk getting blocked!</p> <p>Alright! By now, you should have a good understanding of how Cloudflare detects bots <i>passively</i>. But, remember: that&#39;s only half of the story. Now, let&#39;s take a look at how they do it <i>actively</i>!</p> <h3 id="cloudflare-active-bot-detection-techniques">Cloudflare active bot detection techniques</h3> <p>When you visit a Cloudflare-protected website, many checks are constantly running on the <strong>client-side</strong> (i.e., in your local browser) to determine if you&#39;re a robot. Here&#39;s a list of some methods they use (once again, non-exhaustive):</p> <h4>CAPTCHAs</h4> <div><p> In the past, CAPTCHAs were the go-to method for detecting bots. However, it&#39;s well-known that they harm the end user&#39;s experience. Whether or not Cloudflare serves the user a captcha is dependent on several factors, such as: </p><ul> <li><strong>The site configuration.</strong> A website administrator may choose to enable CAPTCHAs <strong>all the time, sometimes, or never at all.</strong></li> <li><strong>Risk Level.</strong> Cloudflare may choose to serve a CAPTCHA only if the traffic is suspicious. For example, a CAPTCHA may be shown if a user browses a site using the Tor client, but not if the user runs a standard web browser like Google Chrome.</li> </ul> </div> <p>Previously, Cloudflare used reCAPTCHA as their primary captcha provider. But, since 2020, they&#39;ve migrated to use hCaptcha exclusively. Below is an example of hCaptcha appearing on a Cloudflare-protected site:</p> <figure> <a href="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-hcaptcha.jpg" data-fslightbox="gallery" data-type="image"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-hcaptcha-400.jpg" alt="Cloudflare hCaptcha Integration" title="Cloudflare hCaptcha Integration" width="400" height="400"/> </a> <figcaption>Click to open the image in fullscreen</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Canvas fingerprinting</h4> <p>Canvas fingerprinting allows a system to identify the <i>device class</i> of a web client. A device class refers to the <strong>combination of browser, operating system, and graphics hardware</strong> of the system used to access the webpage.</p> <p>Canvas is an <strong>HTML5 API used to draw graphics and animations on a web page</strong> using JavaScript. To construct a canvas fingerprint, a webpage queries your browser&#39;s canvas API to render an image. That image is then hashed to produce a fingerprint.</p> <p>This technique relies on taking a system&#39;s graphic rendering system as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_unclonable_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">physically unclonable function</a>. That might sound complicated, so let me explain it.</p> <div><p> A canvas fingerprint depends on multiple layers of the computing system, such as: </p><ul> <li><strong>Hardware</strong>. GPU</li> <li><strong>Low-level Software</strong>. GPU driver, Operating system (fonts, anti-aliasing/sub-pixel rendering algorithms)</li> <li><strong>High-Level Software</strong> Web Browser (image processing engine)</li> </ul> </div> <p>Because a variation in any of these categories will produce a unique fingerprint, this technique accurately differentiates between device classes.</p> <p>I want to clarify this: <strong>a canvas fingerprint doesn&#39;t contain enough information to sufficiently track and identify unique individuals or bots</strong>. Instead, its <strong>main purpose is to distinguish between device classes accurately</strong>.</p> <p>In the context of bot detection, this is useful because bots tend to lie about their underlying technology (via their user-agent header). Cloudflare has a <strong>large dataset of legitimate canvas fingerprints + user agent pairs</strong>. Using <strong>machine learning</strong>, they can detect device property spoofing (ex. user-agent, operating system, or GPU) by looking for a mismatch between your canvas fingerprint and the expected one.</p> <p>Cloudflare uses a specific canvas fingerprinting method, Google&#39;s <i><a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Picasso Fingerprinting</a></i>.</p> <p>If you&#39;d like to see canvas fingerprinting in action, check out <a href="https://browserleaks.com/canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Browserleak&#39;s live demo</a>.</p> <h4>Event tracking</h4> <p>Cloudflare adds <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">event listeners</a> to webpages. These listen for user actions, such as mouse movements, mouse clicks, or key presses. Most of the time, a real user will need to use their mouse or keyboard to browse. If Cloudflare sees a consistent lack of mouse or keyboard usage, they can assume the user is a bot.</p> <h4>Environment API querying</h4> <p>This is a <strong><i>very</i></strong> broad category. A browser has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">hundreds of Web APIs</a> that can be used for bot detection. I&#39;ll do my best to split them up into <strong>4</strong> categories:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Browser-specific APIs</strong>. These specifications exist in one browser but may not exist in another. For example, <code>window.chrome</code> is a property that only exists in a Chrome browser. If the data you send Cloudflare indicates that you&#39;re using a Chrome browser but send it with a Firefox user agent, they&#39;ll know something is up.</li> <li><strong>Timestamp APIs</strong>. Cloudflare makes use of timestamp APIs, such as <code>Date.now()</code> or <code>window.performance.timing.navigationStart</code> to keep track of a user&#39;s speed metrics. A user will be blocked if timestamps don&#39;t appear like ordinary human browsing activity. Some examples include: browsing inhumanly quickly or mismatching timestamps (such as a <code>navigationStart</code> timestamp from before the page was loaded).</li> <li><strong>Automated Browser Detection</strong>. Cloudflare queries the browser for properties that only exist in automated web browser environments. For example, the existence of the <code>window.document.__selenium_unwrapped</code> or <code>window.callPhantom</code> property indicates the usage of <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Selenium</a> and <a href="https://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PhantomJS</a>, respectively. For obvious reasons, you&#39;re getting blocked if this is detected.</li> <li><strong>Sandboxing Detection</strong>. For our purposes, <strong>sandboxing refers to an attempt at emulating a browser in a non-browser environment.</strong> Cloudflare has checks to stop people from trying to solve its challenges with emulated browser environments, such as in NodeJS using JSDOM. For example, the script may look for the <code>process</code> object, which only exists in NodeJS. They also can detect if functions have been modified by using <code>Function.prototype.toString.call(functionName)</code> on the function in question.</li> </ol> <h3 id="the-core-of-cloudflare-bot-protection">The core of Cloudflare bot protection</h3> <p>Like many other antibots, Cloudflare collects the data from all of the above methods as <i>sensor data</i> and validates it for inconsistencies on the server side.</p> <p>Whew, that was a lot of info! You should now have an understanding of the bot detection techniques used by Cloudflare.</p> <p>So far, we&#39;ve only discussed the high-level concepts without too many specifics regarding Cloudflare&#39;s actual script. But don&#39;t worry. In this next section, we&#39;re going to see exactly how Cloudflare&#39;s antibot puts these techniques into practice; by analyzing its core: the Cloudflare waiting room.</p> <h2 id="cloudflare-waiting-room">Cloudflare waiting Room</h2> <blockquote> <p>Checking if the site connection is secure</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Checking your browser before accessing XXXXXXXX.com</p> </blockquote> <p>Does that ring a bell?

Keeping your developer tools open, navigate to <a href="https://en.aw-lab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AW LAB</a>.</p> <p>You&#39;ll notice that within a few milliseconds after the &#34;initial challenge&#34; script loads, your XHR breakpoint gets triggered (before the first POST request is sent).</p> <figure> <a href="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-breakpoint.png" data-fslightbox="gallery" data-type="image"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-breakpoint-640.png" alt="1st Triggered XHR Breakpoint" title="1st Triggered XHR Breakpoint" width="640" height="292"/> </a> <figcaption>Click to open the image in fullscreen</figcaption> </figure> <p>Now, you can see and access all the variables and functions in the current scope. However, there isn&#39;t much you can deduce from the variable values shown on-screen, and the code is unreadable.</p> <p>Looking closely at the script, <strong>you&#39;ll notice that one function is called over a thousand times</strong>. In this example, that&#39;s the <code>c</code> function (though it might have a different name in your script). When called, there is always a single stringified hex number as the argument. Let&#39;s try running it in the DevTools console:</p> <figure> <a href="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-string-concealing.png" data-fslightbox="gallery" data-type="image"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-string-concealing.png" alt="Running the &#39;c&#39; function in the console" title="Running the &#39;c&#39; function in the console" width="640" height="321"/> </a> <figcaption>Click to open the image in fullscreen</figcaption> </figure> <p>Wow! So it appears that Cloudflare uses a string-concealing obfuscation mechanism. By running the function and replacing its calls with its return values, we can simplify the bottom two lines in the above screenshot to this:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_IndcTei7wgQWEklyn1QS">// The simplified code 
(aG = aw[&#34;Cowze&#34;](JSON[&#34;stringify&#34;](o[&#34;_cf_chl_ctx&#34;]))[&#34;replace&#34;](&#34;+&#34;, &#34;%2b&#34;)), 
aE[&#34;send&#34;](aB.FptpP(aB.RfgQh(&#34;v_&#34; + o[&#34;_cf_chl_opt&#34;][&#34;cRay&#34;], &#34;=&#34;), aG));</code></pre>  </div> <p>Using the same technique of running code in the console, we can deduce that the variables <code>o</code> and <code>aE</code> represent <code>window</code> and an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> instance, respectively. We can also convert bracket notation to dot notation to yield:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_7rWxgva6bJOfaRwywRXj">// The above code, even more simplified! 
(aG = aw.Cowze(JSON.stringify(window._cf_chl_ctx)).replace(&#34;+&#34;, &#34;%2b&#34;)), 
	// aE = new XMLHttpRequest(), an XMLHttpRequest instance initialized earlier in the script 
	aE.send(aB.FptpP(aB.RfgQh(&#34;v_&#34; + window._cf_chl_opt.cRay, &#34;=&#34;), aG));</code></pre>  </div> <p>It&#39;s not perfect, but the code is getting a lot easier for us to read. Simplifying all the string-concealing function calls would improve the script&#39;s readability. However, doing it manually would take an eternity. We&#39;ll tackle this challenge in the next section, but let&#39;s move on for now.</p> <p>If you press the &#34;continue until next breakpoint&#34; button in your debugger, your browser will send the first post request. Immediately after receiving a response, it will pause on the next breakpoint:</p> <figure> <a href="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-breakpoint2.png" data-fslightbox="gallery" data-type="image"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-breakpoint2-640.png" alt="2nd Triggered XHR Breakpoint" title="2nd Triggered XHR Breakpoint" width="640" height="223"/> </a> <figcaption>Click to open the image in fullscreen</figcaption> </figure> <p>What a plot twist! The debugger is paused in a completely different script. This new script is what we&#39;ll call Cloudflare&#39;s &#34;main&#34; or &#34;second&#34; Javascript challenge. But, <strong>if you look at the network log, there was no <code>GET</code> request to this specific script</strong>! So, where did it come from?</p> <p>Taking a closer look at the script, we can see that it&#39;s an anonymous function. The script name, in our case, is <code>VM279</code>. According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17367560/chrome-development-tool-vm-file-from-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this thread</a> on StackOverflow, this second script is likely being evaluated within the initial challenge script, using <code>eval</code> or similar. We can confirm this because the call stack shows the Cloudflare &#34;initial challenge&#34; script as the initiator (<i>see: green boxes in the screenshot</i>)!</p> <p>If we click on the initiator, we can see where this script is being evaluated in the &#34;initial challenge&#34; script:</p> <figure> <a href="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-newfunc.png" data-fslightbox="gallery" data-type="image"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.zenrows.com/images/blog/bypass-cloudflare-newfunc-640.png" alt="Location of the initiator" title="Location of the initiator" width="640" height="215"/> </a> <figcaption>Click to open the image in fullscreen</figcaption> </figure> <p>We&#39;ll use the same method of evaluating the <code>c</code> function calls to undo the string concealing and replacing <code>o</code> with <code>window</code>, which gives us this:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_KTmCjNDoZrbdkSnGTKSh">// The line of code that initiates the second JavaScript challenge 
 
// Note: aE = new XMLHttpRequest(), an XMLHttpRequest instance initialized earlier in the script 
new window.Function(aB.pgNsC(ax, aE.responseText))();</code></pre>  </div> <p>It looks like this function is creating a new function based on the data contained in the <code>responseText</code> of the XMLHttpRequest from the previous breakpoint. Cloudflare probably uses some cipher to decrypt it into an executable script.</p> <p>Okay, we&#39;ve made some progress. Yet as is, the Cloudflare scripts remain unreadable. Even with manual debugging, we won&#39;t be able to figure out much more. If you want to create a Cloudflare bypass, we need to be able to understand it <i>fully</i>. And to do that, we need to deobfuscate it.</p> <h3 id="deobfuscating-the-cloudflare-javascript-challenge-script">Step 3: deobfuscating the Cloudflare Javascript challenge script</h3> <p>This isn&#39;t going to be trivial. Cloudflare uses <i>a lot</i> of obfuscation techniques in their code, and it wouldn&#39;t be practical to cover them all in this article. Here&#39;s a (non-exhaustive) list of examples:</p> <ul> <li> <strong><a href="https://docs.jscrambler.com/code-integrity/documentation/transformations/string-concealing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">String Concealing</a></strong>. Cloudflare removes all references to string literals. In the previous section, we saw that the <code>c</code> function acted as a string concealer. </li> <li> <strong><a href="https://blog.jscrambler.com/jscrambler-101-control-flow-flattening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Control Flow Flattening</a></strong>. Cloudflare obscures the control flow of a program by emulating assembly-like <code>JUMP</code> instructions by using an infinite loop and a central switch statement dispatcher. Here&#39;s an example from the Cloudflare script: <div> <pre><code id="_RMS8GQFr0KXruxaj20mL">// An example of control flow flattening from the Cloudflare script. 
function Y(ay, aD, aC, aB, aA, az) { 
	// The aB array holds a list of all the instructions. 
	aB = &#34;1|6|11|0|15|9|3|10&#34;[&#34;split&#34;](&#34;|&#34;); 
 
	// This is the infinite loop 
	for (aC = 0; true; ) { 
		// The below switch statement is the &#34;dispatcher&#34; 
		// The value of the aB[aC] acts as an instruction pointer, determining which switch case to execute. 
		// After each switch statement finishes executing, the instruction pointer is incremented by one to retrieve the next instruction. 
 
		switch (aB[aC++]) { 
			case &#34;0&#34;: 
				/* ... */ 
				continue; 
 
			case &#34;1&#34;:

				return aD;

				/* ... */

		} 
 
		break; 
	} 
}</code></pre>  </div> </li> <li> <strong>Proxy Functions</strong>. Cloudflare replaces all binary operations (<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>,<code>==</code>, <code>/</code> etc.) with function calls. This decreases code readability, as you constantly need to look up the definition of the extra functions. Here&#39;s an example: <div> <pre><code id="_0q2K5pvYjNKCO02ACyvi">// An example of proxy function usage 
 
az = {}; 
 
// &#39;+&#39; operation proxy function 
az.pNrrD = function (aB, aC) { 
	return aB + aC; 
}; 
// &#39;-&#39; operation proxy function 
az.aZawd = function (aB, aC) { 
	return aB - aC; 
}; 
// &#39;===&#39; operation proxy function 
az.fhjsC = function (aB, aC) { 
	return aB === aC; 
}; 
 
/* ... */ 
 
// Equivalent to ((1 + 3) - 4) === 0 
 
az.fhjsC(az.aZawd(az.pNrrD(1, 3), 4), 0);</code></pre>  </div> </li> <li> <strong>Atomic Operations</strong>. Especially in the main/second challenge script, Cloudflare converts simple strings or numeric literals into long, convoluted expressions taking advantage of the atomic parts of javascript (unary expression, math operations, and empty arrays). This technique is very reminiscent of <a href="http://www.jsfuck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JSFuck</a>. Example: <div> <pre><code id="_lG9Lgu2TEXC2HvKNW0JQ"> // Believe it or not, this is equivalent to:

Each time you enter a Cloudflare waiting room, you&#39;re going to be faced with new challenge scripts.</p> <p>If you want to create your own Cloudflare bypass, you&#39;ll need some highly-specialized skills. The obfuscation of Cloudflare&#39;s challenge scripts is good enough that you can&#39;t just throw it in a general-purpose deobfuscator and get a readable output. You&#39;ll need to create a custom deobfuscator capable of dynamically parsing and transforming each new Cloudflare challenge script into human-readable code. <i>Hint: Try manipulating the script&#39;s abstract syntax tree</i></p> <p>Once you&#39;ve made a working dynamic deobfuscator, you&#39;ll be able to understand better all the checks Cloudflare&#39;s anti-bot performs on your browser and how to replicate the challenge-solving process.</p> <p>In the next step, we&#39;ll analyze some active bot detection implementations from the deobfuscated Cloudflare script. Let&#39;s get to it!</p> <h3 id="analyzing-the-deobfuscated-script">Step 4: analyzing the deobfuscated script</h3> <p>Remember those cryptic payloads and base64 encoded response bodies? Well, now we can understand how they work!</p> <h4>Cloudflare&#39;s encryption</h4> <p>Recall this code snippet, where we determined that the response text was being used to evaluate the main/second challenge script:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_bFfaSo4GIPsioAqlgslc">// Note: aE = new XMLHttpRequest(), an XMLHttpRequest instance initialized earlier in the script 
new window.Function(aB.pgNsC(ax, aE.responseText))();</code></pre>  </div> <p>The deobfuscated version looks like this:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_3YniLI1fqZyHYmsvm2rY">// Note: aE = new XMLHttpRequest(), an XMLHttpRequest instance initialized earlier in the script 
new window.Function(ax(aE.responseText))();</code></pre>  </div> <p>In the end, <code>ab.pgNsC</code> was just a proxy wrapper for the <code>ax</code> function. The deobfuscated <code>ax</code> function looks like this:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_uTln9heELYBGt0XZ7xxn">ax = function (ay) {

	) {} 
	return aD.join(&#34;&#34;); 
};</code></pre>  </div> <p>Can you guess what this function does? It&#39;s a decryption function!</p> <p>Cloudflare encrypts the main/second challenge script with a cipher. Then, after the first <code>POST</code> request to solve the initial challenge, Cloudflare returns the encrypted second challenge script.</p> <p>To actually execute the challenge, it&#39;s decrypted into a string with the <code>ax</code> function using <code>window._cf_chl_opt.cRay</code> as the decryption key. That string is then passed into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Function constructor</a> to create a new function and executed with <code>()</code>!</p> <p>We also previously discussed Cloudflare&#39;s <a href="#cloudflare-active-bot-detection-techniques">active bot detection techniques</a>. Now, we can revisit a few of them to see their implementations!</p> <h4>CAPTCHAs</h4> <p>Here, we can see how Cloudflare loads an hCaptcha instance:</p> <div> <pre><code id="_8tJKFQujHZnjsK8fq1Gr">o[&#34;_cf_chl_hload&#34;] = function () {

	/* ... */

	k.push(Date.now() - ns - pt); 
}</code></pre>  </div> <h4>Event tracking</h4> <p>Here, we can see that Cloudflare adds <code>EventListener</code>s to the webpage to track mouse movements, mouse clicks, and key presses.</p> <div> <pre><code id="_CoBYWVion6JKvUEsLGZ5">function x(aE, aD, aC, aA, az, ay) {

To bypass Cloudflare, you&#39;ll need to combine all the knowledge you&#39;ve gained from the previous sections.</p> <p>As you know by now, Cloudflare has <strong>two bot detection methods</strong>: <strong>passive fingerprinting</strong> and <strong>active bot detection</strong> (<i>through their JavaScript challenge</i>). <strong>To bypass Cloudflare, you sneak under the radar of both of them.</strong> To get you started, here are some tips for each.</p> <h3 id="bypassing-cloudflare-passive-bot-detection">Bypassing Cloudflare passive bot detection</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Use high-quality proxies.</strong> To disguise your scraper as a legitimate user, use residential proxies. Datacenter proxies and VPNs are easily detected by Cloudflare and are classified as suspicious traffic. Additionally, too many requests from a single IP address can lead to blocks, so be sure to rotate out your proxies each session to avoid that.</li> <li><strong>Mimic your browser&#39;s headers.</strong> Make your scraper&#39;s requests look as real as possible by making sure to send all the HTTP headers from the original request. <strong>This includes having valid cookie headers for each request!</strong></li> <li> <span><strong>Match a whitelisted fingerprint</strong>. If you decide to go the browser automation route, your scraper might fulfill this requirement by default. But, only provided that you use the <strong>exact user agent and browser version the library is built upon</strong>.</span> <span>This becomes <strong>a lot more tedious when developing a fully request-based scraper.</strong> You&#39;ll need to capture and analyze packets from the browsers you intend to impersonate. Your selection of programming languages is limited. It must have <strong>enough low-level access to control all the components to Cloudflare&#39;s TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprinting specification</strong>, so you can <strong>match a browser 1:1</strong>.</span> </li> </ul> <p>Remember, passive bot detection is Cloudflare&#39;s first layer of defense. If you want to bypass Cloudflare, you can&#39;t neglect this step.</p> <p>If your activity is labeled suspicious by their passive bot protection system, you&#39;ll be blocked immediately. On the contrary, slipping past them might even allow you to skip over the active bot protection checks.</p> <h3 id="bypassing-cloudflare-active-bot-detection">Bypassing Cloudflare active bot detection</h3> <ul> <li> <span><strong>Reconstruct the challenge-solving logic</strong>. This requires an expert understanding of the Cloudflare waiting room&#39;s internals. Study its request flow and deobfuscated script. You&#39;ll need to figure out <i>exactly</i> <strong>what checks Cloudflare performs, in what order they&#39;re executed, and how you can bypass them</strong>. You also need to <strong>replicate the encryption and decryption of Cloudflare&#39;s various payloads</strong>. This is the most difficult part of creating a bypass since the Cloudflare challenge scripts are dynamic. <strong>Every session might even require you to deobfuscate a new script on the fly</strong>, to parse specific values for use in your solver.</span> </li> <li> <span><strong>Collect Real Device Data</strong>. Even if you understand exactly how they&#39;re made, <strong>some fingerprints are too impractical to attempt impersonating</strong>. For example, Cloudflare&#39;s Canvas fingerprinting. Unlike a TLS or HTTP/2 fingerprint, it relies heavily on moving parts from both software <i>and</i> hardware. The functionality of hardware components is way too advanced to try and imitate and not something you want to spend all your time designing for a scraping project.</span> <span>Instead, consider collecting fingerprint data from real users&#39; devices. Then, you can inject this data into your solver whenever it needs to be used. But, you won&#39;t get far with just a few. Your best option would be to <strong>host a collector on a high-traffic webpage</strong> to ensure you have enough devices to avoid looking suspicious to Cloudflare&#39;s machine learning systems.</span> </li> <li> <span><strong>Use Automated Browsers / Sandbox The Script</strong> If you want to abstract some of the challenge-solving logic, you might consider directly executing the Cloudflare JavaScript challenges. This could be in-browser using automated tooling or by emulating a browser in a sandbox such as JSDOM. <strong>The downside to this approach is the performance</strong>. Running or emulating a browser environment will be much slower and compute-expensive than a request/algorithm-based challenge solver.</span> <span>Also, recall that Cloudflare has <strong>checks for automated browsers and sandboxing.</strong> To bypass them, you first must understand which ones exist and how they work. <strong>So, sandboxed or not, you won&#39;t be able to skip deobfuscating the Cloudflare challenge scripts!</strong></span> </li> </ul> <p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far, great job! You&#39;re now familiar with the process of making a solver for Cloudflare&#39;s antibot challenge.</p> <p>Don&#39;t fret if you found yourself feeling lost during the process. We get it, bypassing any antibot can feel like a daunting task. <strong>But that doesn&#39;t mean you should give up on your scraping project!</strong></p> <p>Bypassing Cloudflare from scratch is a complicated task, and there aren&#39;t any shortcuts if you plan to do it yourself. <strong>But, it doesn&#39;t have to be this difficult! Sometimes, it&#39;s best to have someone else take care of it for you.</strong></p> <h2 id="the-easiest-way-to-bypass-cloudflare">The easiest way to bypass Cloudflare</h2> <p>Most of the time, it&#39;s just not practical to spend massive amounts of time, energy, and money developing and maintaining your own solver.</p> <p><strong><a @click.prevent="showRegisterModal = true" href="https://www.zenrows.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZenRows</a> is designed to bypass Cloudflare and all other antibot solutions.</strong> Stop worrying about the intricacies of detection techniques, dynamic obfuscation, challenge solving, or updates.
