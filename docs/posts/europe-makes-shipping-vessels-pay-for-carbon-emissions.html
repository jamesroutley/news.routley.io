    <h1>Europe makes shipping vessels pay for carbon emissions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For the past 17 years Europe has been cracking down hard on it’s biggest carbon emitters: power plants, iron smelters, and large factories.</p><p>If you have a company that needs to emit carbon you can buy permits from the government. For each permit you hold you can emit 1 ton of CO2. Under this scheme 45% of all carbon emissions from Europe’s biggest emitters are currently covered.</p><p>Last year Europe announced airlines and shipping vessels would also eventually need to start being apart of this program.</p><p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/eu-strikes-deal-make-ships-pay-their-carbon-emissions-2022-11-30/#:~:text=BRUSSELS%2C%20Nov%2030%20(Reuters),to%20invest%20in%20greener%20technologies.">they turned part of it into law</a>, starting in 2024 all shipping vessels going in and out of Europe will need to buy enough permits to cover 40% of their emissions, by 2026 it’ll be 100%.</p><p>Of course, the cost of this policy will be born by those in Europe importing and exporting goods.</p><p>So once again Europe keeps rapidly going ahead with policies that make stuff more expensive. Yes, carbon is a cost not reflected in the price most of us pay for our stuff.</p><p>But the breakneck speed at which they’re trying to transition to renewable energy led directly to this year’s <a href="https://www.maxinomics.com/commodities/dutch-ttf-natural-gas">natural gas</a> fiasco.</p><p>In a decade Europe is either going to look like a genius on how to get tough things done or it’s going to be an economic madhouse, falling behind other parts of the world.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="473" height="840" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/96AmWLRSl8M" title="In a move sure to bring higher prices, EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme includes ships starting 2024" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--></div></div></div></div>
