<p>I think every portable operator thinks about their coax cables and how to use more light and flexible types. During the last few activations, I have switched from my rigid Aircell 5 to the lightweight and flexible RG316. I have bought a couple of different lengths, mainly from Chinese online sellers at AliExpress.</p>
<p>However, I had some hard to define issues like the vague feeling that I am not getting out as good as I should, or a changing SWR during an activation. So I thought I should check my cables before looking at other parts of my equipment.</p>
<p>My professional and educational background does not have anything to do with electronics, and I don’t have the equipment to measure the cable loss directly. But my goal was to check if the cables were faulty, not to measure the exact attenuation.</p>
<p>I have an SWR and Power meter from DJ9PK as per image below. It can measure PEP and has, according to the seller, an accuracy of +/-4 percent.   You can find more details about it here in <a href="http://www.dj9pk.de/Nextion-Daten.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">German</a> or here in <a href="https://www-dj9pk-de.translate.goog/Nextion-Daten.html?_x_tr_sch=http&amp;_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=de&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a> (Google / auto translated).</p>

<p>My KX3 with a CW paddle served as signal source. As large differences are easier to spot than smaller, I switched to the 10-meter band as the HF band with the highest attenuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20230414_124338-scaled.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20230414_124338-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="474" height="357" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20230414_124338-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></a></p>
<p>I then measured a short cable with a very low loss, a 1 m / 3.3 ft RG213, which should have an attenuation of less than 0.1dB (excluding plugs).</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Image-scaled.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Image-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="474" height="357" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Image-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></a></p>
<p>I simply checked how much power came out at the other end of the cable. That value I have used as reference. This cable (and all others) was plugged directly between the KX3 and the power meter, no ATU involved anywhere. The power meter was set to measure PEP. <span id="more-14626"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Power-scaled.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Power-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="474" height="357" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/qrper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Referenz-Power-scaled.jpg?resize=474%2C357&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></a></p>
<p>I repeated all measurements, but the results were very consistent, with only small deviations.</p>
<p>The results were a nightmare. Two RG316 cables out of 3 from AliExpress had an attenuation of more than 4dB, i.e. less than half of the power came out at the other end.</p>

<p>The other cables were fine, with the losses broadly in range with the cable specifications.</p>
<p>I can not say, if it is a loose connection, a faulty plug or if my handling was too rough. It could be that all cables arrived fine, and I damaged the cables during my usage. But to be honest, I don’t care. If a coax fails after some weeks, then it is not an option for me.</p>
<p>I have briefly discussed the findings with local ham radio club members and then decided to go for a Hyperflex 5 cable until I found a reliable source for RG316 cables.</p>
<p>Why Hyperflex 5 you may ask? It is very flexible, as opposed to Aircell 5, and has a much lower attenuation when compared to RG58.</p>
