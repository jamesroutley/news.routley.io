    <h1>An Interactive Guide to the Fourier Transform</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The Fourier Transform is one of deepest insights ever made. Unfortunately, the meaning is buried within dense equations:</p>

<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/45c088dbb767150fc0bacfeb49dd49e5.png" width="189" height="54" alt="\displaystyle{X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}}"/></p>

<p>Yikes. Rather than jumping into the symbols, let&#39;s experience the key idea firsthand. Here&#39;s a plain-English metaphor:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What does the Fourier Transform do?</strong> Given a smoothie, it finds the recipe.</li>
<li><strong>How?</strong> Run the smoothie through filters to extract each ingredient.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Recipes are easier to analyze, compare, and modify than the smoothie itself.</li>
<li><strong>How do we get the smoothie back?</strong> Blend the ingredients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s the &#34;math English&#34; version of the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Fourier Transform takes a time-based pattern, measures every possible cycle, and returns the overall &#34;cycle recipe&#34; (the amplitude, offset, &amp; rotation speed for every cycle that was found).</li>
</ul>

<p>Time for the equations? No! Let&#39;s get our hands dirty and <em>experience</em> how any pattern can be built with cycles, with live simulations.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we&#39;ll have an aha! moment and intuitively realize why the Fourier Transform is possible. We&#39;ll save the detailed math analysis for the follow-up.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a force-march through the equations, it&#39;s the casual stroll I wish I had. Onward!</p>

<h2>From Smoothie to Recipe</h2>

<p>A math transformation is a change of perspective. We change our notion of quantity from &#34;single items&#34; (lines in the sand, tally system) to &#34;groups of 10&#34; (decimal) depending on what we&#39;re counting. Scoring a game? Tally it up. Multiplying? Decimals, please.</p>

<p>The Fourier Transform changes our perspective from consumer to producer, turning <em>What do I have?</em> into <em>How was it made?</em></p>

<p>In other words: given a smoothie, let&#39;s find the recipe.</p>

<p>Why? Well, recipes are great descriptions of drinks. You wouldn&#39;t share a drop-by-drop analysis, you&#39;d say &#34;I had an orange/banana smoothie&#34;. A recipe is more easily categorized, compared, and modified than the object itself.</p>

<p>So... given a smoothie, how do we find the recipe?</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/smoothie-to-recipe-20121030-223058.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform analogy smoothie to recipe" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/smoothie-to-recipe-20121030-223058.png" height="300"/></picture></p>

<p>Well, imagine you had a few filters lying around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pour through the &#34;banana&#34; filter. 1 oz of bananas are extracted.</li>
<li>Pour through the &#34;orange&#34; filter. 2 oz of oranges.</li>
<li>Pour through the &#34;milk&#34; filter. 3 oz of milk.</li>
<li>Pour through the &#34;water&#34; filter. 3 oz of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can reverse-engineer the recipe by filtering each ingredient. The catch?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Filters must be independent</strong>. The banana filter needs to capture bananas, and nothing else. Adding more oranges should never affect the banana reading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filters must be complete</strong>. We won&#39;t get the real recipe if we leave out a filter (&#34;There were mangoes too!&#34;). Our collection of filters must catch every possible ingredient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ingredients must be combine-able</strong>. Smoothies can be separated and re-combined without issue (A cookie? Not so much. Who wants crumbs?). The ingredients, when separated and combined in any order, must make the same result.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>See The World As Cycles</h2>

<p>The Fourier Transform takes a specific viewpoint: <strong>What if any signal could be filtered into a bunch of circular paths?</strong></p>

<p>Whoa. This concept is mind-blowing, and poor Joseph Fourier had his idea rejected at first. (<em>Really Joe, even a staircase pattern can be made from circles?</em>)</p>

<p>And despite <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_history_of_fourier_series">decades of debate</a> in the math community, we expect students to internalize the idea without issue. Ugh. Let&#39;s walk through the intuition.</p>

<p>The Fourier Transform finds the recipe for a signal, like our smoothie process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a time-based signal</li>
<li>Apply filters to measure each possible &#34;circular ingredient&#34;</li>
<li>Collect the full recipe, listing the amount of each &#34;circular ingredient&#34;</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop. Here&#39;s where most tutorials excitedly throw engineering applications at your face. Don&#39;t get scared; think of the examples as &#34;Wow, we&#39;re finally seeing the source code (DNA) behind previously confusing ideas&#34;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If earthquake vibrations can be separated into &#34;ingredients&#34; (vibrations of different speeds &amp; amplitudes), buildings can be designed to avoid interacting with the strongest ones.</p></li>
<li><p>If sound waves can be separated into ingredients (bass and treble frequencies), we can boost the parts we care about, and hide the ones we don&#39;t. The crackle of random noise can be removed. Maybe similar &#34;sound recipes&#34; can be compared (music recognition services compare recipes, not the raw audio clips).</p></li>
<li><p>If computer data can be represented with oscillating patterns, perhaps the least-important ones can be ignored. This &#34;lossy compression&#34; can drastically shrink file sizes (and why JPEG and MP3 files are much smaller than raw .bmp or .wav files).</p></li>
<li><p>If a radio wave is our signal, we can use filters to listen to a particular channel. In the smoothie world, imagine each person paid attention to a different ingredient: Adam looks for apples, Bob looks for bananas, and Charlie gets cauliflower (sorry bud).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Fourier Transform is useful in engineering, sure, but it&#39;s a metaphor about finding the root causes behind an observed effect.</p>

<h2>Think With Circles, Not Just Sinusoids</h2>

<p>One of my giant confusions was separating the definitions of &#34;sinusoid&#34; and &#34;circle&#34;.</p>

<ul>
<li>A &#34;sinusoid&#34; is a specific back-and-forth pattern (a <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-sine-waves/">sine</a> or cosine wave), and 99% of the time, it refers to motion in one dimension.</li>
<li>A &#34;circle&#34; is a round, 2d pattern you probably know. If you enjoy using 10-dollar words to describe 10-cent ideas, you might call a circular path a &#34;complex sinusoid&#34;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Labeling a circular path as a &#34;complex sinusoid&#34; is like describing a word as a &#34;multi-letter&#34;. You zoomed into the wrong level of detail. Words are about concepts, not the letters they can be split into!</p>

<p>The Fourier Transform is about circular paths (not 1-d sinusoids) and <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/">Euler&#39;s formula</a> is a clever way to generate one:</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/euler/equal_paths.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/equal_paths.png" alt="euler path"/></picture></p>

<p>Must we use imaginary exponents to move in a circle? Nope. But it&#39;s convenient and compact. And sure, we can describe our path as coordinated motion in two dimensions (real and imaginary), but don&#39;t forget the big picture: we&#39;re just moving in a circle.</p>

<h2>Following Circular Paths</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s say we&#39;re chatting on the phone and, like usual, I want us to draw the same circle simultaneously. (<em>You promised!</em>) What should I say?</p>

<ul>
<li>How big is the circle? (Amplitude, i.e. size of radius)</li>
<li>How fast do we draw it? (Frequency. 1 circle/second is a frequency of 1 Hertz (Hz) or 2*pi radians/sec)</li>
<li>Where do we start? (Phase angle, where 0 degrees is the x-axis)</li>
</ul>

<p>I could say &#34;2-inch radius, start at 45 degrees, 1 circle per second, go!&#34;. After half a second, we should each be pointing to: starting point + amount traveled = 45 + 180 = 225 degrees (on a 2-inch circle).</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/circular-path-parameters-20121201-203317.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="circular path with parameters" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/circular-path-parameters-20121201-203317.png" width="500"/></picture></p>

<p>Every circular path needs a size, speed, and starting angle (amplitude/frequency/phase). We can even combine paths: imagine tiny motorcars, driving in circles at different speeds.</p>

<p>The combined position of <em>all the cycles</em> is our signal, just like the combined flavor of <em>all the ingredients</em> is our smoothie.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simulation of a basic circular path:</p>



<p>(Based on <a href="http://treeblurb.com/dev_math/sin_canv00.html">this animation</a>, here&#39;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/kazad/8bb682da198db597558c">the source code</a>. Modern browser required. Click the graph to pause/unpause.)</p>

<p>The magnitude of each cycle is listed in order, starting at 0Hz. Cycles <code>[0 1]</code> means</p>

<ul>
<li>0 amplitude for the 0Hz cycle (0Hz = a constant cycle, stuck on the x-axis at zero degrees)</li>
<li>1 amplitude for the 1Hz cycle (completes 1 cycle per time interval)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the tricky part:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The blue graph measures the <em>real part</em> of the cycle</strong>. Another lovely math confusion: the real axis of the circle, which is usually horizontal, has its magnitude shown on the vertical axis. You can mentally rotate the circle 90 degrees if you like.</li>
<li><strong>The time points are spaced at the fastest frequency</strong>. A 1Hz signal needs 2 time points for a start and stop (a single data point doesn&#39;t have a frequency). The time values <code>[1 -1]</code> shows the amplitude at these equally-spaced intervals.</li>
</ul>

<p>With me? <code>[0 1]</code> is a pure 1Hz cycle.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s add a 2Hz cycle to the mix. <code>[0 1 1]</code> means &#34;Nothing at 0Hz, 1Hz of amplitude 1, 2Hz of amplitude 1&#34;:</p>



<p>Whoa. The little motorcars are getting wild: the green lines are the 1Hz and 2Hz cycles, and the blue line is the combined result. Try toggling the green checkbox to see the final result clearly. The combined &#34;flavor&#34; is a sway that starts at the max and dips low for the rest of the interval.</p>

<p>The yellow dots are when we actually measure the signal. With 3 cycles defined (0Hz, 1Hz, 2Hz), each dot is 1/3 of the way through the signal. In this case, cycles <code>[0 1 1]</code> generate the time values <code>[2 -1 -1]</code>, which starts at the max (2) and dips low (-1).</p>

<p>Oh! We can&#39;t forget phase, the starting angle! Use <code>magnitude:angle</code> to set the phase. So <code>[0 1:45]</code> is a 1Hz cycle that starts at 45 degrees:</p>



<p>This is a shifted version of <code>[0 1]</code>. On the time side we get <code>[.7 -.7]</code> instead of <code>[1 -1]</code>, because our cycle isn&#39;t exactly lined up with our measuring intervals, which are still at the halfway point (this could be desired!).</p>

<p><strong>The Fourier Transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes and phases to match any time signal.</strong></p>

<p>Our signal becomes an abstract notion that we consider as &#34;observations in the time domain&#34; or &#34;ingredients in the frequency domain&#34;.</p>

<p>Enough talk: try it out! In the simulator, type any time or cycle pattern you&#39;d like to see. If it&#39;s time points, you&#39;ll get a collection of cycles (that combine into a &#34;wave&#34;) that matches your desired points.</p>

<p><a href="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform examples" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png" width="550px"/></picture></a></p>

<p>But… doesn&#39;t the combined wave have strange values between the yellow time intervals? Sure. But who&#39;s to say whether a signal travels in straight lines, or curves, or zips into other dimensions when we aren&#39;t measuring it? It behaves exactly as we need at the equally-spaced moments we asked for.</p>

<h2>Making A Spike In Time</h2>

<p>Can we make a spike in time, like <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>, using cycles? I&#39;ll use parentheses <code>()</code> for a sequence of time points, and brackets <code>[]</code> for a sequence of cycles.</p>

<p>Although the spike seems boring to us time-dwellers (<em>one data point, that&#39;s it?</em>), think about the complexity in the cycle world. Our cycle ingredients must start aligned (at the max value, 4) and then &#34;explode outwards&#34;, each cycle with partners that cancel it in the future. Every remaining point is zero, which is a tricky balance with multiple cycles running around (we can&#39;t just &#34;turn them off&#34;).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s walk through each time point:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At time 0, the first instant, every cycle ingredient is at its max. Ignoring the other time points, <code>(4 ? ? ?)</code> can be made from 4 cycles (0Hz 1Hz 2Hz 3Hz), each with a magnitude of 1 and phase of 0 (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4).</p></li>
<li><p>At every future point (t = 1, 2, 3), the sum of all cycles must cancel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s the trick: when two cycles are on opposites sides of the circle (North &amp; South, East &amp; West, etc.) their combined position is zero (3 cycles can cancel if they&#39;re spread evenly at 0, 120, and 240 degrees).</p>

<p>Imagine a constellation of points moving around the circle. Here&#39;s the position of each cycle at every instant:</p>

<pre>Time 0 1 2 3 
------------
0Hz: 0 0 0 0 
1Hz: 0 1 2 3
2Hz: 0 2 0 2
3Hz: 0 3 2 1
</pre>

<p>Notice how the the 3Hz cycle starts at 0, gets to position 3, then position &#34;6&#34; (with only 4 positions, 6 <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/fun-with-modular-arithmetic/">modulo</a> 4 = 2), then position &#34;9&#34; (9 modulo 4 = 1).</p>

<p>When our cycle is 4 units long, cycle speeds a half-cycle apart (2 units) will either be lined up (difference of 0, 4, 8…) or on opposite sides (difference of 2, 6, 10…).</p>

<p>OK. Let&#39;s drill into each time point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time 0: All cycles at their max (total of 4)</li>
<li>Time 1: 1Hz and 3Hz cancel (positions 1 &amp; 3 are opposites), 0Hz and 2Hz cancel as well. The net is 0.</li>
<li>Time 2: 0Hz and 2Hz line up at position 0, while 1Hz and 3Hz line up at position 2 (the opposite side). The total is still 0.</li>
<li>Time 3: 0Hz and 2Hz cancel. 1Hz and 3Hz cancel.</li>
<li>Time 4 (repeat of t=0): All cycles line up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick is having individual speeds cancel (0Hz vs 2Hz, 1Hz vs 3Hz), or having the lined-up pairs cancel (0Hz + 2Hz vs 1Hz + 3Hz).</p>

<p>When every cycle has equal power and 0 phase, we start aligned and cancel afterwards. (I don&#39;t have a nice proof yet -- any takers? -- but you can see it yourself. Try <code>[1 1]</code>, <code>[1 1 1]</code>, <code>[1 1 1 1]</code> and notice the signals we generate: <code>(2 0)</code>, <code>(3 0 0)</code>, <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>).</p>

<p>In my head, I label these signals as &#34;time spikes&#34;: they have a value for a single instant, and are zero otherwise (the fancy name is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">delta function</a>.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I visualize the initial alignment, followed by a net cancellation:</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/fourier-interference-20121211-171719.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform constructive and destructive interference" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/fourier-interference-20121211-171719.png" width="400px"/></picture></p>

<h2>Moving The Time Spike</h2>

<p>Not everything happens at t=0. Can we change our spike to <code>(0 4 0 0)</code>?</p>

<p>It seems the cycle ingredients should be similar to <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>, but the cycles must align at t=1 (one second in the future). Here&#39;s where phase comes in.</p>

<p>Imagine a race with 4 runners. Normal races have everyone lined up at the starting line, the <code>(4 0 0 0)</code> time pattern. Boring.</p>

<p>What if we want everyone to <em>finish</em> at the same time? Easy. Just move people forward or backwards by the appropriate distance. Maybe granny can start 2 feet in front of the finish line, Usain Bolt can start 100m back, and they can cross the tape holding hands.</p>

<p>Phase shifts, the starting angle, are delays in the cycle universe. Here&#39;s how we adjust the starting position to delay every cycle 1 second:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 0Hz cycle doesn&#39;t move, so it&#39;s already aligned</li>
<li>A 1Hz cycle goes 1 revolution in the entire 4 seconds, so a 1-second delay is a quarter-turn. Phase shift it 90 degrees backwards (-90) and it gets to phase=0, the max value, at t=1.</li>
<li>A 2Hz cycle is twice as fast, so give it twice the angle to cover (-180 or 180 phase shift -- it&#39;s across the circle, either way).</li>
<li>A 3Hz cycle is 3x as fast, so give it 3x the distance to move (-270 or +90 phase shift)</li>
</ul>

<p>If time points <code>(4 0 0 0)</code> are made from cycles <code>[1 1 1 1]</code>, then time points <code>(0 4 0 0)</code> are made from <code>[1 1:-90 1:180 1:90]</code>. (Note: I&#39;m using &#34;1Hz&#34;, but I mean &#34;1 cycle over the entire time period&#34;).</p>

<p>Whoa -- we&#39;re working out the cycles in our head!</p>

<p>The interference visualization is similar, except the alignment is at t=1.</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/delayed-spike-20121214-162623.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform time spike" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/delayed-spike-20121214-162623.png" width="400px"/></picture></p>

<p>Test your intuition: Can you make <code>(0 0 4 0)</code>, i.e. a 2-second delay? 0Hz has no phase. 1Hz has 180 degrees, 2Hz has 360 (aka 0), and 3Hz has 540 (aka 180), so it&#39;s <code>[1 1:180 1 1:180]</code>.</p>

<h2>Discovering The Full Transform</h2>

<p>The big insight: our signal is just a bunch of time spikes! If we merge the recipes for each time spike, we should get the recipe for the full signal.</p>

<p>The Fourier Transform builds the recipe frequency-by-frequency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate the full signal (a b c d) into &#34;time spikes&#34;: (a 0 0 0) (0 b 0 0) (0 0 c 0) (0 0 0 d)</li>
<li>For any frequency (like 2Hz), the <em>tentative</em> recipe is &#34;a/4 + b/4 + c/4 + d/4&#34; (the amplitude of each spike is split among all frequencies)</li>
<li>Wait! We need to offset each spike with a phase delay (the angle for a &#34;1 second delay&#34; depends on the frequency).</li>
<li>Actual recipe for a frequency = a/4 (no offset) + b/4 (1 second offset) + c/4 (2 second offset) + d/4 (3 second offset).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can then loop through every frequency to get the full transform.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the conversion from &#34;math English&#34; to full math:</p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/fourier-explained-20121219-224649.png.webp" type="image/webp"/><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform plain english" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/fourier-explained-20121219-224649.png" width="500px"/></picture></p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>N = number of time samples we have</li>
<li>n = current sample we&#39;re considering (0 .. N-1)</li>
<li>x<sub>n</sub> = value of the signal at time n</li>
<li>k = current frequency we&#39;re considering (0 Hertz up to N-1 Hertz)</li>
<li>X<sub>k</sub> = amount of frequency k in the signal (amplitude and phase, a complex number)</li>
<li>The 1/N factor is usually moved to the <em>reverse transform</em> (going from frequencies back to time). This <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/58163/dft-why-are-the-definitions-for-inverse-and-forward-commonly-switched">is allowed</a>, though I prefer 1/N in the forward transform since it gives the <em>actual</em> sizes for the time spikes. You can get wild and even use $1/\sqrt{N}$ on both transforms (going forward and back creates the 1/N factor).</li>
<li>n/N is the percent of the time we&#39;ve gone through. 2 * pi * k is our speed in radians / sec. e^-ix is our backwards-moving circular path. The combination is how far we&#39;ve moved, for this speed and time.</li>
<li>The raw equations for the Fourier Transform just say &#34;add the complex numbers&#34;. Many programming languages cannot handle complex numbers directly, so you convert everything to rectangular coordinates and add those.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Onward</h2>

<p>This was my most challenging article yet. The Fourier Transform has several flavors (discrete/continuous/finite/infinite), covers deep math (Dirac delta functions), and it&#39;s easy to get lost in details. I was constantly bumping into the edge of my knowledge.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s always simple analogies out there -- I refuse to think otherwise. Whether it&#39;s a smoothie or Usain Bolt &amp; Granny crossing the finish line, take a simple understanding and refine it. The analogy is flawed, and that&#39;s ok: it&#39;s a raft to use, and leave behind once we cross the river.</p>

<p>I realized how feeble my own understanding was when I couldn&#39;t work out the transform of <code>(1 0 0 0)</code> in my head. For me, it was like saying I knew addition but, gee whiz, I&#39;m not sure what &#34;1 + 1 + 1 + 1&#34; would be. Why not? Shouldn&#39;t we have an intuition for the simplest of operations?</p>

<p>That discomfort led me around the web to build my intuition. In addition to the references in the article, I&#39;d like to thank:</p>

</ul>

<p>Today&#39;s goal was to <em>experience</em> the Fourier Transform. We&#39;ll save the advanced analysis for next time.</p>

<p>Imagine spinning your signal in a centrifuge and checking for a bias. I have a correction: we must spin <em>backwards</em> (the exponent in the equation above should be $e^{-i 2 \pi...}$). You already know why: we need a phase <em>delay</em> so spikes appear in the <em>future</em>.</p>

<p>The Fourier Transform is about cycles added to cycles added to cycles. Try making a &#34;time spike&#34; by setting a amplitude of 1 for every component (press Enter after inputting each number). Fun fact: with enough terms, you can draw any shape, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVuU2YCwHjw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Homer Simpson</a>.</p>
