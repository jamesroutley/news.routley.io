    <h1>Japan Post launches &#39;digital address&#39; system</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                      <p>Japan Post said Monday that it has launched a &#34;digital address&#34; system that links seven-digit combinations of numbers and letters to physical addresses.</p>

<p>Under the system, users can input these seven-digit codes on online shopping websites, and their addresses will automatically appear on the sites.</p>

<p>People can obtain digital addresses by registering with Japan Post&#39;s Yu ID membership service. Their digital addresses will not change even if their physical addresses change. Their new addresses will be linked to the codes if they submit notices of address changes.</p>

<p>With Japan Post opening up a system for obtaining address information using the codes, e-commerce giant Rakuten and others are considering adopting it.</p>

<p>Japan Post plans to spend about a decade to promote broad adoption of the new system.</p>
