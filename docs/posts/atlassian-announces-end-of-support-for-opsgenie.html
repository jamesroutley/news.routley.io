    <h1>Atlassian announces end of support for Opsgenie</h1>

<p>We’re committed to bringing our customers the best possible solutions to keep their teams connected, and their businesses running. That’s why Atlassian acquired Opsgenie in 2018: to help customers run their most critical services with best-in-class alerting and on-call management.</p>



<p>In 2020 we launched Jira Service Management, uniting IT, development, and business teams on a single platform to deliver outstanding service experiences. Today, we’re taking an important next step by announcing the full transition of Opsgenie’s capabilities into the Atlassian platform to better serve your needs.</p>



<h2 id="Our-vision-for-modern-operations"><strong>Our vision for modern operations</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last few years, we’ve built Opsgenie’s operations capabilities into the Atlassian platform—shared across both Jira Service Management and Compass—to deepen the connection between your development and IT operations teams.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://wac-cdn-bfldr.atlassian.com/K3MHR9G8/at/8zmzhm8h478wrpp7sr2pmgsx/CSD-15922_OpsgenieMigrationBlogAnnouncement_Hero_rovo_graph.png?auto=webp&amp;format=png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Customers who need an end-to-end ITSM solution can find one in Jira Service Management, and the powerful platform features that come along with it. Meanwhile, development-focused teams can easily track components with advanced alerting and on-call management in Compass. Together, this forms a complete modern IT operations platform: one that connects development, IT, and support teams in a way that only Atlassian can. We’re continuously enhancing this platform with AIOps capabilities like AI-driven alert grouping, automated alert resolution, automated PIR creation, and more, empowering your team to efficiently detect, prevent, and resolve incidents.</p>



<h2 id="What’s-next-for-Opsgenie-customers"><strong>What’s next for Opsgenie customers</strong></h2>



<p>Starting today, there are two options for Opsgenie customers: move to Jira Service Management for robust end-to-end incident management, or move to Compass for alerting and on-call management alongside an intuitive software component catalog.</p>



<p>As you prepare for this transition, please keep these key milestones in mind:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Opsgenie end of sale – effective June 4th, 2025: </strong>Starting on this date, you’ll no longer be able to purchase or sign up for Opsgenie. This applies to purchases directly from Atlassian (on atlassian.com, or from the Atlassian sales team) as well as partners and resellers. Edition upgrades and downgrades will not be available after this date, though renewals will still be allowed after this date, so long as the subscription term ends before the end of support date below.</li>



<li><strong>Opsgenie end of support – effective April 5th, 2027:</strong> On this date, access to Opsgenie will be shut off, and the product will no longer accessible. Any unmigrated data in Opsgenie will also be deleted at this point.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Opsgenie-Migration/gh-p/opsgenie-migration">read more about the migration process on Atlassian Community Forums</a>, or <a href="http://atlassian.com/software/opsgenie/migration#faq">visit our FAQ</a> for more information on how to plan your next steps.</p>



<h2 id="A-thank-you-to-our-Opsgenie-customers">A thank you to our Opsgenie customers</h2>



<p>We recognize the significance of this transition for our Opsgenie customers, and are committed to supporting you through the migration process. Thank you for trusting us with your team’s most critical work since Opsgenie’s founding in 2012. We remain committed to bringing you best-in-class solutions to help your teams work better, together to keep your critical services running. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.</p>
