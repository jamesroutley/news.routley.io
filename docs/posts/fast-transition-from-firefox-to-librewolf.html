    <h1>Show HN: Fast Transition from Firefox to Librewolf</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After looking at various browser alternatives to Firefox (my daily driver for years), I decided to try LibreWolf and the transition was trivial on a Debian based system (by HN standards). My extensions even ran without logging in (YMMV).</p><p>First install LibreWolf:
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install extrepo -y
sudo extrepo enable librewolf
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install librewolf -y</p><p>Second:
After closing Firefox, copy Firefox profile (in ~/.mozilla/firefox/) to Librevox profile (in ~/.librewolf/).</p><p>Note: I copied the profile into the default profile (as seen in about:profiles) not default-default. I then launched the profile and all my tabs were restored, bookmarks, logins, etc. I will update if something seems broken.</p></div></div></div>
