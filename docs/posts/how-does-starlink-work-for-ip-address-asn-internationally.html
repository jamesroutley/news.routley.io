    <h1>Ask HN: How does Starlink work for IP address/ASN internationally?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was curious how Starlink would work when connected in international locations? Would it show a US IP address? Would it show a Starlink ISP ASN?</p><p>For comparision - cell phone tethering plans, you can be &#34;anywhere&#34; in the world, but the roaming telcom provider will (lack of a better word) &#34;tunnel&#34; your connection to your local telcom so you could be in China, France, UK but you would have the country of origin IP address/telcom provider ASN? E.g. T-Mobile from USA, but in Europe would show that you&#39;re either in California or Kansas.</p></div></div></div>
