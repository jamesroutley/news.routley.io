<p>I find that when I play RPG games, I often hoard single-use items like potions and scrolls, saving them for some future critical moment. I finish games like Skyrim with a backpack full of unspent resources, reserved for a crisis that never actually arrives. What’s the point, then, of all these items?</p>
<p>Just like I save items in games, in real life I too am reluctant to ask for favors or promote my own projects. (Sometimes I even save all my favourite treats and I never eat the last one). I treated these social and professional resources as if they were single-use “magical items”, not to be wasted but reserved for some important-yet-undefined future magnum opus event.</p>
<p>Recently I played Baldur’s Gate 3 and I decided to try something new: I would actually <em>gasp</em> use my items as needed, as they were intended, without undue reservation. Not only was it actually <em>fun</em> to use my fireball scrolls and blow stuff up, but I also discovered new layers and hidden quests. For instance, using a ‘Speak with the Dead’ scroll on a certain suspicious corpse unveiled a questline I would have otherwise missed.</p>
<p>With the same mindset, I’ve been trying to adjust in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>To my surprise, these actions didn’t exhaust my social or professional capital; instead, they allowed me to derive benefits and opened new avenues, much like in the game. A friend forwarded my resume within their network, and my posts connected me with others who shared my interests.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s far more important in life that you use the resources available to you, because you’re on a clock. You need to optimize for your gains wherever you can take them, before you or your resources expire.</p>
<p>And remember, people in your life actually want to help you. They also stand to benefit, and any sort of social capital isn’t necessarily “single-use”, more like “on a cooldown”, able to be requested again after a suitable delay or returning a favor.</p>
<p>Resources, whether in games or in life, are meant to be utilized. Hoarding them out of fear of depletion prevents us from discovering new opportunities and connections. That’s a scarcity mindset that we don’t need to employ. Life thrives not on conservation but on strategic and bold usage of what we do have.</p>
<p>We should not view our capabilities and opportunities as limited-use potions to be saved for the perfect moment. Instead, we should see them as tools (sometimes with a cooldown) and aptly use them to unblock ourselves and move ahead whenever possible, in the very short time that we have on Earth.</p>
