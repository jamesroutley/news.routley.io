At AAX, we have always put our users first, and we would like to share with you the following updates regarding our current situation. We are hopeful that as a community, we can brave through these troubling times together. <br/></p>
<ol><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">AAX scheduled a system upgrade that will help protect our users from the multiple malicious attacks that we’ve observed during this vulnerable time. Due to the failure of our third-party partner, some users&#39; balance data were found abnormally recorded in our system. Hence, limiting our services to prevent further risks, the technical team has had to manually proofread and restore the system to ensure maximum accuracy of all users’ holdings.<br/></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">AAX will continue our best efforts to resume regular operations for all users within 7-10 days to ensure the utmost accuracy. In this light, withdrawals have been suspended to avoid fraud and exploitation. We understand it is important for users to be able to withdraw and transact as soon as possible, and we are working extremely hard to offer limited withdrawals to minimize risk.<br/></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, we have created an <a href="https://bit.ly/3OhDPDr">AAX User Withdrawal Request Form</a> for withdrawal and other operational requests. Our Customer Service Team will follow up and strive to resolve the requests manually one by one in close coordination with our security, operations, and compliance team to ensure a smooth process. Expect manual withdrawals to take longer than usual.<br/> </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">AAX has set up a dedicated Task Force to closely monitor the situation and provide daily updates every day at 12:00 pm (UTC+8) on our official social media and Telegram communities, including the status of daily withdrawals and the progress of our system updates. We also seek to provide the highest level of transparency on our liquidity and risk management.</p></li></ol>

<p dir="ltr">Please also note that no one from AAX or any of our affiliated partners will ever ask you for account passwords, 2FA codes, or any information that would compromise access to your funds. Requests for manual withdrawals, however, will require a UID and relevant information to verify user identity - such as a copy of your ID and registered contact information. </p>
