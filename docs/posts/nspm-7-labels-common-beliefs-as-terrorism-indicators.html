Bush signed a series of classified national security directives after 9/11, the most famous of which authorized NSA’s unlawful domestic intercepts, a directive that wasn’t publicly revealed until four years later.</p><p><span>In NSPM-7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” President Trump </span><em>directs</em><span> the Justice Department, the FBI, and other national security agencies and departments to fight his version of political violence in America, retooling a network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces to focus on “leftist” political violence in America. This vast counterterrorism army, made up of federal, state, and local agents would, as Trump aide Stephen Miller said, form “the central hub of that effort.”</span></p><p>NSPM-7 directs a new national strategy to “disrupt” any individual or groups “that foment political violence,” including “before they result in violent political acts.” </p><p><span>In other words, they’re targeting pre-crime, to reference </span><em>Minority Report</em><span>.</span></p><p>The Trump administration isn’t only targeting organizations or groups but even  individuals and “entities” whom NSPM-7 says can be identified by any of the following “indica” (indicators) of violence:</p><ul><li><p>anti-Americanism,</p></li><li><p>anti-capitalism,</p></li><li><p>anti-Christianity,</p></li><li><p>support for the overthrow of the United States Government,</p></li><li><p>extremism on migration,</p></li><li><p>extremism on race,</p></li><li><p>extremism on gender</p></li><li><p>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family,</p></li><li><p>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on religion, and</p></li><li><p>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on morality.</p></li></ul><p><span>“The United States requires a national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies </span><em>before they result in violent political acts</em><span>,” the directive states (emphasis mine).</span></p><p>A “pre-crime” endeavor, preventing attacks before they happen, is core to the post-9/11 concept of counterterrorism itself. No longer satisfied to investigate acts of terrorism after the fact to bring terrorists to justice, the Bush administration adopted preemption. Overseas, that led to aerial assassination by drones and “special operations” kill missions. Domestically, it led to a counter-terrorism campaign whose hallmark was excessive and illegal government surveillance and the use of undercover agents and “confidential human sources” to trap (and entrap) would-be terrorists.</p><p>Now, with Donald Trump’s directive retooling the counter-terror apparatus to go after Americans at home, this means monitoring political activity, or speech, as an investigative method to discover “radicalism.” (Contrary to other national security documents all during the post-Watergate era, NSPM-7 doesn’t even mention the First Amendment or the fundamental right of Americans to organize and protest.)</p><p>The focus on speech is evident throughout NSPM-7. The directive says that political violence is the result of “organized campaigns” that often begin (with the left) dehumanizing targets in “anonymous chat foras, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions.”</p><p><span>To give a sense of how broad this formulation is, Trump’s earlier designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist group was accompanied by a White House fact sheet singling out people who “celebrated” Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. As </span><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/breaking-trump-declares-war-on-left" rel="">I wrote at the time</a><span>, this describes a lot of Americans!</span></p><p>Trump’s new national security memorandum also alludes to Mangione but adds to it even larger categories of potential targets.</p><p><span>NSPM-7 is fundamentally a law enforcement directive, and it dispenses with the complications of using the active duty military or the National Guard in pursuit of political violence. It directs the Department of Justice to focus the FBI’s </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism/joint-terrorism-task-forces" rel="">approximately 200</a><span> Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) to the new mission. The FBI network of task forces comprises over 4,000 members—including FBI personnel and task force officers (or TFOs) from more than 500 state and local agencies and 50 federal agencies, including special agents, police officers, intelligence analysts and surveillance technicians. First established in New York City in 1980 to systematize FBI and NYPD cooperation, today there are task forces around the country, including at least one in each of the FBI’s 55 field offices.</span></p><p>For the Trump White House, the beauty of using an already existing network is that it bypasses Congressional oversight and scrutiny and even obscures federal activity to governors and legislatures at the state level. States, cities, and local police have already signed Memoranda of Agreements with the feds to fight terrorism and officers are already assigned as task force officers.</p><p>NSPM-7 says the JTTFs “shall investigate” potential federal crimes relating to “acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons” for the purpose of “political violence, terrorism, or conspiracy against rights; and the violent deprivation of any citizen’s rights.” It authorizes the JTTFs to investigate individuals, organizations, and funders “responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet the principal actors engaging in the criminal conduct.”</p><p>“The Attorney General shall issue specific guidance that ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder,” NSPM-7 says. Civil disorder?</p><p><span>I don’t want to sound hyperbolic but the plain truth is that NSPM-7 is a declaration of war on anyone who does not support the Trump administration and its agenda. Yes, it repeats the word “violent” over and over to purport only to go after citizens who are moved to take up arms, but it also directs monitoring and intelligence collection to map and target the new “evildoers,” to borrow a Bush label </span><a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010916-2.html" rel="">he took</a><span> from the Bible just days after 9/11. </span></p><p>The partisan focus couldn’t be more obvious.</p><p>“The real problem is this: since Charlie [Kirk] was murdered — a friend of mine, assassinated — nothing’s changed on their side,” White House counter-terrorism czar Sebastian Gorka told Newsmax after NSPM-7 was signed. “Not one leader —not one left wing thought leader, member of Congress, Senator — nobody has said we distance ourselves from the violent rhetoric.” </p><p>“The left refuses to rid themselves of the justification for violence,” Gorka continued, “and as such, President Trump is taking measures to protect us from the violent rhetoric that becomes snipers and bullets.”</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs/comments&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Leave a comment&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>— </span><em>Edited by William M.
