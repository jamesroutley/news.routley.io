    <h1>23andMe says user data stolen in credential stuffing attack</h1>

<p>23andMe has confirmed to BleepingComputer that it is aware of user data from its platform circulating on hacker forums and attributes the leak to a credential-stuffing attack.</p>
<p>23andMe is a U.S. biotechnology and genomics firm offering genetic testing services to customers who send a saliva sample to its labs and get back an ancestry and genetic predispositions report.</p>
<p>Recently, a threat actor leaked samples of data that was allegedly stolen from a genetics firm and, a few days later, offered to sell data packs belonging to 23andMe customers.</p>

<p>The initial data leak was limited, with the threat actor releasing 1 million lines of data for Ashkenazi people. However, on October 4, the threat actor offered to sell data profiles in bulk for $1-$10 per 23andMe account, depending on how many were purchased.</p>

<p>A 23andMe spokesperson confirmed the data is legitimate and told BleepingComputer that the threat actors used exposed credentials from other breaches to access 23andMe accounts and steal the sensitive data.</p>
<p>&#34;We were made aware that certain 23andMe customer profile information was compiled through access to individual 23andMe.com accounts,&#34; stated 23andMe&#39;s spokesperson</p>
<p>&#34;We do not have any indication at this time that there has been a data security incident within our systems.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Rather, the preliminary results of this investigation suggest that the login credentials used in these access attempts may have been gathered by a threat actor from data leaked during incidents involving other online platforms where users have recycled login credentials.&#34;</p>
<p>The information that has been exposed from this incident includes full names, usernames, profile photos, sex, date of birth, genetic ancestry results, and geographical location.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has also learned that the number of accounts sold by the cybercriminal does not reflect the number of 23andMe accounts breached using exposed credentials.</p>
<p>The compromised accounts had opted into the platform&#39;s &#39;DNA Relatives&#39; feature, which allows users to find genetic relatives and connect with them.</p>
<p>The threat actor accessed a small number of 23andMe accounts and then scraped the data of their DNA Relative matches, which shows how opting into a feature can have unexpected privacy consequences.</p>
<p>23andMe told BleepingComputer that the platform offers two-factor authentication as an additional account protection measure and <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034119874-Adding-2-Step-Verification-to-Your-23andMe-Account" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">encourages</a> all users to enable it.</p>
<p>Users should refrain from reusing passwords and consistently employ strong, distinct credentials for every online account they have.</p>
