    <h1>Tell HN: Duty of Care</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>This brief reply [0] got some love so I thought I&#39;d elaborate. Company ultimately did the right thing so I&#39;m leaving out elements that would identify them.</p><p>I was once asked to remove a hardware safety mechanism from a medical device [1] and replace it with a software only function. Technical first, then we&#39;ll discuss wetware.</p><p>The process was started by, and results displayed on, an embedded Windows PC [2]. The PC didn&#39;t control any safety critical operations. Hardware peripherals had their own sensors, firmware, and safety mechanisms. You could incinerate the PC at any point and be fine.</p><p>There was a Big Red Button acting as a physical power cut-out. Request was to remove the physical button and rely only on a software (touch screen). Death was a remote harm, but moderate injury / user stuck in device / panic attack was plausible. And it&#39;s Windows, so duh.</p><p>Managers didn&#39;t contest my logic, but the request came down from none other than the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a publicly traded company, who was also a major shareholder and took a personal interest in the project. He ran over every layer of management until he ran into my skinny ass. I&#39;m the runt of the litter that would have been pecked to death in the nest if his parents weren&#39;t so amazing.</p><p>I said no way. Not going to happen. Not going to do it. But I never hinted at resignation. They were going to have to fire me or go around me while I take discoverable notes.</p><p>That Big Red Button is still there to this day.</p><p>&#34;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.&#34; - Margaret Mead</p><p>Some suggestions for people in similar circumstances:</p><p>1. Live within your means and have savings. Hard to stand your ground if you&#39;re living paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>2. Suggest reasonable alternatives and keep cool.</p><p>3. Document. Even if it&#39;s just an email to yourself. Who, what, where, when, why, and how much. Update it as the situation evolves. Stick to raw facts you have direct knowledge of.</p><p>4. Research and cite applicable regulations or similar situations. Bring it up with company legal / regulatory affairs staff. Email them after the meeting with a summary of what you discussed.</p><p>5. Don&#39;t resign. Just put your tools down.</p><p>6. ---- I&#39;ve never had to cross this line, but theoreticallyâ€¦.</p><p>7. Sign nothing that looks like a liability release or NDA (often included in severance offers) if they terminate you.</p><p>8. Contact government regulators. OSHA, FDA, FAA, etc.</p><p>9. Nuclear option is go to the press, but I don&#39;t suggest that unless you can afford to bring a lawyer and love a shit show. You probably already signed an NDA before this point. But personally, if it involved risk of death, I&#39;d do it.</p><p>References:</p><p>[0] <a href="https://twitter.com/LdnmaSentinel/status/1589822045592096768" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/LdnmaSentinel/status/1589822045592096768</a></p><p>[1] The studious among you will note the similarities to the Therac-25: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25</a></p><p>[2] At one point we had requirements for hardware peripherals that only had Windows drivers.
