    <h1>Classified specs leaked on War Thunder forum for third time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>WarThunder is a popular MMO military vehicle combat game, one that draws a large and fervent fan base. The game developers also host a forum for fans of the game to talk, and frequently debate, about the specifications and abilities of various vehicles modelled in the game.</h3><p>Recently, WarThunder has added more historically recent vehicles to the game, ones that remain in service with major armies. This, combined with a fervent, technicality familiar fanbase, has led to a few major leaks of classified technical information, affecting both the Challenger 2 and Leclerc MBTs.</p><p>Now the same fate befalls a non-NATO main battle tank. On the 31st of May, images reposted online show that a user posted an image of a Chinese DTC10-125 tungsten penetrator sitting on a technical document describing the specifications of the projectile.</p><p><a href="https://ukdj.imgix.net/2022/06/blur1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;s=c633d30984fee193e170e352812f9593"><img srcset="https://ukdj.imgix.net/2022/06/blur1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;fit=scale&amp;h=300&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;w=273&amp;wpsize=medium&amp;s=418f7c603a4bb3a1c1eabf78daa270fa 300w, https://ukdj.imgix.net/2022/06/blur1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;s=c633d30984fee193e170e352812f9593 619w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" src="https://ukdj.imgix.net/2022/06/blur1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.0&amp;s=c633d30984fee193e170e352812f9593" alt="" width="619" height="679"/></a></p><p>The document, shown above, appears to outline the armour penetration figures against both composite and RHA armour, muzzle velocity at ambient temperature, and dispersion. A technical diagram and handling instructions are also outlined on the document. Some of the information has appeared on the internet before in brochures and claims from the PLA, but this appears to be the first images of internal documentation.</p><p>The DTC10-125 can be fired from the ZTZ 96, 96A, 99, 99A, and is one of the PLAs main tank killing rounds.</p><p>WarThunder forum moderators quickly removed the post, adding <em>“Materials related to the DTC10-125 are classified in China”</em>. Some reports state that the image has popped up previously on Chinese forums, though this remains unconfirmed due to heavy Chinese internet controls. The document cannot be independently verified at this point, but the projectile resting on it appears to be a genuine DTC10-125.</p><p>You can read about a gamer identifying as a Challenger 2 commander posting a classified document online in order to improve the accuracy of the design of the tank <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-challenger-tank-specs-leaked-online-for-videogame/">by clicking here</a> and you can also read about a French Army tank crewman leaking a portion of the Leclerc Main Battle Tank’s classified manual on the forum <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-tank-specs-leaked-on-war-thunder-game-forums-again/">by clicking here.</a></p></div></div>
