    <h1>Tell HN: WhatsApp appears to be censoring references to Signal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I don&#39;t usually go in for conspiracy theories, but this one seems pretty clear-cut and I can&#39;t see anyone else discussing it online: WhatsApp appears to be selectively censoring references to Signal.</p><p>Specifically, I had changed my profile picture on WhatsApp to the Signal logo and my ‘About’ text to ‘Message me on Signal - https://signal.org/download/’. However, I noticed recently (after someone happened to open their WhatsApp in front of me and I saw their chat with me) that my WhatsApp contacts are seeing my profile picture and my ‘About’ text as blank. I&#39;ve checked and this seems to be the case for all of my WhatsApp contacts.</p><p>See screenshots from me and my friend&#39;s phones here: https://imgur.com/a/qvEsswW</p><p>On the bright side, this serves as an ideal demo for convincing anyone who doesn&#39;t understand why I am trying to migrate them over to Signal. So, I guess, <i>thanks</i> Meta?</p></div></div></div>
