We will release bilingual (English and Chinese) math models soon.</b></p></blockquote><p>Over the past year, we have dedicated significant effort to researching and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with a particular focus on their ability to solve arithmetic and mathematical problems. Today, we are delighted to introduce a series of <strong>math-specific</strong> large language models of our Qwen2 series, Qwen2-Math and Qwen2-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. Qwen2-Math is a series of specialized math language models built upon the Qwen2 LLMs, which significantly outperforms the mathematical capabilities of open-source models and even closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). We hope that Qwen2-Math can contribute to the community for solving complex mathematical problems.</p><p>We evaluate our math-specific models on a series of math benchmarks. The results below demonstrate that our largest math-specific model Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Llama-3.1-405B.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/fig2.jpg#center" width="100%"/></figure><h2 id="qwen2-math-base-models">Qwen2-Math: Base Models</h2><p>The base models of Qwen2-Math are initialized with Qwen2-1.5B/7B/72B, and then pretrained on a meticulously designed Mathematics-specific Corpus. This corpus contains large-scale high-quality mathematical web texts, books, codes, exam questions, and mathematical pre-training data synthesized by Qwen2.</p><p>We evaluate our Qwen2-Math base models on three widely used English math benchmarks GSM8K, Math, and MMLU-STEM. In addition, we also evaluate three Chinese math benchmarks CMATH, GaoKao Math Cloze, and GaoKao Math QA. All evaluations are tested with few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Base-Table1.png#center" width="90%"/></figure><h2 id="qwen2-math-instruct-instruction-tuned-models">Qwen2-Math-Instruct: Instruction-Tuned Models</h2><p>We first trained a math-specific reward model based on Qwen2-Math-72B. We then combined this dense reward signal with a binary signal indicating whether the model answered correctly. This combined signal is used as supervision for constructing the SFT data through Rejection Sampling and also in the reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) after SFT.</p><p>We evaluate Qwen2-Math-Instruct on mathematical benchmarks in both English and Chinese. In addition to the widely-used benchmarks, such as GSM8K and Math, we also involve more exams that are much challenging to fully inspect the capabilities of Qwen2-Math-Instruct, such as OlympiadBench, CollegeMath, GaoKao, AIME2024, and AMC2023. For Chinese mathematical benchmarks, we use CMATH, Gaokao (Chinese college entrance examination 2024), and CN Middle School 24 (China High School Entrance Examination 2024).</p><p>We report greedy , Maj@8 and RM@8 performance on all benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, except for the multi-choice benchmarks (including MMLU STEM and multiple-choice problems in GaoKao and CN Middle School 24) with a 5-shot setting. Qwen2-Math-Instruct achieves the best performance among models of the same size, with RM@8 outperforming Maj@8, particularly in the 1.5B and 7B models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our math reward model.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Instruct-Table1.png#center" width="100%"/></figure><p>In more complex mathematical competition evaluations such as AIME 2024 and AMC 2023, Qwen2-Math-Instruct also performs well across various settings, including Greedy, Maj@64, RM@64, and RM@256.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Instruct-Table2.png#center" width="70%"/></figure><h2 id="case-study">Case Study</h2><p>Here we list some test cases, which include some IMO math problems.

x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_t^3 = 2002^{2002},
$$</p><p>we start by analyzing the properties of cubes and their sums. We need to find the smallest $ t $ for which the sum of $ t $ cubes equals $ 2002^{2002} $.</p><p>First, we note that $ 2002 $ can be factored into prime factors:</p><p>$$
2002 = 2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13.
$$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$
2002^{2002} = (2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13)^{2002} = 2^{2002} \times 7^{2002} \times 11^{2002} \times 13^{2002}.
$$</p><p>Next, we consider the properties of cubes modulo 9. Cubes modulo 9 can only be congruent to $ 0, 1, $ or $ -1 $. This is because:</p><p>$$
\begin{aligned}
0^3 &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\
1^3 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\
2^3 &amp;\equiv 8 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}, \\\
3^3 &amp;\equiv 27 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\
4^3 &amp;\equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\
5^3 &amp;\equiv 125 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}, \\\
6^3 &amp;\equiv 216 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\
7^3 &amp;\equiv 343 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\
8^3 &amp;\equiv 512 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}.
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>Now, we need to determine $ 2002^{2002} \mod 9 $. First, we find $ 2002 \mod 9 $:</p><p>$$
2002 \div 9 = 222 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2002 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$
2002^{2002} \equiv 4^{2002} \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>Next, we use Eulerâ€™s theorem, which states that $ a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} $ for $ \gcd(a, n) = 1 $. Here, $ \phi(9) = 6 $, so:</p><p>$$
4^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>We can reduce the exponent $ 2002 \mod 6 $:</p><p>$$
2002 \div 6 = 333 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2002 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}.
$$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$
4^{2002} \equiv 4^4 \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>$$
4^4 = 256.
$$</p><p>Finally, we find $ 256 \mod 9 $:</p><p>$$
256 \div 9 = 28 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>$$
2002^{2002} \equiv 4 \pmod{9}.
$$</p><p>We need to find the smallest $ t $ such that the sum of $ t $ cubes is congruent to 4 modulo 9. The possible sums of cubes modulo 9 are:</p><p>$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\
-1 &amp;\equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + 1 &amp;\equiv 2 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + (-1) &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\
-1 + (-1) &amp;\equiv -2 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + 1 + 1 &amp;\equiv 3 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + 1 + (-1) &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + (-1) + (-1) &amp;\equiv -1 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\\
-1 + (-1) + (-1) &amp;\equiv -3 \equiv 6 \pmod{9}, \\\
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 &amp;\equiv 4 \pmod{9}.
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>We see that the sum of four cubes can be congruent to 4 modulo 9. Therefore, the smallest $ t $ is 4.</p><p>Thus, the smallest positive integer $ t $ such that there exist integers $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t $ with</p><p>$$
x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_t^3 = 2002^{2002}

P(x) \equiv x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 \mod 2.
$$</p><p>Since $ a_i $ are positive integers, $ a_i \mod 2 $ is either 0 or 1. Let $ b_i = a_i \mod 2 $. Then we can rewrite the polynomial modulo 2 as:</p><p>$$

P(0) \equiv b_0 \mod 2.

P(1) \equiv 1^n + b_{n-1} \cdot 1^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 \cdot 1 + b_0 \equiv 1 + b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 \mod 2.
$$</p><p>For $ s(P(1)) $ to have the same parity as $ s(1) $, $ 1 + b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 $ must be odd.

xf(y) + yf(x) \leq 2,
$$</p><p>we will proceed step by step.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Analyze the given inequality</strong>
Given $ x \in \mathbb{R}^+ $, there exists a unique $ y \in \mathbb{R}^+ $ such that</p><p>$$
xf(y) + yf(x) \leq 2.
$$</p><p>We need to explore the implications of this condition.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Consider the case $ x = y $</strong>
Substitute $ y = x $ into the inequality:</p><p>$$
xf(x) + xf(x) = 2xf(x) \leq 2.
$$</p><p>This simplifies to:</p><p>$$
xf(x) \leq 1.
$$</p><p>Thus, for all $ x \in \mathbb{R}^+ $,</p><p>$$
f(x) \leq \frac{1}{x}.
$$</p><p><strong>Step 3: Consider the uniqueness condition</strong>
For each $ x \in \mathbb{R}^+ $, there is exactly one $ y \in \mathbb{R}^+ $ such that $ xf(y) + yf(x) \leq 2 $. We need to ensure that this $ y $ is unique.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Test the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $</strong>
Consider the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $. Substitute $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ and $ f(y) = \frac{1}{y} $ into the inequality:</p><p>$$
x \cdot \frac{1}{y} + y \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x}.
$$</p><p>We need:</p><p>$$
\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \leq 2.
$$</p><p>Using the AM-GM inequality, we know:</p><p>$$
\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \geq 2.
$$</p><p>Equality holds if and only if $ \frac{x}{y} = 1 $, which implies $ x = y $.</p><p>Thus, for $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $, the inequality $ xf(y) + yf(x) \leq 2 $ holds if and only if $ x = y $. This satisfies the condition that there is exactly one $ y $ for each $ x $.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Verify if other functions can satisfy the condition</strong>
Suppose there exists another function $ g: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ $ such that $ g(x) \neq \frac{1}{x} $ for some $ x $. Then, for some $ x $, $ g(x) &lt; \frac{1}{x} $ or $ g(x) &gt; \frac{1}{x} $.</p><ul><li>If $ g(x) &lt; \frac{1}{x} $, then $ xg(y) + yg(x) $ might not satisfy the inequality for all $ y $.</li><li>If $ g(x) &gt; \frac{1}{x} $, then $ xg(y) + yg(x) $ might exceed 2 for some $ y $.</li></ul><p>Thus, any function other than $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ would not satisfy the uniqueness condition.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
The only function $ f: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ $ that satisfies the given condition is:</p><p>$$

f(f(x) + 0) + x f(0) = f(x \cdot 0 + 0) + f(x).

For example, if a red Martian and a blue Martian use the machine, theyâ€™ll be transformed into four green Martians.</p><p>a) Is it possible that, after using that machine finitely many times, we have $ 2022 $ red Martians, $ 2022$ green Martians and $ 2022$ blue Martians?</p><p>b) Is it possible that, after using that machine finitely many times, we have $ 2021$ red Martians, $ 2022$ green Martians and $ 2023$ blue Martians?</p><p><strong>Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct Solution</strong></p><p>Letâ€™s analyze the problem step by step.</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong></p><p>We start with 2 red, 2 green, and 2 blue Martians. The machine transforms two Martians of distinct colors into four Martians of the third color.

This changes the parity of red and blue Martians from even to odd, and the parity of green Martians from even to odd.</li><li>If we transform 1 green and 1 blue Martian, we get 4 red Martians. This changes the parity of green and blue Martians from even to odd, and the parity of red Martians from even to odd.</li></ul><p>In all cases, the parity of the number of Martians of each color changes from even to odd or from odd to even. Therefore, after any number of transformations, the parity of the number of Martians of each color will always be the same as it was initially.</p><p>Since initially all three colors have an even number of Martians, after any number of transformations, the number of Martians of each color will remain even.</p><p>Given that 2022 is an even number, it is possible to have 2022 red, 2022 green, and 2022 blue Martians after a finite number of transformations.</p><p>Thus, the answer to part (a) is:</p><p>$$

$$</p><p><strong>Part (b)</strong></p><p>We start again with 2 red, 2 green, and 2 blue Martians.

The director selects $k$ students, where although each studentâ€™s combination of courses is different, any two students have at least one course in common. At this point, it is found that any student outside these $k$ students cannot be classmates with these $k$ students regardless of how they enroll (having one course in common is enough to be classmates). Find the maximum number of $k$.</p><p><strong>Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct Solution</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students $ k $ such that each student has a unique combination of elective courses, any two students share at least one course, and no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them. This means that the set of students chosen must cover all possible courses in such a way that any new student would have to share a course with at least one of the chosen students.</p><p>First, letâ€™s consider the total number of possible combinations of courses. Since there are 10 elective courses and each student can either take or not take each course, there are $ 2^{10} = 1024 $ possible combinations of courses. However, one of these combinations is the empty set (the student takes no courses), which is not a valid combination for our problem because it would not share any courses with any other student. Therefore, there are $ 1024 - 1 = 1023 $ non-empty combinations of courses.</p><p>We need to find the maximum number of students $ k $ such that any two students share at least one course, and no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of vertices in a graph where each vertex represents a non-empty combination of courses, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding combinations share at least one course. The condition that no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them means that the set of $ k $ students forms a dominating set in the graph.</p><p>The maximum size of such a set is the complement of the minimum size of an independent set in the graph. An independent set in this graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent, which means no two combinations share any course. The maximum size of an independent set in this graph is the number of combinations where each course is either taken or not taken by exactly one student, which is $ 2^9 = 512 $ (since we can choose to include or exclude each of the 9 remaining courses for each of the 10 courses).</p><p>Therefore, the minimum size of an independent set is 512, and the maximum size of a dominating set (which is the complement of the independent set) is $ 1023 - 512 + 1 = 511 $. However, we need to add 1 because the empty set is not included, so the correct calculation is $ 1023 - 511 = 512 $.</p><p>Thus, the maximum number of students $ k $ is $\boxed{512}$.</p></details><details><summary>Problem from USAMO 2010</summary><p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p>Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle A = 90^{\circ}$.

Points $D$ and $E$ are such that $BD$ and $CE$ are angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$, respectively. Therefore, $I$ is the incenter of triangle $ABC$.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Coordinates and Lengths</strong>
Assume $A$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$, $B$ is at $(a, 0)$, and $C$ is at $(0, b)$. The lengths of the sides are:</p><ul><li>$AB = a$</li><li>$AC = b$</li><li>$BC = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2: Incenter Coordinates</strong>
The incenter $I$ of a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ is located at:</p><p>$$
I = \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2} \right)
$$</p><p><strong>Step 3: Lengths of Segments $BI$ and $CI$</strong>
Using the distance formula, we calculate $BI$ and $CI$:</p><p>$$
BI = \sqrt{\left( a - \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 + \left( 0 - \frac{b}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}
$$</p><p>$$
CI = \sqrt{\left( 0 - \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 + \left( b - \frac{b}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}
$$</p><p><strong>Step 4: Lengths of Segments $ID$ and $IE$</strong>
Since $D$ and $E$ are points on $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, and $I$ is the incenter, $ID$ and $IE$ are the distances from the incenter to the sides of the triangle. For a right triangle, these distances are given by:</p><p>$$
ID = IE = r = \frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}
$$</p><p><strong>Step 5: Integer Lengths</strong>
For $AB$, $AC$, $BI$, $ID$, $CI$, and $IE$ to all be integers, the following must hold:</p><ul><li>$a$ and $b$ are integers</li><li>$\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ is an integer</li><li>$\frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ is an integer</li></ul><p><strong>Step 6: Analysis</strong>
For $\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ to be an integer, $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ must be an even integer. Let $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then:</p><p>$$
a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2
$$</p><p>For $\frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ to be an integer, $a + b - 2k$ must be even. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a + b$ must be even.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Given the constraints, it is possible to find integer values for $a$ and $b$ such that all the conditions are satisfied. For example, if $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, then:</p><ul><li>$AB = 3$</li><li>$AC = 4$</li><li>$BC = 5$</li><li>$BI = CI = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ (not an integer)</li></ul><p>Thus, it is not possible for all segments $AB$, $AC$, $BI$, $ID$, $CI$, and $IE$ to have integer lengths simultaneously.</p><p>$$
