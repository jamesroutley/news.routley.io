    <h1>How the ARPANET Protocols Worked (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>The ARPANET changed computing forever by proving that computers of wildly
different manufacture could be connected using standardized protocols. In my
<a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html">post on the historical significance of the ARPANET</a>, I mentioned a few of those protocols, but didn’t
describe them in any detail. So I wanted to take a closer look at them. I also
wanted to see how much of the design of those early protocols survives in the
protocols we use today.</p>

<p>The ARPANET protocols were, like our modern internet protocols, organized into
layers.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The protocols in the higher layers ran on top of the protocols in
the lower layers. Today the TCP/IP suite has five layers (the Physical,
Link, Network, Transport, and Application layers), but the ARPANET had only
three layers—or possibly four, depending on how you count them.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’m going to explain how each of these layers worked, but first an aside about
who built what in the ARPANET, which you need to know to understand why the
layers were divided up as they were.</p>

<h2 id="some-quick-historical-context">Some Quick Historical Context</h2>

<p>The ARPANET was funded by the US federal government, specifically the Advanced
Research Projects Agency within the Department of Defense (hence the name
“ARPANET”). The US government did not directly build the network; instead, it
contracted the work out to a Boston-based consulting firm called Bolt, Beranek,
and Newman, more commonly known as BBN.</p>

<p>BBN, in turn, handled many of the responsibilities for implementing the network
but not all of them. What BBN did was design and maintain a machine known as
the Interface Message Processor, or IMP. The IMP was a customized Honeywell
minicomputer, one of which was delivered to each site across the country that
was to be connected to the ARPANET. The IMP served as a gateway to the ARPANET
for up to four hosts at each host site. It was basically a router. BBN
controlled the software running on the IMPs that forwarded packets from IMP to
IMP, but the firm had no direct control over the machines that would connect to
the IMPs and become the actual hosts on the ARPANET.</p>

<p>The host machines were controlled by the computer scientists that were the end
users of the network. These computer scientists, at host sites across the
country, were responsible for writing the software that would allow the hosts
to talk to each other. The IMPs gave hosts the ability to send messages to each
other, but that was not much use unless the hosts agreed on a format to use for
the messages. To solve that problem, a motley crew consisting in large part of
graduate students from the various host sites formed themselves into the
Network Working Group, which sought to specify protocols for the host computers
to use.</p>

<p>So if you imagine a single successful network interaction over the ARPANET,
(sending an email, say), some bits of engineering that made the interaction
successful were the responsibility of one set of people (BBN), while other
bits of engineering were the responsibility of another set of people (the
Network Working Group and the engineers at each host site). That organizational
and logistical happenstance probably played a big role in motivating the
layered approach used for protocols on the ARPANET, which in turn influenced
the layered approach used for TCP/IP.</p>

<em>The ARPANET protocol hierarchy.</em></p>

<p>The protocol layers were organized into a hierarchy. At the very bottom was
“level 0.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> This is the layer that in some sense doesn’t count, because on
the ARPANET this layer was controlled entirely by BBN, so there was no need
for a standard protocol. Level 0 governed how data passed between
the IMPs. Inside of BBN, there were rules governing how IMPs did this; outside
of BBN, the IMP sub-network was a black box that just passed on any data
that you gave it. So level 0 was a layer without a real protocol, in the sense
of a publicly known and agreed-upon set of rules, and its existence could be
ignored by software running on the ARPANET hosts. Loosely speaking, it handled
everything that falls under the Physical, Link, and Internet layers of the
TCP/IP suite today, and even quite a lot of the Transport layer, which is
something I’ll come back to at the end of this post.</p>

<p>The “level 1” layer established the interface between the ARPANET hosts and the
IMPs they were connected to. It was an API, if you like, for the black box
level 0 that BBN had built. It was also referred to at the time as the IMP-Host
Protocol. This protocol had to be written and published because, when the
ARPANET was first being set up, each host site had to write its own software to
interface with the IMP. They wouldn’t have known how to do that unless BBN gave
them some guidance.</p>

<p>The IMP-Host Protocol was specified by BBN in a lengthy document called <a href="https://walden-family.com/impcode/BBN1822_Jan1976.pdf">BBN
Report 1822</a>. The
document was revised many times as the ARPANET evolved; what I’m going to
describe here is roughly the way the IMP-Host protocol worked as it was
initially designed. According to BBN’s rules, hosts could pass <em>messages</em> to
their IMPs no longer than 8095 bits, and each message had a <em>leader</em> that
included the destination host number and something called a <em>link number</em>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
The IMP would examine the designation host number and then dutifully forward
the message into the network. When messages were received from a remote host,
the receiving IMP would replace the destination host number with the source
host number before passing it on to the local host. Messages were not actually
what passed between the IMPs themselves—the IMPs broke the messages down into
smaller <em>packets</em> for transfer over the network—but that detail was hidden from
the hosts.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/host-imp-1969.png" alt="1969 Host-IMP Leader"/>
<em>The Host-IMP message leader format, as of 1969. Diagram from <a href="https://walden-family.com/impcode/1969-initial-IMP-design.pdf">BBN Report
1763</a>.</em></p>

<p>The link number, which could be any number from 0 to 255, served two purposes.
It was used by higher level protocols to establish more than one channel of
communication between any two hosts on the network, since it was conceivable
that there might be more than one local user talking to the same destination
host at any given time. (In other words, the link numbers allowed communication
to be multiplexed between hosts.) But it was also used at the level 1 layer to
control the amount of traffic that could be sent between hosts, which was
necessary to prevent faster computers from overwhelming slower ones. As
initially designed, the IMP-Host Protocol limited each host to sending just one
message at a time over each link. Once a given host had sent a message along a
link to a remote host, it would have to wait to receive a special kind of
message called an RFNM (Request for Next Message) from the remote IMP
before sending the next message along the same link. Later revisions to this
system, made to improve performance, allowed a host to have up to eight
messages in transit to another host at a given time.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The “level 2” layer is where things really start to get interesting, because it
was this layer and the one above it that BBN and the Department of Defense left
entirely to the academics and the Network Working Group to invent for
themselves. The level 2 layer comprised the Host-Host Protocol, which was first
sketched in RFC 9 and first officially specified by RFC 54. A more readable
explanation of the Host-Host Protocol is given in the <a href="http://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/arpaprot.html">ARPANET Protocol
Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>The Host-Host Protocol governed how hosts created and managed <em>connections</em>
with each other. A connection was a one-way data pipeline between a <em>write
socket</em> on one host and a <em>read socket</em> on another host. The “socket” concept
was introduced on top of the limited level-1 link facility (remember that the
link number can only be one of 256 values) to give programs a way of addressing
a particular process running on a remote host. Read sockets were even-numbered
while write sockets were odd-numbered; whether a socket was a read socket or a
write socket was referred to as the socket’s gender. There were no “port
numbers” like in TCP. Connections could be opened, manipulated, and closed by
specially formatted Host-Host control messages sent between hosts using link 0,
which was reserved for that purpose. Once control messages were exchanged over
link 0 to establish a connection, further data messages could then be sent
using another link number picked by the receiver.</p>

<p>Host-Host control messages were identified by a three-letter mnemonic. A
connection was established when two hosts exchanged a STR (sender-to-receiver)
message and a matching RTS (receiver-to-sender) message—these control messages
were both known as Request for Connection messages. Connections could be closed
by the CLS (close) control message. There were further control messages that
changed the rate at which data messages were sent from sender to receiver,
which were needed to ensure again that faster hosts did not overwhelm slower
hosts. The flow control already provided by the level 1 protocol was apparently
not sufficient at level 2; I suspect this was because receiving an RFNM from a
remote IMP was only a guarantee that the remote IMP had passed the message on
to the destination host, not that the host had fully processed the message.
There was also an INR (interrupt-by-receiver) control message and an INS
(interrupt-by-sender) control message that were primarily for use by
higher-level protocols.</p>

<p>The higher-level protocols all lived in “level 3”, which was the Application
layer of the ARPANET. The Telnet protocol, which provided a virtual teletype
connection to another host, was perhaps the most important of these protocols,
but there were many others in this level too, such as FTP for transferring
files and various experiments with protocols for sending email.</p>

<p>One protocol in this level was not like the others: the Initial Connection
Protocol (ICP). ICP was considered to be a level-3 protocol, but really it was
a kind of level-2.5 protocol, since other level-3 protocols depended on it. ICP
was needed because the connections provided by the Host-Host Protocol at level
2 were only one-way, but most applications required a two-way (i.e.
full-duplex) connection to do anything interesting. ICP specified a two-step
process whereby a client running on one host could connect to a long-running
server process on another host. The first step involved establishing a one-way
connection from the server to the client using the server process’ well-known
socket number. The server would then send a new socket number to the client
over the established connection. At that point, the existing connection would
be discarded and two new connections would be opened, a read connection based
on the transmitted socket number and a write connection based on the
transmitted socket number plus one. This little dance was a necessary prelude
to most things—it was the first step in establishing a Telnet connection, for
example.</p>

<p>That finishes our ascent of the ARPANET protocol hierarchy. You may have been
expecting me to mention a “Network Control Protocol” at some point. Before I
sat down to do research for this post and my last one, I definitely thought
that the ARPANET ran on a protocol called NCP. The acronym is occasionally used
to refer to the ARPANET protocols as a whole, which might be why I had that
idea. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc801">RFC 801</a>, for example, talks about
transitioning the ARPANET from “NCP” to “TCP” in a way that makes it sound like
NCP is an ARPANET protocol equivalent to TCP. But there has never been a
“Network Control Protocol” for the ARPANET (even if <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET">Encyclopedia Britannica
thinks so</a>), and I suspect people
have mistakenly unpacked “NCP” as “Network Control Protocol” when really it
stands for “Network Control Program.” The Network Control Program was the
kernel-level program running in each host responsible for handling network
communication, equivalent to the TCP/IP stack in an operating system today.
“NCP”, as it’s used in RFC 801, is a metonym, not a protocol.</p>

<h2 id="a-comparison-with-tcpip">A Comparison with TCP/IP</h2>
<p>The ARPANET protocols were all later supplanted by the TCP/IP protocols (with
the exception of Telnet and FTP, which were easily adapted to run on top of
TCP). Whereas the ARPANET protocols were all based on the assumption that the
network was built and administered by a single entity (BBN), the TCP/IP
protocol suite was designed for an <em>inter</em>-net, a network of networks where
everything would be more fluid and unreliable. That led to some of the more
immediately obvious differences between our modern protocol suite and the
ARPANET protocols, such as how we now distinguish between a Network layer and a
Transport layer. The Transport layer-like functionality that in the ARPANET was
partly implemented by the IMPs is now the sole responsibility of the hosts at
the network edge.</p>

<p>What I find most interesting about the ARPANET protocols though is how so much
of the transport-layer functionality now in TCP went through a janky
adolescence on the ARPANET. I’m not a networking expert, so I pulled out my
college networks textbook (Kurose and Ross, let’s go), and they give a pretty
great outline of what a transport layer is responsible for in general. To
summarize their explanation, a transport layer protocol must minimally do the
following things. Here <em>segment</em> is basically equivalent to <em>message</em> as the
term was used on the ARPANET:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a delivery service between <em>processes</em> and not just host machines
(transport layer multiplexing and demultiplexing)</li>
  <li>Provide integrity checking on a per-segment basis (i.e. make sure there is no
data corruption in transit)</li>
</ul>

<p>A transport layer could also, like TCP does, provide <em>reliable data transfer</em>,
which means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Segments are delivered in order</li>
  <li>No segments go missing</li>
  <li>Segments aren’t delivered so fast that they get dropped by the receiver (flow
control)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like there was some confusion on the ARPANET about how to do
multiplexing and demultiplexing so that processes could communicate—BBN
introduced the link number to do that at the IMP-Host level, but it turned out
that socket numbers were necessary at the Host-Host level on top of that
anyway. Then the link number was just used for flow control at the IMP-Host
level, but BBN seems to have later abandoned that in favor of doing flow
control between unique pairs of hosts, meaning that the link number started out
as this overloaded thing only to basically became vestigial. TCP now uses port
numbers instead, doing flow control over each TCP connection separately. The
process-process multiplexing and demultiplexing lives entirely inside TCP and
does not leak into a lower layer like on the ARPANET.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to see, in light of how Kurose and Ross develop the ideas
behind TCP, that the ARPANET started out with what Kurose and Ross would call a
strict “stop-and-wait” approach to reliable data transfer at the IMP-Host
level. The “stop-and-wait” approach is to transmit a segment and then refuse to
transmit any more segments until an acknowledgment for the most recently
transmitted segment has been received. It’s a simple approach, but it means
that only one segment is ever in flight across the network, making for a very
slow protocol—which is why Kurose and Ross present “stop-and-wait” as merely a
stepping stone on the way to a fully featured transport layer protocol. On the
ARPANET, “stop-and-wait” was how things worked for a while, since, at the
IMP-Host level, a Request for Next Message had to be received in response to
every outgoing message before any further messages could be sent. To be fair to
BBN, they at first thought this would be necessary to provide flow control
between hosts, so the slowdown was intentional. As I’ve already mentioned, the
RFNM requirement was later relaxed for the sake of better performance, and the
IMPs started attaching sequence numbers to messages and keeping track of a
“window” of messages in flight in the more or less the same way that TCP
implementations do today.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>So the ARPANET showed that communication between heterogeneous computing systems
is possible if you get everyone to agree on some baseline rules. That is, as
I’ve previously argued, the ARPANET’s most important legacy. But what I hope
this closer look at those baseline rules has revealed is just how much the
ARPANET protocols also influenced the protocols we use today. There was
certainly a lot of awkwardness in the way that transport-layer responsibilities
were shared between the hosts and the IMPs, sometimes redundantly. And it’s
really almost funny in retrospect that hosts could at first only send each
other a single message at a time over any given link. But the ARPANET
experiment was a unique opportunity to learn those lessons by actually building
and operating a network, and it seems those lessons were put to good use when
it came time to upgrade to the internet as we know it today.</p>
