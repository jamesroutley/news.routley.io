    <h1>Intel&#39;s Thunderbolt Share lets two PCs control each other over a USB cable</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why can’t you just plug a USB cable between two PCs, drag your mouse cursor between their screens, and drop files between them, as if they were a single machine? Well, <a href="https://plugable.com/products/tbt-tran">you can</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/23/2493876/j5-create-wormhole-km-switch-review">have for years</a> — but Intel may be about to turbocharge that idea with Thunderbolt Share. </p><p>It’s a proprietary app that <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unlocks-ultra-fast-pc-to-pc-with-thunderbolt-share.html">Intel will be licensing</a> to laptop, desktop, and accessory manufacturers to bundle with new hardware. Install it on two Thunderbolt 4 or 5 computers, connect them with a Thunderbolt cable, and you should be able to share your mouse, keyboard, screens, storage, and other USB peripherals; drag and drop files at Thunderbolt speeds; and sync data between them. It won’t let you share an internet connection, though. </p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div></div><p>Intel says you can also mirror one PC’s screen to another at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second at low latency and with zero compression — and the PCs can connect through a Thunderbolt dock or monitor if that’s more convenient than a direct link.</p><p>It doesn’t <em>strictly</em> require a Thunderbolt-certified computer, mind you, or even necessarily an Intel processor. “USB 4 and Thunderbolt 3 connections may work, we just really don’t guarantee it, we won’t be providing support for it,” says Intel Thunderbolt chief Jason Ziller. </p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div></div><p>But it does require the app, which Intel will charge OEMs an extra license fee to provide exclusively with new hardware. Having to buy a subset of Thunderbolt computer or Thunderbolt accessory kind of limits the environments in which this might come in handy! Intel says you do get a second license with any Thunderbolt Share PC you buy or two with any accessory, though.</p><p>The app is an upsell because PC manufacturers are interested, says Ziller, and Intel wants to test and certify it thoroughly with them “to make sure it’s a great experience.” </p><p>It’s also just for Windows right now: “We’re exploring other OS opportunities but at this point in time it would not work connected to a Mac.”</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div></div><p>Acer, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer are the first PC partners, along with accessory vendors Belkin, Kensington, Plugable, and Promise Technology. Some of those companies previously sold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#USB_bridge_cables">“Easy Transfer” cables</a> designed to migrate from one computer to the next; <a href="https://plugable.com/products/tbt-tran">Plugable already sells a Thunderbolt cable</a> packaged with a Bravura Easy Computer Sync app that offers drag and drop and remote computer control, too. I wonder how Thunderbolt Share will compare.</p></div></div>
