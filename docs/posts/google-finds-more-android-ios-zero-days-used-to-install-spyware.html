    <h1>Google finds more Android, iOS zero-days used to install spyware</h1>

<p>Google&#39;s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered several exploit chains using Android, iOS, and Chrome zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities to install commercial spyware and malicious apps on targets&#39; devices.</p>
<p>The attackers targeted iOS and Android users with separate exploit chains as part of a first campaign spotted in November 2022.</p>
<p>They used text messages pushing bit.ly shortened links to redirect the victims to legitimate shipment websites from Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan after first sending them to pages triggering exploits abusing a WebKit remote code execution zero-day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT213597" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2022-42856</a>) and a sandbox escape (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2021-30900</a>) bug.</p>
<p>On compromised devices, the threat actors dropped a payload allowing them to track the victims&#39; location and install .IPA files.</p>
<p>In this campaign, an Android exploit chain was also used to attack devices featuring ARM GPUs with a Chrome GPU sandbox bypass zero-day (<a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_24.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2022-4135</a>), an ARM privilege escalation bug (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38181" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2022-38181</a>), and a Chrome type confusion bug (<a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_27.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2022-3723</a>) with an unknown payload.</p>
<p>&#34;When ARM released a fix for CVE-2022-38181, several vendors, including Pixel, Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo and others, did not incorporate the patch, resulting in a situation where attackers were able to freely exploit the bug for several months,&#34; <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/spyware-vendors-use-0-days-and-n-days-against-popular-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google TAG&#39;s Clément Lecigne said</a>.</p>
<h2>Second series of attacks against Samsung users</h2>
<p>A second campaign was spotted in December 2022 after Google TAG researchers found an exploit chain targeting up-to-date Samsung Internet Browser versions using multiple 0-days and n-days.</p>
<p>Targets from United Arab Emirates (UAE) were redirected to exploit pages identical to the ones created by the Variston mercenary spyware vendor for its Heliconia exploitation framework and targeting a long list of flaws, including:</p>
<ul><li>CVE-2022-4262 - Chrome type confusion vulnerability (zero-day at time of exploitation)</li>
<li>CVE-2022-3038 - Chrome sandbox escape</li>
<li>CVE-2022-22706 - Mali GPU Kernel Driver vulnerability providing system access and patched in January 2022 (not addressed in Samsung firmware at the time of the attacks) </li>
<li>CVE-2023-0266 - Linux kernel sound subsystem race condition vulnerability that gives kernel read and write access (zero-day at time of exploitation)</li>
<li>The exploit chain also used multiple kernel information leak zero-days when exploiting CVE-2022-22706 and CVE-2023-0266.</li>
</ul><p>In the end, the exploit chain successfully deployed a C++-based spyware suite for Android, complete with libraries designed to decrypt and extract data from numerous chat and browser apps.</p>
<p>Both campaigns were highly-targeted and the attackers &#34;took advantage of the large time gap between the fix release and when it was fully deployed on end-user devices,&#34; said Lecigne.</p>
<p>&#34;These campaigns may also indicate that exploits and techniques are being shared between surveillance vendors, enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools.&#34;</p>
<p>The discovery of these exploit chains was prompted by findings shared by Amnesty International&#39;s Security Lab which also <a href="https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2023-03-29_android_campaign" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> information regarding domains and infrastructure used in the attacks.</p>
<p>&#34;The newly discovered spyware campaign has been active since at least 2020 and targeted mobile and desktop devices, including users of Google’s Android operating system,&#34; Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/03/new-android-hacking-campaign-linked-to-mercenary-spyware-company/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added in a separate report today</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;The spyware and zero-day exploits were delivered from an extensive network of more than 1000 malicious domains, including domains spoofing media websites in multiple countries.&#34;</p>
<h2>Spyware vendor tracking efforts</h2>
<p>This is part of an ongoing effort to keep an eye on the mercenary spyware market and track the zero-day vulnerabilities they&#39;re exploiting to install their tools on the vulnerable devices of human rights and political activists, journalists, politicians, and other high-risk users worldwide.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-predator-spyware-infected-android-devices-using-zero-days/" target="_blank">said</a> in May 2022 that it was actively tracking more than 30 vendors with variable levels of public exposure and sophistication known to sell surveillance capabilities or exploits to government-sponsored threat actors worldwide.</p>
<p>In November 2022, Google TAG researchers <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-discovers-windows-exploit-framework-used-to-deploy-spyware/" target="_blank">revealed</a> that it had linked an exploit framework known as Heliconia and targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Defender vulnerabilities to the Variston IT Spanish software company.</p>
<p>In June 2022, some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) helped <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spyware-vendor-works-with-isps-to-infect-ios-and-android-users/" target="_blank">Italian spyware vendor RCS Labs</a> to infect the devices of Android and iOS users in Italy and Kazakhstan with commercial surveillance tools, according to Google.</p>
<p>One month earlier, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-predator-spyware-infected-android-devices-using-zero-days/" target="_blank">another surveillance campaign</a> was brought to light by Google TAG, where state-sponsored attackers exploited five zero-days to install Predator spyware developed by Cytrox.</p>
