    <h1>A Year of CS Studying in Review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><p><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/year-of-cs">üè∑ year-of-cs</a></p><p>I always find the transition from one year to another hard. To me, it feels like mourning the loss of the old year while facing down an unnerving blank canvas of the new year. But wow! What a year it has been! Just a little over a year ago, I scribbled down in my notebook, ‚ÄúLearn more CS fundamentals? Rust projects, maybe C?‚Äù. I thought little of it. I‚Äôm prone to writing ideas down, where they stay unloved and untouched. This time it was different. This time, I managed to follow through!</p><h2 id="the-lowlights">The Lowlights</h2><ul><li>I struggled a lot to stay motivated when bumps were encountered or work started getting overwhelming. This was probably the biggest issue faced. Getting stuck on a project or a concept and not having resources, good documentation, or a friendly person to ask for help could really mess up my flow and derail progress.</li><li>OS learnings were so-so overall for me. I saw the value in understanding better how the OS works, page tables, system calls, etc. While I achieved that, it mostly left me feeling that the Linux OS kernel is way too complicated and crufty.</li><li>Zig ‚ö°. I really wanted to like Zig, and in many ways I really do! It‚Äôs definitely safer and easier to program in than C. It‚Äôs also far too new of a language, with little documentation and tutorials to help programmers get started quickly. I spent more time searching the web and Discord groups for how to do something than programming, which was frustrating. I am looking forward to revisiting it down the road when it‚Äôs a little more mature and the standard library functions and API have settled.</li><li>Algorithms were brushed off for the most part, and, much like getting kids to eat their vegetables, I know it‚Äôs something I will need to tackle deeper to become a better programmer. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the dry nature of the content, the presentation, or what, but I could not bring myself to do much studying in this area. If you have an engaging or useful algorithm learning resource to share, please do!</li></ul><h2 id="the-highlights">The Highlights</h2><ul><li>C is a lot more approachable and enjoyable of a language to program in than I thought, if a lot of responsibility to write secure code. Its small size made it easy to pick up and get running quickly and I find myself reaching for it now over other languages.</li><li>Learning Assembly was an ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment for me where architecture and software ideas finally clicked together and so many things made a lot more sense.</li><li>Doing the OS OSTEP C utilities projects along with the Advanced Unix Programming course projects was perfect for getting more comfortable with UNIX/OS concepts, understanding how common UNIX commands are working, and learning C better. <ul><li>I found re-making <code>ls</code> as <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bugwhisperer/lsls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">‚ÄúLimited Scope ls‚Äù (ie. lsls)</a> to be super helpful towards understanding file pointers, file/directory setups, and how inodes worked.</li><li>Writing my ‚ÄúGosh Awful SHell‚Äù (ie. gash) was a particularly challenging but enlightening exercise for me, where I finally understood how processes and pipes worked. I‚Äôm still sad that I lost that when my hard drive died.</li></ul></li><li>One project I can‚Äôt recommend enough is the writing of an emulator! Working first on the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bugwhisperer/chipzzzzzzzz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CHIP8</a> interpreter and later my own <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~bugwhisperer/gil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gil CPU/VM</a> in Q4 of this year was key to driving home and making real ideas around CPU cycles (fetch, evaluate, execute), device I/O, etc. It also revealed that I need to study computer architecture topics further.</li></ul><h2 id="what-s-next-for-2025">What‚Äôs next for 2025?</h2><p>For 2025, I will be keeping to low-level stuff, as it‚Äôs both where I find the ideas most interesting and also where I still need to work on improving more. I got a lot of C exposure this year, so that‚Äôll stick around, but I‚Äôll be working on projects focused on and studying topics based around a few broad areas.</p><h3 id="computer-architecture-risc-v-assembly">Computer Architecture &amp; RISC-V Assembly</h3><p>I covered computer architecture <a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/blog/year-of-cs-study-in-review/./2024-07-13-q2-study-updates.md">back in Q2</a>, and while I learned a lot, I didn‚Äôt go as deep as I would have liked to, as time was limited, and I had more material to cover to stay on track overall. This year, I‚Äôll revisit this topic with the more in-depth textbook, which I had put down last year, being too much to handle at the time.</p><p>As mentioned already, I really enjoyed studying assembly and want to try out some deeper projects on RISC-V architecture with physical boards. I will stick with RISC-V since it‚Äôs a sane, manageable instruction set, plus it is FOSS and thus in alignment with my values.</p><h3 id="retro-computing-plan-9-os">Retro-computing &amp; Plan 9 OS</h3><p>Plan 9 üêá (9 Front) OS is a recent discovery, but <em>very</em> interesting to me in that it‚Äôs a whole different take on the version of UNIX ideas we see everywhere today. It‚Äôs also a distributed OS, and Plan 9 servers can act like separate file or CPU servers, where the user only needs the terminal connection. I will play around with this further and probably work on porting some projects over.</p><p>More broadly, I want to commit to focusing on more sustainable computing, grounding myself in what we used in years past, before computers had a million gigs of RAM and multicore processors, to inform possible solutions to our climate crisis and how computing can adapt to face it.</p><p>‚ÅÇ</p><p>Overall, while far from perfect, I‚Äôm very satisfied with how this whole effort turned out! I‚Äôm way better off in terms of my CS fundamentals than I was a year ago. Now, I‚Äôll have 3 months time at Recurse Centre coming up soon, so there‚Äôll be able opportunities to dedicate tackling some of these.</p><hr/></div></div>
