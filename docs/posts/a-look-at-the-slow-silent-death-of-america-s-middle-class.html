A few minor symptoms can often turn out to be quite a serious disease if left unchecked. Like millions of uninsured Americans, we’ve largely been ignoring the symptoms of economic issues and hoping they went away. As a nation, we tend to do that often. Unfortunately, these issues aren’t going <em>anywhere</em>. We’re succeeding only in allowing an economic disease to spread.</p><p id="40db">Sure, everyone likes<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"> </span></span>to pay some good lip service to our income inequality issues and pressure on the lower classes during election years, but what about actually fixing the problem? What would that look like? Is it even possible?</p><p id="90ae">First, we would need to be honest about what went wrong in the first place and whether memory matches reality. We’re going to look at both here. Since so many have the inclination to “restore” America back to its former middle-class glory, a little history is more than appropriate.</p><p id="8375">The vise has been tightening around the middle of the country for some time now, so there’s more than enough to explore. I choose “vise” as a word there quite intentionally as well; the pressure is coming from two sides. Costs are rising while wealth inequality grows. I was writing an article on an impending housing problem a few months back and went to inflation-adjust new home prices since the early 2000s. I realized I didn’t have to: salaries have remained more or less the same. Both a lack of upward mobility on salaries and plenty of upward mobility on costs have had their impact.</p><p id="4b39">So where did we go wrong?</p><h2 id="30b9"><strong>What color are your glasses? Oh, they’re rose? How nice.</strong></h2><p id="dcfe">Before we dive too deep, we should address a major caveat upfront: the “middle-class days” of America were selective. I’d venture if you asked people who lived in minority neighborhoods in Newark, Detroit, Chicago, or most suburbs thereof in the 1960s and 1970s about our heyday, they’d have some different opinions on what that time represented.</p><p id="38b7">To elaborate I’m going to throw an economics term out there. Artificial scarcity is a term with pretty well-defined parameters in business classes and lectures. Essentially, it’s when we have more than enough resources for a given item or service but for one reason or another, it’s difficult to obtain anyway. This can result from monopolies, people “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">cornering the market</a>” or other macro-level causes in economics.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*JILAs7VDXInflsE-?q=20" width="537" height="420" role="presentation"/></p><p><img alt="" width="537" height="420" role="presentation"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Houses in Levittown circa 1958.

A part of our middle-class history was due to artificial scarcity, in my opinion. When we think back to the “good times” of the 1950s or (pre-war) 60s, many think of a time with nuclear families and middle-class comfort. For many, it was exactly that. But social constructs and barriers to entry were creating artificial scarcity in the labor market.</p><p id="bd23">If lucrative careers and some middle-class opportunities were largely shut off to minorities and women, whoever was left was suddenly a more valuable resource than they really were. In 1960, America was about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_racial_and_ethnic_demographics_of_the_United_States" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">85% white</a>. Half of <em>that </em>number were women. We had a country with the demands of 180 million people but only 76 million or so were eligible for all the careers in circulation.</p><p id="bed2">When you diminish those numbers by the number of children, retirees, disabled war veterans (far more common back then), and others, you can see we had a relatively small number of eligible workers compared to the total workforce. And sure, minorities and women were “technically” eligible for many careers, but socially? Not as often. There’s no doubt these artificial shortages in labor contributed to plenty of middle-class families in the era, albeit often indirectly. It’s important to keep that in mind.</p><h2 id="7236"><strong>The old days are gone</strong></h2><p id="5c96">For the citizens who didn’t face a ton of stereotyping, bias, and outright discrimination, there is no doubt that our relative technological advantage over other nations following World War II assisted mightily with our living standards at home. We had domestic demand for plenty of products and services, and domestic production to match. Spurred on by government spending (the importance of the G.I. Bill cannot be overstated), American consumers found themselves with more home buying opportunities and purchasing power than any time in the previous few decades.</p><p id="90d5">There was some international demand for what we produced here at home, but the relatively isolated nature of countries at the time meant dramatically reduced imports and exports compared to what we’re used to today. This is hugely important. Even if other nations caught up to the United States in production or efficiency, the prohibitive costs of transportation and global trade in those days would have made competing with us domestically very difficult.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Pf9mL676pNCx6A0Y?q=20" width="700" height="446" role="presentation"/></p><p><img alt="" width="700" height="446" role="presentation"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A drone.

No changes to the image.</figcaption></figure><p id="894e">Piece by piece, technology has changed that. We export about twice what we did in the post-war period and <a href="https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/u.s._imports_and_exports_1947_2016" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">import three times as much</a>. Our industries began to face competition amid the increasing development of poorer nations and technological improvements that made global shipping and trade significantly more accessible. Workers no longer need to be anywhere near the end-user of the product they’re manufacturing. There is no turning back the clock on these changes. They’re here to stay.</p><p id="a20f">As much as many of us may hate to admit it, the role of government was drastically different as well. How were we able to spur spending among the lower classes and finance things like the G.I. Bill? Our top tax rate <a href="https://www.tax-brackets.org/federaltaxtable/1947" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">was 91%</a>. Corporate taxes were <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-economic-growth/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">over 50%</a>. And yes, gasoline taxes and capital gains taxes were around then, too.</p><p id="dda0">The federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was about 50% higher in 1960 than it is today. Make no doubt about it, the economy that preceded/persisted in the middle-class boom was a tax-and-spend economy. Nowadays those two words are usually only put together to mock a political candidate.</p><p id="7a9d">Public attitudes toward unions were significantly more favorable than they have been recently, though this part does <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/12751/labor-unions.aspx" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">seem to be turning around</a>. The combination of a progressive tax system and union strength kept corporations and wealth inequality in check, leaving more for the middle class. Add in the relatively low overseas competition at the time, and you had a perfect environment. One that can’t be duplicated outside of a time machine.</p><p id="090f">That’s not to say that they <em>eliminated </em>inequality or loopholes entirely, there was still plenty of that. And no one wanted to be called anything near a socialist in the 1950s, as it was too close to “communist” for comfort. Still, the gap between classes was much tighter than it is today.</p><h2 id="0e6b"><strong>Retirement comforts</strong></h2><p id="5240">Millennials may not know what a pension is. I’m mostly joking, but some literally may not. This is another area that many point to as one of the larger nails in the middle-class coffin. There are plenty of reasons why retirement assurances have all but disappeared, but there’s no doubt this has contributed to our woes.</p><p id="98ae">Essentially having a large percentage of their retirement assured in the form of pension plans and social security, workers had less of a savings burden during their working years. These extra dollars could go into everyday spending or provide an extra level of comfort. They also weren’t directly exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market as heavily as everyone is required to be now through their 401ks.</p><p id="5b14">The decreased negotiating power of unions certainly didn’t help when it came to protecting pensions, but neither too did our medical knowledge and improvements. In a time where “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCMzjJjuxQI" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more doctors smoked Camels</a> than any other cigarette” and the drunk-driving laws were essentially “don’t have more than six lowballs immediately prior to driving”, it wasn’t as costly to ensure your workforce’s retirement.</p><p id="5030">Any pension fund is going to rely on actuarial tables and projections to see if it’s sustainable and, under the society of 1955, it mostly was worth the effort. Men had a <a href="https://u.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">median life expectancy of 66</a>. 30 years of service in exchange for 7–8 years of compensated retirement. Four active workers for every retiree, basically.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*sgldHKAhMJ4xJiKA.jpg?q=20" width="640" height="403" role="presentation"/></p><p><img alt="" width="640" height="403" role="presentation"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Labor union organizing in 1974.

No changes.</figcaption></figure><p id="f580">While our life expectancies might be only up by 15% or so <em>overall</em>, our <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/was-retirement-better-in-1950/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">length of retirement</a> is up by 250% or more. The costs of lost talent and public pressure would need to be absolutely <em>enormous </em>to make keeping a pension fund alive a worthwhile task. Look at policemen’s unions and how many of their funds are near insolvency for a case study in how it plays out when you have a retiree for every worker.</p><p id="780f">A total of two industries still offer pensions with frequency: colleges/universities and state/local government (including teachers). Two areas that are often lamented for their bloat, inefficiency, and high cost. We can’t have it both ways without major changes.</p><p id="3f83">Ultimately, private sector leaders are chosen by shareholders to deliver a profit to said shareholders. Their job is to look at cutting costs wherever necessary without public blowback. If we have an issue with that, we need to address the system and not the individuals.</p><p id="7298">I’ve been hearing the term “late-stage capitalism” a lot lately. Well, not in real life, but on the internet. It’s a good term for what I suspect its users want to accomplish: financial overhaul. It particularly draws to mind late-stage alcoholism. Whenever I hear late-stage capitalism, I think of a cirrhotic liver. Good marketing.</p><p id="d32f">My point here is that no quick fix is going to repair the lost history above. You may agree with the “late-stage capitalism” folks and you may not, but we <em>cannot </em>simply turn back the clock to when times were “better” and magically restore workers’ power, retirement, and wage growth. Only large systemic changes (and most likely gradual ones at that) will shift back the balance of power. That’s why we talk about it so often but never do anything: it’s hard.</p><h2 id="a0e4"><strong>The way back</strong></h2><p id="ccfe">I’ve said before that a blank sheet of paper couldn’t pass in the Senate, and I stand by that assumption. As such we should assume any legislative changes to restore the balance that the middle-class of yesteryear enjoyed should be discarded as impossible. Given we <em>are </em>less isolationist now, I’m not sure a 91% tax rate wouldn’t just lead to some talent drain, anyway.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HiOqnZbGcvpPXRoL?q=20" width="700" height="467" role="presentation"/></p><p><img alt="" width="700" height="467" role="presentation"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>The above was voted down 51–49 in a party-line vote.

So let’s forget our “power” at the ballot box. We’re too ideologically divided to form a cohesive group class-wise regardless, something I’ve lamented elsewhere in other articles.</p><p id="ff5a">That takes a lot of tools out of the toolbox, I know. So what’s left? Well, the attitude towards unions turning around is a good sign — more of that would help. Somehow, from the 1980s through the 2000s, corporations started winning the PR campaign against unions, despite most peoples’ interests being more aligned with the latter than the former. Wherever workers can gain a bit of leverage, we should encourage it, particularly in our current climate.</p><p id="9d86">This brings us to the much-discussed changes in our labor market. Currently, we’re calling it “The Great Resignation” and it’s easy to get caught up in some overly abundant optimism. Workers gaining some leverage is a good thing, but this isn’t the type of leverage that will create change.</p><p id="2cc6">Sorry to pop the bubble, but the jobs most people are quitting were terrible jobs with exceedingly high turnover in the first place. Companies have had <em>some </em>new struggles in finding replacements for these employees, resulting in some small wage growth. On the very bottom rung. Essentially, we’ve moved people up from “hopelessly struggling” to “almost hopelessly struggling”.</p><p id="fb95">We’ll only see real change if semi-skilled and skilled positions start atrophying from major corporations. And there’s little chance of that happening now. We’re far too extravagant. Even people making $100,000 are leveraged up to their eyeballs in unnecessary luxury. Our marketers are effective.</p><p id="c1f5">If we embraced a more minimalist attitude, we could probably afford to leave some of these jobs that are literally killing us. I don’t know about everyone else but if I have a bed, bathroom, stocked bookshelf, and a television I’m good. We have plenty of people right here at home who are struggling, let alone those living abroad. We should look at how much we really “need”. The houses I’m seeing built are absurd.</p><p id="229e">Employers might feel the need to up the ante if everyone was taking the job they <em>liked</em> instead of the job they <em>need, </em>which more people could do if they gave up some luxuries. The working class and working poor already are essentially forced into the nearest labor. The middle class has put themselves there voluntarily through purchases and debt. As it stands, corporations have what’s left of the middle class trapped in their clutches — and they won’t let go voluntarily.</p></div></div></div><div><div><p id="2cb8"><em>This article is for informational purposes only.
