    <div><div><p>In winter, London welcomes visitors with some of the most exquisite plumage in the avian world. However, their gorgeous feathery ensembles make seeing these superbly camouflaged birds tricky – but so rewarding when you do!</p></div></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The largest of these three long-billed waders is the woodcock. This dumpy-bodied beauty is found mostly in damp woodland and heathland. </p>
<p>In winter, British breeders are joined by migrants arriving from breeding grounds across the North Sea. Though it’s tricky to predict where they’ll land, places to look include Sydenham Hill Wood, Wimbledon Common and Highgate Wood. That cryptic barred plumage makes them virtually impossible to spot among the leaf litter of a woodland floor, where they grub for invertebrates. During severe winter weather, you could spot one on the move seeking better feeding conditions.</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>The slightly smaller snipe is another British breeder whose population swells in winter, augmented by birds from Iceland, northern Europe and Scandinavia – increasing numbers here more than tenfold.</p>
<p>Though its plumage is also wonderfully patterned and cryptic, the snipe is easily distinguished by its extraordinarily long, slender beak – around a quarter of the length of the body. Roaming marshes and lake margins, its large feet allow it to walk confidently on such soft surfaces. It probes the mud with that slender bill, feeling for prey with sensitive nerve endings at the tip.</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p><strong><em>Jack snipe on left, next to a common snipe on the right</em></strong></p>
<p>Smaller again than its near namesake, the jack snipe has a shorter bill and creamier head and back stripes. Arriving from the taiga of northern Europe, Scandinavia and even Siberia, and similarly fond of wetlands where it feeds with a characteristic bobbing motion, it’s even more elusive and secretive – and very tricky to see unless flushed. </p>
