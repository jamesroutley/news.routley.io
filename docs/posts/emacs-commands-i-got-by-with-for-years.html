I was going to make a post about the common Org functions I use frequently, but I thought that I should start with common commands I used for generic Emacs when I started using it more than twenty years ago. This might also be useful for people starting out learning Emacs.</p>
<p>If you just want the survival guide content and skip the history and commentary, go to the “My List of Basic Commands” section below.</p>
<p>Maybe I am muddying the waters even further by giving yet another intro to Emacs, but if other people do it, why can’t I? You can always check the Emacs documentation on the web <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/documentation.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The way I used Emacs back then is a lot different than the way I use it today. You could call the eras BC (Before Chemacs) and AD (After Dired).</p>
<p>These days I use a lot of functions by calling M-x and then the function name. I use ido and smex, so I get not only auto-completion but some history as well. If I am in an Emacs instance that has been running for a while, there will be a lot of functions in the history. Then I can usually just hit M-x, get a list of functions I have called in the minibuffer, and I might be able to just use arrow keys to use the one I want. It keeps a history for that session, but so far I have not found a way to maintain history between sessions.</p>
<p>When I first came across Emacs, it was at a small analytics firm in Oak Park that no longer exists. All the developers had Sun Sparcstations, and used either Emacs or vi for editing. Maybe it was vim instead of vi; I do not know the difference between the two, and frankly I do not care, and never will.</p>
<p>Someone (probably a sysadmin) showed me vi. I thought the whole concepts of modes was stupid. I found someone who used Emacs. I asked them: What happens when I open a file in Emacs and hit the “A” key? They told me it would just insert the letter “A” in the file. I decided I wanted to learn Emacs instead of vi. I learned some commands, and I wrote them on a piece of paper that I kept with me for a while until I had them memorized. If you are learning Emacs, there is nothing wrong with writing down commands, either on paper, or even in another editor, or using an online cheat sheet. <i>In the past two decades, it still amazes me that people want to play the game of “who can spin the most plates in their head”. It is a stupid game to play, and only stupid people like playing it.</i></p>
<p>I know a lot of vi people use vi “because it is always there”, but is that really a good reason? It sounds practical, but to me that is no different than, “I run Windows on my machine because that is what was on it when I bought it at Best Buy.” Common is not always better. Convenient is not always better. Companies should stop treating developers (and everyone else) as fungible cogs. Emacs is not a flash in the pan. If you want something lean and mean on a prod server, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano">GNU nano</a>. As long as you know the ^ key refers to the Control key, you have all the commands you need on the bottom.</p>
<p>The company lost a major client after I had been there a few years. When someone important suddenly leaves and nobody can see why, that might be a warning sign. Also: When a small company gets the vast majority of its revenue from one client, that is a very vulnerable company.</p>
<p>I still used Emacs, but not as much. I became a Java developer, so I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEdit">jEdit</a> as my primary editor for years, even on Linux. One selling point was I could also use it on Windows machines at work. Later I moved to Austin, and I started looking into tech groups to join. The EmacsATX group existed when I moved here, but it met at lunchtime downtown. Companies in Austin seem more spread out than in Chicago; there does not seem to be one section that is as economically important as the Loop is in Chicago. I have never heard of a Meetup holding meetings around lunchtime in Chicago, which is more centralized and has better mass transit. In Austin, most people would drive to the meeting, and have to turn around the minute they got there. So I did not go to the Emacs meetings. Maybe they had their reasons, but to me it seemed like a bad decision.</p>
<p>Then there was a new leader, and he moved it to evenings, and I started going. Then I started getting more into Emacs again. My use of Emacs during my Emacs Revival is a lot different than it was in my Classical Era. The first time around I did not know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9OgXRDXxs">buffers</a> or the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html">desktop</a>; I would just open a single file, make any changes I needed, and exit. <i>You can think of the Emacs “desktop” as a session; it keeps a list of files that were open the last time you used Emacs, and where you were in those files.</i> I made a few aliases in Bash, one with “–no-desktop” and one without. Now I have one instance running all the time on one of my machines using the Emacs desktop. I keep my local desktop file in a local git repo that I save every month. I would have multiple files open in jEdit. Once I learned how to toggle the desktop in Emacs, I dropped jEdit.</p>
<p>I mentioned the desktop at an EmacsATX meeting, and people got upset with me that it was called the “desktop” and not something more descriptive like “session”. I had to speak slowly and use short words and explain to them that I did not call it the “desktop”, so getting upset with me was pretty stupid. Pro tip in life: before you ask someone why something is the way it is, ask them if the status quo was their decision.</p>
<p>Understanding buffers will also expand your Emacs skills. (I am not referring to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer.html">minibuffer</a> at the bottom that is used for M-x autocomplete or finding and replacing regular expressions.) Files are held in a buffer while they are being edited in memory, like other text editors. But there are many other things that happen in buffers in Emacs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages can be logged to a file, but they show up in a “Messages” buffer.</li>
<li>When you list buffers, the list itself is a buffer. You can use the buffer list to manage buffers, such as renaming or deleting them. <i>You could say the alt name for that is the meta-buffer, but that might be a confusing shift that would cause your control of Emacs to escape from you.</i></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">Dired</a> can be used to manage the file system, and is also a buffer.</li>
<li>You can use the “<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html#index-occur">occur</a>” function to list all the instances of a regular expression in a file or a buffer, and the results are displayed in a buffer.</li>
<li>There is a scratch buffer that can be used to run Emacs Lisp code, or for simple math calculations.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eshell.html">Eshell</a> is run in a buffer. If you wish to have multiple Eshell instances open in one Emacs instance, you need to change the name of the prior Eshell buffer. Otherwise, running <i>M-x eshell</i> will just keep taking you to the same buffer.</li>
<li>Games like Tetris and Pong get their own buffers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I started using a config based on Flying Machine’s <a href="https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/">Emacs config</a>. A couple of the things in it that were new to me were smex (EmacsWiki page <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Smex">here</a>, Github page <a href="https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex">here</a>) and IDO (EmacsWiki page <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings">here</a>, manual <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/ido.html">here</a>). I found out that I could type <i>M-x</i>, and smex would give me a list of available functions, and use autocomplete to give you possible matches. One of the topics at a rambling EmacsATX meeting was about what happens if there are conflicting key chords, and how to prevent conflicts. I decided to use M-x, and since them I generally do not learn key chords when I start using a new mode. Instead I get the names of the functions and use those. I can usually get them with <i>M-x describe-bindings</i> for all of them, or <i>M-x describe-key</i> for a particular key chord. Granted, it is more time-consuming this way, but most function names describe what they do. <i>org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c</i> is an exception.</p>
<p>Side note for beginners: “M-x” means to simultaneously hit the “Meta” and “X” keys. When Emacs was developed, keyboards had a key called the “Meta” key. It was later renamed the Alt key, but the Emacs community still refers to it by “M” in lists of key chords. Sometimes in life, you just need to say: Don’t know, don’t care, let’s keep going.</p>
<p>“C-x” means to hit the Control and X keys as the same time, “Esc” is the Escape key, and “S” is shift, although few key chords explicity list “Shift” as a key. Some key chords do need the shift, like “C-@”, which is “set-mark-command”. The at-sign is Shift-2.</p>
