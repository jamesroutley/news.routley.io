<p dir="auto">Testing, evaluation or training LLMs requires an ideal QnA dataset aka the golden dataset.</p>
<p dir="auto">This dataset needs to be diverse, covering a wide range of queries with accurate responses.</p>
<p dir="auto">Creating such a dataset takes significant manual effort.</p>
<p dir="auto">As the prompt or RAG contexts are updated, which is nearly all the time for early applications, the dataset needs to be updated to match.</p>
