    <h1>Malware infiltrates Pidgin messenger&#39;s official plugin repository</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The Pidgin messaging app removed the ScreenShareOTR plugin from its official third-party plugin list after it was discovered that it was used to install keyloggers, information stealers, and malware commonly used to gain initial access to corporate networks.</p>
<p>The plugin was promoted as a screen-sharing tool for secure Off-The-Record (OTR) protocol and was available for both Windows and Linux versions of Pidgin.</p>
<p>According to ESET, the malicious plugin was configured to infect unsuspecting users with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkgate-and-pikabot-malware-emerge-as-qakbots-successors/" target="_blank">DarkGate malware</a>, a powerful malware threat actors use to breach networks since QBot&#39;s dismantling by the authorities.</p>
<h2>Sneaky Pidgin plugin</h2>
<p>Pidgin is an open-source, cross-platform instant messaging client that supports multiple networks and messaging protocols.</p>
<p>Although not as popular as in the mid-2000s when multi-protocol clients were in high demand, it remains a popular choice among those seeking to consolidate their messaging accounts into a single app and has a dedicated user base of tech-savvy individuals, open-source enthusiasts, and users who need to connect to legacy IM systems.</p>
<p>Pidgin operates a plugin system that allows users to extend the program&#39;s functionality, enable niche features, and unlock new customization options.</p>
<p>Users can download them from the project&#39;s official <a href="https://pidgin.im/plugins/?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">third-party plugins list</a>, currently hosting 211 addons.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pidgin.im/posts/2024-08-malicious-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an announcement</a> on the project&#39;s website last week, a malicious plugin named &#39;ss-otr&#39; had slipped into the list on July 6, 2024, and was only pulled on August 16 following a user report about it being a keylogger and screenshot capturing tool.</p>
<div><p>&#34;A plugin, ss-otr, was added to the third party plugins list on July 6th. On August 16th we received a report from 0xFFFC0000 that the plugin contained a key logger and shared screen shots with unwanted parties.</p></div>
<p>A red flag is that ss-otr only provided binaries for download and not any source code, but due to the lack of robust reviewing mechanisms in Pidgin&#39;s third-party plugin repository, nobody questioned its security.</p>
<h2>Plugin leads to DarkGate malware</h2>
<p>ESET <a href="https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1828114327976415445" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> the plugin installer is signed with a valid digital certificate issued to <em>INTERREX – SP. Z O.O.</em>, a legitimate Polish company.</p>

<p>The plugin offers the advertised functionality of screen sharing but also contains malicious code, allowing it to download additional binaries from the attacker&#39;s server at jabberplugins[.]net.</p>
<p>The downloaded payloads are either PowerShell scripts or the DarkGate malware, which is also signed by an Interrex certificate.</p>
<p>A similar mechanism is implemented for the Linux version of the Pidgin client, so both platforms are covered.</p>
<p>ESET says that the same malicious server, which has been taken down now, hosted additional plugins named OMEMO, Pidgin Paranoia, Master Password, Window Merge, and HTTP File Upload.</p>
<p>These plugins were almost certainly also delivering DarkGate, indicating that ScreenShareOTR was just one small part of a broader-scale campaign.</p>

<p>Pidgin has not provided download stats for ss-otr, so the number of victims is unknown. </p>
<p>Those who installed it are recommended to remove it immediately and perform a full system scan with an antivirus tool, as DarkGate may be lurking on their system.</p>
<p>To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Pidgin announced that, from now on, it will only accept third-party plugins that have an OSI Approved Open Source License, allowing scrutiny into their code and internal functionality.</p>
