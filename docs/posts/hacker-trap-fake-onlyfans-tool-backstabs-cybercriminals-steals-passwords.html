    <h1>Hacker trap: Fake OnlyFans tool backstabs cybercriminals, steals passwords</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Hackers are targeting other hackers with a fake OnlyFans tool that claims to help steal accounts but instead infects threat actors with the Lumma stealer information-stealing malware.</p>
<p>The operation, <a href="https://veriti.ai/blog/exposed-onlyfans-hack-gone-wrong-how-cyber-criminals-turn-into-victims-overnight/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">discovered by Veriti Research</a>, constitutes a characteristic example of the blurred lines between being a predator or prey in the world of cybercrime, where ironic twists and backstabs are abundant.</p>
<h2>&#34;Checking&#34; into a Lumma infection</h2>
<p>OnlyFans is an extremely popular subscription-based adult content platform where creators can earn money from users (referred to as &#34;fans&#34;) who pay for access to their content.</p>
<p>Creators can share videos, images, messages, and live streams with their subscribers, while subscribers pay a recurring fee or one-time payments for exclusive content.</p>
<p>Given its popularity, OnlyFans accounts often become targets of threat actors who attempt to hijack them to steal fan payments, extort the account owner to pay a ransom, or simply leak private photos.</p>
<p>Checker tools are designed to help validate large sets of stolen login credentials (usernames and passwords), checking if the login details match any OnlyFans accounts and whether they&#39;re still valid.</p>
<p>Without those tools, cybercriminals would have to manually test out thousands of credential pairs, an impractical and tedious process that would render the scheme nonviable.</p>
<p>However, these tools are commonly created by other cybercriminals, causing hackers to trust that they are safe to use, and in some cases, this backfires.</p>
<p>Veriti discovered a case of an OnlyFans checker promising to verify credentials, check account balances, verify payment methods, and determine creator privileges but instead installed the Lumma information-stealing malware.</p>

<p>The payload, named &#34;brtjgjsefd.exe,&#34; is fetched from a GitHub repository and loaded into the victim&#39;s computer.</p>
<p>Lumma is an information-stealing malware-as-a-service (MaaS) that has been rented to cybercriminals since 2022 for $250-$1000/month and distributed via various means, including malvertising, YouTube comments, torrents, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-password-stealing-malware-masked-as-fixes/" target="_blank">GitHub comments</a>.</p>
<p>It is an advanced information stealer with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lumma-stealer-malware-now-uses-trigonometry-to-evade-detection/" target="_blank">innovative evasion mechanisms</a> and the ability to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-dev-says-they-can-revive-expired-google-auth-cookies/" target="_blank">restore expired Google session tokens</a>. It is mostly known for stealing two-factor authentication codes, cryptocurrency wallets, and passwords, cookies, and credit cards stored on a victim&#39;s browser and file system.</p>
<p>Lumma also doubles as a loader itself, capable of introducing additional payloads onto the compromised system and executing PowerShell scripts.</p>
<h2>A broader deception operation</h2>
<p>Veriti found that when the Lumma Stealer payload is launched, it will connect to a GitHub account under the name &#34;UserBesty,&#34; which the cybercriminal behind this campaign uses to host other malicious payloads.</p>

<p>Specifically, the GitHub repository contains executables that resemble checkers for Disney+ accounts, Instagram, and a supposed Mirai botnet builder:</p>
<ul><li>Disney+ account thieves are targeted with &#34;DisneyChecker.exe&#34;</li>
<li>Instagram hackers are lured by &#34;InstaCheck.exe&#34;</li>
<li>Wannabe botnet creators are lured with &#34;ccMirai.exe&#34;</li>
</ul><p>Digging deeper into the malware&#39;s communications, Veriti&#39;s researchers found a set of &#34;.shop&#34; domains that acted as command and control (C2) servers, sending commands to Lumma and receiving the exfiltrated data.</p>
<p>This campaign is not the first time threat actors have targeted other cybercriminals in malicious attacks.</p>
<p>In March 2022, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-from-hackers-by-pushing-fake-malware-on-forums/" target="_blank">hackers targeted hackers with clipboard stealers</a> disguised as cracked RATs and malware-building tools to steal cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Later that year, a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-backdoors-own-malware-to-steal-data-from-other-hackers/" target="_blank">malware developer backdoored their own malware</a> to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and VPN account data from other hackers.</p>
