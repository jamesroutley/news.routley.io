    <h1>Exploring CUE</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When I was working on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hasura.io/blog/what-we-learnt-by-migrating-from-circleci-to-buildkite">this project</a> at work, I wished to take a closer look at CUE. It seemed like a candidate for the project that we were undertaking (defining CI configs). But we didn‚Äôt end up choosing it at that time. We ended up using golang for writing our CI config - reasons: Turing completeness, familiarity for the team, good tooling, ease for other teams to understand, and a great deal of support from the compiler.</p>
<p>But tonight, I would like to take a closer look at CUE. The main reason for my curiosity is the recently released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dagger.io">dagger</a> project. CUE seems to be at the center of this project. I hope I could understand the reason for that preference during my exploration here.</p>
<p>Also, I have been dabbling in this problem space for a long while. I know that the pain is real - That 2000 lines CI config written as YAML file, that 1800 lines <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://json-schema.org">JSON schema</a> file - I have edited them all. They have all hurt me! It is good to see projects emerging that acknowledge that this problem exists.</p>
<p>Time to borrow some quotes from CUE docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CUE is an open-source data validation language and inference engine with its roots in logic programming. Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language, it has many applications, such as data validation, data templating, configuration, querying, code generation, and even scripting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the gist of where it came from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is a very different language, the roots of CUE lie in GCL, the dominant configuration language in use at Google as of this writing. It was originally designed to configure Borg, the predecessor of Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CUE has a set of philosophies and principles, which I hope to revisit at the end of this blog post to get a better idea of how they are practically applied.</p>
<p>Starting by reading - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cuelang.org/docs/usecases/">https://cuelang.org/docs/usecases/</a></p>
<h2 id="Configuration"><a href="#Configuration" title="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2><p>The first line in docs - I love it &lt;3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguably, validation should be the foremost task of any configuration language. Most configuration languages, however, focus on boilerplate removal. CUE is different in that it takes the validation first stance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more point that I want to highlight is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CUE basic operation merges configurations in a way that the outcome is always the same regardless of the order in which it is carried out (it is associative, commutative, and idempotent).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the order in which we write a config in the config file does not matter - pretty much like other config formats.</p>
<h3 id="Types"><a href="#Types" title="Types"></a>Types</h3><p>One of the cool things that CUE is doing which we don‚Äôt see much in the wild is having ‚Äútypes‚Äù for the configuration. Like we mention types in a real programming language, we could use types in CUE to represent how the config should look like. I guess this in turn will be used by the tooling to validate the config.</p>
<p>Example config from the docs:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>#Spec: {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Now the above type called ‚ÄúSpec‚Äù could be used by the actual config like this</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>spec: #Spec</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h3 id="Boilerplate-and-Inheritance"><a href="#Boilerplate-and-Inheritance" title="Boilerplate and Inheritance"></a>Boilerplate and Inheritance</h3><p>Copy pasting a hundred lines of config (boilerplate) to add or edit one line of config - done that ‚úîÔ∏è</p>
<p>Opening a random file with 2 lines of config and wondering ‚Äúwhat does this even do ü§î‚Äù - done that ‚úîÔ∏è (because the actual config that contains most of the config is placed in a different file and is <em>inherited</em> to this config file to reduce boilerplate)</p>
<p>CUE is a config language, so obviously there is a mechanism to avoid boilerplate but this point sounds particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like with other configuration languages, CUE can add complexity if values are organized to come from multiple places. However, as CUE disallows overrides, deep layerings are naturally prevented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CUE disallows overrides - want to see a practical example of this. Forgetting to override values in an inherited config file is a great way to do something bad in production systems; if the default value is not good enough, then forgetting to override that default value might easily cause trouble. For example default config setting of a container has a memory limit of 256MB but the application running in the container needs 512MB of memory to function properly; if the author of that application forgets to override, then that would impact the application when it is trying to run - often silently after deploying to prod :D  Does CUE help us combat this problem? I will continue reading for now and wait to know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inheritance, is not commutative and idempotent in the general case. In other words, order matters. This makes it hard to track where values are coming from. This is not only true for humans, but also machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Other-config-languages"><a href="#Other-config-languages" title="Other config languages"></a>Other config languages</h3><p>Some notes from the docs with comparison to other config languages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Jsonnet, CUE is a superset of JSON</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CUE‚Äôs focus is data validation whereas Jsonnet focuses on data templating (boilerplate removal). Jsonnet was not designed with validation in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here comes HCL (one of my favorite config languages):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HCL has some striking similarities with GCL. But whether this was a coincidence or deliberate, it removes the core source of complexity of GCL: inheritance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, whether the removal of inheritance was a coincidence or great insight, there is no construct given in return that one might need for larger scale configuration management. This means the use of HCL may hit a ceiling for medium to larger setups.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Data-Validation"><a href="#Data-Validation" title="Data Validation"></a>Data Validation</h2><h3 id="Validating-YAML-and-JSON"><a href="#Validating-YAML-and-JSON" title="Validating YAML and JSON"></a>Validating YAML and JSON</h3><p>one of the neat things about CUE is that it tries to play a bit nice with YAML and JSON whenever possible. A great example is how CUE could be used as a way to validate already existing YAML or JSON configurations.</p>
<p>I installed the <code>cue</code> tool on my machine at this point and thought of re-writing the example from docs to practice CUE.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ cue vet --help </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Let us consider a YAML config that is absurd.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>min:</span> <span>10</span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Equivalent JSON file:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The above config is absurd because ‚Äúmin‚Äù is greater than ‚Äúmax‚Äù - what a contradiction! It seems like we could write a CUE file to check for these kinds of mistakes:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>min: *0 | number</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>After writing the CUE check, we could vet it like this</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ cue vet check.cue range.json range.yaml </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The above command first validates the JSON file and throws the error at that point and STOPs without showing the error for YAML file (Why so? Why can‚Äôt it continue? - maybe I will discover it afterward)</p>
<p>Fixing the error in JSON file and retrying <code>cue vet</code> shows the problem in the YAML file.</p>
<h2 id="Schema-Definition"><a href="#Schema-Definition" title="Schema Definition"></a>Schema Definition</h2><p>I have written JSON Schema in the past to define the structure of what the configuration should look like. It also helps in the validation of the configuration. JSON Schema becomes very complex at scale. When you are past some point, it becomes very difficult to digest it.</p>
<p>CUE feels more readable than JSON Schema in the first look so far.</p>
<p>If we write Schema in CUE, there is a way to check if <code>v2</code> of schema is backward-compatible with <code>v1</code> of the schema. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cuelang.org/docs/usecases/datadef/#validating-backwards-compatibility">This example</a> in the docs describes it very neatly. I guess there is a potential to use this to enhance tooling for all of us here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON Schema and OpenAPI are purely data-driven data definition standards. OpenAPI originates from Swagger. As of version 3, OpenAPI is more or less a subset of JSON Schema. OpenAPI is used to define Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To know that an alternative for the above technologies is emerging gives me a fresh breeze to me.</p>
<h2 id="Code-generation-and-extraction"><a href="#Code-generation-and-extraction" title="Code generation and extraction"></a>Code generation and extraction</h2><p>As of writing this, it seems like we could extract CUE definitions from Go code and protobuf definitions. The docs don‚Äôt tell exactly how yet - but we might discover it afterward, I guess.</p>
<p>Also, it seems like CUE could be used to annotate Go source code, and Go structs could be validated with the help of that. Cue at this point plays nicely with Go (because it is written in Go) and I am guessing that it will play nice with other languages based on how it is getting adopted by the community.</p>
<h2 id="Querying"><a href="#Querying" title="Querying"></a>Querying</h2><p>Just realized that CUE could act as a query language. Let us say that we have a 1000 lines of config and we would like to extract a few configs that match a certain constraint, then CUE might be used for this. Example: Give me all config settings, whose values are numbers.</p>
<p>I think right now we will have to use CUE API (via Go code) to perform these kinds of querying, but the docs called for discussion of use-cases if you have one!</p>
<h2 id="Scripting"><a href="#Scripting" title="Scripting"></a>Scripting</h2><p>It seems like CUE is providing a scripting layer for data. The docs are suggesting to refer <code>cue help cmd</code> for more information at this point. </p>
<p>After reading that help section, I learned that cue places itself as an alternative to make files. We could have a <code>cue</code> file with various commands which perform some task when we run <code>cue cmd &lt;that_command_name&gt;</code></p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>package project</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>We could also inject data from the environment with something like this:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>package project</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The expression tripped me up at first, but by re-reading it slowly I was able to understand it more clearly. It defines <code>who</code> to either be of value ‚Äúworld‚Äù OR a value of type string which is injected by <code>who_arg</code></p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ cue cmd hello</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="JSON"><a href="#JSON" title="JSON"></a>JSON</h2><blockquote>
<p>CUE is a superset of JSON: any valid JSON file is a valid CUE file. There is not much more integration you can get than that. The main motivation to make it a superset was to promote familiarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we are here, I would like to point out a style in CUE for an equivalent JSON.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>is usually written in CUE using a folded form like this</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>I ultimately checked the above line of CUE using the <code>cue export</code> command takes in CUE file and returns JSON/YAML.</p>
<p>Also, there is ‚Äúencoding/json‚Äù package in CUE‚Äôs scripting layer to manipulate JSON data in configuration.</p>
<h2 id="YAML"><a href="#YAML" title="YAML"></a>YAML</h2><blockquote>
<p>Unlike with JSON, CUE is not a superset of YAML. One of the design goals of CUE was to be easily machine generatable and modifiable. The sensitivity to indentation and the lexical obscurity of the typing of tokens make YAML too bug prone for this purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That gave me a smile :D</p>
<p><code>cue vet</code> is your friend here. <code>encoding/yaml</code> package in the scripting layer to deal with YAML configs. I guess this is mainly to play nice with the existing ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="Go"><a href="#Go" title="Go"></a>Go</h2><p>Cue is written in Go and so has nice integration with it.</p>
<p>The first thing is if you need a package at the scripting layer, you could probably do so by writing a Go package. Builtin packages that are available inside a CUE file are listed here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/pkg">https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/pkg</a></p>
<p>It seems like we could also import definitions into CUE from other Go code bases using this command:<br/></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br/></pre></td><td><pre><span>cue get go k8s.io/api/core/v1</span><br/></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div>
