    <h1>STM32 MCU family goes 64-bit with the STM32MP2x (Cortex-A35)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p>STMicroelectronics has announced its second-generation STM32 microprocessors, promising improved performance and acceleration for edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning workloads â€” and a move to 64-bit processors cores for the first time in the range&#39;s history.</p><p>&#34;Our embedded MPUs address the trend thatâ€™s pushing more workloads and greater demands to smart devices, often deployed at the IoT [Internet of Things] edge, for faster response and increased efficiency,&#34; says STMicro&#39;s Stephane Henry of the company&#39;s new processors.</p><div><div><p><span>STMicro has announced new parts in the STM32 range, and they&#39;re the company&#39;s most powerful yet. (ðŸ“·: STMicroelectronics)</span></p></div></div><p>&#34;The new STM32MP2 devices we are announcing today,&#34; Henry continues, &#34;extend the performance trajectory, introducing our most powerful processing engine, now adding edge AI, and supported by the STM32 ecosystem to accelerate product development.&#34;</p><p>The first surprise in the new chip range: a move to 64-bit processor cores, despite retaining the STM32 name. The STM32MP2 chips are the company&#39;s first to use the Arm Cortex-A35 core, running at speeds of up to 1.5GHz, alongside a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller core running at up to 400MHz, a dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU) with 3D acceleration and support for 1080p displays, a video processing unit (VPU), and a neural processing unit (NPU) designed to accelerate on-device edge AI and machine learning work.</p><div><div><p><span>The new parts include up to two 64-bit Arm Cortex-A35 cores running at up to 1.5GHz, but keep the &#34;STM32&#34; name. (ðŸ“·: STMicroelectronics)</span></p></div></div><p>This NPU, STMicro claims, can deliver up to 1.35 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of compute, with workloads able to run on the Cortex-A35, Cortex-M33, GPU, VPU, or NPU cores as-required. It&#39;s not present in all models, however: only the STM32MP257, STM32MP255, and STM32MP23x chips include the AI co-processor and 3D GPU; the remainder of the range stick with one or two Cortex-A35 cores and a single Cortex-M33.</p><p><span>STMicro is making much of the parts&#39; industrial qualifications: the company says the chips can run 24 hours a day for 10 years, with a junction temperature rated at -40Â°C to 125Â°C (-40Â°F to 257Â°F). The new parts also come with the promise of Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platforms (SESIP) Level 3 certification, readying them for the US Cyber Trust Mark </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/the-us-cyber-trust-mark-aims-to-label-internet-of-things-products-built-with-security-in-mind-166c82e1da9c" rel="nofollow">announced back in July last year</a><span> â€” along with the company&#39;s </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/stmicro-goes-concurrent-with-multi-protocol-ble-zigbee-thread-and-matter-stm32wba55-54-chips-f5feff3995e0" rel="nofollow">recently-unveiled 32-bit STM32WBA55 and STM32WBA54 chips</a><span>.</span></p><div><div><p><span>Some, but not all, models in the range include 3D-capable GPUs and a 1.35 TOPS neural network coprocessor. (ðŸ“·: STMicroelectronics)</span></p></div></div><p>Other features of the parts include up to three gigabit Ethernet ports through the use of a two-port switch, support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), PCI Express Gen. 2, USB 3.0, and up to three CAN-FD buses, RGB, LVDS, and MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) video outputs with H.264 video acceleration on the GPU-equipped models, and a MIPI Camera Serial Interface 2 (CSI-2) input with image signal processor.</p><p><span>While STMicro is unveiling the parts now, however, it is not quite ready to take orders: the parts are due to enter volume production in June this year, with a development board to follow in due course.
