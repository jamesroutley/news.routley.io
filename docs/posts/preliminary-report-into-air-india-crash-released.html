      <p>In a statement following the release of the report, Boeing - the maker of the Dreamliner that crashed in June - has released a statement saying &#34;our thoughts remain with the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected on the ground in Ahmedabad.&#34;</p><p>The US aviation giant adds that it continues to &#34;defer&#34; to India&#39;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau - which is leading the investigation - to provide information about the crashed plane in line with international protocol.</p>

      <p>The preliminary report sets out what happened. What we don’t
know is why.</p><p>The fuel control switches are designed not to be moved
accidentally. Shifting them from RUN to CUT OFF is a two-stage process. Each
switch has to be lifted before it can be moved down, and there are two of them,
one for each engine.</p><p>The conversation between the two pilots appears to show that
one of them was aware the switches had been moved – though the other denied it.</p><p>Was this a simple mistake made by a pilot under pressure, or
was there another reason? The report baldly sets out the precise times when the
switches were moved, but there is no other context given – except for that
brief exchange between the pilots.</p><p>The report itself does not highlight any technical problem
that could have led to confusion in the cockpit, before the engines lost
thrust.</p><p>One other possibility - and it is a dreadful one - is that
this was a premeditated action. Nevertheless, it is a possibility that experts
say should be taken seriously.</p><p>The report itself is careful not to draw any conclusions –
and the investigation (which has been criticised by some for its lack of
urgency and transparency) is ongoing.</p><p>It is highly likely the &#34;human aspect&#34; – the personal
circumstances of the flight crew – will form part of that process.</p>

      <p>Investigators are zeroing in on what they describe as
an interesting point in the report.</p><p>The report says in December 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin
(SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing
737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.</p><p>While the issue was noted, it wasn’t deemed an unsafe
condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.</p><p>The same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8
aircraft, including Air India’s VT-ANB, which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory,
Air India did not perform the recommended inspections.</p><p>Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident
investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, tells the BBC he’s wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.</p><p>“What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does
it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut
the fuel supply?&#34; he says.</p><p>&#34;When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens?
Could the switch just flip itself to OFF and shut down the engine? If that’s
the case, it’s a really serious issue. If not, this also needs to be
explained.&#34;</p>

      <p>Investigators say there are two main takeaways from
the preliminary report on Air India Flight 171.</p><p>First, both engine fuel cut off switches moved from run to cut off within seconds of takeoff, abruptly cutting the plane&#39;s thrust at 180 knots.</p><p>Cockpit voice recordings capture one pilot asking the
other why they&#39;d shut the engines down, only to be met with a denial -
heightening suspicion that this wasn’t a routine or accidental action. Engineers note these switches are specifically guarded and require
deliberate operation, typically reserved for emergencies like engine fire - not
mid-flight manoeuvres.</p><p>Second, the preliminary findings reference a 2018 Federal Aviation Authority bulletin alerting operators to the possible disengagement of the fuel switch
locking mechanism.</p><p>However, there’s no clear explanation of how this
mechanical issue could have caused both switches to flip nearly simultaneously.
The bulletin was advisory and inspections by Air India were skipped. The
airline’s past maintenance included throttle module replacements in 2019 and
2023. None of these replacements were linked to the fuel control switches.</p><p>Until further investigation digs into whether this was
human error or a rare mechanical malfunction, the cause remains unresolved.</p>

      <p>One thing that stands out from the report is that so far there has been no advisory issued for the Boeing Dreamliner 787 or the GE GEnx-1B engine operators used in this aircraft.</p><p>At the moment mechanical fault has been ruled out but we need to wait for more information to come out as these are just preliminary findings. </p><p>The content of the report is, however, quite shocking, especially the fact that both the fuel control switches were moved from the run position to the cut-off position. </p><p>But many questions are still swirling around. </p><p>Was it a technical issue? Was it a software issue? Was it a human error?</p><p>The findings of this report are being closely watched as families of this devastating crash seek closure.</p>

      <p>Prior to boarding Air India Flight 171, the crew and two pilots of the flight all underwent testing to ensure they were capable of operating the aircraft.</p><p>The report states that both pilots, who were based at Mumbai, had arrived at Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had an &#34;adequate rest period&#34;.</p><p>The crew and pilots all also underwent a breathalyser test at
06:25 local time and were found &#34;fit to operate the flight&#34;, it added.</p>

      <p>The report says the fuel samples that were taken from tanks
used to refuel the Air India aircraft were &#34;satisfactory&#34;.</p><p>Aviation experts had previously told the BBC that fuel
contamination was a possible factor that could&#39;ve caused the crash. A dual
engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging.</p><p>Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if
that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.</p><p>The report separately outlines that a &#34;very limited
amount of fuel samples&#34; were retrieved from the APU filter and
Refuel/Jettison valve of the left wing.</p><p>&#34;The testing of these samples will be done at a
suitable facility capable of carrying out the test with the limited available
quantity,&#34; the report said.</p>

      <p>Our team is continuing to parse through the preliminary investigation into the Air India crash. </p><p>As a reminder, under international aviation rules, the investigating state has
to file an initial report, detailing any findings, within 30 days of an air
crash.</p><p>In a statement released last month, <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2139785">India&#39;s Ministry for Civil Aviation said<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> the investigation has been led by India’s
Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.</p><p>The investigation includes an aviation medicine specialist, an
Air Traffic Control officer, as well as representatives from the US National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).</p><p>The statement adds that both black box recorders were located in
the days following the crash - one on the rooftop of the building of the crash
site, found on 13 June, and the other in the debris on 16 June. Data extraction
began on 24 June.</p><p>The ministry statement adds that “these efforts aim to
reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify
contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences&#34;.</p>
