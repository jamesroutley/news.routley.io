      <p>The Airline Pilots&#39; Association of India (ALPA India) has reacted to the preliminary report on the crash, raising concerns over the way the investigation is being handled.</p><p>In a statement reported by <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/aviation/air-india-plane-crash-pilots-union-include-in-capacity-of-observers-ongoing-probe-19636096.htm">Indian media<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>, the pilots&#39; union said it was &#34;surprised at the secrecy surrounding these investigations&#34; and alleged that &#34;suitably qualified personnel were not taken on board for the probe&#34;.</p><p>“We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,” ALPA India&#39;s president, Captain Sam Thomas, says in the statement.</p><p>The preliminary report says just seconds after take-off, the cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you do the cut off?”, referring to the fuel switch that starved the engines. The other replied, “I didn’t.” It&#39;s still unclear who asked the question and who answered.</p><p>The union urges the authorities to allow it to join the process to help ensure transparency.</p><p>“We once again request the powers that be to include us even in the capacity of observers so as to provide the requisite transparency in the investigations,” the statement adds.</p>

      <p>There was much speculation about the Air India Boeing 787&#39;s Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or the &#34;black boxes&#34; - which will help tell the story of the crash. </p><p>These devices record flight data and cockpit audio, including pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds.</p><p>The preliminary report offers key insights into how they were recovered and what they revealed.</p><p>One recorder was found on 13 June, a day after the crash, atop a building, heavily damaged by impact and heat, with exposed wires and burned connectors.</p><p>The second was recovered three days later near another building, still attached to its equipment shelf.</p><p>Both were sent to the AAIB lab in Delhi on 24 June. As in previous cases, investigators used a “Golden Chassis” - an identical EAFR unit - and special download cables sourced from the NTSB in the US to extract the data.</p><p>The AAIB successfully retrieved about 49 hours of flight data covering six flights, including the crash, and two hours of cockpit audio capturing the final moments.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most crucial thing to emerge from the preliminary report is that the plane&#39;s fuel switches were cut off shortly before the crash. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a really important switch and therefore it&#39;s one that&#39;s protected against somebody just brushing against it,&#34; explains Graham Braithwaite, director of Aerospace and Aviation at Cranfield University. </p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&#39;s Today programme, he says in order for a pilot to move the switch, &#34;they&#39;ve got to lift it and move very positively the position&#34;.</p><p>He points out the report does not say a pilot moved the switch, and at this stage &#34;you would expect the report to keep an open mind&#34;. </p><p>On wider danger to passengers, he says the area of focus in this investigation is &#34;very specifically on this flight, on this particular aircraft on this day&#34;.</p><p>&#34;The 787 had flown a billion passengers safely prior to this flight&#34; and it has a good record, Braithwaite adds.</p>

      <p>We now know that just seconds after take-off, both the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner&#39;s fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the &#34;cut-off&#34; position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to &#34;cut-off&#34; is a move typically done only after landing.</p><p>Investigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they&#39;re highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps.</p><p>&#34;It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,&#34; a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.</p><p>That&#39;s what makes the Air India case stand out.</p><p>I spoke to several experts from around the world to understand what the report tells us about the crash - and what it doesn&#39;t. </p><p><i>You can read Soutik&#39;s </i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gy78gpnqo">full analysis on the cockpit audio here</a><i>.</i></p>
