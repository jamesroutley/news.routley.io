      <p>We now know that just seconds after take-off, both the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner&#39;s fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the &#34;cut-off&#34; position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to &#34;cut-off&#34; is a move typically done only after landing.</p><p>Investigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they&#39;re highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps.</p><p>&#34;It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,&#34; a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.</p><p>That&#39;s what makes the Air India case stand out.</p><p>I spoke to several experts from around the world to understand what the report tells us about the crash - and what it doesn&#39;t. </p><p><i>You can read Soutik&#39;s </i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gy78gpnqo">full analysis on the cockpit audio here</a><i>.</i></p>

      <p>The Air India 787 was destroyed after crashing into multiple buildings outside the airport in Ahmedabad after takeoff in June.</p><p>Here&#39;s what the preliminary report reveals:</p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      The aircraft hit the BJ Medical College hostel, about 0.9 nautical miles from the runway
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      It clipped trees and a chimney, then crashed into a building with a slight nose-up

      <p>The preliminary report sets out what happened. What we don’t
know is why.</p><p>The fuel control switches are designed not to be moved
accidentally. Shifting them from RUN to CUT OFF is a two-stage process. Each
switch has to be lifted before it can be moved down, and there are two of them,
one for each engine.</p><p>The conversation between the two pilots appears to show that
one of them was aware the switches had been moved – though the other denied it.</p><p>Was this a simple mistake made by a pilot under pressure, or
was there another reason? The report baldly sets out the precise times when the
switches were moved, but there is no other context given – except for that
brief exchange between the pilots.</p><p>The report itself does not highlight any technical problem
that could have led to confusion in the cockpit, before the engines lost
thrust.</p><p>One other possibility - and it is a dreadful one - is that
this was a premeditated action. Nevertheless, it is a possibility that experts
say should be taken seriously.</p><p>The report itself is careful not to draw any conclusions –
and the investigation (which has been criticised by some for its lack of
urgency and transparency) is ongoing.</p><p>It is highly likely the &#34;human aspect&#34; – the personal
circumstances of the flight crew – will form part of that process.</p>

      <p>Investigators are zeroing in on what they describe as
an interesting point in the report.</p><p>The report says in December 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin
(SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing
737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.</p><p>While the issue was noted, it wasn’t deemed an unsafe
condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.</p><p>The same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8
aircraft, including Air India’s VT-ANB, which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory,
Air India did not perform the recommended inspections.</p><p>Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident
investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, tells the BBC he’s wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.</p><p>“What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does
it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut
the fuel supply?&#34; he says.</p><p>&#34;When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens?
Could the switch just flip itself to OFF and shut down the engine? If that’s
the case, it’s a really serious issue. If not, this also needs to be
explained.&#34;</p>

      <p>Investigators say there are two main takeaways from
the preliminary report on Air India Flight 171.</p><p>First, both engine fuel cut off switches moved from run to cut off within seconds of takeoff, abruptly cutting the plane&#39;s thrust at 180 knots.</p><p>Cockpit voice recordings capture one pilot asking the
other why they&#39;d shut the engines down, only to be met with a denial -
heightening suspicion that this wasn’t a routine or accidental action. Engineers note these switches are specifically guarded and require
deliberate operation, typically reserved for emergencies like engine fire - not
mid-flight manoeuvres.</p><p>Second, the preliminary findings reference a 2018 Federal Aviation Authority bulletin alerting operators to the possible disengagement of the fuel switch
locking mechanism.</p><p>However, there’s no clear explanation of how this
mechanical issue could have caused both switches to flip nearly simultaneously.
The bulletin was advisory and inspections by Air India were skipped. The
airline’s past maintenance included throttle module replacements in 2019 and
2023. None of these replacements were linked to the fuel control switches.</p><p>Until further investigation digs into whether this was
human error or a rare mechanical malfunction, the cause remains unresolved.</p>

      <p>As we&#39;ve been reporting, India&#39;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has published a 15-page preliminary report. It details what happened to the Air India plane that crashed within seconds after takeoff. </p><p>&#34;The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about <b>08:08:42</b>
UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another <b>with a time gap of 01 sec,</b>&#34; the report says.</p><p>Then, &#34;in the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
The other pilot responded that he did not do so.&#34;</p><p>At <b>08:08:52 UTC</b>, &#34;the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN&#34;, and <b>four seconds</b> after that, &#34;the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN.&#34; It was now <b>08:08:56</b>. </p><p>At <b>08:09:05, nine seconds later, </b>one of the pilots transmitted<b> &#34;</b>MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY&#34; to the Air Traffic Control Officers on the ground. The officers received no response, and shortly afterwards, they saw the plane crashing. </p><p>Here is a <a href="https://aaib.gov.in/What%27s%20New%20Assets/Preliminary%20Report%20VT-ANB.pdf">link<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> to the preliminary report.</p>
