      <p>Earlier reports, including from the BBC, reported the death toll as 270, based on figures from officials at the crash site and doctors at the hospitals where the injured were being treated. </p><p>But days after the crash, Gujarat government officials revised the number, saying that 260 people were killed. </p><p>This figure includes 241 of the 242 passengers on board the flight and 19 casualties on the ground. The plane crashed into the canteen a doctors&#39; hostel in Ahmedabad, where student doctors were getting lunch.</p>

      <p>The British man who survived the Air India plane crash says he
managed to escape the wreckage <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd901xn4001o">through an opening in the plane&#39;s fuselage.</a></p><p>Speaking to Indian state media the day after the crash,
Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A, said the lights inside the aircraft
&#34;started flickering&#34; moments after take off.</p><p>He said within five-to-10 seconds, it felt like the plane was
&#34;stuck in the air&#34;. </p><p>&#34;The lights started flickering green and
white... suddenly slammed into a building and exploded. I still can&#39;t believe how I survived. I walked out of the

      <p>The narrative was just beginning to change for Air India in the lead-up to the tragedy.</p><p>In the hands of a new private owner - the Tata Group bought the airline from the government in 2022 - Air India showed an operating profit, better revenues and fewer customer complaints.</p><p>Although disgruntlement about poor service standards, dysfunctional in-house entertainment and flight delays hadn&#39;t entirely gone away, there was an understanding that these were niggling transition troubles as the airline undertook multiple <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ygp1w5eq7o">complex mergers</a> to streamline its operations.</p><p>The cosmetic improvements were beginning to show too; slick new livery and retrofitted interiors on some aircraft, brand-new A-350s in the fleet deployed on key routes and a record-breaking order for new planes to retire old ones to service India&#39;s booming aviation market.</p><p>After years of neglect when Air India was under state ownership, the Tatas said earlier this year that they&#39;d embarked on the &#34;final climb phrase&#34; of the carrier&#39;s transformation journey towards becoming a &#34;world-class&#34; airline.</p><p>Here is how the devastating crash has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglz239ydrjo">cast a shadow on these plans</a>.</p>

      <p>We now know that just seconds after take-off, both the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner&#39;s fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the &#34;cut-off&#34; position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to &#34;cut-off&#34; is a move typically done only after landing.</p><p>Investigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they&#39;re highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps.</p><p>&#34;It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,&#34; a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.</p><p>That&#39;s what makes the Air India case stand out.</p><p>I spoke to several experts from around the world to understand what the report tells us about the crash - and what it doesn&#39;t. </p><p><i>You can read Soutik&#39;s </i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gy78gpnqo">full analysis on the cockpit audio here</a><i>.</i></p>

      <p>The preliminary report has brought fresh attention to the two pilots in control of the ill-fated Air India flight.</p><p>Just seconds after take-off, cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you do the cut-off?”- referring to the fuel switch that starved the engines. The other replied, “I didn’t.” It&#39;s still unclear who asked the question - and who answered.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the crew.</p><p><b>Capt Sumeet Sabharwal</b>, 56, was a veteran with 30 years of experience at Air India. He had logged 15,638 flying hours, including 8,596 on the Boeing 787. Based in Mumbai, he lived with his elderly father and was looking forward to retirement.</p><p><b>First Officer Clive Kunder</b>, 32, had 3,403 total flying hours, with 1,128 on the Dreamliner. He joined Air India in 2017 and had dreamed of flying since school.</p><p>Both were based in Mumbai and had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight, with adequate rest, the report says. Kunder was the pilot flying, while Sabharwal was the pilot monitoring, it says.</p><p>The crew had passed pre-flight breathalyser tests and were seen at the gate on CCTV before they took off, the report adds.</p>

      <p>The preliminary report sets out what happened. What we don’t
know is why.</p><p>The fuel control switches are designed not to be moved
accidentally. Shifting them from RUN to CUT OFF is a two-stage process. Each
switch has to be lifted before it can be moved down, and there are two of them,
one for each engine.</p><p>The conversation between the two pilots appears to show that
one of them was aware the switches had been moved – though the other denied it.</p><p>Was this a simple mistake made by a pilot under pressure, or
was there another reason? The report baldly sets out the precise times when the
switches were moved, but there is no other context given – except for that
brief exchange between the pilots.</p><p>The report itself does not highlight any technical problem
that could have led to confusion in the cockpit, before the engines lost
thrust.</p><p>Some experts also say the possibility that this action was premeditated should be taken seriously, though more of the conversation between the two pilots needs to be released before it is possible to determine what happened.</p><p>The report itself is careful not to draw any conclusions –
and the investigation (which has been criticised by some for its lack of
urgency and transparency) is ongoing.</p><p>It is highly likely the &#34;human aspect&#34; – the personal
circumstances of the flight crew – will form part of that process.</p>

      <p>Investigators are zeroing in on what they describe as
an interesting point in the report.</p><p>The report says in December 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin
(SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing
737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.</p><p>While the issue was noted, it wasn’t deemed an unsafe
condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.</p><p>The same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8
aircraft, including Air India’s VT-ANB, which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory,
Air India did not perform the recommended inspections.</p><p>Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident
investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, tells the BBC he’s wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.</p><p>“What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does
it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut
the fuel supply?&#34; he says.</p><p>&#34;When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens?
Could the switch just flip itself to OFF and shut down the engine? If that’s
the case, it’s a really serious issue. If not, this also needs to be
explained.&#34;</p>
