      <p>We&#39;ve been hearing a lot about the fuel switches of the Air India flight, which the preliminary report into the crash says were cut-off after the plane took off.</p><p>Our international business correspondent takes a look into the use of these switches, and how they could have ended up in the off position.</p>

      <p>India is the world’s third-largest passenger aviation market.  </p><p>The country’s scheduled carriers operate nearly 850 aircraft, a sharp rise from around 400 a decade ago. </p><p>Annual air passenger numbers have more than doubled since 2014-15, jumping from 116 million to 239 million. </p><p>The number of commercial aerodromes has also seen a significant increase, growing from around 60–70 a decade ago to nearly 130–140 today.</p><p>Earlier this week, I asked India&#39;s air safety regulator <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnr828z0go">whether June&#39;s crash dented the reputation of air travel in India</a>. </p><p>Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, the chief of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the data didn&#39;t point to that.</p><p>&#34;We looked at the data to assess whether it had any impact on domestic or international operations. There was no significant drop in traffic. At most, we observed a very marginal dip for a short period, affecting both domestic and international flights, along with a few cancellations,&#34; Kidwai said. </p><figure><p><span><img alt="View of Airplanes standing at Mumbai Airport on June 13, 2025 in Mumbai, India.

      <p>The Airline Pilots&#39; Association of India (ALPA India) has reacted to the preliminary report on the crash, raising concerns over the way the investigation is being handled.</p><p>In a statement reported by <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/aviation/air-india-plane-crash-pilots-union-include-in-capacity-of-observers-ongoing-probe-19636096.htm">Indian media<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>, the pilots&#39; union said it was &#34;surprised at the secrecy surrounding these investigations&#34; and alleged that &#34;suitably qualified personnel were not taken on board for the probe&#34;.</p><p>“We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,” ALPA India&#39;s president, Captain Sam Thomas, says in the statement.</p><p>The preliminary report says just seconds after take-off, the cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you do the cut off?”, referring to the fuel switch that starved the engines.

      <p>There was much speculation about the Air India Boeing 787&#39;s Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or the &#34;black boxes&#34; - which will help tell the story of the crash. </p><p>These devices record flight data and cockpit audio, including pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds.</p><p>The preliminary report offers key insights into how they were recovered and what they revealed.</p><p>One recorder was found on 13 June, a day after the crash, atop a building, heavily damaged by impact and heat, with exposed wires and burned connectors.</p><p>The second was recovered three days later near another building, still attached to its equipment shelf.</p><p>Both were sent to the AAIB lab in Delhi on 24 June. As in previous cases, investigators used a “Golden Chassis” - an identical EAFR unit - and special download cables sourced from the NTSB in the US to extract the data.</p><p>The AAIB successfully retrieved about 49 hours of flight data covering six flights, including the crash, and two hours of cockpit audio capturing the final moments.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most crucial thing to emerge from the preliminary report is that the plane&#39;s fuel switches were cut off shortly before the crash. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a really important switch and therefore it&#39;s one that&#39;s protected against somebody just brushing against it,&#34; explains Graham Braithwaite, director of Aerospace and Aviation at Cranfield University. </p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&#39;s Today programme, he says in order for a pilot to move the switch, &#34;they&#39;ve got to lift it and move very positively the position&#34;.</p><p>He points out the report does not say a pilot moved the switch, and at this stage &#34;you would expect the report to keep an open mind&#34;. </p><p>On wider danger to passengers, he says the area of focus in this investigation is &#34;very specifically on this flight, on this particular aircraft on this day&#34;.</p><p>&#34;The 787 had flown a billion passengers safely prior to this flight&#34; and it has a good record, Braithwaite adds.</p>

managed to escape the wreckage <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd901xn4001o">through an opening in the plane&#39;s fuselage.</a></p><p>Speaking to Indian state media the day after the crash,
Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A, said the lights inside the aircraft
&#34;started flickering&#34; moments after take off.</p><p>He said within five-to-10 seconds, it felt like the plane was
&#34;stuck in the air&#34;. </p><p>&#34;The lights started flickering green and
white... suddenly slammed into a building and exploded. I still can&#39;t believe how I survived. I walked out of the
rubble.&#34;</p><p>Ramesh’s brother, who was also on the flight, did not survive the
tragedy - a week later, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg8591rpjyo">Vishwashkumar carried Ajay&#39;s coffin at his
