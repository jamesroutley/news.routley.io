We learned that a pilot could be heard asking the other in a voice recording: why did you cut off? The other replied he did not do so. No significant faults have been found with the plane or its engines so far.</p><p><b>The Air India response</b>: In a statement, the airline said it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cx20p2x9093t?post=asset%3Aede98983-fa04-4d89-b381-26dc81cdb190#post">stands in solidarity with those affected.</a> It acknowledges the report and says it will continue to work with the relevant authorities. </p><p><b>The reaction</b>: Some of the relatives of crash victims feel frustrated.

      <p>The question has been on pretty much everyone’s mind since the crash.</p><p>Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, head of India’s aviation safety regulator DGCA, told me last week that “India’s skies have always been safe - past and present”.</p><p>He points to global safety data from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), showing that India often outperformed the world average in accidents per million flights.</p><p>Kidwai notes that between 2010 and 2024, only two years saw India’s accident rate rise above the global average - and those were linked to major accidents. </p><p>So, while every tragedy is devastating, India’s overall aviation safety record remains strong, he says.</p><p>I have also asked him about recent headlines that have raised concerns - from a Delhi-Srinagar flight that hit severe turbulence to growing reports of maintenance oversights and training shortfalls - you can <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnr828z0go">read more about what he has to say here</a>.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="An aircraft flies in the sky as clouds loom over in Siliguri, India, on May 26, 2025.
