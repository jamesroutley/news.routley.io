      <p>As we&#39;ve been reporting, India&#39;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has published a 15-page preliminary report. It details what happened to the Air India plane that crashed within seconds after takeoff. </p><p>&#34;The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about <b>08:08:42</b>
UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another <b>with a time gap of 01 sec,</b>&#34; the report says.</p><p>Then, &#34;in the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
The other pilot responded that he did not do so.&#34;</p><p>At <b>08:08:52 UTC</b>, &#34;the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN&#34;, and <b>four seconds</b> after that, &#34;the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN.&#34; It was now <b>08:08:56</b>. </p><p>At <b>08:09:05, nine seconds later, </b>one of the pilots transmitted<b> &#34;</b>MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY&#34; to the Air Traffic Control Officers on the ground. The officers received no response, and shortly afterwards, they saw the plane crashing. </p><p>Here is a <a href="https://aaib.gov.in/What%27s%20New%20Assets/Preliminary%20Report%20VT-ANB.pdf">link<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> to the preliminary report.</p>

      <p>One thing that stands out from the report is that so far there has been no advisory issued for the Boeing Dreamliner 787 or the GE GEnx-1B engine operators used in this aircraft.</p><p>At the moment mechanical fault has been ruled out but we need to wait for more information to come out as these are just preliminary findings. </p><p>The content of the report is, however, quite shocking, especially the fact that both the fuel control switches were moved from the run position to the cut-off position. </p><p>But many questions are still swirling around. </p><p>Was it a technical issue? Was it a software issue? Was it a human error?</p><p>The findings of this report are being closely watched as families of this devastating crash seek closure.</p>

      <p>Air India has released a statement on the report.

      <p>Prior to boarding Air India Flight 171, the crew and two pilots of the flight all underwent testing to ensure they were capable of operating the aircraft.</p><p>The report states that both pilots, who were based at Mumbai, had arrived at Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had an &#34;adequate rest period&#34;.</p><p>The crew and pilots all also underwent a breathalyser test at
06:25 local time and were found &#34;fit to operate the flight&#34;, it added.</p>

      <p>The report says the fuel samples that were taken from tanks
used to refuel the Air India aircraft were &#34;satisfactory&#34;.</p><p>Aviation experts had previously told the BBC that fuel
contamination was a possible factor that could&#39;ve caused the crash. A dual
engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging.</p><p>Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if
that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.</p><p>The report separately outlines that a &#34;very limited
amount of fuel samples&#34; were retrieved from the APU filter and
Refuel/Jettison valve of the left wing.</p><p>&#34;The testing of these samples will be done at a
suitable facility capable of carrying out the test with the limited available
quantity,&#34; the report said.</p>

      <p>The preliminary report from India’s Air Accident Investigation Bureau into the loss of Air India flight 171, which killed 260 people, has cast attention firmly on the actions of the pilots.</p><p>As we just reported, the report says that according to data from the flight recorder both the fuel control switches, which are normally used to switch the engines on or off when on the ground, were moved from the <b>run</b> to the <b>cutoff</b> position shortly after takeoff. </p><p>This caused both engines to lose thrust.</p><p>It says that in the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he “did the cutoff”. The other pilot, it says, responded that he did not do so. </p><p>It is not specified which voice is which. At the time the aircraft took off, the co-pilot was flying the plane, while the captain was monitoring.</p><p>The switches were then moved back into their normal inflight position, something which would automatically start the process of relighting the engines. </p><p>One engine, according to the report, was in the process of regaining thrust at the time the aircraft crashed. The other was relit but was not yet regaining thrust.</p><p>The report says: &#34;At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers, suggesting that no significant fault has been found with the plane or its engines.&#34;</p><p>The report does not draw any conclusions, and points out that the investigation is continuing, but it is clear attention is now being focused on the actions of the pilots.</p>

      <p>One of the findings from the report outlines how a pilot could be heard asking the other pilot in a voice recording of the cockpit in the moments before the crash: why did you cut off? </p><p>The report says that both engine fuel cut off switches were turned to &#34;cut-off&#34; with a time delay.</p><p>Below is an excerpt of that finding from the preliminary report:</p><p>&#34;The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. </p><p>&#34;The Engine N1
and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cutoff. </p><p>&#34;In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
The other pilot responded that he did not do so.&#34;</p>
