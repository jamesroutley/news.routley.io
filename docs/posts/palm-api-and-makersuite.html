<p>We’re seeing a new wave of generative AI applications that are transforming the way people interact with technology – from games and dialog agents to creative brainstorming and coding tools. At Google, we want to continue making AI accessible by empowering all developers to start building the next generation of applications with generative AI by providing easy-to-use APIs and tools.</p>

<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-developers-google-cloud-workspace/" target="_blank"> we announced the PaLM API</a>, a new developer offering that makes it easy and safe to experiment with Google’s large language models. Alongside the API, we’re releasing MakerSuite, a tool that lets developers start prototyping quickly and easily. We’ll be making these tools available to select developers through a Private Preview, and stay tuned for our waitlist soon.</p>

It will provide developers access to models that are optimized for multi-turn use cases, such as content generation and chat, and general purpose models that are optimized for use cases such as summarization, classification, and more. Starting today, we’re making an efficient model available in terms of size and capabilities, and we’ll add other models and sizes soon.

We learned a lot about generative AI development workflows and how fragmented they can be. Developers have to use different tools to accomplish tasks like crafting and iterating on a prompt, generating synthetic data, and tuning a custom model.

And with MakerSuite, you’ll be able to quickly test and iterate on your tuned model right in the browser.

This synthetic data can be used in various scenarios, such as tuning or evaluations.

Embeddings can also be used in downstream applications built with TensorFlow, Keras, JAX, and other open-source libraries.

<p>It’s an exciting time in AI for developers and we want to continue to make sure we build AI tools that help make your lives easier. We plan to onboard new developers, roll out new features, and make this technology available to the broader developer community soon. During this time, we’ll listen to feedback, learn, and improve these tools to meet developers where they are.</p><p>To stay updated on our progress, <a href="https://developers.google.com/newsletter" target="_blank">subscribe to the Google Developers newsletter</a>.</p>
