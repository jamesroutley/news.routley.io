    <h1>Nannou â€“ An open-source creative-coding framework for Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Batteries Included</h2><p>One of the beauties of being a creative coder is that we have the potential to create works in a wide range of domains. Nannou aims to give equal priority to a full suite of creative I/O including graphics, multi-windowing, audio, lasers, lighting<!-- --> <a href="https://guide.nannou.cc/why_nannou.html#goals">and more</a>.</p></div><div><h2>A fast, modern language</h2><p>When experimenting with the cutting edge in audiovisual processing high performance becomes a necessity. When performing live or creating long-running installations reliability becomes equally important. Rust ticks these boxes<!-- --> <a href="https://guide.nannou.cc/why_nannou.html#why-rust">and more</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Open Source &amp; Liberally Licensed</h2><p>Access to these technologies is often expensive and locked behind proprietary systems. We believe in democratising this space by open sourcing Nannou for everyone to use. You can find the code<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou">here</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Join Us!</h2><p>You can get started with nannou by visiting<!-- --> <a href="https://guide.nannou.cc">the guide</a>.
