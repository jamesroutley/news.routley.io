<p>I have been playing around with content and crypto. I am calling this idea Route3</p>



<p>I connected my super secrete mere coin with different pages on my website. </p>



<p>This made me think about the future of URL mapping. </p>



<p>When ORMs became popular with Ruby on Rails and Django we had the notion of mapping URL endpoints to functions. The functions would handle authentication and data (sometimes middleware would handle authentication etc). </p>



<p>With web3 we can connect smart contracts  with URL endpoints – what does this mean and why is it important. </p>



<ol><li>we are moving from URL end point to smart contract or token as the point of entry. </li></ol>



<p>Instead of having a URL endpoint – rest like – I just have a token</p>



<p>I connect actions with the token, maybe the balance of the token, or some smart contract function or variable on the token. </p>



<p>Why is this important, what changes does this create? </p>



<p>REST endpoints were useful for storing and retrieving data. It centers around data object and communication with data and objects. </p>



<p>If we have smart contract controlled end points – we are now centering around access and authentication not data. </p>



<p>I don’t necessarily have to create the token in order to create a site based on access. </p>



<p>Here I have created a <a href="https://msrobot0.github.io/route4/">simple website</a> based on having 1 USDC coin in your wallet – this is a stable coin pegged to the us dollar: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48.">https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48.</a></p>



<p>I did not create USDC. I don’t even have any USDC – so I can’t even use this site. </p>



<p>These are just beginning thoughts – but I imagine creating an ERC20 (or other protocol) routing token that users can generate to map to states. </p>
