    <h1>Graphs That Explain Software Engineering Salaries in 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2659566397" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/software-salaries-2023" data-authors="Tekla S. Perry" data-headline="Eight Graphs That Explain Software Engineering Salaries in 2023"><div><p>Every year, online job search firms collect data about the salaries, skills, and overall job market for tech professionals, generally focusing on software engineers</p><p>The numbers from job search firms <a href="https://www.dice.com/recruiting/ebooks/dice-tech-salary-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dice</a> and <a href="https://hired.com/blog/highlights/hired-releases-2023-state-of-software-engineers-report/?cookie_consent=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hired</a> have been released. These 2022 numbers have been eagerly anticipated, given the turmoil generated by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-layoffs-2022" target="_self">a spate of tech layoffs</a> in the latter part of the year, which Dice estimates at more than 140,000. The data they collect doesn’t allow for apples-to-apples comparisons, but I’ve read through both reports, pulled out data from past years to give the numbers some perspective when possible, and summarized it in eight charts. Dice’s numbers come from a survey administered to its registered job seekers and site visitors between 16 August 2022 and 17 October 2022, for a total of 7,098 completed surveys. Hired’s analysis included data from 68,500 job candidates and 494,000 interview requests collected from the site between January 2021 through December 2022, supplemented by a survey of 1,300 software engineers.</p></div></div></div>
