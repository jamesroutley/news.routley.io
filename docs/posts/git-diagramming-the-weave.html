    <p>We all know the current US President is one hell of an orator and often assures us that he has “the best words”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to an Ivy League school. I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man knows words. Says so right there. While some might view his non-sequitur ramblings as the nascent stages of dementia or an unfiltered ADHD brain launching into successive short (at times racist) bullet-point diatribes based on the last word or phrase he said like a cursed game of word association, the President asserts this is not the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about, like, nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like - and friends of mine that are, like, English professors - they say, it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5107714/breaking-down-former-president-donald-trumps-rambling-linguistic-style">The Weave</a>” re-entered my consciousness this week after I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ds1Cz-LpA">a quick snippet of an Oval Office event</a> where Trump says the (“radical left-wing”) CBO projects tariffs will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion USD. I was skeptical –<a href="https://youtu.be/ab9yLd3OjSw">and for good reason</a>– but I tuned in. What shocked me was not the complete lack of specifics about the CBO projection, but rather the actual reason for the Oval Office meeting: a FIFA event? Wow.</p>

<p>For awhile now, I’ve clued into the cyclical pattern of his speeches, little snippets of “the best words” and talking points assembled like a ransom note cut from a magazine. I often wondered if it’s possible to diagram “the weave”. The “branching” narratives Trump uses made me think a git-graph-style visualization was apropos. So I grabbed a transcript and got to work.</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html">Mermaid.js’ GitGraph Diagram</a> which worked well but only supports horizontal charts. As I sat with it I realized I wanted a chronological list of statements that read like a transcript. I repurposed the Mermaid’s GitGraph DSL and made a web component called <code>&lt;git-graph&gt;</code> to help me visualize and document Trump’s derailing trains of thought from the above event.</p>

<p>By my count in that four-minute address there were ten distinct themes or “branches”, most of which are common grievances or rhetorical themes found in nearly all Trump speeches. I used “cherry-picking” to model callbacks to a previous statement (e.g. “the stock market is up”) that seem to reverberate into later trains of thought, a quintessential feature of the weave.</p>
<p>Four minutes of the weave was about all I could handle but I think this visualization models what I experience when trying to follow along to the President’s speeches. One or two phrases on a topic, then jumping to a new topic, weaving in a (sometimes unrelated) point from a previous topic to make the thought appear more cohesive and linear, then driving deep down an inconsequential topic. When he talks so long about ten different topics at a time, I’d forgive you for thinking he said something salient. But when you break it down you see it for what it is: a mishmash of talking points.</p>
