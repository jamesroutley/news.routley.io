    <h1>Some notes on Firefox’s media autoplay settings in practice as of Firefox 124</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Some notes on Firefox&#39;s media autoplay settings in practice as of Firefox 124</h2>

	<p><small>March 29, 2024</small></p>
</div><div><p>I&#39;ve been buying digital music from one of the reasonably good
online sources of it (the one that recently got acquired, again,
making people nervous about its longer term future). In addition
to the DRM-free lossless downloads of your purchases, this place
lets you stream albums through your web browser, which in my case
is an instance of Firefox. Recently, I noticed that my Firefox
instance at work would seamlessly transition from one track to the
next track of an album I was streaming, regardless of which label&#39;s
sub-site I was on, while my home Firefox would not; when one track
ended, the home Firefox would normally pause rather than start
playing the next track.</p>

<p>(I listen to both albums I&#39;ve purchased and albums I haven&#39;t and
I&#39;m just checking out. The former play through the main page for
my collection, while the latter are scattered around various URLs,
because each label or artist gets a &lt;label&gt;.&lt;mumble&gt;.com sub-domain
for its releases, and then each release has its own page. For the
obvious reasons, I long ago set my home Firefox to allow my
collection&#39;s main page to autoplay music so it could seamlessly
move from one track to the next.)</p>

<p>Both browser instances were set to disallow autoplay in general in
the Preferences → Privacy &amp; Security (see <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay">Allow or block media
autoplay in Firefox</a>),
and inspection of the per-site settings showed that my work Firefox
actually had granted no autoplay permissions to sites while my home
Firefox had a list of various subdomains for this particular vendor
that were allowed to autoplay. After spelunking my about:config, I
identified this as a difference in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxMediaAutoplaySettingsIII"><code>media.autoplay.blocking_policy</code></a>, where the work Firefox had this
set to the default of &#39;0&#39; while my home Firefox had a <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxMediaAutoplaySettingsIII">long-standing
setting of &#39;2&#39;</a>.</p>

<p>As discussed in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/block-autoplay">Mozilla&#39;s wiki page on blocking media autoplay</a>, the default setting
for this preference <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/block-autoplay#Sticky_user_gesture_activation_.28default.29">allows autoplay once you&#39;ve interacted with
that tab</a>,
while my setting of &#39;2&#39; requires that you always click to (re)start
audio or video playing (unless the site has been granted autoplay
permissions). Historically I set this to &#39;2&#39; to try to stop Youtube
from autoplaying a second video after my first one had finished.
In practice this usage has been rendered functionally obsolete by
Youtube&#39;s own &#39;disable autoplay&#39; setting in its video player (although
it still works to prevent autoplay if I&#39;ve forgotten to turn that
on in this Firefox session or if Youtube is in a playlist and ignores
that setting).</p>

<p>(For both Youtube and this digital music source, a setting of &#39;1&#39;,
a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/block-autoplay#Transient_user_gesture_activation">transient user gesture activation</a>,
is functionally equivalent to &#39;2&#39; for me because it will normally
be more than five seconds before the video or track finishes playing,
which means that the permission will have expired by the time the
site wants to advance to the next thing.)</p>

<p>Since I check out multi-track albums much more often than I look
at Youtube videos (in this Firefox), and Youtube these days does
have a reliable &#39;disable autoplay&#39; setting, I opted to leave
<code>media.autoplay.blocking_policy</code> set to &#39;0&#39; in the work Firefox
instance I use for this stuff and I&#39;ve just changed it to &#39;0&#39; in
my home one as well. I could avoid this if I set up <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxExtraProfilesHack">a custom
profile for this music source</a>, but I
haven&#39;t quite gotten to that point yet.</p>

<p>(I do wish Firefox allowed, effectively, per-site settings of this
as part of the per-site autoplay permissions, but I also understand
why they don&#39;t; I&#39;m sure the Preferences and per-site settings UI
complexity would be something to see.)</p>

<p>(If I&#39;d thought to check <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxMediaAutoplaySettingsIII">my previous notes on this</a> I probably would have been led
to <code>media.autoplay.blocking_policy</code> right away, but it didn&#39;t
occur to me to check here, even though I knew I&#39;d fiddled a lot
with Firefox media autoplay over the years. My past self writing
things down here doesn&#39;t guarantee that my future (present) self
will remember that they exist.)</p>

<p>PS: I actually go back and forth on automatically moving on to the
next track of an album I&#39;m checking out, because the current &#39;stop
after one track&#39; behavior does avoid me absently listening to the
whole thing. If I find myself unintentionally listening to too many
albums that in theory I&#39;m only checking out, I&#39;ll change the setting
back.</p>
