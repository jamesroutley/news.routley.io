    <h1>In defence of the boring web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Having recently had the pleasure of doing most of my internet
interactions on a tablet or a smartphone because my laptop was ‘hors de
combat,’ I was able to further reflect on the state of the modern
web.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> With Web 2.0 being already passé, Web 3.0 being not the latest
fad any more, and talks of Web 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0, my own website seems
to follow a strange and anachronistic vision. I like to call this <strong>The
Boring Web</strong>. Similar to <a href="http://boringtechnology.club">the Boring Technology Club</a>,
this website employs boring techniques, both in terms of how content is
being presented as well as in terms of its technology stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am not using JavaScript, except for a minimal installation of
<a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> to be able to render equations in
blog posts (and I know of no other simple way to accomplish this
goal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not using any cookies or additional ways of user tracking.
Instead, I am using <a href="https://goaccess.io">GoAccess</a> to generate static
reports based on the webserver logs—no user-facing parts are
involved, and IP addresses are anonymised. As a consequence, I am not
wasting your valuable time by letting you accept or decline any
cookies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, I am not pestering readers with ‘Click here to subscribe’
banners that open <em>after</em> you have been browsing the site for a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also don’t require you to create an account if you want to read more
than three articles per month. In fact, I am happy that you are even
reading this text!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, I am not showing you any ads or
affiliate links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty boring so far, right? Wait until you read about the technology
stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored in a <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> repository.</li>
<li>All content is written in Markdown files.</li>
<li>The structure of the website is essentially a twin of its folder
structure.</li>
<li>I am using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> a static website generator, to
generate, well, <em>static</em> HTML files.</li>
<li>These HTML files are served using <a href="https://www.nginx.com">nginx</a>.</li>
<li>Everything is hosted on a Debian machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not using a load balancer, a database, or a cache server. In
fact, I am even hosting other websites on this server without
experiencing any noticeable performance issues.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I do not want this post to come across as a self-aggrandising ‘look at how
<em>simple</em> and <em>elegant</em> this setup is’  diatribe. I believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum"><em>de
gustibus non est disputandum</em></a>
when it comes to highly-subjective things like elegance or simplicity.
The point I want to make is <strong>boring has served me well so far</strong>: this
website does not have a lot of moving parts; I can easily host it almost
anywhere and even if I switch from Hugo to something else, my choices
ensure that content can be easily preserved. My content has survived
several iterations of blogging software without my <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">URIs changing</a>.
I am not sure whether my content <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">is designed to last</a>,
but I sure hope to be able to look back on this post in 10 years and
scoff at my own naïveté.</p>
<h2 id="is-boring-technology-for-you">Is boring technology for you?</h2>
<p>I realise that many of these boring choices I made are a consequence of
this website being a kind of pet project or labour of love if you will.
I enjoy having an amount of complexity that I can just handle, and these
choices provide me with some control—I am not at the beck and call of
some content provider that can pull the rug out from under me at any
time.</p>
<p>Likewise, I feel that these choices <strong>serve my readers better</strong>. Yes,
being integrated into Medium, Substack, or any other larger platform
might increase my reach. But it would also come with hidden costs that
I am unwilling to pay at this time. I do not want my visitors to be
tracked. I do not want my visitors to be badgered by some popups. I do
not want my content to sit behind multiple layers of caching and load at
a snail’s pace. And I certainly don’t want my content interspersed with
ads.</p>
<h2 id="a-privileged-perspective">A privileged perspective</h2>
<p>Of course, I am privileged in that I don’t depend on this website in any
way. It is my way of sharing things I find interesting with the rest of
the world. If my livelihood depended on visitors, I would probably have
to think again about monetising the content somehow. However, I am
reasonably sure that there are <strong>better ways</strong> than this is commonly
done in most websites. I strongly believe that if ads get in the way of
content, you are doing something wrong.</p>
<h2 id="try-being-boring-if-you-can-afford-it">Try being boring (if you can afford it)</h2>
<p>I think boring websites like mine are possible for more people. It’s
less a function of the expected number of visitors, but rather
a function of its intended purpose. If your website has a well-defined
purpose, maybe boring technology could be good for
you. An excellent example of what I have in mind is
<a href="https://lichess.org">lichess.org</a>. The site has a single purpose:
getting you to play chess with people. This is as true to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix
philosophy</a> of ‘Do one
thing well.’ As negative example, I often wonder how many university
websites <em>really</em> need the level of complexity they are exhibiting? Do
I have to click through cookie warnings, a newsletter alert, and all
kinds of other distractions just to see your faculty listing? I hope
not.</p>
<p>Notice that boring does not mean that the website has to look as
minimalist as mine. But when it comes to the way users are treated,
boring wins the day—fewer interruptions are a blessing for readers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, boring can be exciting.</p>
