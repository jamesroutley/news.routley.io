    <h1>Ask HN: Have you ever heard of users demonstrating against software?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today in Trondheim, Norway, around 100 health doctors &amp; nurses demostrated by walking with torches trough the city against the implementation of a new software in the hospital. The Helseplatform is an adaptation of Epic to the Norwegian Health system. Have this ever happen in history before? How bad can something be that users go out in the street to demostrate?</p></div></div>
