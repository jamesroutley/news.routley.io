    <h1>Ask HN: Whatever happened to the “coming wave” of delivery drones?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I feel like a few years ago all the rage was that Amazon and other retailers were going to deliver things via drones, straight to your doorstep</p><p>Food delivery companies as well seemed to be testing out robots that would bring your food to you albeit in a more sidewalk bound way</p><p>Its been a few years and I have yet to have a single thing drone delivered to my house</p><p>What happened to that alternate future? Are companies still working on it? Or did we move on from that idea for some reasons we discovered?</p></div></div></div>
