<blockquote>
  <p>As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book.</p>

  <p>Be yourself.</p>

  <p>Be imperfect.</p>

  <p>Be human.</p>

  <p>Care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this note, I’ve been trying to develop a set of guidelines for myself about whether and how I wish to use LLMs in my own work. One of the guidelines I’ve been stubborn about is “don’t use LLMs to produce anything you expect anybody to actually read.”</p>

<p>It feels like a basic form of respecting somebody else’s time.</p>
