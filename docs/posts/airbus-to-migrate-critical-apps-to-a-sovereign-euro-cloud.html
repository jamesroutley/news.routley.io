    <h1>Airbus to migrate critical apps to a sovereign Euro cloud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud – but estimates only an 80/20 chance of finding a suitable provider.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/25/airbus_a350_1000.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="Airbus A350-1000"/></p><h2 title="Google Workspace switch drags on amid Excel dependencies, compliance requirements, and compatibility issues">Seven years later, Airbus is still trying to kick its Microsoft habit</h2>

<p>The aerospace manufacturer, which has already consolidated its datacenter estate and uses services like Google Workspace, now wants to move key on-premises applications including ERP, manufacturing execution systems, CRM, and product lifecycle management (aircraft designs) to the cloud.</p>
<p>&#34;I need a sovereign cloud because part of the information is extremely sensitive from a national and European perspective,&#34; Catherine Jestin, Airbus&#39;s executive vice president of digital, told <em>The Register</em>. &#34;We want to ensure this information remains under European control.&#34;</p>
<p>The driver is access to new software. Vendors like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/03/sap_ceo_push_for_cloudonly/">SAP are developing innovations exclusively in the cloud</a>, pushing customers toward platforms like S/4HANA.</p>
<p>The request for proposals launches in early January, with a decision expected before summer. The contract – understood to be worth more than €50 million – will be long term (up to ten years), with price predictability over the period.</p>

    

<p>Digital sovereignty has become more critical since Donald Trump&#39;s return to the White House in January. His policies created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/30/microsoft_getting_nervous_about_europes/">volatility in trade and geopolitical relations</a>, prompting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/17/european_tech_sovereign_fund/">European customers to reduce reliance on US providers</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>While <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/microsoft_announces_strengthening_of_sovereignty/">Microsoft</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/03/aws_european_sovereign_cloud/">AWS</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/21/google_sovereign_cloud_updates/">Google</a> have created solutions to address these concerns, fears persist about the US CLOUD Act, which allows authorities to request data held by American corporations in overseas datacenters.</p>

<p>Microsoft admitted in French court last July it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/microsoft_admits_it_cannot_guarantee/">couldn&#39;t guarantee data sovereignty</a> under this legislation.</p>
<p>Jestin is waiting for European regulators to clarify whether Airbus would truly be &#34;immune to extraterritorial laws&#34; – and whether services could be interrupted.</p>

<p>The concern isn&#39;t theoretical. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan reportedly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/international_criminal_court_ditches_office/">lost access to his Microsoft email</a> after Trump sanctioned him for criticizing Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, though Microsoft denies suspending ICC services.</p>
<p>Beyond US complications, Jestin questions whether European cloud providers have sufficient scale. &#34;If you asked me today if we&#39;ll find a solution, I&#39;d say 80/20.&#34;</p>
<p>This puts pressure on European providers to collaborate, though whether they can navigate such complexities in Airbus&#39;s timeframe remains uncertain. ®</p>
