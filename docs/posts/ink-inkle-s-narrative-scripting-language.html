                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

                    <p>If you&#39;re new to <strong>ink</strong>, why not download <strong>Inky</strong>, our ink editor that allows you to play and test your stories.</p>

                    <p>The basics tutorial below has been written with a non-technical audience in mind, covering just the basics for people who want to write stories that they can put on the web.</p>
                        
                    <p>And to see everything that ink has to offer, read the writer&#39;s manual, or buy the offical user&#39;s guide.</p>

                <h3>ink - the language</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Markup, not programming</strong>: Text comes first, code and logic are inserted within.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple, elegant syntax</strong>: Why not get a taste in the <a href="https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md">writing tutorial</a>?</li>
                    <li><strong>Proven</strong>: literally millions of words of content have been written for our <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/">own</a> <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/sorcery/">games</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to learn</strong>, but with powerful constructs for more <strong>advanced scripting</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conceived as middleware</strong>: a narrative engine designed to slot into a game engine.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h3>Inky - the editor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Play as you write</strong>: The play pane automatically refreshes and reloads the choices you made.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error highlighting</strong>, as-you-type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jump to definition</strong>: alt-click on a divert (they&#39;re like hyperlinks in ink) to jump to the target.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export to JSON</strong>, ink&#39;s intermediate compiled format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export to web</strong>: Generates a page <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/misc/The_Intercept_Inky/">like this one</a>, ready to be customised.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Unity Integration</h3>
                <p>The plugin provides you with everything you need to get started with <strong>ink</strong> in Unity. It automatically recompiles ink files as you edit them, and even comes with a simple previewer that lets you play stories directly within the Editor, without writing a line of code.</p>

                <h3>Sample Game</h3>
                <p><em>The Intercept</em> is a game we built to demonstrate how you might build an entire simple game with <strong>ink</strong> and Unity. See how we like to structure our own ink files, and how easy it is to use the Unity plugin within a real game. We built the game in a couple days for a game jam!</p>

                <li><strong><a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/inklewriter">inklewriter</a></strong> is an easy-to-use online tool to write basic interactive stories.</li>
                <li><strong>ink</strong> by comparison is a more powerful narrative scripting language that is primarily designed for professional game development, though it can also be used to <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/">write and share choice-based interactive fiction</a>. It is also surprisingly easy to learn, though for ease of use it&#39;s hard to beat inklewriter!</li>
