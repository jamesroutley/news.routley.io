    <h1>200 lbs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I started lifting weights in February 2022. A couple of friends were doing it so I decided to join in. I never saw myself as the weightlifting type, and I didn’t expect much to come of it.</p>
<p>It soon became a weekly routine and we found ourselves doing a lot of bench press. We weren’t taking it too seriously but after a couple of months I passed my high-school max (140 lbs) and a few weeks later I was able to bench my own weight (150 lbs). It was fun seeing progress. We kept up the routine and after 6-8 months I was seeing physical changes in my body (noticeably, less fat and more muscle).</p>
<p>I don’t have words to describe how bizarre this was to me. For whatever reason, I’ve been basically the same size and weight since 2008. Even when I trained for marathons or biked daily to work, I looked basically the same. That’s just how it was.</p>
<p>But apparently not anymore! I started to wonder what kind of changes I could see if I took this seriously. Could I get totally ripped? Is a six-pack possible? How much could I bench if I kept going?</p>
<p>These were foreign thoughts to me. In the past, I’ve considered weightlifting to be something of a vanity sport. Good for people who enjoy it but a waste of time for me. But after some lengthy internal debate<sup>*</sup>, I decided to go for it. I set a goal to bench 200 lbs by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>And just two weeks ago, I did it. One good rep at 200 lbs. It felt amazing!</p>
<p>So now what? Do I keep going?</p>
<p>At this point, I’ve decided “no.” Getting to 200 took a lot of effort and attention that I want to direct elsewhere.</p>
<p>But before I move on entirely, I wanted to capture a few lessons from the experience (mostly for my future self, should he want to try something like this again):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be patient.</strong> This is the most important one. You can’t go into each workout expecting to lift more than the last one. Things take time, and if you aren’t patient, you make stupid mistakes (like going too hard without a spotter). I backslid a lot because of vacations, donating blood, and unrelated health issues; instead of getting frustrated, I learned to say “it’s ok, I’m not in a hurry.” Patience is so important that I don’t recommend setting weightlifting goals with a deadline. Make goals like “lift twice a week and work towards benching 200 lbs” instead of “bench 200 lbs by December 31st.”</li>
<li><strong>When you get stuck, try something new.</strong> It’s common to hit a plateau. My max sat at 185 lbs for over four months before I was able to get past it. When that happens, try something new. Try variations on your exercises, session length, and frequency. Change how you eat, breathe, rest, and recover. And if you don’t know what to do, learn techniques from books, websites, and podcasts.</li>
<li><strong>Get plenty of sleep.</strong> I never got a new max on a day that I slept poorly. Sleep seemed to correlate to “a good day” more than anything else I could do (drinking water, eating protein, visualization, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>I still plan to go to the weight room, but more for fun and general fitness. Maybe I’ll get into squats or pull-ups or something else. There’s a lot of interesting ways to stay active.</p>

<p><small>* I ended up journaling my internal debate, so I might as well include it here for the curious. Maybe it will resonate with someone (unlikely—my wife says “nobody thinks like this”).</small></p>
