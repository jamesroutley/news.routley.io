      # I blog by writing directly for the web browers

      The blog you&#39;re reading is written directly for the web browsers. no extra build step.

      The blog have many reincarnations, the longest lived one is based on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

      However, even a static site generator will deprecate some features one day. and my words need to follow the convention of that static site generator.

      And one day, the blog is broken. And I don&#39;t want my blog to have a build step anymore.

      Therefore, the blog you&#39;re reading now is written directly for the browers, with [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me/) for markdown, and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting.

      Browsers are powerful today, with built-in audio and video players.

      More importantly, Browsers and HTML are never deprecated.

      And I don&#39;t have to endlessly search for a theme that fits my taste.
