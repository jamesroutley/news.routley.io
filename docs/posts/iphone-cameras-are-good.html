    <h1>iPhone cameras are good</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>
Ever wonder why you never see a smartphone photo printed and
                framed on the wall? I&#39;ll explain exactly why.
</p><p>
The photos above look similar at a glance, but there are some key
                differences that seem small but are actually very sensitive to our
                perception of humans:
</p><ul> <li>
The fish eye iPhone lens creates distortion, look at the
                        feet of the pink player. There&#39;s also distortion of the
                        players on the edges who appear to be leaning toward the
                        center in the iPhone photo.
</li> <li>
Compare the jawlines (important!) of the players. The
                        iPhone photo is much less flattering. Real cameras
                        capture shadow more accurately. An iPhone does lots of
                        computation to try to make everything well-lit, but it
                        ruins important facial features in the process.
</li> <li>
The blurred background of the right photo makes the
                        players &#34;pop&#34;. This is called bokeh. The landscape is
                        also much more accurate to human perception, again due
                        to fish-eye distortion of the iPhone camera.
</li> </ul><p>
Let&#39;s take a look at an individual player:
<img alt="Photo2" src="https://candid9.com/assets/vertical_player.jpg"/>
More things to notice:
</p><ul> <li>
in the iPhone photo, the player is &#34;leaning&#34;. His (long)
                        feet are on the left and his head is on the right of the
                        image. In the right image, the image accurately portays
                        his balanced and confident stance.
</li> <li>
The players body is much more flattering in the right
                        image. His chest and shoulders look larger compared to
                        the &#34;stumpy&#34; appearance on the left.
</li> <li>
The jawline is much more flattering in the right image.
                        The iPhone image almost entirely deletes the jawline on
                        the shaded side of his face.
</li> <li>The iPhone has a &#34;hotdog&#34; skin complexion.</li> </ul><p>
Off with their heads!
 </p></div><p>
The above photo is from a professional camera. Let&#39;s compare iPhone
            with its mighty 48 MP to a 2004 Sony Digicam with a paltry 5.1 MP on
            auto mode:
</p><div><p>
I am sure there are many more differences that I am not able to see.
            All these details might seem minor, but the human eye is incredibly
            sensitive when perceiving other humans.
</p><p>
So this is why you don&#39;t see iPhone photos framed on walls. It&#39;s also
            why top brands like The Masters never post iPhone photos.
</p><p>
Most photos are of people, but I&#39;ll add a couple more photos that
            show the distortion inflicted by iPhone cameras:
