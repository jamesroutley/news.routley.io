                This service is an accessibility-first, on‑demand renderer. It converts a single Apple Developer page to
                Markdown only when requested by a user. It does not crawl, spider, or bulk download; it does not attempt
                to bypass authentication or security; and it implements rate limiting to avoid imposing unreasonable
                load.
            </p>
            <p>
                Content is fetched transiently and may be cached briefly to improve performance (approximately 30
                minutes). No permanent archives are maintained. All copyrights and other rights in the underlying
                content remain with Apple Inc. Each page links back to the original source.
