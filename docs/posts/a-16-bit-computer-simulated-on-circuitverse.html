<p>Looks like I have quite the backlog of comments to reply (CircuitVerse should add a reply feature) to:</p>
<p>Kuro.Mp3: I really wanted to make a platformer, but unfortunately CircuitVerse right now struggles to understand the concept of holding down a button, so it would have to be an auto-runner, which would make it essentially be Flappy Bird again. I have plans to add a circuit to the codebase that can do this when I have time. Also great high score~.</p>
<p>General: Thanks for all of the comments~ I hope it is epic enough.</p>
<p>Andrei A Buo: Erm a) would be useful if you would please mention exactly which circuits you want me to look at, I don&#39;t have enough time to look through all your circuits, and b) turns out I do and I can&#39;t find much original work to rate. (Admittedly it could be a program but do you really think I&#39;m going to check every single cart on every single fork?)</p>
