    <h1>Australia to ban engineered stone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Australia has become the first country to announce a ban on engineered stone following a surge in workers developing the lung disease silicosis.</p><div><section role="contentinfo" aria-label="key points" data-component="KeyPoints" data-uri="coremedia://teaser/103225906"><h2 data-component="Heading">Key points:</h2><ul data-component="List" role="list"><li data-component="ListItem"><span></span>Engineered stone will be banned in most states and territories from July 2024</li><li data-component="ListItem"><span></span>The material can be found in thousands of Australian bathrooms and kitchens</li><li data-component="ListItem"><span></span>Doctors and workers had called for the ban over health and safety concerns</li></ul></section></div><p>Commonwealth, state, and territory workplace ministers unanimously agreed to implement a national ban on the product at a long-awaited meeting on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The ban will start on July 1, 2024 in most states and territories.</p><p>The world-first decision comes after hundreds of workers developed silicosis from working on engineered stone, a popular material mostly used for kitchen benches and bathroom vanities.</p><p>Ministers also agreed to a &#34;transition period&#34; for engineered stone contracts entered into before the ban was announced, with arrangements to be finalised at a later meeting.</p><p>The federal government will also impose a ban on imported engineered stone to provide an &#34;additional layer of enforcement and deterrence at the border&#34;, however the date has not been finalised yet.</p><p>Trade unions, health organisations and personal injury law firms have all welcomed the ban, saying it will save lives.</p><p>&#34;Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it,&#34; Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Liam O&#39;Brien said.</p><p>&#34;With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?&#34;</p><p>Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was &#34;deeply disappointed&#34; by the decision.</p><p>A spokesperson said the reasoning behind the decision was &#34;flawed&#34; and that singling out engineered stone would not eliminate the risk of silicosis in the workplace.</p><p>&#34;Most importantly, it [the decision] fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates – poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards,&#34; they said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Popular material sparked a rise in lung disease</h2><p>Engineered stone, a durable and affordable alternative to natural materials like granite and marble, exploded in popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s.</p><p>However doctors began sounding the alarm after noticing a surge in stonemasons developing silicosis, a long-term and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224334" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224334"><img alt="A shiny white and grey kitchen countertop." sizes="(max-width: 543px) 543px," srcset="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/25055c8bfd8b6518a52d2c5e164ddcfd?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=454&amp;cropW=605&amp;xPos=28&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=647 543w, https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/25055c8bfd8b6518a52d2c5e164ddcfd?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=441&amp;cropW=661&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=7&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/25055c8bfd8b6518a52d2c5e164ddcfd?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=441&amp;cropW=661&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=7&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/><div><figcaption id="103224334" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure__figcaption" aria-live="polite"> <!-- -->The industry estimates 2-3 million Australian households have engineered stone benchtops.<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text">(<span>Supplied: <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/new-kitchen-gm160046305-17827008" data-component="Link">iStock photo</a>, <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/EJ-J?mediatype=photography" data-component="Link">EJ-J</a></span>)</span></span></figcaption></div></figure><p>One of those doctors, respiratory physician Ryan Hoy, said the disease was mostly striking down young men in the prime of their work lives.</p><p>&#34;Some of these people with silicosis, they&#39;re extremely sick … we have a condition which caused them to become so short of breath it&#39;s hard to do just normal daily activities,&#34; he said.</p><p>Since the first Australian silicosis case linked to working on engineered stone was reported in 2015, hundreds more cases have emerged.</p><p>Unions joined doctors to campaign for a ban, arguing it could become the &#34;asbestos of the 2020s&#34; due to the risks it posed to workers&#39; health.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">An &#39;important win for thousands of workers&#39;</h2><p>Earlier this year workplace ministers tasked Safe Work Australia, a government WHS agency, with investigating how a ban could work and whether low-silica engineered stone could remain on the market safely.</p><p>The report found there was no safe level of silica, concluding: &#34;The use of all engineered stone should be prohibited.&#34;</p><p>The CMFEU&#39;s Zach Smith said the nationwide ban would &#34;stop the deadly scourge of silicosis in its tracks&#34;.</p><p>&#34;This is an important win for the thousands of workers that have been forced to use this product, which has caused them to contract life-ending silicosis,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;Let&#39;s be clear about this — the decision that&#39;s been made by the various levels of government today will save lives.&#34;</p><h2 data-component="Heading">&#39;From the breadwinner to nothing&#39;</h2><p>Safe Work found that while silicosis cases could emerge in several industries, the numbers were &#34;disproportionate&#34; among engineered stone workers.</p><p>Engineered stone workers also suffered a faster disease progression and were more likely to die from it, the report said.</p><p>The majority of engineered stone workers diagnosed with silicosis were under 35.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224134" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224134"><img alt="A man with brown hair lies in a hospital bed with three small children cuddling him." sizes="(max-width: 543px) 543px," srcset="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/11b60201dee4d24c5ddca567cd2c043e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=558&amp;cropW=744&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=28&amp;width=862&amp;height=647 543w, https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/11b60201dee4d24c5ddca567cd2c043e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=497&amp;cropW=745&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=33&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/11b60201dee4d24c5ddca567cd2c043e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=497&amp;cropW=745&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=33&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/><p><figcaption id="103224134" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure__figcaption" aria-live="polite"> <!-- -->Ben Harrison has three young children, and is unable to play with them without losing his breath.<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text">(<span>Supplied: Ben Harrison</span>)</span></span></figcaption></p></figure><p>Over five years of reporting, the ABC has spoken to more than a dozen stonemasons, many in their 20s or 30s with young families, whose lives have been shattered by the disease.</p><p>They have told the ABC about its devastating consequences: struggling to breathe properly, needing lung transplants and facing an early death.</p><p>Former stonemason Ben Harrison, 34, was diagnosed with silicosis four years ago and told the ABC he supported a ban.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve gone from being the breadwinner of the house … to being nothing,&#34; he said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">More details to be worked out</h2><p>Workplace ministers are due to hold another meeting in March 2024 to work out details for the transition period for engineered stone contracts that have already been implemented.</p><p>Caesarstone said a transition period of six months would not be enough time to avoid &#34;significant disruption&#34; to the construction and homebuilding industry.</p><p>&#34;A longer period [is] needed to ensure industry can meet the anticipated demand for substitute products and that fabricators with the necessary financial resources can retool and retrain employees to work on other products,&#34; a spokesperson said.</p><p>The Housing Industry Association said the ban had caused uncertainty and concern to the small businesses that supply engineered stone, adding that new machinery and alternative products would be needed.</p><p>&#34;It is critical following today&#39;s decision that governments now prepare a detailed industry transition plan that addresses these and other key matters,&#34; association managing director Jocelyn Martin said.</p><p>Dr Hoy said broader change was needed to make sure a similar crisis did not happen again.</p><p>&#34;We can&#39;t be waiting until people develop disease and they die from conditions related to work before we start acting,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;We really need to change the ways to identify problems at work, and act before people become sick.&#34;</p></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-12-13T06:20:27.000Z">20h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-12-13T06:20:27.000Z">20 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 13 Dec 2023 at 6:20am</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-12-13T10:33:06.000Z">16h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-12-13T10:33:06.000Z">16 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 13 Dec 2023 at 10:33am</time></p></div>
