<p><strong>Tuesday, January 13</strong></p>



<p>A farm in Saxony has been left with 4,000 tons of potatoes in what Berliner Morgenpost is calling “a story about the absurdities of our food system”. </p>



<p>A trader ordered the harvest but after the potatoes were harvested and stored, it became clear that the supply on the market was greater than the demand. The market price had fallen and although everything was financially settled, the potatoes remained.</p>



<p>4,000 tons is almost four million kilograms or the weight of 800 adult elephants. Stacking as high as Berlin’s TV Tower, so many potatoes could feed hundreds of thousands of people.</p>



<p>The first truckful of these potatoes, which were stored in cool, dry halls on a farm south of Leipzig, are now on their way to Berlin to be distributed for free. While Ecosia is financing the transport from Saxony to Berlin, the Berliner Morgenpost is helping to organise the free distribution.</p>



<p>The collaborative initiative plans to save the 4,000 tons of potatoes from being wasted. Registration to collect some free potatoes is now closed. </p>



<p>Today, those who registered on time will receive an email stating whether their application was accepted or rejected. If it was accepted, they will received details about the date, approximate time and information about collection. </p>



<p>However, you can still help the project. Berliner Morgenpost is looking for more places from which the potatoes can be distributed and accepting financial donations for further truckloads.
