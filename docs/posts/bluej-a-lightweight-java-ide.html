      <h3>History and Team</h3><p>
In the late nineties, Michael Kölling developed a pedagogical language and environment called Blue as part of his PhD work. BlueJ is a port of Blue to Java, and was first released in 1999. Thanks to generous support from Sun Microsystems (and more recently Oracle), BlueJ development and support has continued since then. Initially based just in Australia, the team spread to the UK and then to Denmark when Michael moved there. First the Danish team, and then the Australian team, moved to the UK where they all now work in the Computing Education Research Group at the University of Kent.  The current staff includes:
