    <h1>I bought a £16 smartwatch just because it used USB-C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
					<p>Look, I&#39;m an idiot. I know that, you know that, and the man on the moon knows that. Let&#39;s not get into <em>why</em> I&#39;m an idiot; let&#39;s just accept that I have my peculiarities and you have yours. My idiocy is a quest to make sure all my portable electronics can recharge using USB-C.</p>
					<p>Modern smartwatches are tiny and they do a lot. As a consequence, their battery life is generally poor. The industry&#39;s attempts to fix this are either to <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/why-dont-smart-watches-use-usb-c-to-recharge/">replace the charging standard every year</a> hoping to find something magical, or to lock you in to a walled-garden on proprietary nonsense.</p>
					<p>I want to recharge my watch while I&#39;m riding the bus. That means plugging one end of a USB-C cable into the seat and the other into my wrist. That&#39;s how I recharge my phone, eReader, laptop, headphones, toothbrush, and a hundred other gadgets. Why should a watch be any different?</p>
					<p>So I bought the only smartwatch I could find with a USB-C port. The <a href="https://www.colmi.info/products/colmi-p80-smartwatch">Colmi P80</a> - on offer at £16. It bills itself as &#34;The world&#39;s first type-c smart watch&#34;.</p>
					<p><a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oCwt0hW"><img alt="Product shot of a watch being recharged by USB-C." height="720" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/colmi.webp" width="720"/></a></p>
					<p>To be clear, I wasn&#39;t expecting this to be a <em>good</em> smartwatch. Anything you buy from AliExpress for the cost of a couple of pints is bound to be a bit crap. What I wanted to know is whether USB-C charging of watches is <em>viable</em>.</p>
					<p>What I discovered is that, yes, USB-C charging works even on a relatively small watch. Oh, and that this is a surprisingly decent bit of kit - especially given its price.  Let&#39;s dive in!</p>

					</h2>
					<p>It tells the time accurately!</p>
					<p>You can set it up without using the app (more on that later). It Bluetooth paired to my phone without a problem - and without PIN entry. I could make and receive calls from the watch - and the voice quality was adequate.</p>
					<p>Tilting the watch up made the display come on! I wasn&#39;t expecting that, to be honest.</p>
					<p><img alt="Smartwatch with a custom face." height="510" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/meter-watchface.webp" width="680"/></p><p>The jog-dial button works. Good for scrolling and clicking.</p>
					<p>Swiping on the screen to navigate works with pretty good accuracy.</p>
					<p>Vibration notifications were strong enough to be noticeable.</p>
					<p>There were a bunch of simple games and apps on there - including 2048 - which all ran fine.</p>
					<p>The built in torch (!) was bright and useful.</p>
					<p>And, yes, it charged via USB-C!</p>
					<h2 id="charging-speed-and-battery-life">
						<a href="#charging-speed-and-battery-life">Charging Speed and Battery Life</a>
					</h2>
					<p>It claims a 0-100 in 90 minutes which seemed broadly accurate.</p>
					<p><img alt="Charging speed of 1.5 hours." height="500" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/COLMI_P80_type-c_Smartwatch_1.webp" width="500"/></p><p>It came with a short USB-C to C lead which was charge-only, no data. I plugged it until fully charged, then wore it continuously. After 24 hours of use, even with all my fiddling, that battery was at 80%.</p>
					<p>After four days, it still had 40% left - I&#39;d been using it for exercise, sleep tracking, a couple of phone calls, and using the torch at night. After 5 days, I finally got the &#34;low battery&#34; warning when I hit 20%. I reckon, with moderate usage, you&#39;d squeeze a week out of it. Sticking the brightness up, keeping the screen on longer, and playing music through its tiny speaker are also going to drag the battery life down.</p>
					<p>My <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/gadget-review-plugable-usb-c-voltage-amperage-meter-240w/">USB-C Power Meter</a> said it charged at 5V .16A, that&#39;s around 0.8W. Slow, but it only has a small 280mAh battery. Bluetooth Low Energy is, unsurprisingly, pretty energy efficient! Heart monitoring and motion detection is also a low-power activity. There&#39;s no power-guzzling GPS or cellular connection - so the power requirements are pretty modest.</p>
					<p>The rubber flap keeps the port safe, although does feel a little flimsy. If you have a chunky cable, it might interfere with the cover a little.</p>
					<h3 id="power-delivery">
						<a href="#power-delivery">Power Delivery</a>
					</h3>
					<p>This does <em>not</em> work with PD chargers. If you plug this in to the same power-brick as your laptop, it will not charge. Based on the three that I tried, PD chargers will not negotiate down to 1W levels.</p>
					<p>If you have a charging <em>adapter</em> with multiple outputs, the regular USB-C ones will charge this just fine. All the USB-A to C chargers worked fine.</p>
					
					
					<h2 id="heart-monitoring">
						<a href="#heart-monitoring">Heart Monitoring</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Much like <a href="https://neilzone.co.uk/2025/06/initial-thoughts-on-a-18-colmi-r09-smart-ring-and-gadgetbridge/#i-have-not-benchmarked-accuracy">my friend Neil and his smartring from the same manufacturer</a>, I&#39;ve not benchmarked the accuracy of the heart-rate monitoring. When I exercise, it goes up. When I relax, it goes down.</p>
					<p>It pegged my resting heart rate at about 65BPM, which in line with other devices. While <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/08/review-egofit-walker-pro-an-under-desk-treadmill/">walking on my treadmill</a>, it went up to 100.</p>
					<p>My SpO<sub>2</sub> was measured as 99% which, again, was as expected. I held my breath for as long as possible and it dropped to 95%.</p>
					<p>Within the app, you can set a &#34;Heart Rate Warning&#34; and various other detection settings.</p>
					<h2 id="sleep-monitoring">
						<a href="#sleep-monitoring">Sleep Monitoring</a>
					</h2>
					<p>I wore it at night. There&#39;s a &#34;sleep mode&#34; setting which stops the screen coming on, but you have to dive into a sub-menu to turn it on.</p>
					<p>The watch showed this reasonably accurate screen:</p>
					<p><img alt="Graph of coloured lines showing sleep state." height="800" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sleep1.webp" width="800"/></p><p>The data are also sent to the app:</p>
					<p><img alt="In app screenshot with a complex graph." height="1122" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sleep-app.webp" width="504"/></p><h2 id="whats-annoying">
						<a href="#whats-annoying">What&#39;s Annoying?</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Given that this is a £16 watch, it hasn&#39;t exactly been &#34;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/11/designed-by-apple-in-california-chronicles-20-years-of-apple-design/">Designed by Apple in California</a>&#34;.  There are limitations and weird little niggles but, surprisingly, not too many.</p>
					<p>First up, the brains of the watch is the <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/JieLiTech-JL7012F6/C7434396">JL7012</a> - which is a deliberately underpowered chip.  It can do Bluetooth comms and drives the screen reasonably well. You&#39;re not going to be flinging billions of pixels around in 3D. The animation of all the interactions is a little jerky - obviously not 60FPS but just slow enough to be slightly annoying.</p>
					<p>You can&#39;t tap the screen to turn it on; you have to click the side button or rotate your wrist. The raise to wake works, but takes a second or two to register. Weirdly, the scroll wheel works in <em>most</em> UI elements, but it doesn&#39;t for changing dates and times - so it is a bit of a slog to manually scroll through them on screen.</p>
					<p>There <a href="https://www.colmi.info/pages/colmi-user-manual">no online manual available</a>. All the other Colmi products have a manual available. Similarly, there&#39;s no firmware updates listed - although the app does claim to be able to update the firmware.</p>
					<p>The USB-C port is for charging only - you can&#39;t get data off it via cable. You cannot use the watch while charging - once plugged in it will show a few messages about keeping the device clean. If you set it to use &#34;nightstand&#34; mode, plugging in will show the time and battery level - but you can&#39;t interact with any of the functions.</p>
					<p>Directions - no maps, GPS, or even a basic compass. You cannot add any apps to this - what you get is what you get.</p>
					<p>Connectivity - Bluetooth only. No WiFi and no cellular. This can&#39;t make emergency calls unless you&#39;re connected to Bluetooth.</p>
					<p>Multiple alarms can be set - but you can&#39;t choose their ringtone.</p>
					<p>You can add some &#34;favourites&#34; to the main screen, swipe across to get them. Sadly the options are pretty limited. For example, you can&#39;t put alarms or the calculator there. For those, you&#39;ve got to dive into the main menu.</p>
					<p>The screen brightness is manually controlled - no clever adaptive technology here. It can go bright enough to see in the blazing sunshine, although the dimmest setting is still a bit bright for night use.</p>
					<p>There&#39;s no NFC - so you can&#39;t use this to pay for things. You can&#39;t even use it as an NFC business card - although you can send it QR codes to display, which is a handy alternative.</p>
					<p>All that might sound bad but please remember that this is <strong>a sub £20 watch</strong>; it isn&#39;t competing with something costing ten times as much. The fact that it does all these things at all is pretty impressive!</p>
					<p>Some of the functionality isn&#39;t available unless you pair it with the supplied app.</p>
					<h2 id="app">
						<a href="#app">App</a>
					</h2>
					<p>It is a given that all hardware apps are fundamentally a bit rubbish. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crrepa.band.colmi_fit">Colmi Fit app</a> is basically fine. It isn&#39;t <em>very</em> polished but does everything it needs to do. You can get away without using the app completely for most things.</p>
					<p><img alt="Permissions request screen with poorly formatted text." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/permissions.webp" width="504"/></p><p>If you want updated weather, stocks, or prayer times - you&#39;ll need it to be paired to the app. Annoyingly, things like world clock also need a connection to be set up. Similarly, things like menstrual tracking need a connection (although, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61952794">please note the privacy implications</a>).</p>
					<p><img alt="Period tracking settings." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/period.webp" width="504"/></p><p>Annoyingly, despite it being basic Bluetooth functionality, music controls don&#39;t work without the app nor does the ability to show contact information.</p>
					<p>Notifications other than calls also require the app. You&#39;ll need to give it permission to read all your notifications, but you can set it only to forward ones from specific apps. I didn&#39;t bother to set that up.</p>
					<p><img alt="Notifications settings for individual apps." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Notifications.webp" width="504"/></p><p>There are several built-in watch faces which can be changed by rolling the knob. Only one of the built-in faces is customisable:</p>
					<p><img alt="A watch face which lets you change the background image and position of the text." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Custom-watch-face.webp" width="504"/></p><p>What surprised me was just how many watch faces were available to download:</p>
					<p><img alt="Long list of watch faces." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/face-gallery.webp" width="504"/></p><p>Sadly, I don&#39;t think it is possible to add your own designs, and none of them let you fiddle with what&#39;s displayed.</p>
					<p>Many of the settings - like how long the screen should stay on for - are only available in the app. Even thought the app can get your location, you have to manually tell it what city you&#39;re in for an accurate weather forecast.</p>
					<p>There were a few things I couldn&#39;t get working. The &#34;AI Voice Assistant&#34; is, I assume, just streaming audio back to your phone. As I don&#39;t have an assistant app, it didn&#39;t do anything. I&#39;m not a Muslim, so I can&#39;t tell if the prayer times are accurate. The stress monitoring is a bit opaque - I don&#39;t know what precisely it measures. I don&#39;t have a menstrual cycle for it to track. I didn&#39;t investigate the SOS settings either:</p>
					<p><img alt="SOS settings to trigger an alert." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sos.webp" width="504"/></p><p>Oh, and you can also tell it to remind you to drink water.</p>
					<p><img alt="Water intake settings." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/water-intake.webp" width="504"/></p><p>Finally, the app will show a notification showing your goals.</p>
					<p><img alt="Permanent notification showing step goal." src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/notification.webp" width="504"/></p><p>The app works well even if you deny it all the permissions it asks for but, obviously, some bits won&#39;t work unless they have access to your phone book, location, gallery, etc. You can always uninstall the app once done setting it up.</p>
					<h2 id="exercise-mode">
						<a href="#exercise-mode">Exercise Mode</a>
					</h2>
					<p>There are a bunch of different exercise modes on the watch - I&#39;m not sporty enough to tell you what the difference is between all of them.</p>
					<p>The app has some basic fitness stuff and will track your jogging locations.</p>
					<p>Buried in the watch menu are your historic stats, but you&#39;ll need the app to export them.</p>
					<p>Step detection is, like most watches, based on arm-swinging. So it wasn&#39;t terribly accurate when I was on my <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/08/review-egofit-walker-pro-an-under-desk-treadmill/">standing desk treadmill</a>, but was acceptably accurate when going outside. It showed roughly the same amount of steps as the Pixel Watch 3.</p>
					<p>You have to manually activate exercise mode if you want to quickly look up your heart-rate, steps, times, etc.</p>
					<h2 id="instruction-manual">
						<a href="#instruction-manual">Instruction Manual</a>

					<p>The leaflet in the box is the standard multi-lingual affair. Here&#39;s a quick scan of the English version. That&#39;ll show you some of what this watch is capable of.</p>
					<p><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scanned-Instructions-Lossy.webp"><img alt="Instructions for the watch." height="1539" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scanned-Instructions-Lossy.webp" width="2469"/></a></p>
					<h2 id="other-interesting-features">
						<a href="#other-interesting-features">Other Interesting Features</a>

					<p>I got the cheapest strap possible - but it looks like it uses standard fittings if you want something more luxurious.</p>
					<p>The 240x296 screen is bright and colourful - a basic screen protector is included in the box.</p>
					<p>There&#39;s a built in LED which acts as a torch - which is only useful if you wear it on the left wrist.</p>
					<p>The &#34;Flappy Bird&#34; clone is a bit crap, but 2048 and space invaders are reasonable time-wasters.</p>
					<p>There&#39;s a camera shutter app if you want to use it as a remote control.</p>
					<p>It <em>claims</em> to be IP67 waterproof, but warns not to immerse it in water or use it in steamy environments. It seemed to be splash resistant, but I didn&#39;t take it swimming or showering.</p>
					<h2 id="security">
						<a href="#security">Security</a>
					</h2>
					<p>There is none. There&#39;s no password lock on the screen and there&#39;s no Bluetooth PIN.</p>
					<p>To be fair, there&#39;s nothing much you can do with the watch if you stole it. OK, you could make some phone calls if you were within range and get people&#39;s contact details. But there&#39;s no payment information stored. A thief might get your exercise and menstrual data, but it isn&#39;t a treasure trove of information.</p>
					<p>Once it is paired to your device, it doesn&#39;t advertise itself via Bluetooth. If it is disconnected, it only broadcasts its availability when the screen is on. There&#39;s no pairing PIN.</p>
					<h2 id="oem">
						<a href="#oem">OEM</a>
					</h2>
					<p>The manufacturer appears to be <a href="http://moyoung.com/">Mo Young</a> - they make the watch and the app.</p>
					<p><a href="http://moyoung.com/en/solution/watch"><img alt="Diagram of a watch." height="528" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/custome-watch.webp" width="1172"/></a></p>
					<p>They have <a href="http://moyoung.com/en/solution/watch">some detail about the watch platform</a> but not much.</p>
					<h2 id="open-source-and-gadgetbridge">
						<a href="#open-source-and-gadgetbridge">Open Source and GadgetBridge</a>

					<p>The device uses the MOYOUNG-V2 protocol.  I was able to pair it with <a href="https://gadgetbridge.org/">GadgetBridge</a> by pretending it was a Colmi V79. Most of the functionality worked - I was able to see heart rate, steps, change some settings etc. I&#39;ve <a href="https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/issues/5193">requested GadgetBridge support</a> which should make it possible to get notifications etc.</p>
					<p><ins datetime="2025-08-06T20:31:54+00:00">Update!

					<p>There are a few open source apps to <a href="https://github.com/VicGuy/DaFbc">create new watch faces</a> and then <a href="https://github.com/VicGuy/DaFup">upload watch faces</a> to the device. But I wasn&#39;t able to get them working.</p>

					<p>My last smartwatch was the <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/06/review-watchy-an-eink-watch-full-of-interesting-compromises/">fairly crappy eInk Watchy</a> which recharged with micro-USB, I only used it for a few weeks before getting bored of it.  The last time I seriously tried to use a smart watch <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/07/smart-watch-wearable-technology-failure/">was a decade ago and I hated it</a>.</p>
					<p>Perhaps I&#39;m just not a watch person? This is a cheap and useful way to get started. After a few days of use, I&#39;m beginning to get used to it. It&#39;ll be more useful once I configure the notifications I get, I suspect.</p>

					<p>That&#39;s up to you, champ. I&#39;m not your real dad and I&#39;m not trying to take his place. But I&#39;m here for you if you need me.</p>
					<p>Anyway, <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/why-dont-smart-watches-use-usb-c-to-recharge/">as discussed in a previous post</a>, this little device shows that it <em>is</em> possible to make a smartwatch that uses USB-C.  It isn&#39;t the most powerful or customisable watch. It can&#39;t compete with a £200+ Apple or Android watch - but it is surprisingly capable.</p>
