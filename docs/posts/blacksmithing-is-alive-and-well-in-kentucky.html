Not according to <a href="https://www.craigkaviarforge.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Craig Kaviar</a>, a prominent practitioner of the craft who is based in Louisville, Ky. If anything, he said, “there’s been a revival.”</p><p>The industrial revolution rendered a lot of traditional blacksmith work — making hammers, nails, axes, shovels and more — obsolete. But blacksmiths like Mr. Kaviar, 69, have found success creating so-called “functional art.” Mr. Kaviar, for instance, is regionally known for making handrails forged with leaves and birds that have a rough-hewed, borderline macabre design evocative of the work of sculptors like Louise Bourgeois.</p></div></div><div><p>He recently completed a sprawling, three-part archway for the local Crab Orchard Animal Sanctuary with almost Tim Burton-esque details. Mr. Kaviar said he had taken “the criteria the owner had” and had then made the work his own, adding horses, trees, a giraffe and more to a sign denoting the sanctuary’s name.</p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/03/multimedia/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/03/multimedia/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/03/multimedia/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk/22artofcraft-blacksmith-06-lcwk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A bearded man in a yellow T-shirt and a blue apron sits, looking at the camera.

But it’s in Louisville where his work is most prominent.</p><p>And, in his telling, the craft is only growing in the area. “When I came to Louisville, there was no one doing it,” he said. “Now there are several other people around doing it as well. It’s a fine craft.”</p><p>Mr. Kaviar also works with Guns to Gardens, a group that repurposes voluntarily surrendered guns into garden tools. His role is straightforward: “I take the barrel and I punch a hole in the center. And then on one end, I flatten it.”</p></div></div><div><p>Mr. Kaviar said he would continue to work so long as his body could handle it. He’s typically in the shop from 9 a.m. to 6 or 7 p.m. “I fear that if I give it up, I’ll sit around watching TV too much,” he said. “It helps keep me in shape.”</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/22/autossell/Blacksmith-blowtorch-video-cover/Blacksmith-blowtorch-video-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/05/16/108704_1_22artofcraft-blacksmith-blowtorch_wg_360p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>“I love using the tools and the feel of the metal,” he said. “When you’re hammering hot metal, the metal has a different feel, and different heat.
