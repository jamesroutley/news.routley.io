Scratch that, a lot of critics keeps talking about how YIMBYs, industrial policy wonks, and the rest don’t have a clue how to finance their proposals (despite the mountain of literature saying otherwise).

There is roughly $6 trillion of it, sitting in American public pension funds, currently being allocated in a way that serves nobody.</p><p><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/19668611-oren-cass?utm_source=mentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-attrs="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Oren Cass&#34;,&#34;id&#34;:19668611,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;user&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:null,&#34;photo_url&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9afce891-e251-4da4-b20d-1c52f1b88d90_2403x2415.jpeg&#34;,&#34;uuid&#34;:&#34;bbce69b3-441e-4d71-a074-7581ccb4617f&#34;}" data-component-name="MentionUser">Oren Cass</a></span><span>’s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/opinion/capitalism-industry-financialization.html" rel="">recent New York Times column</a><span> describes an American financial sector that has stopped fueling the real economy and started consuming it. </span><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/559294-dean-baker?utm_source=mentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-attrs="{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Dean Baker&#34;,&#34;id&#34;:559294,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;user&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:null,&#34;photo_url&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6a6e430-c307-4993-83dd-fb8d75cac7ad_144x144.png&#34;,&#34;uuid&#34;:&#34;1932ba24-e6d7-4374-88f0-79da1e1cc83b&#34;}" data-component-name="MentionUser">Dean Baker</a></span><span>, writing at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, </span><a href="https://cepr.net/publications/oren-cass-uses-good-economics-in-attacking-finance-in-nyt/" rel="">endorsed Cass’s diagnosis</a><span> and added a complementary set of regulatory reform proposals.

Mozambique’s per capita growth fell from 5.2% to 0.3%, Zambia from 3.5% to 0.3%.</span></p><p>If you look at the profession as a whole, you see a lot of economists pointing at this gap for decades. They are routinely sidelined in favor of voices whose concern for market discipline ends where Wall Street’s balance sheet begins.</p><p><em><strong>Where I’m going with this</strong></em></p><p>I’m taking Cass’s and Baker’s arguments in a more “developmental state” direction, with pensions being the biggest target. Three claims:</p><p><span>First, the capital that energy, infrastructure, and housing buildouts need already exists: </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2024-annual-survey-public-pensions.html" rel="">$6 trillion in public pension funds</a><span>, with liability profiles that match 30-year transmission lines and 40-year nuclear plants almost perfectly.</span></p><p>Second, that capital is trapped in an institutional arrangement that charges enormous fees to match the performance of a simple index fund, while the money deployed through these intermediaries actively harms the communities pensioners live in: buying up their housing, closing their hospitals, bankrupting their local employers, gutting their newspapers.</p><p>Third, redirecting this capital doesn’t require new government spending or new financial structures. It requires breaking the equilibrium that one side of the debate defends (Summers) in favor of the other (Baker, or further still, the developmental-state economists in China, Singapore, and Japan). And it requires conditioning any future public rescues on actual structural reform.</p><p>We want to start with the data, because the data are damning.</p><p><span>The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran a straightforward comparison: how did actual public pension returns stack up against a simple 60/40 portfolio of stock and bond index funds, the kind any individual investor could assemble in a Vanguard account for nearly zero cost? </span><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/how-do-public-pension-plan-returns-compare-to-simple-index-investing/" rel="">The answer: roughly the same. Public pensions earned about 6.1% annually. The 60/40 benchmark earned about 6.1% annually.</a><span> The entire apparatus of consultants and alternative managers produced no excess return.</span></p><p><span>It gets worse. Pensions performed better than the benchmark before the 2008 financial crisis and worse afterward, precisely as they ramped up allocations to hedge funds, private equity, and other “alternatives.” </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/endowments-in-the-casino-even-the-whales-lose-at-the-alts-table" rel="">Richard Ennis has documented a negative alpha of approximately 1.2% per year since 2008</a><span>, virtually all of it associated with alternative investments. Reason Foundation found that 84% of public pension funds failed to beat a passive 60/40 portfolio over the past 20 years. The median plan trails the benchmark by 1-2% annually over 15- and 20-year horizons.</span></p><p>Cass documents the same pattern from the other end of the transaction: private equity is now underperforming a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund across three-month, one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year horizons.</p><p>The fee structures explain why. For a large pension fund with 30-40% in alternatives, total portfolio costs exceed 1% annually, versus roughly 5 basis points for an indexed strategy. The most expensive slice is private equity, where Ennis estimates total costs of 6%+ annually. On $6 trillion in assets, 1% is $60 billion per year. Over a decade, half a trillion dollars. Over 30 years, more than a trillion.</p><p>CalPERS, the nation’s largest public pension, exited hedge funds in 2014, citing “high costs and weak performance.” Their hedge fund portfolio had generated 4.8% annually over a decade, trailing the hedge fund industry’s own benchmark by roughly a fifth. Then, by 2024, CalPERS announced plans to increase private market investments by $30 billion. The cycle repeats because nothing about the incentive structure has changed.</p><p>The tens of billions in annual fee waste is actually the smaller problem.</p><p>The larger problem is what pension capital is and what it’s being used for. Pension capital is money that will not be needed for 20 to 40 years. By its nature, it is the most patient capital in the American economy, longer in duration than venture capital (5-7 year exit targets), longer than private equity (similar horizon despite the “long-term” branding). Pension funds should be the natural financiers of the long-duration assets this publication covers: transmission lines, nuclear plants, housing bonds, grid infrastructure.</p><p>Instead, pension funds hand their capital to intermediaries who invest it on shorter time horizons and charge 6% annually. The assets that need patient capital, grid, nuclear, housing, defense-industrial capacity, can’t find it. And the intermediaries collect fees regardless.</p><p>We’ve solved this kind of problem before.</p><p>What we are describing is not novel. It is approximately what American public pensions did for four decades before the alternatives revolution.</p><p><span>From roughly 1920 to 1960, legal restrictions confined pension investments to government securities, primarily municipal and state bonds. Michael Glass and Sean Vanatta call this </span><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/798740/figure/fig03" rel="">“fiscal mutualism.”</a><span> At the system’s peak in 1942, public pension portfolios held 73% of their assets in state and local bonds. New York Comptroller Morris Tremaine invested pension funds in municipal bonds explicitly “to assist local governments in procuring funds for improvements at fair interest rates.” The bonds paid market rates. This was not a subsidy. But the closed loop aligned the interests of pensioners, taxpayers, and local governments in a way the current system does not. A retired firefighter’s savings backed the fire station. There were essentially no intermediary fees.</span></p><p><span>The mechanism generated what Glass and Vanatta describe as a </span><a href="https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/222115/" rel="">“virtuous cycle.”</a><span> Public employees contributed wages to the pension fund. The fund bought municipal and school district bonds. The captive demand suppressed borrowing costs, allowing localities to build schools, roads, and sewers at favorable rates. That infrastructure supported community growth, which expanded the tax base and the number of public employees, which increased contributions to the pension fund. Nobody got rich intermediating the transaction, which is why nobody has an incentive to bring it back.</span></p><p><span>The system started to strain in the 1940s when municipal bond yields fell to around 1.2%, roughly 41% of corporate bond returns, and broke open in the 1960s when states adopted the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudent_man_rule" rel="">“prudent man rule”</a><span> allowing pension funds to invest in corporate equities. That first shift, from municipal bonds to corporate stocks, was defensible. Equities offered higher long-term returns, and pensioners deserved the benefit. The adoption of the prudent man rule by states and its role in transforming public pension investment is documented in detail by </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00346764.2023.2270458" rel="">Vanatta</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second shift was not. Starting in the 1980s and accelerating after 2000, pensions piled into hedge funds, private equity, and other alternatives that promised superior returns through sophisticated strategies. By 2021, alternatives constituted </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4940886" rel="">nearly 40% of pension risk allocations</a><span>. Two decades of data now show this shift was a pure loss: same returns, </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/have-alternative-investments-helped-or-hurt" rel="">vastly higher fees</a><span>, and no benefit to the communities whose workers the funds are supposed to serve. The virtuous cycle was replaced by an extractive one. Pension contributions flow to consultants, who recommend alternative managers, who charge </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/the-endowment-syndrome-why-elite-funds-are-falling-behind" rel="">6% in fees</a><span> and deliver </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/how-hidden-costs-undermine-public-pensions-in-the-us" rel="">index-matching returns</a><span>. Meanwhile the communities that employ the pensioners struggle to finance basic infrastructure.</span></p><p>We are not arguing for a return to 1942. We are arguing that some version of the closed loop should replace the current arrangement.</p><p>Japan and China both built their own versions of fiscal mutualism at national scale.</p><p><span>Japan ran the </span><a href="https://www.mof.go.jp/english/policy/filp/index.html" rel="">Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP)</a><span> from the postwar period through 2001, channeling postal savings and pension reserves through the Ministry of Finance into infrastructure and public housing.

The move into expensive alternatives added cost without adding return. The Japanese failure was political capture of capital allocation. The American failure is intermediary capture, which may be even </span><em>worse</em><span>. Both are real risks, and any reform must guard against both.</span></p><p><span>But here is what Japan got right that America is getting wrong. As of December 2024, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_Japan" rel="">88.1% of Japanese government debt is held domestically. The Bank of Japan holds 46.3%, domestic insurance companies 15.6%, domestic banks 14.5%. Foreign investors hold only about 12%</a><span>. Japanese households save at high rates, deposit into banks and insurance companies, and those institutions buy Japanese government bonds because their liabilities are also yen-denominated. The government uses the proceeds for spending and debt service. Even after the formal FILP reforms in 2001, the structural logic persists through this market-mediated channel.

Japan’s central bank is running a profitable equity long book funded by money creation, its finance ministry is running a leveraged carry trade in foreign currencies, and its pension fund is compounding returns at minimal cost. The “sovereign wealth fund with borrowed money” is not a metaphor. It is a description of actual positions totaling several trillion dollars.</span></p><p><span>This is why the gross debt number is misleading in isolation. When you consolidate the entire public sector balance sheet (the Bank of Japan’s equity holdings, the foreign exchange reserves, GPIF, the public financial institutions) Japan’s net public sector liability had </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7d3f20c-b303-4f6c-b4a0-8ee8906ae155" rel="">fallen to roughly 65 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2025</a><span>. When the St. Louis Fed researchers ran the same calculation for the United States in 2022, America’s net public sector liability was 119 percent of GDP, nearly double Japan’s current figure, despite America’s gross debt being barely half of Japan’s in GDP terms. The country that looks fiscally reckless on the headline number is in better net shape than the country that looks responsible, because Japan kept its savings at home and earned a spread on them while America scattered its capital across fee-extracting intermediaries.</span></p><p><span>Japan is not the only country running this playbook. </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/government-debt-to-gdp" rel="">Singapore carries gross debt of 173% of GDP</a><span>, higher than the United States, but has </span><a href="https://www.agd.gov.sg/files/overview_of_singapore_government_borrowings_2025.pdf" rel="">no net debt</a><span>. Its sovereign wealth funds, GIC and Temasek, together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore manage assets estimated at </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">three to four times GDP</a><span>.

Singapore’s constitution </span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/how-singapore-manages-its-reserves" rel="">bars the government from borrowing to spend</a><span>; instead it allows spending up to half of expected long-term real returns on the reserves. As OMFIF put it: </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">“Singapore has employed borrowing not to meet current expenses or to fund a deficit, but to build a strong balance sheet.”</a><span> The crude debt-to-GDP metric that dominates American fiscal debate would rank Singapore as more indebted than the United States. In reality it is one of the wealthiest sovereigns on earth.</span></p><p>The principle is the same in both cases. The domestic holding base is the load-bearing wall of fiscal stability; the direct product of keeping capital circulating inside the national economy rather than handing it to intermediaries who scatter it across global alternative assets. The St. Louis Fed researchers note that Japan’s ability to sustain this depends on “stable and low funding costs from bondholders,” meaning the domestic savings channel must hold. If domestic institutions stop buying JGBs, the spread collapses and the sovereign wealth fund logic unravels. America cannot copy Japan’s solution or Singapore’s. But the underlying principle is clear: a nation that keeps its savings circulating domestically earns the fiscal room to maneuver that a nation dependent on foreign creditors and fee-extracting intermediaries does not.</p><p><span>China built a similar engine through the </span><a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/27bjsstsqxhkmh1v3kzkt/banking/making-sense-of-belt-and-road-the-chinese-policy-bank-china-development-bank/" rel="">China Development Bank</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_financing_vehicle" rel="">Local Government Financing Vehicles</a><span>, routing household deposits into infrastructure at massive scale.

Municipal Utility Districts are special districts that issue tax-exempt bonds to finance water, sewer, drainage, and road infrastructure for new developments. MUD bonds are self-liquidating (homeowners pay them off through property taxes over 20-30 years), asset-backed, transparent, and regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. They have financed major projects like The Woodlands, Clear Lake City, and First Colony. Pension funds holding MUD bonds instead of hedge fund LP interests would earn comparable returns while financing actual housing and infrastructure.</p><p>The question is why New York’s ETI allocation is 2% instead of 15%.

His conclusion: “New transmission capacity must be heavily subsidized.”</span></p><p>He’s right, and we need to go further with providing cheaper capital. Transmission lines are 30-50 year assets with regulated, predictable cash flows. They don’t need charity, they need patient buyers for the debt that finances them. The natural buyers are pension funds, whose 30+ year liability profiles match transmission asset durations almost perfectly. The reason pension funds aren’t buying is that their capital is tied up in alternative strategies with 5-7 year horizons, paying 6% in annual fees to roughly match a bond index.</p><p>Pension funds currently hold around $2 trillion in the bond side of their portfolios. Most of that is in corporate bonds, complex fixed-income strategies, and private credit funds charging 2-and-20. If even a quarter of that allocation shifted to municipal and infrastructure bonds, including bonds financing grid transmission, that would create roughly $500 billion in captive demand for infrastructure debt. That would lower the cost of financing transmission buildout. Not through subsidies. Through a large, natural buyer entering the market for the assets its liability structure already demands.</p><p>Parlmer estimates that solving the location problem might be part of a greater-than-$1 trillion project. The pension system’s bond allocation alone could absorb a significant fraction of that financing need, if it weren’t locked up in hedge fund LP interests.</p><p>China has roughly 30 reactors under construction, financed in significant part through state-mobilized patient capital channeled via the China Development Bank.

The LPO is a critical tool, providing federal debt for projects that private lenders consider too large or technically complex. But nuclear projects also need long-term equity commitments and project finance bonds that match their 40-60 year operational life. A nuclear plant with a power purchase agreement is essentially an infrastructure bond: predictable cash flows over a multi-decade horizon, backed by a regulated revenue stream. Pension funds should be natural participants in that capital stack.</span></p><p>Parlmer has floated the idea of state-backed reactor fleets, either DoD or DoE operated, because he can’t see another path to rapid deployment. Pension-backed project finance isn’t state ownership, but it could serve a similar de-risking function. A pension fund investing in a nuclear project finance bond backed by a DoD power purchase agreement would face lower risk than most of what is currently in pension alternative allocations, and would fund something that matters.</p><p><span>Parlmer’s analysis of Chinese industrial automation is alarming: </span><a href="https://mattparlmer.substack.com/p/blitzrobotik" rel="">PRC added more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/china-now-has-more-factory-robots-than-the-rest-of-the-world-combined/" rel="">quintupled its per-worker robot count since 2017</a><span>, and is pulling ahead of the United States in industrial sophistication. His prescription: dollars flowing into industrial automation at more than ten times current levels, with subsidies directed to startups rather than legacy firms.</span></p><p>Pension funds already allocate significant capital to venture through their alternatives sleeve, but that money flows overwhelmingly to Sequoia and Andreessen, not to defense tech or industrial automation startups in Ohio or Texas. The geographic and sectoral concentration of pension-funded VC mirrors the broader venture ecosystem’s biases: software over hardware, Bay Area over everywhere else, consumer over defense.</p><p><span>Redirecting even a fraction of pension VC allocation toward regional defense and industrial venture vehicles wouldn’t require new government spending. It would redirect existing capital flows. The </span><a href="https://www.ohioinnovationfund.com/" rel="">Ohio Innovation Fund</a><span> and similar state-level vehicles demonstrate that the institutional architecture is feasible. The returns are uncertain (this is venture, after all) but the counterfactual is not a guaranteed 12% from private equity. It’s 6% from a fund that charges 6% in fees to roughly match the S&amp;P 500.</span></p><p>We will be candid: the venture case is weaker than the infrastructure case. Pension funds are not natural venture investors, and pushing them toward VC risks the “picking winners” failure mode that destroyed Japan’s Fiscal Investment and Loan Program. But our argument is not that pensions should become venture funds. It is that the capital they currently waste on underperforming alternatives could be partially redirected toward asset classes that at least fund something strategic, and that the bar for improvement over the status quo is extraordinarily low.</p><p><span>Pension capital allocated to private equity and hedge funds does not just fail to generate excess returns.

Cerberus subsequently sold Steward’s hospital real estate to Medical Properties Trust for $1.25 billion in a sale-leaseback that saddled the hospitals with unsustainable rent obligations. All told, Cerberus and Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre </span><a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/steward-health-cares-bankruptcy-one-year-later/" rel="">extracted approximately $1.3 billion</a><span> from the system. De la Torre bought a $40 million yacht and two private jets.

Five hospitals closed. Roughly 2,400 workers lost their jobs. Nashoba Valley Medical Center, which served 115,000 residents in rural Massachusetts and received 16,000 emergency room visits annually, shut its doors.

The financial establishment is now pre-planning the next hedge fund bailout.</span></p><p><span>Now the pension side. Years of fee extraction and underperformance have left pensions deeply underfunded, </span><a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/public-pensions-are-mixing-risky-investments-unrealistic-predictions" rel="">$1.3 trillion in the hole by official accounting, or closer to $5.1 trillion using market-rate discount rates</a><span>, according to Stanford’s Joshua Rauh. That underfunding eventually triggers its own bailouts. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan included </span><a href="https://www.pbgc.gov/arp-sfa/faqs" rel="">roughly $97 billion in “special financial assistance”</a><span> for the most severely underfunded union pension plans. The single largest allocation, </span><a href="https://teamster.org/2022/12/in-victory-for-teamster-retirees-central-states-pension-fund-awarded-36-billion/" rel="">$36 billion, went to the Teamsters’ Central States Pension Fund</a><span>. That assistance has improved headline numbers: Milliman’s year-end 2024 study reports </span><a href="https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/multiemployer-pension-funding-study-year-end-2024" rel="">aggregate multiemployer funding at 97%</a><span>. But strip out the SFA grants and the aggregate drops to 89%. Eighty-five plans remain below 60% funded. And the SFA program </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47512" rel="">made no changes to multiemployer plan funding rules</a><span>, so the structural dynamics that created the underfunding are entirely intact.</span></p><p>The obvious objection to redirecting pension capital is political capture, Japan’s FILP and its bridges to nowhere. That risk is real. But Japan’s pension system, whatever FILP’s failures, is not trillions in the hole. The counterfactual is not “safe status quo vs. risky reform.” The current system already fails, already gets bailed out, and taxpayers are already on the hook.</p><p>On top what the pension funds already pay out in fees, if the federal government is going to spend $97 billion rescuing pension plans, and the Fed is going to deploy trillions backstopping the Treasury market, the obvious question is: why isn’t any of that capital building something?</p><p>A $97 billion pension rescue conditioned on not just reforms but also investing 25% of assets in domestic infrastructure bonds would have simultaneously stabilized the pensions, financed grid buildout, and created a template for redirecting patient capital toward national priorities. Instead, the money went in with no structural reform. No investment mandates, no fee caps, no requirement to stop feeding the same intermediary complex that created the underfunding. The plans that received bailout funds are free to continue allocating to the same managers whose fees helped drain them. And they will.</p><p>The institutional dynamics are a textbook captured-bureaucracy problem. Career risk provides cover through complexity: run a simple indexed portfolio and underperform in a given year, and you look unsophisticated. Run a complex alternatives-heavy portfolio and underperform, and you look like you tried your best. No one gets fired for hiring Goldman Sachs. Consultants don&#39;t get paid to recommend index funds; they get paid to recommend strategies requiring ongoing advice and manager searches. Benchmarks are gamed: pension funds construct custom benchmarks biased by 1-2% annually relative to fair passive alternatives, and private equity returns are reported with lags that smooth volatility and create the illusion of diversification. Trustees worry that directing capital toward municipal or infrastructure bonds rather than &#34;optimizing&#34; globally could be challenged as a breach of fiduciary duty, even though the &#34;safe&#34; legal path leads into strategies that have demonstrably underperformed. The cycle is self-reinforcing. CalPERS tried to break it in 2014 when they exited hedge funds. Ten years later, they were back in private markets.</p><p>The honest version of this section would list transparency mandates, fee caps, infrastructure bond requirements, and indexing mandates. We drafted it. Then we deleted it, because every item on the list requires action by the same actors who benefit from the current arrangement.</p><p>State legislators who would mandate fee transparency receive campaign contributions from the asset management industry. Pension board trustees who would cap alternatives face career risk if they simplify. The consultants who would need to recommend index funds over complex strategies are the same consultants whose business model depends on recommending complex strategies. Federal legislators who would attach conditions to bailouts just passed $97 billion with no conditions attached, because the political incentive was to deliver the money and move on.</p><p>We have spent this entire piece documenting a self-reinforcing capture loop. It would be dishonest to end it by proposing that the captured institutions reform themselves. CalPERS knew the answer in 2014. They exited hedge funds, published the rationale, took a public stand. A decade later they were back in private markets for $30 billion more, because nothing about the incentive structure had changed. If the nation’s largest and most sophisticated pension fund, with a board that understood the problem and acted on it, could not sustain the exit, a policy white paper is not going to do it.</p><p>We are describing a trap, not proposing an escape.</p><p>What will happen is another bailout. The math guarantees it. The SFA grants improved headline numbers, but strip them out and aggregate multiemployer funding drops to 89%. Eighty-five plans remain below 60% funded. The program changed no funding rules. The fee extraction continues. The underperformance compounds. At some point, probably within the next decade, a recession or market downturn will force the next round of plans into insolvency and Congress will face the same choice it faced in 2021.</p><p>That is the only moment when the political dynamics actually shift. When public money is on the table and legislators need a story to tell about why this time is different, there is a narrow window in which conditions can be attached. Not because anyone in the system wants reform, but because the politics of unconditional bailouts get worse each time. The 2021 rescue passed in a COVID relief omnibus where no one was paying attention. The next one will face more scrutiny, more anger, and a public that has watched pension-funded private equity close their hospitals and cut their neighbors’ wages.</p><p>The question is not “how do we reform pension allocation now.” It is: “when the next bailout arrives, what conditions are ready to attach?” That means having the legislative language drafted. It means having the qualifying criteria for infrastructure bonds defined (investment-grade, revenue-backed, independently certified) so that the debate is over a concrete mechanism rather than an abstract principle. It means having the fee cap number chosen and the benchmark methodology specified. It means having the sunset clause and the performance trigger designed, so that the infrastructure mandate self-destructs if it fails and cannot become a permanent slush fund.</p><p>None of that requires passing legislation today. It requires preparation for a political window that is coming whether anyone wants it or not.</p><p>The trap will not reform itself. But it will need public money again. The work between now and then is to make sure that the next time Congress writes a check to rescue a pension system bled dry by intermediary fees, the check comes with conditions that route the capital toward qualifying infrastructure debt rather than back into the same extraction loop that created the crisis. That is the difference between rescue and subsidy. It is also, realistically, the only reform that has a chance of happening.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></div>
