    <h1>Unicode Roman Numerals and Screen Readers</h1>

<p>How would you read this sentence out aloud?</p><p>&#34;In Hamlet, Act Ⅳ, Scene Ⅸ...&#34;</p><p>Most people with a grasp of the interplay between English and Latin would say &#34;In Hamlet, Act four, scene nine&#34;.  And they&#39;d be right!  But screen-readers - computer programs which convert text into speech - often get this wrong.</p><p>Why? Well, because I didn&#39;t just type &#34;Uppercase Letter i, Uppercase Letter v&#34;. Instead, I used the Unicode symbol for the Roman numeral 4 - <code>Ⅳ</code>.  And, it turns out, lots of screen-readers have a problem with those characters.</p><h2 id="dont-know-much-about-history"><a href="#dont-know-much-about-history">Don&#39;t Know Much About History</a></h2><p>Unicode contains the range of Roman numbers from 1 - 10, plus a couple of compound numbers, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 - in a variety of forms.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-04-at-00-05-15-Numerals-in-Unicode-Wikipedia.png" alt="Screenshot of a Table of Roman numerals in Unicode." width="927" height="244"/></p><p>Why does Unicode contain these number which, to most people, are just squashed together Latin letter?  As ever with Unicode, it is a mix of legacy and practicality.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch15.pdf">Unicode standard says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>
<strong>Roman Numerals.</strong> For most purposes, it is preferable to compose the Roman numerals from sequences of the appropriate Latin letters. However, the uppercase and lowercase variants of the Roman numerals through 12, plus L, C, D, and M, have been encoded for compatibility with East Asian standards. Unlike sequences of Latin letters, these symbols remain upright in vertical layout. Additionally, in certain locales, compact date formats use Roman numerals for the month, but may expect the use of a single character.</p></blockquote><p>Far be it for me to disagree with the learned authors of the spec, but I think they may have erred slightly on this one.  While it may be <em>preferable</em> to re-use Latin letters, it leads to ambiguity which can be confusing for a screen-reader.</p><h2 id="practical-examples"><a href="#practical-examples">Practical Examples</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s write out the numbers using regular letters. Suppose you were talking about &#34;Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene I&#34;.  Most screen readers will see the &#34;III&#34; and correctly speak aloud &#34;Roman three&#34; or similar. But when they get to the &#34;I&#34; it becomes ambiguous. Most will read out &#34;Eye&#34;.</p><p>Screen-readers rarely look at the whole sentence for context. Which means they get confused. It&#39;s fairly obvious that XIV should be &#34;fourteen&#34; as there&#39;s no English word &#34;xiv&#34;<sup id="fnref-45103-scrabble"><a href="#fn-45103-scrabble" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>. But what about &#34;MIX&#34; - is that 1009 or the word &#34;mix&#34;?</p><p>Anyone who has watched the BBC knows about their fondness for displaying in Latin the year a programme was made. MCMXCVI is particularly challenging for a screen-reader!</p><h2 id="testing-it"><a href="#testing-it">Testing It</a></h2><p>I took the following sample sentence - using both letters and Roman numerals.</p><blockquote><p>
Text. In Hamlet, Act I, Scene XI the year is MCMXCVI and they are watching Rocky V.</p></blockquote><p>Here&#39;s how various services coped:</p><h3 id="amazon-polly"><a href="#amazon-polly">Amazon Polly</a></h3><p>First, the good news. Amazon&#39;s Polly read the Roman numerals perfectly. It even pronounced <code>ⅯⅭⅯⅩⅭⅥ</code> as &#34;nineteen ninety six&#34;.<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->
