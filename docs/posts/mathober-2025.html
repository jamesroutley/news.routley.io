        <p>Mathober is almost here! I am looking forward to seeing everyone’s creativity and take on this year’s prompts. If you’ve never participated before, now’s the perfect time to jump in!</p><p>The goal of Mathober is simple: have fun, learn, grow, and play with the prompts. <strong>No pressure!</strong></p><p><strong>There are no rules</strong> – participate in as many prompts as you want, whenever you want.</p><p>Feel free to express yourself in any medium!</p><p>In the past, people have used ink, code, math history, comics, origami, poetry, deep dives, videos, and various forms of art. Maybe you’ll bring something new to the table, or simply enjoy spectating!</p><p>Thanks to everyone who participates – it’s such a joy to explore math together through so many different mediums. I’m always inspired by the creativity and passion you all bring!</p><p>Prompts are below and also at <a href="http://mathober.com/">http://mathober.com/</a>.

I use a random number generator to go to random entries. I then take parts or the whole entry for the list. If I draw an item that is associated with a person&#39;s name, I try to find another name to call it by. Sometimes I keep it anyway, sometimes I draw another – that is the game of curation. Sometimes I throw out ones that are too similar to others or previous years. </p><p>Every year, I have no idea what many of these are until I go to doodle them – that is part of the fun. If you would like to make sure that certain concepts are included, please contact me, and I will add them if they are not. </p>
