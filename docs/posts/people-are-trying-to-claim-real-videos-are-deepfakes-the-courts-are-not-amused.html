        <p>In 2016, Elon Musk went on stage at a tech conference outside Los Angeles and made a bold statement about the self-driving capability of Teslas.</p><p>&#34;A Model S and Model X at this point can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person. Right now,&#34; the CEO told the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11840936/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-mars-full-video-code">Code Conference</a> audience during a Q&amp;A session following his interview with tech journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher.</p>

The Court is unwilling to set such a precedent by condoning Tesla&#39;s approach here.&#34;</p><p>The Tesla lawsuit is not the first time deepfakes have been invoked in an attempt to rebut evidence — and likely won&#39;t be the last.</p>

AI</a></p><hr/><p>While the threat that deepfakes could be offered as evidence is real, she said, &#34;the courts have built up hundreds of years of resilience against efforts to introduce fake or tampered with evidence, going all the way back to faking somebody&#39;s signature on a handwritten document and going up through typed or mimeographed documents, film, video, Photoshopped evidence, and digital photography and videos.&#34;</p><p>In fact, Pfefferkorn thinks as AI technology proliferates, it&#39;s more likely that courts will confront accusations of fakery against real evidence than attempts to introduce fake evidence.</p>
