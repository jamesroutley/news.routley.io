<p>Kerri and I took a ceramics class recently!</p>
<p>I made a <span>hypercube</span>.</p>

<p>My instructor was... <em>disappointed</em>. The class was supposed to make a mug, or a bowl, something functional. But I had this idea in my head and couldn&#39;t shake it. The glaze turned out amazing (this <span>iridescent blue</span> that shifts in the light). I&#39;ve been wondering if it would look even cooler painted in <span title="the darkest material known to science">Vantablack</span>.</p>
<p>Anyway. I&#39;ve been noticing parallels between <span>code</span> and <span>clay</span>. They&#39;re both mediums. Vessels for ideas. You weren&#39;t thinking about <span>hypercubes</span> until you saw one on the coffee table, and now you might be picturing what a ceramic tesseract would even look like.</p>

<p>Both are malleable. When you&#39;re centering the clay, it&#39;s constantly moving, constantly responding. You push a little too hard and the whole thing wobbles off center. Same with code. You add a feature, refactor something, introduce a bug, fix three more. It&#39;s <em>never</em> static. It&#39;s <em>never</em> done.</p>
<p>Clay breaks. A lot. My first few attempts collapsed on the wheel. One piece cracked in the kiln. I dropped another walking to my car. But nobody cries about it, you just start over. The clay doesn&#39;t care. It&#39;s just material waiting for the next idea.</p>
<p>You&#39;re gonna have a <em>really</em> bad time if you get too attached to it.</p>

<p>Code is the same way. We&#39;re so precious about it sometimes, like every line is sacred. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just text. <strong>Delete it. Rewrite it. Start fresh.</strong> The idea survives even when the implementation doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Before AI, we had to make every plate and coffee mug by hand. Every line of code, carefully typed. Every function, crafted manually.</p>
<p>Now? We&#39;ve hit the <span>industrial revolution</span> of code.</p>

<p>When the industrial revolution came for pottery, factories started pumping out ceramics. Plates got cheap. Mugs became disposable. You&#39;d think clay would have disappeared. Why bother with the slow, messy, manual process when machines could do it faster?</p>
<p>But clay didn&#39;t go away. Ceramics studios are everywhere now. People pay good money to throw pots on weekends. Kerri and I are proof. The <span>craft</span> got more valuable once it wasn&#39;t necessary anymore. When you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to make something by hand, choosing to makes it mean something.</p>
<p>Software engineers love to joke about automating themselves out of a job. Well, we&#39;re finally getting there. LLMs can write code. A lot of it, fast. The industrial revolution is here.</p>
<p>So what happens to <em>us</em>?</p>
<p>Maybe the same thing that happened to potters. The production work gets automated. The commodity code writes itself. But the <span>craft</span> remains. The weird ideas, the <span>hypercubes</span>, the things that don&#39;t fit in templates: that&#39;s still us. That&#39;s still <em>human</em>.</p>

<p>Honestly I think I&#39;m going to like it more. I got into programming because I liked building things, not because I wanted to type boilerplate for the rest of my life. If AI handles the mugs, I can focus on the <span>hypercubes</span>.</p>
<p>The medium isn&#39;t going anywhere. It&#39;s just getting more <em>interesting</em>.</p>
