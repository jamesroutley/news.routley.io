    <h1>Ask HN: How Do Browsers Isolate Internal Audio from Microphone Input?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve noticed an interesting feature in Chrome and Chromium: they seem to isolate internal audio from the microphone input. For instance, when I&#39;m on a Google Meet call in one tab and playing a YouTube video at full volume in another tab, the video’s audio isn’t picked up by Google Meet. This isolation doesn’t happen if I use different browsers for each task (e.g., Google Meet on Chrome and YouTube on Chromium).</p><p>Does anyone know how Chrome and Chromium achieve this audio isolation?</p><p>Given that Chromium is open source, it would be helpful if someone could point me to the specific part of the codebase that handles this. Any insights or technical details would be greatly appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
