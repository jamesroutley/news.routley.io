    <h1>Signal Public Username Testing (Staging Environment)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <p>Hey, all!</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along with the commit messages across our repositories, it’s no secret that we’ve been working on bringing Usernames to Signal for a while now. After rounds of internal testing, we have hit the point where we think the community that powers these forums can help us test even further before public launch.</p>
<p>To do so, we’d first like to invite you to test in Staging. Think of <em>The Staging Environment</em> as a parallel Signal universe: you’ll need to install and run a new build (links below), and register for a new account with a phone number (you can use the same one you’re using in Production). Anybody you wish to talk with in Staging needs to be registered in Staging as well (please coordinate with your Signal testing pals in group chats rather than posting your phone numbers and usernames to the forums). We have no uptime guarantees in Staging, and it’s likely that push notifications won’t work as well, or potentially at all, during your testing.</p>
<p>Once you’re registered and running the app, please navigate into <em>Settings / Profile</em> and <em>Settings / Privacy / Phone Number</em> to explore the new functionality available in these builds. Please test creating usernames, sharing username links, modifying the sharing settings for your phone number, and inviting people to groups by username and by phone number alike.</p>
<p>As you’re testing, we’re most interested in hearing about crashes and seeing your corresponding <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318591-Debug-Logs-and-Crash-Reports">debug logs</a> in this dedicated forum thread. These early builds are designed to proactively crash if it appears that anything has gone wrong under the hood, since we’re changing the fundamental way that accounts are identified in the Signal ecosystem. We know that there are some rough edges in the UX at the moment, as you might expect with pre-beta software, so you’re welcome to note issues you find in the UX, but we may already be aware of many of them. Lastly, we expect to update these builds daily, rather than the weekly cadence you’ve become accustomed to in the public beta channels (even as the server side of the staging environment goes up and down through various bouts of development and deployment on our side).</p>
<p>Thank you, and happy testing! <img src="https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/blue_heart.png?v=12" title=":blue_heart:" alt=":blue_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"/></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Android</strong>: Builds are available through Firebase. Sign up <a href="https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/eaacf1dd462bcd8c">here</a>. When enrolling, use an email address that is accessible on your test device. You’ll be sent instructions and download links through that email.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong>: You can compile from <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop">source</a> or follow these links for <a href="https://updates.signal.org/desktop/signal-desktop-staging-mac-universal-6.40.0-staging.20231108.12-bb8e7af90.dmg">MacOS</a> and <a href="https://updates.signal.org/desktop/signal-desktop-staging-win-6.40.0-staging.20231108.12-bb8e7af90.exe">Windows</a> (you’ll be prompted to update to the latest version after you install these links that are the latest as of the time of this post). Linux users can add the Desktop Alpha apt repo (<a href="https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt-alpha">https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt-alpha</a>), and then <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install signal-desktop-staging</code>. <em>Running a linked desktop requires you to first have registered with an Android or iOS device in Staging.</em></p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: Well! This isn’t as easy as clicking a link, but for the technically ambitious-crowd here, you can clone the latest <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS">Signal-iOS</a> code and run in the XCode simulator. Just set the target to Signal-Staging, and prepare to step over some debug assertions as you go. Note that self-built iOS apps won’t be able to receive push notifications from the service.</p>
