    <h1>Ask HN: What are the best tools for web scraping in 2022?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Last time this question was asked on HN was in 2017 (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15694118), a lot has changed in the last 5 years in the world of web scraping (legal landscape, antibot unblockers, data type specific APIs, etc), so I thought it may be a good idea to refresh this question and see what are the most popular tools used by the HN community these days.</td></div></div>
