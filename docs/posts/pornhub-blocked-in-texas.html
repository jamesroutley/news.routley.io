    <h1>Pornhub Blocked in Texas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/pornhub/" id="auto-tag_pornhub" data-tag="pornhub">Pornhub</a> and other affiliated adult websites have blocked access to users in Texas, amid a legal battle with the Lone Star State’s attorney general over an age-verification law.</p>



<p>
	Last week, a federal appeals court <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-50627-CV0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upheld a Texas law</a> requiring pornography sites to institute age-verification measures to ensure only adults 18 and older are able to access them, while it also struck down a part of the law requiring porn sites to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/pornhubs-texas-age-verification-law-violates-first-amendment-ruling-1235709902/">display “health warnings”</a> about the content. That came after a previous federal judge’s ruling that <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/pornhubs-texas-age-verification-law-violates-first-amendment-ruling-1235709902/">the Texas law violated the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment</a> prohibition against free-speech restrictions. The Texas Attorney General’s Office immediately appealed that decision.<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.kargo.com/privacy" target="_blank"></a>

<p>
	A new message displayed Thursday to users with internet addresses in Texas on Pornhub (and other sites operated by parent company <a href="https://variety.com/t/aylo/" id="auto-tag_aylo" data-tag="aylo">Aylo</a>) explained that it was disabling access to comply with the law, as first <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/pornhub-blocked-texas-age-verification-19021482.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> by the Houston Chronicle.</p>



<p>
	“As you may know, your elected officials in Texas are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. Not only does this impinge on the rights of adults to access protected speech, it fails strict scrutiny by employing the least effective and yet also most restrictive means of accomplishing Texas’s stated purpose of allegedly protecting minors,” the message reads in part.

</p>



<p>
	The Pornhub sites’ message continued, “Until the real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Texas. In doing so, we are complying with the law, as we always do, but hope that governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety and security of users.”</p>



<p>
	According to the message, “While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, providing identification every time you want to visit an adult platform is not an effective solution for protecting users online, and in fact, will put minors and your privacy at risk. The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the only effective solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users’ age on their device and to either deny or allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that verification.”</p>



<p>
	Pornhub called the Texas age-verification “ineffective, haphazard and dangerous” and asserted that it will drive users “from those few websites which comply, to the thousands of websites, with far fewer safety measures in place, which do not comply. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect minors and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.”

	</p>




<p>
	The Texas law was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in June 2023. The legislation, Texas H.B. 11811, was scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1, but it was on hold after the lawsuit filed by the Free Speech Coalition (a group that includes Pornhub’s parent company) resulted in a preliminary injunction staying its enforcement. The law applies to online publishers whose content is more than one-third “sexual material harmful to minors” and requires them to verify the age of all visitors using a government-issued ID or “public or private transactional data.”</p>



<p>
	Reps for Pornhub and its parent company, Aylo, did not immediately respond to a request for additional information.</p>



<p>
	Pornhub and the company’s network of other sites are also blocked or restricted in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Virginia and Utah, which have adopted similar laws.</p>



<p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/pornhub-parent-name-change-aylo-adult-entertainment-1235700312/">Aylo is owned by Canadian private-equity firm Ethical Capital Partners</a>, which acquired Pornhub’s predecessor company MindGeek for undisclosed financial terms last year. ECP has said it would focus on building the company’s “trust and safety” and to make it “the internet leader in fighting illegal online content.”</p>
