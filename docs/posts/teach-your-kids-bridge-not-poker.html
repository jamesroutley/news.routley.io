    <h1>Teach your kids bridge, not poker</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A post recently made the rounds on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">hacker news</a> claiming that
<a href="https://momentofdeep.substack.com/p/teach-your-kids-poker-not-chess?s=r">you should teach your kids poker, not chess</a>.
The comments on that post go through a lot of the reasons why poker is a bad game to teach your
children, but I felt that I was well suited to opine on this topic, and explain why duplicate
bridge is the best game for practicing the life skills involved in business and programming,
compared to all of the alternatives.</p>
<p>I am a passionate player of strategy games, but never a professional player at any. I played chess
as a child, ultimately studying to the point where I can play at ~1500 play strength today.
In high school, I was a passionate Magic: the Gathering player. I played a lot at the competitive level
and also became a level 2 Magic Judge for a brief time. In college, I started to seriously play bridge
and poker. When I turned 21, I made money playing Texas Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha (the latter of which
I enjoyed more, but had fewer players). In college, I played bridge with the college club twice a week,
and became decent at the game. Today, I am mostly a bridge player, but I still play chess, Magic, and
poker once in a while. I believe that bridge is the best game for learning life skills, and that it is
a great game to play as an amateur.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-of-bridge">The Game of Bridge</h2>
<p>Bridge is unfortunately associated with an aging population of players and is a lot less “cool” than
chess or poker. However, there is a small community of young players that are both friendly and
competitive, hopefully the benginning of a renaissance for the game.</p>
<p>Bridge is played with four players, two teams of two, using a standard deck of cards. Each player sits
across from their teammate. On each hand, the entire deck is dealt out, and then the game goes through
two phases: bidding and playing.</p>
<p>During the bidding phase, players call out public bids to determine the
<em>contract</em>, exchanging information about their hands through the limited information of a number and a
suit (“one spade” is a bridge bid). Information exchange occurs during the bidding phase using agreements
about the meaning of each bid called bidding conventions. Partnerships can come up with their own agreement
or use one of a few common bidding conventions, like Standard American, 2-over-1, and ACOL. Learning bidding
conventions is like learning chess openings: you need to spend time learning one of them.</p>
<p>During the playing phase, one player from the partnership that won the bidding places their hand face up on
the table, and the other player from that partnership plays a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game">trick-taking game</a> (similar to hearts or spades) against
the opposing pair to try to take as many tricks as possible. The person playing the contract is called
the “declarer,” while the other two players are “defenders” (the player whose hand is face-up is the “dummy”).
The playing phase is then scored based on whether the declarer has made the number of tricks promised in the
contract. Taking as many tricks as promised (or more) is called “making the contract,” and offers rewards
that depend on the level of the contract and the number of tricks taken, while taking fewer tricks is “going
down.” The defending side is rewarded for making you go down. Playing the hand is often subtle and challenging,
regardless of whether you are defending or declaring, and every trick matters regardless of whether you are
expecting to take 10 tricks or 2.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-bridge">The Benefits of Bridge</h2>
<h4 id="managing-information">Managing Information</h4>
<p>Information management is central to bridge. During the bidding phase, you and your partner determine what is
important to share with each other to determine a contract. During the playing phase, you have to work with the
fact that two other hands are not publicly known.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge_probabilities">Probability</a> comes into play here: understanding
distributions of cards and possible hands that opponents can have will allow you to figure out how to play for
the maximum number of tricks. The bidding and playing phases are all about deriving the maximum value you can
from the limited information you have, much like life.</p>
<h4 id="planning-a-line">Planning a Line</h4>
<p>Like chess, bridge play often involves thinking several tricks ahead and planning your line of play. However,
you have to plan for contingencies and plan to mitigate the effects of the unknown information. Because you
know that the entire deck is dealt out, there is often an understandable amount of missing information. There
are 13 tricks in a hand, which is long enough to plan a line based on a few critical decisions, but short enough
that you can reasonably work with the probability space.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous amount of depth to bridge play strategy: For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_play_(bridge)">squeezes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endplay">endplays</a>
are examples of ways to play a bridge hand based on giving an opponent options for how they want to give up a trick
to you. To execute an endplay or a squeeze, you have to plan for a lot of possible hands and outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a lot of strategy on the defensive side, including strategy on how to make an opening lead
and strategy around how to give information to you partner.</p>
<h4 id="asymmetry-not-randmoness">Asymmetry, not Randmoness</h4>
<p>The cards that are distributed around the table are not distributed fairly. The game of bridge teaches you to
deal with the cards you are dealt and maximize the number of tricks your partnership takes in every circumstance.
Due to duplication and the contract scoring system, one trick often matters a lot, and playing weak hands well
matters as much as playing strong hands well.</p>
<p>Bridge games are set up so that the aspect of “who has the good cards” is completely mitigated. Bridge
is often played “duplicated”: many tables play with the same sets of hands, and your result is compared against
other pairs (at other tables) with the same hands, <em>not</em> the other pair at the same table. In this way, playing
weak hands well is rewarded, while playing strong hands poorly is punished. The randomness of “who gets the cards”
is mitigated in the scoring. You can still lose a hand to someone who takes a different (possibly worse) line of
play and happens to catch the cards in the right places, but the skill difference tends to average out over 20-30
hands, which is normal for a bridge tournament.</p>
<h4 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h4>
<p>Bridge is a partnership game, and you are going to have to learn to work with your partner. This means learning
your partner’s tendencies, learning how to work with others, and learing to become a good communicator. Like a
team game, your individual skill is only half of your team’s success. Bridge will also involve miscommunications
and mistakes, and so you will also learn to ask for forgiveness and to forgive others for their mistakes.</p>
<p>Partners and teams will often have a postmortem after a bridge game where they review the hands and learn from
them. The postmortem will help you learn to give and take criticism constructively (although postmortems are not
always constructive).</p>
<h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>
<p>Learning to work with bidding conventions and learning to recognize certain types of tactics during the play
of the hand are important for being a good bridge player. This kind of preparation rewards you the same way that
learning chess openings rewards you. Crafting new bidding conventions or modifying the ones you use with a
partner are also important for maximizing your chances of winning. Many different kinds of bidding conventions
are out there, and you can learn a lot from learning about them and thinking about them.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-the-alternatives">Comparison to the Alternatives</h2>
<p>In comparison to bridge, there are several alternative games on offer, including poker, chess, trading card games,
and other board games. I am going to be categorizing these on a few axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperfect vs perfect information: In a perfect information game, both players have the same information about
the state of the game.</li>
<li>Asymmetric vs symmetric: In a symmetric game, both players are playing with the same objectives and set of pieces.
Asymmetric games have different objectives or different pieces.</li>
<li>Luck vs skill: In a luck game, some information about the game state that is hidden from all players (<em>eg</em> with
dice rolls or facedown cards).</li>
</ul>
<p>By this categorization, bridge is an <strong>imperfect information asymmetric skill game</strong>. It is very unusual to have
imperfect information but no luck in a game, since imperfect infomration is often derived from luck. Bridge
derives 100% of its information gaming from asymmetry, and mitigates luck through the way it is scored. In my
opinion, it is hard to have a richer strategic space or a better learning environment than you can find in an
imperfect information skill game.</p>
<p>Because we are talking about games for kids, I will also be talking a little bit about the communities around
each game, as I have observed them. One point against bridge is that the bridge community as a whole is not the
friendliest or the most welcoming. However, you can find players, particularly younger players, who are happy to
play with new players who are learning the game.</p>
<h4 id="poker">Poker</h4>
<p><strong>Imperfect information symmetric luck game</strong></p>
<p>Poker is a game of information, but poker is also primarily a gambling game: money and gambling are inseparable
from poker. People will play poker differently when they are playing for large amounts of money than when
they are playing for small amounts of money: they are a lot more conservative when a lot of cash is on the line.
Due to the nature of pot sizes in poker, people in small games often find themselves making big-money decisions
and vice versa. However, if you are playing for <em>no</em> money, that dynamic disappears and the game changes a lot.
Unless you want to introduce gambling to your children, this fact alone disqualifies poker.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that high-level poker is a lot more about “tells” and “reading your opponent” than doing
math. This is not the case. Playing pot odds poker (straight math) will often earn you money at low-stakes
games because people look too hard for tells. High-level poker players will talk and think a lot about “ranges”
and probabilities. A “range” is a set of hands that would act in a particular way, and high-level players
understand that betting at a poker table is more about your range and your opponents’ ranges, and how you
stack up.</p>
<p>Since poker involves luck, when you lose or win a hand, you have the task of separating out your skill from your
luck. In all luck games, people are biased in favor of attributing your wins to skill and your losses to luck,
and it takes a lot of discipline to avoid this fallacy. However, poker does involve a lot more skill than most
luck games.</p>
<h4 id="chess">Chess</h4>
<p><strong>Perfect information symmetric skill game</strong></p>
<p>If you want to become a professional at a strategy game as a child, I would personally suggest chess. There
is a tremendous amount of strategy to study around chess, and at the high levels it actually has a lot of the
“information gaming” aspects of poker or bridge. High-level chess involves a lot of learning and preparation,
and you can gain an advantage against another player by playing an opening or aiming for a position that you
have studied and they have not.</p>
<p>However, at lower levels, chess games are mostly determined by who makes fewer blunders. There isn’t much
of an information game when you sometimes leave pieces open for your opponent to caputre using basic tactics
and combinations. It takes a tremendous amount of thought and attention to play the game to even this level.
High-level chess is an imperfect information bluffing game, but lower-level chess is about avoiding mistakes
with perfect information.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a vibrant community of serious chess players everywhere, and there are a tremendous
number of resources for people who want to go from “serious casual” to “professional.”</p>
<h4 id="go">Go</h4>
<p><strong>Perfect information symmetric skill game</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know much about how to play go, but I understand that it is similar to chess: the low-level game is
about avoiding mistakes, while the high-level game has components of strategy and preparation.</p>
<h4 id="trading-card-games">Trading Card Games</h4>
<p><strong>Imperfect information asymmetric luck games</strong></p>
<p>Trading card games like Magic: the Gathering and Pokemon are often marketed as being “combinations of poker
and chess.” I have generally found that not to be the case. In my experience, randomness determines the
outcomes of games more than skill or information asymmetry. Generally, players start with a hand of cards
and draw one card per turn from the top of their deck. This trickle of resources both creates luck and
limits the asymmetry of information: you only get one new card per turn to bluff with, and you can find
yourself seeing a good mix of resources or being starved of one resource or another.</p>
<p>Good magic players have some ability to limit the effects of randomness, but much less than in other luck games
on this list. The top ranked players by the <a href="http://www.mtgeloproject.net/leaders.php">MTG Elo Project</a>
have win rates below 66%, and their “GP records” (games played in “Grand Prix” tournaments,
where anyone can enter) generally have a win rate below 70%. These highly skilled players cannot crack a 75%
win rate over random players! Furthermore, these are match wins: their game win rate would be closer to 50%
than to 75%, since best-of-three matches have the effect of decreasing the effects of luck.</p>
<p>Futhermore, trading card games are expensive to play, with a single competitive Magic deck costing
$300-2000. In an environment where “the best” deck changes every 3 months, there is a tremendous amout of
money required to play seriously.</p>
<p>“Limited” format tournaments, where the cards are provided for the tournament, are also fairly expensive because
buying packs of cards is expensive, and packs don’t hold their value once they are opened. For example, a
sealed Grand Prix usually has a $100 entry fee, and on average you will walk out with &lt;$10 of new cards. A
casual draft may have a $25 or less entry fee, though, and I find these to be the best way to play magic.</p>
<p>One final note: competitive Magic players are often a lot less friendly than compeititve players of other games.
I don’t know why this is. Depending on who you ask, they may also be less honest: compeititive Magic has had
a lot of cheating scandals in its recent history.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-scrabble">Bonus: Scrabble</h4>
<p><strong>Imperfect information symmetric luck game</strong></p>
<p>Scrabble is a great casual game that can teach your child a trememdnous amount of vocabulary, particularly
words that are two and seven letters. I learned such words as “aa,” “cwm,” and “aorists” playing Scrabble
with my grandmother.</p>
<p>Like trading card games, Scrabble is an imperfect information game played between two players with an aspect
of randomness. However, high-level Scrabble players are really good at removing variance from the game by
opening up fewer spaces where new words can be played. The fact that the dictionary of words can be
completely memorized also helps. Like poker, high-level Scrabble players know how to mitigate luck to the
point where it is almost a skill game.</p>
<p>I have never played competitive scrabble, but I have heard that the competitive scene is the most welcoming
of any game.</p>
<h2 id="give-bridge-a-try">Give Bridge a Try</h2>
<p>Compared to the alternatives, bridge offers a rewarding experience that combines asymemtric gameplay and
imperfect information while avoiding the effects of luck. This makes bridge a perfect game to teach a
growing young mind. They will learn to deal with the asymmetric circumstances of life and others with
hidden information, while also teaching about planning lines of play and the value of teamwork.</p>
<p>A lot of the alternatives are great games, but if you are interested in teaching and learning useful life
skills through the platform of a game, there are few alternatives that offer the richness of contract bridge.</p>
