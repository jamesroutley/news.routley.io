    <h1>Brussels Airlines makes 3,000 unnecessary flights to maintain airport slots</h1>

    <div><div><div> <p>Brussels Airlines has operated 3,000 empty or near-empty flights this winter to avoid losing take-off and landing rights at major airports, it has been revealed.</p>
<p>The airline&#39;s parent company, Lufthansa, operated 18,000 flights this winter that would otherwise have been cancelled due to lack of passengers, including 3,000 flights under the Brussels Airlines banner, reports <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/416221/article/2022-01-05/brussels-airlines-fait-voler-3000-avions-vide-pour-conserver-ses-creneaux-de">Le Soir</a> and <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_3-000-vols-a-vide-par-brussels-airlines-juste-pour-conserver-les-creneaux-de-vols?id=10908898">RTBF</a>.</p>
<p>The news has prompted the Belgian federal government to write to the European Commission, urging it to rethink the rules on securing slots.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic hit, the rule was that airlines must operate flights in at least 80% of their scheduled take-off and landing slots, or they risked losing them.</p>
<p>This was revised down to 50% after coronavirus broke out, but this still remains much higher than the actual number of flights needed to meet passenger demand.</p>
<p>Belgium&#39;s federal mobility minister Georges Gilkinet (Ecolo), has written to the European commissioner for transport, Adina Valean, to raise the issue.</p>
<p>Gilkinet said the rules were incomprehensible from an economic and ecological point of view - and the threshold for keeping these sought-after slots should be further reduced to give airlines more flexibility.</p>
