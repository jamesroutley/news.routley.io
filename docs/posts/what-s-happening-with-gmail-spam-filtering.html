    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s happening with Gmail spam filtering?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the last 2 weeks my gmail inbox went from zero spam to at least 2/3 spam/phishing emails per day on the inbox. I&#39;m marking them as spam but nonetheless it keeps happening. I&#39;m wondering if because spam traffic increased and spammers found a new way to trick anti-spam or if gmail engineers changed something on their end. Is anyone experiencing the same?</p><p>Not a big deal as it&#39;s been almost a year I&#39;m migrating off gmail and I&#39;m keeping it only for a few things, but still annoying</p></div></div></div>
