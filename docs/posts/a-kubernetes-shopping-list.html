    <h1>a Kubernetes shopping list</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 8, 2024</em></p><p>I talked to a few people yesterday—it sounds like Kubernetes is where it&#39;s at. I really enjoyed Nomad back in the day, but it looks like I&#39;d have to do a lot of roll-your-own, which kind of negates the benefit of operational simplicity for me.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>That doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m going to let simplicity go out the window. I looked around and found that Vultr will manage the control plane for free as long as you pay for the worker nodes. Doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s highly-available, but I think that&#39;s OK for me for now.</p><p>So that leaves me with another shopping list to make: how do I run my stuff in Kubernetes?</p><ul><li><strong>CD and workload management:</strong> I&#39;ll definitely use Argo CD for this. I used it in production at my last job and it was great.</li><li><strong>CI:</strong> Like I mentioned yesterday, I&#39;ve been wanting &#34;real&#34; CI for my personal stuff for a while. It looks like I have options: maybe Argo Workflows to stay in the family, but Tekton looks fine too. I know I said I&#39;d rather avoid Jenkins but Jenkins X is apparently a rewrite? Interesting. I could also switch Git hosting to GitLab and use their runners.</li><li><strong>Routing and load balancing:</strong> Bunch of good options. Traefik, the Nginx ingress controller, etc. I&#39;m most interested in Istio, though. Seems like it has a gateway thing? Worth playing around with, anyway.</li><li><strong>Container storage:</strong> Harbor graduated from the CNCF, so probably that if I don&#39;t get something built in with the Vultr cluster. But maybe Dragonfly, which does P2P stuff? Seems cool but I probably don&#39;t have the problem it solves.</li><li><strong>Misc:</strong><ul><li>A very experienced friend told me that cert-manager and external-dns were pretty much required, so I&#39;m going to look into them.</li><li>I&#39;ve also used and loved Argo Rollouts, so that&#39;s going on the list. Not <em>required</em>, but they worked enough better for me than the core deployment object before and give you options for healthy rollouts so I&#39;m going to use them for sure.</li><li>I&#39;ll need to set up the CSI driver for Vultr too so that my persistent volumes will persist.</li><li>How do secrets work in Kubernetes now? Do I need to run some component or is the builtin stuff usually good enough?</li></ul></li></ul><p>But, zooming out, I don&#39;t want to spend <em>too</em> much time on this. It&#39;s really easy to tweak and tweak and then never move on to the rest of what needs to happen.</p><p>So, guess I&#39;ll start grabbing stuff and shoving it into Terraform and see what happens!</p></article></div>
