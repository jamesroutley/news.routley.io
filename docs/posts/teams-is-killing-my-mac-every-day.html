						<p>Hi <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/108367">@Sam Cosby</a>, thank you for your reply.</p><p>I&#39;ve attached a video of the flickering.  This was a month ago and still persists. It seems to be getting worse.  But reducing the size of the Teams window so the video feeds are smaller reduces the flicker. I have Xfinity internet which boast 1gb burst speeds and when I&#39;ve tested it, it always comes around 200MB/second.</p><p>The reality of running Teams on this computer is I have to shut down most every app to get it run at a reasonable pace and more often than not reboot after using Teams for my computer to recover.   While I run Teams, I have to shut down my Apple apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar because they start to lag too and it causes even more delay in Teams opening and responding to commands.</p><p>The performance issues I&#39;ve experienced are a seriously long lag times 5-20 seconds (easily) throughout the entire use of it.  Opening the app takes forever, opening a meeting takes forever to populate the screen that allows me to turn on/off the camera/microphone before joining the meeting takes forever.  Upon joining the meeting, that takes forever, bringing up the share options dialog box takes forever, once clicking on the Share button, it takes several clicks for it to respond to the option I selected.  Because of the lag, I&#39;ve lost confidence that when I select an option, the App actually acknowledges it, especially disconnecting, and as a result, buttons get clicked multiple times causing even more delay.  Sometimes I have to command Q to leave meetings because &#34;End Meeting&#34; doesn&#39;t respond. It&#39;s like the button is decorative. These delays accumulate to about 45-60 seconds from the time I open Teams to when I can actually connect into a meeting. Leaving is quick if I just Command Q or Command-option escape and force quit Teams.  I have no patience for waiting on the app to figure itself out anymore.  However the worst was of all these delays was over three minutes from the time I opened the app to when I actually was joined into the meeting but that was the prior version (June 2021 - I think) to the one I&#39;m running now, Version 1.4.00.16567 on Mac OSX Big Sur 11.6.</p><p>Again, when Teams failed me in the meeting yesterday in front of 100 people, before that, I was stoked to see Teams opening up quickly, popped me right in to the meeting. I seriously thought I had fixed this lag issue... by erasing my entire hard drive and reinstalling the OS from scratch with no backup recovery to ensure whatever issue is causing these lags before didn&#39;t get transferred over to this fresh OS install. But, the very moment I clicked that share button, everything went FUBAR again and Teams has been running awful since.  It&#39;s like it has some weird memory leak that tends to compound in some preference file full of errors. I&#39;ve deleted preference files before and that tended to help some but not a fix.</p><p>Hopefully this gives you enough of my experience and attempted resolve to work with?</p>
