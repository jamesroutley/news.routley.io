                <h3>Your database knowledge is outdated</h3>
                <p>
                    Your Tech Stack has changed dramatically in the past 20 years:
                    Some technologies are now state-of-the-art, and some have been invented and are obsolete meanwhile.
                    But you still use the same simple database concepts as many years ago.
                    Every technology progresses, but databases don&#39;t invent anything new? Isn&#39;t that strange?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There have been countless improvements, but you don&#39;t know of them.
                    When using ORM (Object-relational Mapping), most developers lose touch with database improvements as they are hidden from them.
                    And that&#39;s good as you don&#39;t have to know every nifty detail.
                    But when you know a little more about modern database features, you develop faster by relying on many fascinating features.
                </p>

                <h3>An evening is enough to attain more knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                    Telling you that a single evening is enough to make you a database wizard is a lie.
                    But you don&#39;t have to become one.
                    You can take a shortcut by only learning essential features for developers.
                    And this is exactly what this book is designed for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book is designed as a cookbook with many small independent recipes.
                    Each one teaches you simple tips &amp; tricks you can add to your application in a very short time.
                    You should be able to read it thoroughly in a single evening and on the next day you can discuss those improvements with your colleagues.
                    This is a whole different experience from all the books you bought but never had the time to read.
                </p>
