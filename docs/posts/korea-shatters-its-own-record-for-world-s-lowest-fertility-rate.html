    <h1>Korea shatters its own record for world’s lowest fertility rate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>South Korea has once again shattered its own record for the world’s lowest fertility rate as it faces the prospect of its population of 51 million people more than halving by the end of this century.</p><p>Korean women were estimated, based on 2021 data, to have an average of just 0.81 children over their lifetimes, down from 0.84 a year earlier, the statistics office said Wednesday. The number of newborns declined last year to 260,600, which equates to about 0.5% of the population.</p></div></div>
