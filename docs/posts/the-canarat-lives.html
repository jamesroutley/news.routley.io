    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Just a quick note to say that the <a href="https://slinkp.com/canarat#resurrection-attempt-2-2026" rel="nofollow">Canarat</a> makes sound again! Very happy about
this. A quick video proof!</p>

<p>Now all I have to do is redo the useless tone circuit
(which <a href="https://slinkp.com/canarat/#the-mystery-mod" rel="nofollow">is not what I built, strange as that seems</a>).</p>
<p>... and take it out of the case again so I can paint it...</p>
<p>... and design the graphic...</p>
<p>... and maybe a logo for my &#34;brand&#34; such as it is ...</p>
<p>... and paint all that...</p>
<p>... and then put it back together again without breaking it.</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t blogged the few completed pedal builds I&#39;ve done. 
Because writing is slow, I guess. More retroblogging! Less being precious about it!</p>
