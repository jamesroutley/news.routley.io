        This pitch is for an app that does not yet exist<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and that I’m not currently planning to build,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
        but that I would love to use. Please, take this idea. Build this thing.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> And then let me use it.

      <p><em>Are you interested in playing music with other people, but not sure how to find them?</em></p>
      <p><em>Do you have fond memories of casually playing in various ensembles throughout your school years, but no longer have access to an available pool of other musicians, space to make music in, or relevant equipment?</em></p>
      <p><em>Have you ever had a sudden longing to play some duets, and then remembered that none of your former musical co-conspirators live nearby?</em></p>
      <p><em>You aren’t alone! Enter…</em></p>

        <p><strong>Ensembler</strong>, the swipe-to-match app for meeting musicians near you!</p>
        <p>Simply fill out a few basic profile questions, then peruse the profiles of Ensemblers within your chosen geographic radius.</p>
        <p>Swipe right or left to indicate interest in meeting up to play together. If you are mutually interested you’ll be connected to plan your jam session logistics.</p>
        <p>A free hour opened up in your week? Use “Play ASAP” mode to broadcast your availability to all Ensemblers with whom you’ve previously matched.</p>
        <p>You’ll be making music <del>ensemble</del> together in no time!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Ensembler profiles include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Instrument(s): acoustic, electric, vocalist type, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p>Musical activities of interest: sight-reading, pre-preparing notated scores, improvising, playing from lead sheets or charts, playing traditional non-notated repertoire, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p>Relative skill level for each combination of instrument and activity</p></li>
        <li><p>Genres of interest</p></li>
        <li><p>Logistic concerns, e.g., ability to host an ensemble session or willingness to travel to another place to play; need for piano or amplifier access; etc.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An Ensembler can set up as many sub-profiles as are relevant, i.e., one profile for each advanced proficiency clarinet, one for beginner xylophone sight-reading, one for basic piano accompaniment for a vocalist singing show tunes,
        etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Thanks to Ensembler, I sightread duets before work twice a week with various different working professionals around my neighborhood. It’s like I’m back in high school, starting each day in the band room with my friends, except
          that when we’re done playing we go to our jobs instead of second period geometry!” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Moving to a new city used to be so isolating: it would take me years to find my way into the hidden musician networks to find people to play with. Now I can be jamming with a new acquaintance across the street before I’ve even
          unpacked my dishes.” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I thought I was ordering pizza but now there are two bassoonists rocking out in my kitchen. Please send help. 1 star.” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="current-features">Current features</h3>
      <p>Some of the many features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Set up multiple profiles, for folks who play multiple instruments at various levels</p></li>
        <li><p>Bookmark musicians you’ve enjoyed playing with in the past, to be notified of their current jam availability</p></li>
        <li><p>Assemble multi-player ensembles of any combination, by specifically searching to fill specific instruments or roles; e.g., a rock band with a vocalist, a piano quintet, etc.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Search based on specific instrument or for more generic musical properties, i.e., anyone with a concert Eb instrument for a specific book of duets, anyone who plays a rhythm instrument, anyone who plays an acoustic instrument,
            etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Restrict potential matches to those within your known sphere, e.g., only people with whom you have a mutual Ensembler in common or (for younger players) those who share a professional music teacher in common</p></li>
        <li><p>Add matches to your pool of on-demand “Play ASAP” players, for when you have a sudden urge to play some music and want to broadcast that availability to pre-matched Ensemblers</p></li>
        <li><p>Live geographic updating, so that the pool of available players always matches your current location</p></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “These days when I travel, I always bring my fiddle along—thanks to Ensembler, I’m always able to find someone to teach me a local favorite tune!” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Other features facilitate the logistics of meeting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Ability to feature by musicians who have necessary instruments or equipment available to borrow, e.g., a piano or drumset, or amplifier on site</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to match with local venues that offer their space for music playing, at a set fee, for those without private practice space access</p></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “I’m not a musician myself, but I used to love listening to my kids practice. Now that I’ve made my living room piano available on Ensembler, my neighbors stop by to sing show tunes and practice their sonatas. My home feels lively
          again.” </p>
      </blockquote>
