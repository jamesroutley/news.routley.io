<p>Zulip Server 9.0 is a major release, with over 5,300 new commits merged across
the project since the 8.0 release in December 2023. Notable new features include
a UI redesign with larger font size and line spacing, major improvements for
composing messages, and much more!</p>
<p>A total of 124 people contributed commits to Zulip since the 8.0 release,
bringing the project to over 1,450 code contributors. Zulip is remarkable for
its number of major contributors, with <a href="https://zulip.com/team">89 people</a>
who’ve contributed 100+ commits.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who’s
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html">contributed</a>

suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/support-zulip-project">giving back</a> to the Zulip
community.</p>

<p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server and web application. We’d also like to
share news and updates for the project as a whole since the 8.0 release last
December:</p>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<p>We’ve been hard at work on Zulip’s next-generation mobile app for Android and
iOS, built with Flutter. Users can look forward to redesigned apps and a
<a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/Flutter/near/1582367">faster, smoother experience</a>.</p>
<p>We published a first
<a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/Flutter/near/1708728">community beta release</a>
last December, and have made 9 more releases since then,
<a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/1-announce/topic/mobile.20beta/near/1716421">packed with features</a>.
There are over 1,700 commits in the latest release, and progress has been
accelerating, with another full-time developer and three Google Summer of Code
participants joining our mobile team this summer.</p>
<p>Later this year, we’ll announce a public beta here on the Zulip blog, so that
you can try it out and see the new smoother experience for yourself. In the
months after that, we’ll roll out the new app for everyone as the next version
of the official Zulip mobile apps on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’ve
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases">continued updating the existing mobile apps</a>
for key Zulip Server 9.0 features you’ll read about below, as well as fixing
selected bugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#readme">Zulip Terminal</a> features new
since last December include easy-to-read themes when using a transparent
terminal, improved in-app help, the ability to compose and edit messages in
external editors, and a prompt to avoid accidentally closing — and losing — the
message you are composing.</p>

<p>This section gives an overview of the major features and improvements in Zulip
Server 9.0.</p>
<p>Alongside the major changes, this release contains hundreds of refinements
beyond what can be described here. We believe that getting the little details
right makes a big difference in a product that’s so central to people’s daily
work. To make Zulip
<a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/rust/#the-language-team-moves-from-discord-to-zulip-its-better-in-all-the-ways-i-care-about">a joy to use</a>,
we relentlessly fine-tune the user experience, and consider it a priority to
investigate and fix even minor bugs.</p>
<h2 id="streams-renamed-to-channels">“Streams” renamed to “channels”</h2>
<p>To better match terminology familiar from other apps, “streams” have been
renamed to “<a href="https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-channels">channels</a>” across
the app in this release. The functionality remains exactly the same, and
integrations do not need to be updated for this transition.</p>
<h2 id="in-app-feature-announcements">In-app feature announcements</h2>
<p>To make it easier to discover what’s new in Zulip, important product changes are
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/configure-automated-notices#zulip-update-announcements">now announced</a>
via automated messages. These messages are sent to a “Zulip updates” topic in a
channel selected by organization administrators. Users can read the
announcements when it’s convenient, and chat about them in the same topic.</p>
<p>On self-hosted servers, these
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html#upgrade-notes-for-9-0">configurable</a>
notices are shipped with the Zulip server version that includes the new feature.</p>
<h2 id="improved-reading-experience">Improved reading experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>To make reading more comfortable, Zulip has been redesigned with a larger font
size and line spacing. Because personal preferences vary, the previous design
remains available via the <a href="https://zulip.com/help/font-size">compact mode</a>
setting, and we plan to offer flexible controls for font size and line spacing
in the next major release.</li>
<li>For a more focused reading experience, you can now hide the
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/left-sidebar">left</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-list">right</a> sidebars even in a full-size window.
When the left sidebar is hidden,
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts#navigation">keyboard navigation</a>
lets you jump to the next unread topic or to your
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/configure-home-view">home view</a>. The
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-list">right sidebar</a> has been redesigned to
highlight users in the current channel or direct-message conversation.</li>
<li>Messages and topic names now load much faster when you open the web or desktop
app.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/focus-mode.CW8MPwgV_MlQm8.webp" alt="" width="2120" height="760" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></p>
<h2 id="improved-experience-for-composing-messages">Improved experience for composing messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>The compose box has been redesigned, with a cleaner, more modern look.</li>
<li>When you start composing, the most recently edited draft for the conversation
you are composing to now automatically appears in the compose box. You can
always
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/view-and-edit-your-message-drafts#save-a-draft-and-start-a-new-message">save a draft</a>
for later and start a new message.</li>
<li>When you paste content into the compose box, Zulip will now do its best to
preserve the formatting, including links, bulleted lists, bold, italics, and
more. If you don’t need the formatting, you can undo it with <code>Ctrl+Z</code>, or
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts#the-basics">paste as plain text</a>.</li>
<li>Pasted channel and topic
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-topic">link URLs</a>
are now automatically converted into
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#link-to-a-channel-or-topic-within-zulip">nicely formatted</a>
links.</li>
<li>To <a href="https://zulip.com/help/quote-and-reply">quote and reply</a> to part of a
message, you can now select the part that you want to quote.</li>
<li>You can now scroll down in all typeahead menus to see more matches for what
you’ve typed so far.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/compose-box.6NRbWRE1_Z28NwSv.webp" alt="" width="1814" height="944" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></p>
<h2 id="more-natural-navigation">More natural navigation</h2>
<ul>
<li>For clarity and consistency, three key message views that show multiple
conversations at once are now labeled
“<a href="https://zulip.com/help/combined-feed">Combined feed</a>” (previously “All
messages”), “<a href="https://zulip.com/help/channel-feed">Channel feed</a>”, and
“<a href="https://zulip.com/help/direct-messages#access-all-dms">Direct message feed</a>”.</li>
<li>To make it easier to read your messages topic-by-topic, channel links in the
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/left-sidebar">left sidebar</a> now take you directly to
the top topic in the channel. You can
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/channel-feed#configure-where-channel-links-in-the-left-sidebar-go">configure</a>
them to go to the channel feed instead (previously the only option).</li>
<li>When you send a message to a conversation that you’re not viewing, Zulip now
jumps you to that conversation, unless
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mastering-the-compose-box#automatically-go-to-conversation-where-you-sent-a-message">configured</a>
otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-and-improved-ways-to-find-messages">New and improved ways to find messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main <a href="https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages">search</a> has been
redesigned with pills for search filters, making it easier to use.
<span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/search-pills.gJyJpot5_GPHpu.webp" alt="" width="1012" height="59" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></li>
<li>You can use the new
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/emoji-reactions#view-your-messages-with-reactions">Reactions view</a>
to see how others have responded to your messages with emoji reactions. You
can also
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages#search-by-message-status">search</a>
all messages with reactions.</li>
<li>You can now search for messages
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/follow-a-topic#search-for-messages-in-followed-topics">in topics you follow</a>,
or see a feed of all messages (or just unread messages) in your followed
topics.</li>
<li>You can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/direct-messages#find-a-direct-message-conversation">filter</a>
direct message conversations in the left sidebar to show conversations that
include a specific person.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="easier-user-onboarding">Easier user onboarding</h2>
<p>Zulip’s onboarding experience has been redesigned to introduce core Zulip
concepts when they first become relevant.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/inbox-intro-modal.FV_4wDKS_Z1JlzHx.webp" alt="" width="1496" height="1080" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>One-time modals now introduce the <a href="https://zulip.com/help/inbox">Inbox</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/recent-conversations">Recent conversations</a> views.
Permanently dismissable banners explain complex situations, such as composing
a message
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mastering-the-compose-box#composing-to-a-different-conversation">while viewing a different conversation</a>,
when they come up. <span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/inbox-intro-modal.FV_4wDKS_Z1JlzHx.webp" alt="" width="1496" height="1080" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span> <span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/onboarding-banner.Cf42Bcvo_Z1MTT6q.webp" alt="" width="1306" height="170" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></li>
<li>To introduce <a href="https://zulip.com/help/star-a-message">starred messages</a>,
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/view-your-mentions">your mentions</a>, and other views,
we added descriptions in the bar at the top, and to the message area when the
view is empty.</li>
<li>Introductory messages have been rewritten to better explain how
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics">conversations labeled with topics</a>
work in Zulip, including how to
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/replying-to-messages">reply</a> to an existing thread,
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics#how-to-start-a-new-topic">start</a>
a new conversation, and
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-topic">move messages</a> if they
are out of place. To make intro messages easier to find, they are now starred
and marked as unread for new users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-and-usability-improvements">Design and usability improvements</h2>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/user-card.B8MNmu0b_wNnBe.webp" alt="" width="691" height="1089" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>All the menus have been restyled, with a cleaner look, better icons, and
improved screen reader accessibility. Also, you can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/dark-theme">switch themes</a> directly from your personal
menu. <span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/user-card.B8MNmu0b_wNnBe.webp" alt="" width="691" height="1089" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></li>
<li>You can now configure how
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/allow-image-link-previews">previews</a> of animated
images show the animation (always, when you hover over them, or never).</li>
<li>To better show key information,
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/desktop-notifications">desktop</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mobile-notifications">mobile</a> notifications now
abbreviate quoted content.</li>
<li>The message
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/view-a-messages-edit-history">edit history</a> view has
been redesigned for visual consistency and ease of use.</li>
<li>If you’d prefer not to see
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/typing-notifications">notifications when others type</a>,
you can now disable them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>Alt+P</code> keyboard shortcut lets you toggle between edit mode and
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/preview-your-message-before-sending">preview mode</a>
when composing or editing a message.</li>
<li>A new <code>Shift+V</code> keyboard shortcut offers quick access to

</ul>
<h2 id="improved-user-management">Improved user management</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new combined user settings panel lets you manage
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/manage-a-user">users</a>,
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user">deactivated users</a>,
and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users">invitations</a> in one place. You
can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions#view-users-by-role">filter</a> the
list of users in your organization by role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profile pictures are now shown alongside user names in settings, making it
easier to identify people at a glance. You can click on a name to open the
user’s <a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-cards">card</a>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/_astro/user-settings.BoX-g8Jg_Z9fg9B.webp" alt="" width="2296" height="770" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You now have a lot of flexibility for configuring direct message permissions
in your organization, with
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/restrict-direct-messages#restrict-direct-messages">new settings</a>
for who can <strong>authorize</strong> and <strong>start</strong> direct message conversations. These
settings are designed so that users can always respond to a direct message
they’ve received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now mark a custom profile field as
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/custom-profile-fields#make-a-custom-profile-field-required">required</a>,
to prompt everyone to fill it out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes#require-unique-names">require</a>
users to choose unique names in your organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When inviting users, you can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users#send-email-invitations">decide</a>
whether to receive a direct message when the invited user joins your
organization. An updated design makes the UI for
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/invite-new-users">inviting</a> new users easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now link to a user’s
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/view-someones-profile">profile</a>, to share it with
someone else.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improved-channel-administration">Improved channel administration</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zulip.com/help/create-a-channel">Creating a channel</a> is now a
smoother experience:
<ul>
<li>Adding subscribers is now a separate step from configuring channel settings.
Advanced settings are collapsed by default.</li>
<li>When you create a channel, you are now taken directly there if you are a
subscriber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Channel settings now show additional details, including when the channel was
created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is now a convenient UI for
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/generate-integration-url">configuring custom event filters</a>
for an integration. Documentation for over 60 integrations has been updated
with simplified instructions.</li>
<li>There are new integrations for
<a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/patreon">Patreon</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/githubsponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a>, and the
<a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/github">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/grafana">Grafana</a> integrations have been
improved.</li>
<li>We made extensive additions to Zulip’s API documentation, including
<a href="https://zulip.com/api/get-events#events-by-type">handy navigation</a> for
<a href="https://zulip.com/api/real-time-events">real-time push</a> event formats,
articles on important concepts like thumbnailing, and new documentation for
about a dozen previously documented API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<ul>
<li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 24.04, and drops support for Ubuntu
20.04.</li>
<li>The Zulip server now serves thumbnails of uploaded images for previews in the
message feed, greatly reducing bandwidth usage for most Zulip installations.
Images now load much faster for users in all Zulip apps.</li>
<li>The Zulip server has always scaled well, but this release comes with several
further efficiency improvements, which will make a big difference for

<p>Our community translators have been hard at work keeping up with the product as
it evolves. This release features translations that cover the majority of
non-error strings in 25 languages, including Gujarati for the first time.</p>

<p>We
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview/release-lifecycle.html#compatibility-and-upgrading">highly recommend</a>
upgrading to Zulip Server 9.0 to take advantage of the hundreds of improvements
in this release and future security updates. We work hard to ensure that
upgrades are smooth; you can upgrade by following the straightforward
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a>.
The
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#upgrade-notes">upgrade notes section of the changelog</a>
details changes you’ll want to understand before upgrading.</p>
<p>Commercial support for server upgrades is available for installations that
purchase a Business or Enterprise <a href="https://zulip.com/plans#self-hosted">plan</a>.
For community support, everyone is welcome to drop by the
<a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>.</p>
<p>Zulip Cloud is always up to date with the latest Zulip improvements.</p>

<p>We’re continuing to focus on improving the design of the Zulip web app, and
shipping next-generation mobile apps for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>We use project boards to publicly track goals for major
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/zulip/projects/9/views/12">server</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/zulip/projects/5/views/4">mobile</a> releases. These
boards are updated on an ongoing basis as priorities evolve, and many community
improvements integrated into Zulip are never specifically tracked as release
goals.</p>
<h2 id="release-schedule">Release schedule</h2>
<p>This release is coming out about seven months after the
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2024/07/15/zulip-8-0-released/">Zulip Server 8.0 release</a>
last December. We are targeting a shorter interval for the next major release,
which is expected in late 2024.</p>

<p>If you appreciate Zulip, please recommend it to someone you know, for work or
any other collaborative endeavor. If they say that Zulip won’t work for them,

<a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback">#feedback</a> channel in the
<a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>.
Feedback from current and potential users is a vital part of how we design and
prioritize improvements to Zulip.</p>

possible!</p>
