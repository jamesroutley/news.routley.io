<p>Participants in the Recognizing Preprint Peer Review workshop <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002502">posted a
paper</a>
in which they outlined a vision for increasing peer review of public preprints.
They, also, examined what progress has been made towards realizing that vision.</p>

<p>The paper shared data on the uptake in preprint review across 13 services. Some
of the services listed use crowdsourced review, but most take a journal-like
form with review organized and moderated by a team of editors.</p>

<p>You can find the raw numbers linked in one of the paper’s citations:</p>

<p>After 6 years, only a few thousand articles are being reviewed per year across
13 different services. And it looks like growth is stalling.</p>

<p>Compare that to Arxiv’s adoption:</p>

<p><img src="https://info.arxiv.org/help/stats/2021_by_area/newsubs.png" alt="Arxiv&#39;s adoption."/></p>

<p>After 6 years there were already 20,000 articles a year being shared through
Arxiv - a single preprint service.</p>

<p>So why is the adoption of preprint review so much slower than the adoption of
preprints themselves?  And why does it appear to be stalling?</p>

<h2 id="whats-blocking-adoption">What’s blocking adoption?</h2>

<p>All of these services suffer from <a href="https://www.theroadgoeson.com/crowdsourcing-peer-review-probably-wont-work">two of the three
impediments</a> that prevent the
adoption of crowdsourced review:</p>

<p>Scholars have no bandwidth for review and scholars are not free to leave the
journals. The ones that crowdsource also suffer from fears of bad actors in an
unmoderated context.</p>

<p><strong>Scholars have no bandwidth for review.</strong></p>

<p>They find time to review for traditional journals because it counts towards
their service work and journal editors lean on personal relationships or the
prestige of their journals, with an implied exchange of benefit. Journals are,
also, communities and people will go above and beyond for their communities.
Even with all of that, editors are really struggling to recruit reviewers.</p>

<p><strong>Scholars are not free to leave the journals.</strong></p>

<p>Scholars are required by their tenure and promotion committees to publish in a
limited set of journals. They aren’t really free to go outside of their
journals.</p>

<p>…so how did preprints get traction?</p>

<p>Preprints were able to get traction because they didn’t compete with journal
publishing. There was a direct benefit to scholars from sharing their work
through a preprinting service: they got it in the hands of their peers and
community that much sooner. The time it took was low compared to the benefit.
And they could still go on to publish it in a journal.</p>

<p>Preprint <em>review</em> does compete with journal review. It competes for scholar’s
most precious resource – their time.</p>

<p>It doesn’t offer the same benefits as journal review. It’s not clear preprint
review counts towards service work and the preprint review services don’t have
prestige to lean on. They can’t offer an implied exchange of benefits. And they
haven’t built significant communities yet (though many are working very hard to
do just that).</p>

<p>Preprint review services have to ask academics to sacrfice their most precious
resource in return for the promise of a better future.</p>

<p>We can’t afford to introduce additional barriers to adoption. But many of the
preprint review services have done just that through their design choices.</p>

<h2 id="making-it-harder-than-it-already-is">Making it Harder than it Already Is</h2>

<p>In user interface design, we have the concept of
<a href="https://www.fullstory.com/user-friction/">friction</a>.  Friction is anything
that slows the user down in accomplishing their task: clicks, typing, thinking,
or waiting. Some friction is unavoidable, but good system design always seeks
to drive friction down to the absolute minimum possible.</p>

<p>Many of these services have introduced friction into the process of reviewing
or seeking review for a preprint through their design choices. They chose to
build new platforms to run preprint review and layer them on top of the
existing preprint platforms, meaning adopters now have to contend with two
entirely separate platforms.</p>

<p>Some of the platforms ask reviewers to select a preprint on a preprint
platform, bring it to the review platform, and review it. Others ask authors to
submit to an existing preprint platform before submitting to the review
platform to have their paper reviewed.</p>

<p>To adopt preprint review through one of these platforms, users must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Become aware of the existence of a platform.</li>
  <li>Visit the platform.</li>
  <li>Understand what the platform is and what it is asking of them.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use the platform to give a review or submit a preprint for review.</li>
  <li>Find the preprint they want to review, or submit the preprint they want
reviewed, on another service. Meaning they have to:
    <ol>
      <li>Discover the preprint platform(s) for their discipline. <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></li>
      <li>Learn how to use the preprint platform.</li>
      <li>Find the preprint they want to review. Or submit the preprint they want
reviewed and wait for it to be accepted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to submit that preprint to the review platform.</li>
  <li>If they’re the reviewer, execute the review. If they’re an author, they have
to work through a journal-like review process.</li>
</ol>

<p>At any point, we could lose a user. Each step in the journey adds friction and
increases that risk substantially.</p>

<p>Some of these steps are unavoidable when you’re trying to build a new platform
(eg. 1,2,3,4). Others we have direct control over. Step 5 adds a ton of
friction not only to the initial adoption, but to each subsequent review and
submission. <a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/">COAR Notify</a> helps with
step 1 assuming the user is already on a preprint platform that has adopted it,
but not the rest of the process.</p>

<p>By adopting these designs, we’ve made an already uphill climb that much
steeper.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-differently">What can we do differently?</h2>

<p>We need to make adopting preprint review as frictionless as possible. We need
people to be able to do it with one click and for the option to do it to be
right in front of them where they already are. We need to integrate preprint
review directly scholar’s existing workflows. <a href="#footnote-2">[2: eLife]</a></p>

<p>That means it needs to be a core part of the existing preprint platforms. Even
better would be to integrate preprinting and preprint review directly into the
traditional publishing flows and platforms: eg. Scholar One or Editorial
Manager.</p>

<p>I’m assuming the folks working on preprint review tried to integrate directly
into the *rxiv diaspora, and weren’t able to. It wouldn’t be surprising if the
preprint services were wary of implementing review for fear the journals would
view it as direct competition and start refusing to accept preprinted
submissions.</p>

<p>It also seems highly unlikely that the commerical publishers are going to
integrate preprinting and preprint review into Editorial Manager or Scholar
One.</p>

<p>So are we stuck with high friction approaches? No. There’s a third option.</p>

<p>We can build a new platform, with preprinting and preprint review integrated
directly into the publishing flow, and bring the journals to that platform.</p>

<p>The commercial publishers and the journals are not the same thing. The journals
are their editorial teams and communities. Many (most?) of the editorial teams
are composed of scholars. We’ve seen communities follow editorial teams when
the editorial teams leave the commercial publishers.</p>

<p>If we could convince the editorial teams to run their journals on our new
platform, they would bring their authors and reviewers with them. That would
allow us to build preprinting and preprint review directly into scholar’s
primary publishing workflow. We could make it one click and achieve the
absolute minimum friction possible, which would give us the best chance of
adoption.</p>

<p>So is that possible? <strong>Yes.</strong> But that’s a story for another post.</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
  <li><a name="footnote-1"></a> Many of these services chose this architecture to
take advantage of the buy-in that existing preprint servers have. They were
hoping that this would eliminate steps 5.1 and 5.2. For those aware of the
preprint platforms, that works. But step 5.3 still adds substantial, repeated
friction to the workflow. And preprinting itself is still working towards
adoption. By some estimates 5 million scholarly articles are published a year,
but only 10 - 20 million preprints total have been shared in the last 30
years (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preprint_repositories">wikipedia</a>).</li>
  <li><a name="footnote-2"></a> There’s one service that doesn’t fit well into
this analysis: <a href="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</a>. By taking a traditional
journal and turning it into a preprint review service, they are very nearly
building preprint review into scholars existing flows… …<em>nearly</em>.  They
aren’t asking users to use two separate platforms, but they are asking users to
choose between reviewed preprint and traditional VOR at the outset. They got
some serious backlash from their community for doing it. It’s still early in
the experiment, so it remains to be seen how it will play out. But of all the
current attempts, this one removes the most barriers to adoption.</li>
