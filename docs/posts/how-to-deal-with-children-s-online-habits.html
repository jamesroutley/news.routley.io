    <h1>Ask HN: How to deal with children&#39;s online habits?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Or, more generally, how to give children freedom and privacy, yet also be there to help them understand the lessons the world is about to teach them?<p>I have this preconceived notion that I don&#39;t want to violate my children&#39;s privacy. It&#39;s very tempting, of course, to passively monitor e.g. their spending or online habits, but I don&#39;t want to.</p><p>(As a concrete example, I know a some people get very detailed reports from the daycare about what their children have been up to. I&#39;m not interested in that -- when I want to know what the daycare experience is like, I personally spend a day at the daycare.</p><p>This gives me much more nuance than a report ever would, but it also feels more respectful toward my child that they&#39;re allowed a part of their life outside of my supervision. But the reason I can do that is because there are other helpful adults at the daycare. That won&#39;t be the case everywhere, unfortunately.)</p><p>So I want them to have privacy, but I would also want to pick up on problems early -- either their own bad behaviour, or if they&#39;re victim&#39;s of someone else&#39;s bad behaviour.</p><p>Some more concrete questions in the same vein:</p><p>- What fraction of their online time should I sit with them?</p><p>- Do I play all video games with them or should they have some of &#34;their own&#34;?</p><p>- Do I give them the ability to do online purchases?</p><p>- Do I allow them to use up all of their money even as a mistake, or do I set up a limit?</p><p>- Do I limit their &#34;screen time&#34; (hate that term) or will that prevent them from interacting with their friends in the way they would want to?</p><p>This depends on maturity levels, of course, but I&#39;m looking for generalisations. My children are 2 and 0.2 years old now, so this won&#39;t be relevant in a while but I like to be prepared and if you have thoughts regarding any maturity level, please share.</p><p>The reason I ask you HN folks is (a) that you are likely to understand my concern for privacy and personal integrity, and (b) that I&#39;ve received very useful and thought-out child-related advice here before.</p><p>----</p><p>I&#39;m also skipping a bunch of privilege-related questions like &#34;who the hell can take a day off to spend it at the daycare?&#34; Or, perhaps more importantly, &#34;what determines how much time you spend online with your children may not be what&#39;s appropriate, but how much time you can spare for it?&#34;</p><p>And yeah, both of those are problems for myself as well -- I&#39;m interested in all creative solutions here, also that help work around such problems.</p></div></div>
