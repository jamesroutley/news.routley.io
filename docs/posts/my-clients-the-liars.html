    <p>
      I made <strong><a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">Dragula</a></strong>, a highly experimental extension to
      macOS that adds weight to one of the oldest
      user interface
      interactions ever: The Finder’s
      drag-and-drop interaction.
    </p>

    <p>In the world of Dragula, when you drag a file (or files), you will find
      it easier if the files are smaller in size, and harder if they are larger in size. A small GIF is easy to drag;
      you can likely move one across the screen while barely moving
      your mouse. But you might find it nigh impossible to move a large file, like a movie or the Xcode IDE. </p>

    <p>Indeed, in the
      world of Dragula, <em>every
        drag-and-drop interaction involving files is weighted</em>: individual files, folders, and even Finder windows.
    </p>

    <p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/pbt/dragula">source code</a>, or read on below to see why I did this
      and how I did it.</p>

    <h2>The unbearable weightlessness of drag-and-drop</h2>
    <p>Drag-and-drop has been a mainstay of
      personal
      computing since <a href="https://folklore.org/A_Floppy_named_lsadkfjalhkjh.html?sort=date?sort=date">it first
        showed up in the
        first Macintosh</a>.
      It’s easy to see why: We drag things around a lot in real life! Direct manipulation is incredibly powerful
      and intuitive. It’s so intuitive that there’s evidence we <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2460625.2460650">spend more effort to move digital things that represent
        heavy
        real-life things</a>. Despite our world becoming more virtual, drag-and-drop is arguably the most powerful
      interaction it has ever been.

    </p><p>And yet, every drag-and-drop interaction is designed to feel the same, no matter what you’re dragging.
      That made me curious: I wanted to
      play around with the conventions of drag and drop a little bit and I wanted to see what that would feel like.
      Differentiating
      drag and drop based on file size seemed like a great first step.</p>

    <p>(plus, I thought it would be silly)</p>
