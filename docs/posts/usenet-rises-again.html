    <h1>USENET rises again?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The USENET management committee has reconvened and there are green shoots of growth in the original, pre-World Wide Web social network.</p>
<p>USENET, or NetNews, is a text-only social discussions forum, or rather a set of a great many forums, called &#34;newsgroups,&#34; carried by multiple servers around the world. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds, and many are still running just fine. It never went away – it&#39;s still alive, you can get on it for free, and there is a choice of client apps for most OSes to help you navigate.</p>
<p>Although USENET is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, the Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority. Board member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Tristan_Miller" rel="nofollow">Tristan Miller</a> told <em>The Reg</em>: &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Jason_Evans" rel="nofollow">Jason Evans</a> and I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Press_releases/2020-11" rel="nofollow">re-established the Board</a> in 2020, after a long period of dormancy. We were joined a few months later by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Rayner_Lucas" rel="nofollow">Rayner Lucas</a>.&#34;</p>

    

<p>Among other things, the board manages the list of newsgroups, and now that there&#39;s an active board again, it has been busy. It deleted some very old groups at the moderators&#39; request, and added the first new newsgroup in many years for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/27/gemini_protocol/">the Gemini protocol</a>. If you have a News client, news:comp.infosystems.gemini ought to open it. The board has also revamped the website, run a Reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nn4vp8/were_the_usenet_big8_management_board_ask_us/" rel="nofollow">Ask Me Anything session</a>, updated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/stump/" rel="nofollow">GNU Stump</a> and WebStump packages used by moderators, and more.</p>

        


        

<p>USENET is older than the web, and works more like email: servers carry a list of newsgroups, and sync messages with each other. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds.</p>
<p>(One of the things that contributed to the downfall of USENET was when people worked out how to post binary files, encoded as multi-part blocks of ASCII text. It still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/12/a_pair_of_usenet_pirates_get_66_months_behind_bars/">has piracy problems</a> but you can just ignore that stuff. It was also the venue for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/history-advertising-no-195-canter-siegels-green-card-spam/1441026" rel="nofollow">first spam message</a> in internet history.)</p>

<p>Getting online is pretty easy. Get an account on a USENET server. Install a client, tell it the server address. Download the list of groups, subscribe to some, and new messages get delivered to your client. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk uses a service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eternal-september.org/" rel="nofollow">Eternal September</a>, after the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" rel="nofollow">event</a> when AOL added USENET access to its internet client and tens of thousands of newbies flooded in without knowing the rules. We&#39;ll give you one hint: scrupulously follow the &#34;netiquette&#34; of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">plain-text, bottom-posted email</a>.</p>

        

<p>Eternal September only carries text groups, no binaries, but it offers totally free accounts, whereas some higher-capacity servers such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eweka.nl/en" rel="nofollow">Eweka</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://giganews.com/" rel="nofollow">Giganews</a> charge for access.</p>
<p>As for a client – well, as we mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">when introducing their new ESR versions</a>, we use Thunderbird. It&#39;s free, it works, and it runs on all the big desktop OSes. There are lots out there, though. Even <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Groups</a> is still alive, if woefully neglected.</p>
<p>As a big science fiction reader, this vulture enjoys dipping into <code>rec.arts.sf.written</code> and <code>rec.arts.sf.fandom</code>. The computer history group <code>alt.folklore.computers</code> is still pretty busy. There is life in several retrocomputing channels, and we&#39;ve been enjoying talking about Acorn RISC OS and Fortran among other things. ®</p>
