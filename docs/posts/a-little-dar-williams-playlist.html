            <p data-block-key="8h7r0">Annually, the last week of the year, singer-songwriter Dar Williams plays at a <a href="https://darwilliams.com/blog/f/General_Music/804">concert</a> here in New York City. I really loved the one I attended in 2017, when I <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2017/blockchain-and-bitcoin-dar-williams-and-so-on/">wrote</a>,</p>

    <p>“She does this show in Brooklyn the last week of every year, and I&#39;m going to try to go now that I know that. 2018, 2019, 2020 -- something to look forward to in every year. I could use that.”</p>

<p data-block-key="yfxej">I tried going to that concert in 2022, and it was crowded with poor ventilation and I was one of the very few wearing a mask; I think I spent most of it sitting in the foyer just outside the room, listening to the muffled music, balancing my COVID caution with my desire to hear. In 2023 I stayed home.</p><p data-block-key="dgsh2">I longingly considered going to the 2024 concert, but realized I&#39;d probably have a similar experience as I&#39;d had in 2022. Instead I asked a friend who also enjoys <a href="https://darwilliams.com/product/f/Music/intro/">her music</a> if he&#39;d listen to a playlist with me. He doesn&#39;t much care for <i>End of the Summer</i> and mostly has her earlier work; here&#39;s what we put together and appreciated together on New Year&#39;s Eve. Fourteen songs, 56 minutes. A lot of heartstring-pullers, as I realized partway through.</p>
