said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, who produced the study. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster,&#34; she said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The UN acknowledges that achieving massive cuts in emissions is now a tall order. But it points to electricity, industry, transport and buildings as areas where rapid transformations away from fossil fuels can be made. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;ve got to take climate change with us wherever we go,&#34; said Ms Anderson. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Into the classrooms, into the boardrooms, into the voting booth, over the dinner table. We cannot let go of climate change.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As well as highlighting the slow pace of progress on tackling the causes of warming, other studies published this week show that governments are failing to prepare for the impacts of higher temperatures. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the UK, a committee of MPs and peers says the government needs to &#34;get a grip&#34; on the risk to critical infrastructure posed by a warming climate.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Firefighters battle blazes in the Amazon</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5803/jtselect/jtnatsec/132/report.html">report</a> of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy cites examples where severe weather has overwhelmed transport and communications. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>These include the deaths of three people from a train derailment in Scotland after heavy rainfall in August 2020, and the loss of electric power by almost 1m people during Storm Arwen in November 2021. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The thing I find most disturbing is the lack of evidence that anyone in government is focusing on how all the impacts can come together, creating cascading crises,&#34; said the chair of the Joint Committee, Dame Margaret Beckett MP.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There are simply no ministers with focused responsibility for making sure that our infrastructure is resilient to extreme weather and other effects of climate change.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While almost all the reports published this week underline the lack of progress on climate, there are some strong positives amidst the gloom. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/state-climate-action-2022">State of Climate Action</a> study says that in transport, a transition to sustainable travel is well underway.
