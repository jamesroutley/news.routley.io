for its propensity to scavenge food from anywhere it can - messily raiding garbage and often stealing food right out of people&#39;s hands.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the native bird may have figured out how to overhaul its bad reputation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It has developed an &#34;ingenious&#34; method of eating one of the only animals Australians hate more - the cane toad, a toxic and pervasive pest.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>First introduced to Australia in the 1930s, cane toads have no natural predators in the country and have wrought havoc on native animal populations.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The toad&#39;s skin contains venom which it releases when threatened, causing most animals that come into contact with it to die quickly of a heart attack.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Hence Emily Vincent&#39;s surprise when members of the community started sending her pictures and videos of ibis &#34;playing&#34; with the amphibians.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Vincent, who runs the invasive species programmes at environment charity Watergum, says the behaviour has been reported up and down Australia&#39;s east coast.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Ibis were flipping the toads about, throwing them in the air, and people just wondered what on earth they were doing,&#34; she told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;After this they would always either wipe the toads in the wet grass, or they would go down to a water source nearby, and they would rinse the toads out.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She believes it is evidence of a &#34;stress, wash and repeat&#34; method that the birds have developed to rid the toads of their toxins before swallowing them whole.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It really is quite amusing.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Clever-birds"><span role="text">&#39;Clever&#39; birds</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>It isn&#39;t the first time birds have been spotted eating cane toads, Macquarie University Professor Rick Shine told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They seem to be less susceptible to the poison than other animals, like snakes, mammals or crocodiles.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Supplied</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Toad expert Rick Shine says he hasn&#39;t heard of the behaviour before</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But they can still die from too much of it and it tastes &#34;awful&#34;, Prof Shine says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39348313">species spread across Australia</a>, birds like hawks and crows rather quickly figured out how to eat around the poison glands on their shoulder.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They would flip the toads on their back and rip out their insides, leaving the glands untouched.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But this is the first time Prof Shine - who has studied toads for 20 years - has heard of birds using a method like this to eat them whole.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Ibis do get an unfair reputation... [but] this demonstrates that these are clever birds,&#34; Ms Vincent says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They&#39;ve actually forced the cane toad to get rid of the toxin itself, they haven&#39;t had to mutilate it in any way. The cane toad is doing all the work for them.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Population-control"><span role="text">Population control</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Professor Shine and Ms Vincent both say it is a promising sign that native animals are learning to adapt to the toads, which are now estimated to number over 2 billion.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some species are slowly recognising the pests are &#34;a very bad choice for lunch&#34; and there are suggestions others are undergoing genetic changes that leave them less susceptible to the poison.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And then there are animals like the ibis that have worked out how to eat toads safely, which could help bring the population back under control. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They&#39;ve got an incredible breeding capacity... so with every female cane toad that&#39;s removed from the environment, it&#39;s the prevention of up to 70,000 new cane toads each year,&#34; Ms Vincent says.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>As well as poisoning predators, cane toads also dine on small native animals</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Most of the heavy lifting is being done by animals that Australia loves to hate - like the ibis, rodents or ants - Prof Shine says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;All of those animals are actually doing a wonderful job as an unseen army that are reducing the numbers of cane toads every year,&#34; Professor Shine says.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;So we really should be grateful for some of these unloved Australians.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="You-may-also-be-interested-in"><span role="text">You may also be interested in:</span></h2></p><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>The birds on the balcony that charmed TikTok</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
