            &#34;<strong>poline</strong>&#34; is an enigmatic color palette generator, that harnesses the mystical witchcraft of polar coordinates. Its
            methodology, defying conventional color science, is steeped in the esoteric knowledge of the early 20th century. This
            magical technology defies explanation, drawing lines between anchors to produce visually striking and otherworldly
            palettes. It is an indispensable tool for the modern generative sorcerer, and a delight for the eye.

          <h2>Terminology &amp; Working Principles</h2>
          <p>
            The name &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; represents the essence of the library - <strong>a polar line</strong>. 
            The combination of these two words symbolizes the process of creating a palette by drawing lines between <strong>anchor</strong> points. 
            This unique moniker encapsulates the heart and soul of this micro-library written in TypeScript.
          </p><p>
            In &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34;, <strong>anchors</strong> represent the points that the lines are drawn
            between.
            The number of <strong>points</strong> determines the number of colors generated between
            each pair of anchors. The more points, the more colors generated. The positions of these points are determined by
            <strong>position functions</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 id="summoning">Summoning</h2>
          <p>
            The use of &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; begins with the invocation of its command, which can be performed with or without arguments.
            If called without, the tool will generate a mesmerizing palette featuring two randomly selected <strong>anchors.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, one can choose to provide their own <strong>anchor</strong> points, 
            represented as a list of <strong>hsl</strong> values, for a more personal touch. 
            The power to shape and mold the colors lies in your hands.

        <div data-section="points">
          <h2 id="points">Points</h2>
          <p>
            The magic of &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; is revealed through its technique 
            of drawing lines between anchor points. The richness of the palette is determined 
            by the number of <strong>points</strong>, with each connection producing a unique color.
          </p>
          <p>
            As shown in the illustration, increasing the number of <strong>points</strong> will yield an even greater array of colors.
            By default, four points are used, but this can easily be adjusted through the &#39;numPoints&#39; property on your Poline
            instance, as demonstrated in the code example.
          </p>
          <!--p>
            As demonstrated on the illustration, "<strong class="t">Poline</strong>"
            works by drawing lines between the <strong>anchors</strong>. The number of <strong>points</strong>
            determines the number of colors generated between each pair of anchors. 
            The more <strong>points</strong> you have, the more colors you will get.
          </p-->
          <pre><code data-code="points"></code></pre>
          <p>
            The resulting palette is a product of points multiplied by the number of anchor pairs.
            It can be changed after initialization by setting the <strong>numPoints</strong> property on your &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; instance.

        <div data-section="anchors">
          <h2 id="anchors">Anchors</h2>
          <p>
            At the heart of &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; lies the concept of <strong>anchors</strong>, the fixed points that serve as the foundation for the creation of
            color palettes. <strong>Anchors</strong> are represented as a <strong>list of hsl</strong> values, which consist of three components: <strong>hue</strong> [0…360],
            <strong>saturation</strong> [0…1], and <strong>lightness</strong> [0…1]. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The choice is yours, whether to provide your own anchor points during
            initialization or to allow &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; to generate a random selection for you by omitting the &#39;anchorColors&#39; argument. The
            versatility of &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; extends beyond its initial setup, as you can also add anchors to your palette at any time using
            the &#39;<strong>addAnchor</strong>&#39; method. This method accepts either a <strong>color</strong> as HSL array values or an array of <strong>X, Y, Z</strong> coordinates, 
            further expanding the possibilities of your color creation.

          <p>
            With this feature, you have the power to fine-tune your palette and make adjustments as your creative vision
            evolves. So whether you are looking to make subtle changes or bold alterations, &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; is
            always ready to help you
            achieve your desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to update existing <string>anchors</string> is made possible through the &#39;<strong>updateAnchorPoint</strong>&#39; method. 
            This method accepts the <strong>reference to the anchor</strong> you wish to modify and either a color in the form of <strong>HSL</strong> 
            representation or an <strong>XYZ</strong> position array.

        <div data-section="positionFunction">
          <h2 id="positionFunction">Position Function</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>position function</strong> in &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; plays a crucial role in determining the <strong>distribution of colors between the anchors</strong>.
            It works similar to easing functions and can be imported from the &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; module.
          </p>
          <p>
            A position function is a mathematical function that maps a value <strong>between 0 and 1</strong> to another value between 0 and 1.
            By definition the same position function for all axes &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; will draw a straight line between the anchors.
            The chosen function will determine the distribution of colors between the anchors.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-code="positionFunction"></code></pre>
          <p>
            If none is provided, &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; will use the default function, which is a sinusoidal function.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following position functions are available and can be included by importing the <strong>positionFunctions</strong> object from the &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; module:
            </p><ul>
              <li>linearPosition</li>
              <li>exponentialPosition</li>
              <li>quadraticPosition</li>
              <li>cubicPosition</li>
              <li>quarticPosition</li>
              <li>sinusoidalPosition <strong>(default)</strong></li>
              <li>asinusoidalPosition</li>
              <li>arcPosition</li>
            </ul>
          
          <p><label>
              <span><span>Position Fn</span></span>
              
            </label>

      </article>
      <article>
        <div data-section="positionFunctions">
          <h2 id="positionFunctions">Arcs</h2>
          <p>
            By defining <strong>different position functions for each axis</strong>, you can control the distribution of colors along each axis 
            (<strong>positionFunctionX</strong>, <strong>positionFunctionY</strong>, <strong>positionFunctionZ</strong>). 
            This will draw different arcs and create a diverse range of color palettes.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-code="positionFunctions"></code></pre>

          <!--p>
            The <strong>position functions</strong> are used to determine the position of the 
            <strong>points</strong> between the <strong>anchors</strong>. The <strong>position functions</strong> 
            can be the same for XYZ (positionFunction) or different for each axis (positionFunctionX, positionFunctionY, positionFunctionZ).
          </p>
          <p>
            They function a lot like an easing function and can be imported from the <strong class="t">poline</strong> module.
          </p-->
          <!--p>
            Any function that takes a <strong>number between 0 and 1</strong> and returns a number between 0 and 1 can be used as a <strong>position function</strong>.
            The second argument is called `reverse`. It is a boolean set to true on every second connection between anchors.

          <p>
            By default, the palette is not a closed loop. This means that the last color generated is not the same as the first color.
            If you want the palette to be a closed loop, you can set the <strong>closedLoop</strong> argument to true.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-code="closedLoop"></code></pre>
          <p>
            It is also possible to close the loop after the fact by setting <strong>poline.closedLoop = true|false</strong>.

          <p>
            With the power of hue shifting, &#34;<strong>Poline</strong>&#34; provides yet another level of customization. 
            This feature allows you to <strong>shift the hue</strong> of the colors generated by a certain amount, giving you the ability to animate your
            palette or create similar color combinations with different hues.&#34;
          </p>
          <p>
            &#34;<strong>poline</strong>&#34; supports hue shifting. This means that the hue of the colors will be shifted by a certain amount.
            This can be useful if you want to animate the palette or generate a palette that looks similar to your current palette but using different hues.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-code="hueShift"></code></pre>
          <p>
            The amount is a int or float between -Infinity and Infinity. It will permanently shift the hue of all colors in the palette.

          <p>
            In some situations, you might want to know which anchor is closest to a certain position or color.
            This method is used in the visualizer to select the closest anchor on click.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-code="closestAnchor">poline.getClosestAnchorPoint(

            The <strong>maxDistance</strong> argument is optional and will return null if the closest anchor is further away
            than the maxDistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any of the <strong>xyz</strong> or <strong>hsl</strong> components can be null. If they are <strong>null</strong>, they will be ignored.
