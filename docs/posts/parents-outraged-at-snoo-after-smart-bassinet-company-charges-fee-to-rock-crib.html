If parents use the bassinet for five months, that&#39;s an extra $100 fee on top of the hefty purchase price. </p><div><figure><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/18/newFile-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A child sleeping in a Snoo bassinet.

At that point, many parents either hand down their newborn gear to friends or relatives with newborns, or post them for sale on online hand-me-down markets. </p><p>With the new pricing scheme in place, the Snoo will be able to continue collecting cash from parents even after its been handed down several times. </p><p>Parents angry with the change has prompted some backlash, with calls for review bombs and instructions for how to complain to the company being shared on social media. </p><p>Happy Baby customers received an email in June alerting them to the change in pricing. Buyers who picked up a Snoo before July 15 were grandfathered into the previous structure, while anyone who bought after that was locked into the subscription model. </p><p>Andrew Gwin, a father who bought the Snoo, told the <em>Times</em> he likened the new pay structure to having to shell out extra to use an iPhone&#39;s camera or a car&#39;s radio. </p><p>He said he had a great experience using the Snoo with his first child. The family has a second on the way, but said they won&#39;t be paying for the subscription. He has gone so far as to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission over the app&#39;s price. </p><div><figure><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/09/db2c7451e790996846edf93c7063cb52Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzMTg5OTQ2-2.73233002.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/09/db2c7451e790996846edf93c7063cb52Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzMTg5OTQ2-2.73233002.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/09/db2c7451e790996846edf93c7063cb52Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzMTg5OTQ2-2.73233002.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A baby who is wide awake and not sleeping in its Snoo" on="tap:auto-image-gallery,inline-image-carousel.goToSlide(index=2)" tabindex="0" role="button" data-gallery-length="3"/></p><figcaption>A baby who is wide awake and not sleeping in its Snoo<span> <!-- -->(<!-- -->PA Archive<!-- -->)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“It’s clearly a way to punish those who go to the secondhand market and just add a tax on top of the expenses the parents already face,” he told the <em>Times</em>. </p><p>The company&#39;s founder, Harvey Karp, said the pricing change was necessary to &#34;bring in revenue,&#34; noting that the company was not underwritten by a university or the government, and must survive on its sales alone. </p><p>He said his ultimate goal would be to see the Snoo paid for by the government or by insurance companies, but it&#39;s unclear if there has been any substantive movement toward achieving that end. </p><p>Karp is a former pediatrician, and said he developed the Snoo in order to help prevent SIDS — sudden infant death syndrome. Babies placed in the Snoo have to be strapped in, preventing them from rolling around. That nighttime movement can lead to SIDS, according to the<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm"> US Centers for Disease Control</a>. </p><p>Approximately 3,400 babies die from SIDS every year, the CDC reports. </p></div></div>
