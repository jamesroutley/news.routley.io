    <h1>How to build a website without frameworks and tons of libraries</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
An innocent question <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/21-websites-for-free-illustrations-29a45232db" target="_blank">was posted</a> on IndieHackers the other day:
<span>&#34;I&#39;m asking what did you use to build your website&#34;</span>.
    </p><p>
The question also had a second part.
So just to be fair, here it is in its entirety: <span>&#34;I&#39;m asking what did you use to build your website, I really love the design and feeling of kodingkitty.&#34;</span></p><p>
But this post is not about people loving our website.
Although we&#39;re obviously happy about that.
    </p><h2>The shocking truth</h2><p>
The question sparked an idea to write about the tech stack that KodingKitty team uses for its own web.
And we warn you beforehand: it&#39;s so simple that some of you might find it shocking.
    </p><p>
You have been warned.
    </p><h2>Hype is just a coincidence</h2><p>
Our tech stack has nothing to do with the current hype about lightweight or simplified web development.
Not everyone rides that wave, and that&#39;s fine.
    </p><p>
On the other hand, we believe that in many cases, &#34;back to the roots&#34; or &#34;simplicity is the ultimate perfection&#34; is a better solution for customers than convoluted web of overused frameworks and libraries.
    </p><p>
To put it another way, the solution we designed for our website and the current hype is just a coincidence.
Our stack is simple because we wanted something pragmatic with minimal friction for the developers.
    </p><p>
And even though we wanted Koding Kitty website to have a distinctive yet subtle design, it is important to mention that it could have been achieved in many other ways.
    </p><h2>Comparing options</h2><p>
Our website and the way it is built comes from our past experience.
    </p><p>
We had the chance to work with different web frameworks in the past.
We know this is a luxury not everyone has.
It has allowed us to compare different technologies and decide what works best for us.
    </p><p>
From the beginning we agreed to start with a static website.
After all, what does a kitty&#39;s web really need?
A front page, a showcase, a blog ... and probably not much more.
At least in the beginning.
    </p><h2>Our requirements</h2><p>
We set the following set of requirements:
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
What are the options today to have a website with the above requirements?
    </p><h2>Wordpress (and similar CMS)</h2><p>
Nothing against WordPress, it&#39;s done a tremendous job for the internet but ...</p><p>
We don&#39;t need to store our content in a database.
We don&#39;t need to deal with plugins.
We don&#39;t need a visual editor to write our content.
    </p><h2>No-Code</h2><p>
Yes, that&#39;s one area where there&#39;s a lot of the hype these days.
    </p><p>
But to be a web coder and use a no-code tool?
Seriously?
It sounds weird.
    </p><p>
We want to own our content.
We want to do whatever we want with our web.
We can code a website faster than we can build it in the no-code WYSIWYG editor.
    </p><p>
The last point is that such tool still requires initial (and then ongoing) learning.
    </p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>
We have an experience with frameworks.
    </p><p>
But, did we want to do the whole setup?
Although it can be done quickly, we would end up with too many parts.
Like a database, configuration, libraries, admin, and so on.
Yes, it is a fully customizable solution, but we would end up with something that resembles WordPress.
    </p><p>
And that&#39;s not what we wanted.
    </p><h2>Jamstack (aka Site generators)</h2><p>
Static site generators look like a tempting option for our needs, don&#39;t they?
    </p><p>
Just pick a programming language, do some coding, press a button (or run a script) and voila ...</p><p>
Unfortunately, Jamstack tools require an initial setup and an initial (and continuous) learning.
    </p><p>
We understand, that writing a blog in markdown is convenient, but taking all things into consideration we decided for simpler solution.
    </p><h2>KittyStack</h2><p>
Our solution is obvious, when you review our requirements (repeated below for your convenience):
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
Let&#39;s discuss them one by one:
    </p><h2>Fast website</h2><p>
Is a static website fast?</p><h2>Fast development</h2><p>
Now, you may be thinking: &#34;If you&#39;re not writing your content in markdown, you&#39;re not using a fancy editor, then what are you using?&#34;
    </p><p>
We write our content in HTML!
    </p><p>
Take a look at our website.
For the kind of posts we publish there, HTML is ideal.
We mix the text with HTML/CSS/JS widgets, so it makes sense to have a post written directly in HTML.
    </p><h2>Inexpensive hosting</h2><p>
Is hosting a static site inexpensive?
    </p><p>
It depends on the provider and all the bells and whistles you decide you need.
    </p><p>
We decided to go with the absolute minimum, because hosting static sites doesn&#39;t require a massive hardware setup.
    </p><p>
Mind you, Hetzner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting" target="_blank">webhosting</a> starts at 2 EUR!
How crazy is that?
    </p><p>
And if you are worried that your site will not survive a massive spike in traffic - like when your post hits the front page of Hacker News - it probably will.
At least our site did.
    </p><h2>Minimal complexity</h2><p>
We insisted on minimal complexity, but some of our pages and posts have repeating patterns.
    </p><p>
While it is possible to use a copy+paste routine, it can quickly get out of control.
Using some form of loops would help a lot.
Also, the ability to include some blocks of code - like header, footer, and the alike - would be beneficial.
    </p><h2>Templating to the rescue</h2><p>
And so we come to the last piece of the puzzle.
    </p><p>
Meet <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/" target="_blank">Jinja</a> templates, which make our life much easier.
Jinja allows us to use loops, include files (navigation bar, footer, etc.) and much more.
    </p><p>
Plus, we didn&#39;t have to learn a new system as we were already using frameworks based on Jinja before.
    </p><h2 id="kittys-tool-chain">A simple toolchain</h2><p>
Now you might be wondering how we generate the final, static page.
    </p><p>
We use a short Python script with exactly 45 lines of code.
<span>Including comments and blank lines.</span></p><p>
In summary, this is the simple toolchain for building our web:
    </p><ul><li>Developer updates index.src.html</li><li>Watchdog.py detects the file change and ...</li><li>... renders Jinja template into index.html and ...</li><li>... calls <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS CLI</a> to generate styles.min.css.</li></ul><!-- Widget --><div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="0.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10 2l-.15 .005a2 2 0 0 0 -1.85 1.995v6.999l-2.586 .001a2 2 0 0 0 -1.414 3.414l6.586 6.586a2 2 0 0 0 2.828 0l6.586 -6.586a2 2 0 0 0 .434 -2.18l-.068 -.145a2 2 0 0 0 -1.78 -1.089l-2.586 -.001v-6.999a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-4z" stroke-width="0" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10.325 4.317c.426 -1.756 2.924 -1.756 3.35 0a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 2.573 1.066c1.543 -.94 3.31 .826 2.37 2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 1.065 2.572c1.756 .426 1.756 2.924 0 3.35a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -1.066 2.573c.94 1.543 -.826 3.31 -2.37 2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -2.572 1.065c-.426 1.756 -2.924 1.756 -3.35 0a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -2.573 -1.066c-1.543 .94 -3.31 -.826 -2.37 -2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -1.065 -2.572c-1.756 -.426 -1.756 -2.924 0 -3.35a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 1.066 -2.573c-.94 -1.543 .826 -3.31 2.37 -2.37c1 .608 2.296 .07 2.572 -1.065z"></path><path d="M9 12a3 3 0 1 0 6 0a3 3 0 0 0 -6 0"></path></svg><p><span>watchdog.py</span><span>renders Jinja template</span><span>calls Tailwind CLI</span></p></div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="0.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10 2l-.15 .005a2 2 0 0 0 -1.85 1.995v6.999l-2.586 .001a2 2 0 0 0 -1.414 3.414l6.586 6.586a2 2 0 0 0 2.828 0l6.586 -6.586a2 2 0 0 0 .434 -2.18l-.068 -.145a2 2 0 0 0 -1.78 -1.089l-2.586 -.001v-6.999a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-4z" stroke-width="0" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></div><p>
It&#39;s also important to mention following:
    </p><ul><li>During development, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server" target="_blank">Live Server</a> serves files and reloads them as they change.</li><li>When it&#39;s time to publish, the files are uploaded <span>manually</span> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP</a>.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
Web development can be kept simple without sacrificing too much.
    </p><p>
In fact, it can be liberating to limit yourself to just a few options.
And based on what we&#39;ve seen so far, many customers would benefit from having solutions that are faster, simpler and cheaper.
    </p><p>
But don&#39;t just take our word for it.
Take a look around the web and ask yourself: could the same result be achieved using a less complex tech stack?
