<p>Google has agreed to pay Canadian news businesses $100 million a year to comply with the country&#39;s Online News Act, despite previously saying it would remove Canadian news links from search rather than make the required payments.</p>
<p>Google and government officials agreed to a deal that lets Google negotiate with a single news collective and reduce its overall financial obligation. Facebook owner Meta is meanwhile holding firm in its opposition to payments.</p>
<p>&#34;Google will contribute $100 million in financial support annually, indexed to inflation, for a wide range of news businesses across the country, including independent news businesses and those from Indigenous and official-language minority communities,&#34; Minister of Canadian Heritage Pascale St-Onge said in a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2023/11/statement-by-minister-st-onge-on-next-steps-for-the-online-news-act.html">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The $100 million in Canadian currency is worth about $74 million in US currency. Before today&#39;s deal, the federal government <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-news-act-google-meta-1.6954656">estimated</a> that Google would have to pay $172 million a year.</p>
<p>&#34;After extensive discussions, the Canadian Government agreed to a number of changes to address our deeply held concerns that C-18 would require payment for links and create uncapped financial liability through an unworkable bargaining process, simply for helping Canadians find relevant and useful information,&#34; Google said in a statement provided to Ars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-18/royal-assent">C-18 law</a> contains a &#34;duty to bargain&#34; requiring large search engines and social media services to negotiate payments with news businesses or groups of news businesses. In June, six months before the law&#39;s implementation, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/google-tells-canada-it-wont-pay-link-tax-will-pull-news-links-from-search/">Google said</a> it would not pay the &#34;link tax&#34; and instead would remove links to Canadian news sources from Google Search and Google News for users who access the services in Canada.</p>
<h2>Payments based on number of journalists</h2>
<p>Today, Google thanked St-Onge &#34;for acknowledging our concerns and deeply engaging in a series of productive meetings about how they might be addressed.&#34; The resulting deal provides &#34;a streamlined path to an exemption at a clear commitment threshold,&#34; <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-ca/company-news/outreach-initiatives/an-update-on-canadas-bill-c-18-and-our-search-and-news-products/">Google said</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>&#34;While we work with the government through the exemption process based on the regulations that will be published shortly, we will continue sending valuable traffic to Canadian publishers,&#34; Google said.</p>
<p>The Canadian government confirmed that Google will be allowed to negotiate with a single collective, instead of separately with multiple news organizations or groups of news organizations. &#34;Google will have the option to work with a single collective to distribute its contribution to all interested eligible news businesses based on the number of full-time equivalent journalists engaged by those businesses,&#34; St-Onge said.</p>
<p>New rules to effect the change will be implemented before the Online News Act is enforced. St-Onge&#39;s announcement said the Canadian Heritage agency &#34;will share more details about the final regulations following approval by the Treasury Board of Canada and prior to the Act coming into effect on December 19, 2023.&#34;</p>
<p>Google said that &#34;under the revised regulations, there is a path for publishers to continue to receive valuable traffic... which Google can allocate through a deal with a single collective of its choosing. Importantly, this will allow Google to bypass the requirement to settle with publishers directly or individually, and any corresponding mandatory bargaining obligations.&#34;</p>
<h2>No Canadian news on Facebook</h2>
<p>Meta, the other company affected by the Online News Act, &#34;ended its talks with the government last summer and stopped distributing Canadian news on Facebook and Instagram,&#34; the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/google-online-news-act-1.7043330">CBC noted</a> today.</p>
<p>Meta hasn&#39;t changed its stance. &#34;Unlike search engines, we do not proactively pull news from the Internet to place in our users&#39; feeds and we have long been clear that the only way we can reasonably comply with the Online News Act is by ending news availability for people in Canada,&#34; Meta told the CBC.</p>
<p>Canadian officials previously estimated that Facebook would have to pay $62 million a year, but the deal with Google suggests that Meta could lower that amount significantly. Meta reportedly hasn&#39;t resumed talks with the government.</p>
<p>&#34;This [deal with Google] shows that this legislation works,&#34; St-Onge said, according to the CBC. &#34;Now it&#39;s on Facebook to explain why they&#39;re leaving their platform to disinformation and misinformation instead of sustaining our news system.&#34;</p>
