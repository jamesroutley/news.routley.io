<p>After six years of finding jobs that would pay me to travel the world, I was determined to somehow<em> </em><strong>get paid to live in Antarctica</strong>, too– the final frontier and the last continent in my quest to <a href="https://wandereatwrite.com/7-continents-7-seas-how-i-got-paid-to-travel-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit all seven continents and sail through the Seven Seas</a>.</p>

<p>It was only after seeing Anthony Bourdain’s trip down to “the ice” (Antarctica) on <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_Parts_Unknown" target="_blank">Parts Unknown</a></em> (<em>go ahead, roll your eyes; I have no shame</em>) that I realized it was possible to see the white continent the same way I’d seen the rest of this planet: with a paycheck.</p>
<p><em><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://wandereatwrite.com/7-continents-7-seas-how-i-got-paid-to-travel-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>7 Continents &amp; 7 Seas: How I Got Paid to Travel the World</strong></a></em></p>
<p>Tony inspired a lot of people with that Antarctica episode– not just me– to see and experience life on the ice.</p>
<p>Now nearly four years into my ice career, I hope this guide serves to inspire and encourage the next; to spark an interest in the mesmerizing, unique, and last untouchable place on this planet that is Antarctica.</p>
    




<h2 id="can-you-live-in-antarctica">Can you live in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>While there are a select handful of tourist expeditions that offer overnight experiences in Antarctica, the only people who actually live on the ice are those working at research facilities.</p>
<p>If you work at one of the research stations in Antarctica, you can live on the ice for approximately up to a year and a half at a time before you need to go off continent for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Internationally, there are currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_stations_in_Antarctica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43 active permanent research stations</a> operating year-round in Antarctica with an additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_stations_in_Antarctica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 facilities with seasonal operations</a> in the summer (as of 2020).</p>
<p>The United States has three permanent research stations in Antarctica:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wandereatwrite.com/life-at-mcmurdo-station-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McMurdo Station</a>:</strong> the largest station on the continent and located on Ross Island</li>

<p>There are two general categories of people who get hired to live and work on Antarctic research stations: <strong>scientists and support staff</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-scientists-needed-in-antarctica">Why are scientists needed in Antarctica?</h3>
<p>The White Continent is central to understanding a lot about our world: the environment, the climate, the oceans, the atmosphere, space, and so much more. </p>
<p>This is due to Antarctica being largely untouched and uninhabited unlike other continents, as well as its unique location and environment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a time when science is held in open contempt…when painfully acquired data is actually being deleted from computers if it conflicts with preconceived policies, these guys are looking at some deep stuff.</p>
<cite>Anthony Bourdain, Parts Unknown: Antarctica</cite></blockquote>
<p>The scientific findings from Antarctica provide us with rich information about the world that extends through numerous areas of studies.</p>
<p>From biologists studying the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcmurdo-dry-valleys" target="_blank">Dry Valleys</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.antarctica.gov.au/news/2019/nasa-space-robot-tested-in-antarctica/" target="_blank">NASA </a>utilizing the ice’s rare conditions to test equipment for future space missions, there is an abundance of research activity happening in the harshest continent on Earth.</p>
<ul><h4 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h4><li>Antarctica is home to 4/5 of all known <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/hunting-for-antarcticas-lost-meteorites/583564/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meteorites</a></li><li>One of the eight ground-based radio telescopes used to capture the first image of the black hole was located at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=298276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Pole</a></li><li>Antarctica is <a href="https://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the largest desert</a> in the world</li></ul>
<h3 id="what-support-staff-jobs-are-in-antarctica">What support staff jobs are in Antarctica?</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, it takes a village.</p>
<p>On the ice, science cannot move forward without a team of people to support them with all the necessary provisions: operating facilities, mechanics, machine operators, cooks, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, medical staff, firefighters, airfield operators– the list goes on. </p>
<p>Any job you could think of that is needed to run a small and isolated town, there’s probably a position for that.</p>
