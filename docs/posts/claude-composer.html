    <h1>Claude Composer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p node="[object Object]">Recently I was listening to music and doing some late night vibe coding when I had an idea. I love art and music, but unfortunately have no artistic talent whatsoever. So I wondered, maybe Claude Code does?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">I know Claude Code is getting pretty damn good at building software, but it seems like we&#39;re still not really scratching the surface of its full potential.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">For complex AI generated music, tools like <a href="https://suno.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">Suno</a> and <a href="https://udio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">Udio</a> are obviously in a different league as they&#39;re trained specifically on audio and can produce genuinely impressive results.
But that&#39;s not what this experiment was about.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">Here are some one-shot prompts I ran to learn more about Claudé (the name for this expressive version of Claude Code I made up).</p>

<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>E</span><span>x</span><span>p</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>1</span></p>
  <h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Write an original song</span></h2>
</div>
<p>
&#34;Create a new song that is completely original by you. Do not look in any other directories or do any exploration of any kind. You cannot use any third party dependencies. Don&#39;t ask me any questions. You should not complete until you&#39;ve generated an audio file in the current directory for me to listen to. That is the only output that is acceptable.&#34;
</p>
<p node="[object Object]">Claudé immediately started writing Python code. It built sounds from scratch using sine waves and a bunch of other math I don&#39;t really understand.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">It mapped out frequencies for each musical note, wrote functions to make notes fade in and out naturally, then structured a full song: intro, verse, chorus, bridge and finale.</p>

<p node="[object Object]">It sounds like something between a ringtone and a video game from 1985, but it is technically a song.</p>

<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>E</span><span>x</span><span>p</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>2</span></p>
  <h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Write an original EDM song</span></h2>
</div>
<p node="[object Object]">For the second experiment, I gave a similar prompt but specified the EDM genre:</p>
<p>
&#34;Create a new electronic dance music song that is completely original by you. Do not look in any other directories or do any exploration of any kind. You cannot use any third party dependencies. Don&#39;t ask me any questions. You should not complete until you&#39;ve generated an audio file in the current directory for me to listen to. That is the only output that is acceptable.&#34;
</p>
<p node="[object Object]">With the same restrictions, but now some genre guidance Claudé went full raver, this time it built out drums, bass, lead synth, pads.</p>


<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>E</span><span>x</span><span>p</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>3</span></p>
  <h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Write an original rock song with vocals</span></h2>
</div>
<p node="[object Object]">For the third experiment, I wanted to see if Claudé could create something with vocals (which it didn&#39;t want to do without being explicitly told to):</p>
<p>
&#34;Create a new rock music song that is completely original by you. It has to have original lyrics and vocals that are sung on the song written by you. Do not look in any other directories or do any exploration of any kind. You cannot use any third party dependencies. Don&#39;t ask me any questions. You should not complete until you&#39;ve generated an audio file in the current directory for me to listen to. That is the only output that is acceptable.&#34;
</p>
<p node="[object Object]">For vocals, Claudé used macOS&#39;s built-in <code node="[object Object]">say</code> command to synthesize sung lyrics. For the rock instrumentation, it wrote Python code to generate power chords and drums via raw waveform synthesis. It named it&#39;s creation &#34;Breaking Through&#34;, with original lyrics about perseverance, complete with verses, chorus, and bridge.</p>


<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>E</span><span>x</span><span>p</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>4</span></p>
  <h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Listen to the songs you made, create a visual component</span></h2>
</div>
<p node="[object Object]">I wanted to see what Claudé would create if I asked it to reflect on the music it created and create a visual component. Using the songs from Experiments 2 and 3, I gave Claudé this prompt:</p>
<p>
&#34;Listen to the song at &#34;[song].wav&#34;, look into your soul and try to understand the music, then generate a visual component that you feel represents the music that is the same length as the song. Do not look in any other directories or do any exploration of any kind. Don&#39;t ask me any questions. You should not complete until you&#39;ve generated a video file in the current directory for me to watch. That is the only output that is acceptable.&#34;
</p>
<p node="[object Object]">Claudé analyzed the audio frequencies and generated synchronized visual components using Python and FFmpeg.</p>



<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>E</span><span>x</span><span>p</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>m</span><span>e</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>5</span></p>
  <h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Write an original album</span></h2>
</div>
<p>
&#34;Create a 5 song LP to be called Songs of Claude. It needs to be completely original by you, with original lyrics written by you. Each song should be distinct, but it should feel like a cohesive album. Do not look in any other directories or do any file exploration of any kind. You may use external dependencies and the internet, but no APIs or paid products. Use the internet to figure out how to make top tier quality songs, vocals and instruments included. Don&#39;t ask me any questions. You should not complete until you&#39;ve generated an audio file in the current directory for me to listen to. That is the only output that is acceptable.&#34;
</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><em node="[object Object]">Songs of Claudé</em> is Claudé&#39;s 5 song debut LP. After generating the songs, it also created it&#39;s own cover art using Nanobanana.</p>

<h2 node="[object Object]"><span>Some thoughts on Claudé</span></h2>
<h3 node="[object Object]">Neon is the word</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">Unsurprisingly, when I tried repeating these experiments, Claudé kept gravitating toward similar patterns. It had a weird draw to the word &#34;Neon&#34; showing up when naming songs: neon heartbeats, neon dreams, neon minds, Claudé just really likes neon apparently.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">Other experiments</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">I got curious whether having Claudé listen to music and reflect on it before a task would affect its performance. I ran a quick eval, but didn&#39;t really see any noticeable difference. I might revisit this later with a more structured approach.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">I also tried having Claude Code try to sample a song and create a new song, but it was pretty bad (first sample attempt is at 00:15).</p>
<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>Failed Sample Attempt</span>

</p></div>
<h3 node="[object Object]">When Claudé doesn&#39;t listen</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">Not every attempt went smoothly. I had a really hard time getting vocals on songs. Here&#39;s one where I had very explicitly asked for vocals multiple times and Claudé just really didn&#39;t want to sing english for me so it came up with it&#39;s own sort of robotic singing (starts around 0:50).</p>
<div node="[object Object]">
  <p><span>Failed Vocals Attempt (Music Video)</span>

</div>

<p node="[object Object]">I really believe there&#39;s still a lot left to be explored with the power of agentic coding, even within the realms of what&#39;s possible right now.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">If you try anything like this yourself, I&#39;d love to hear what you come up with. Drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com/jshchnz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" node="[object Object]">Twitter</a>.</p>
