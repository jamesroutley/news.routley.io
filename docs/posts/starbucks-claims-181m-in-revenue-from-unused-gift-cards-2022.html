<p><span data-contrast="auto">The amount of unused credit claimed that year was up from $145 million in fiscal year 2000, Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-16/starbucks-181m-in-unused-gift-cards-sparks-complaint-to-sec-sbux?sref=zNmRQ0gk#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">reported</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> Wednesday (Nov. 16).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The growing amount of money left by customers on their stored-value cards and accounts was disclosed by the </span><a href="https://thesoc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Strategic Organizing Center</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, an organization composed of labor unions, which filed a complaint Wednesday with the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (SEC) in which it requested an investigation into how the company accounts for that unused money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sources interviewed by Bloomberg said Starbucks’ disclosures around breakage — revenue from services that are paid for but not used — are less detailed than those offered by other companies, even though credit is a significant component of its financial health.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">About 43% of Starbucks’ revenue in fiscal year 2021 came from stored-value programs — a category of products that includes gift cards and rewards that are credits in the company’s loyalty app, according to the report.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>A Starbucks spokesperson declined PYMNTS<span data-contrast="auto">’ request for</span> comment other than to share a link to the company<span data-contrast="auto">’</span>s most recent annual report.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This report comes about two weeks after Starbucks executives said the company plans to partner with additional companies for </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/loyalty-and-rewards-news/2022/starbucks-seeks-new-partners-caffeinate-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">cross-brand rewards</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As PYMNTS reported at the time, Starbucks is something of a leader in the restaurant loyalty space, with its loyalty program members contributing 55% of revenue — way over-indexing relative to the general restaurant customer population.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition, the brand saw its base of active loyalty members grow 16% year over year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
