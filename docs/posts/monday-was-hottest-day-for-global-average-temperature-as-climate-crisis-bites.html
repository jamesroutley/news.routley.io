In parts of China, an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/as-beijing-swelters-activists-hope-the-heat-will-prompt-climate-action">enduring heatwave</a> continued, with temperatures above 35C (95F). North Africa has seen temperatures near 50C (122F), with, in the Middle East, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/thousands-suffer-heat-stress-on-hajj-pilgrimage-as-temperatures-reach-48c">thousands suffering</a> from unusually scorching heat during the hajj religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>And even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica">Antarctica</a>, currently in its winter, registered anomalously high temperatures, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/25/slowing-ocean-current-caused-by-melting-antarctic-ice-could-have-drastic-climate-impact-study-says">glacier melt</a> accelerates and the sun intensifies. Ukraine’s Vernadsky research base, in the vast frozen continent’s Argentine Islands, recently broke its July temperature record with a reading of 8.7C (47.6F).</p><p>Jeni Miller, executive director of the California-based Global Climate and Health Alliance, an international consortium of health organizations, said: “People around the world are already enduring climate impacts, from heatwaves, wildfires and air pollution to floods and extreme storms. Global warming is also exacerbating crop losses and the spread of infectious diseases, as well as migration.”</p><p>She added: “The extraction and use of coal, oil and gas harm people’s health, are the primary driver of warming and are incompatible with a healthy climate future. That’s all the more reason that governments must prepare to deliver a commitment at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop28">Cop28</a> to phase out all fossil fuels, and a just transition to renewable energy for all.”</p><p>Climate scientist Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Britain’s Imperial College London, said: “It’s a death sentence for people and ecosystems.”</p><p>Scientists lamented the climate crisis, accelerated by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/04/climate-heating-el-nino-has-arrived-and-threatens-lives-declares-un">El Niño weather pattern</a>, the latest of which the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned this week had begun.
