<div><p>While it’s widely accepted heat pumps can keep homes warm in regions that don’t experience extreme cold, their performance in chilly parts of the world is frequently debated. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00351-3">new paper</a> out of Oxford University has put much of that skepticism to rest.</p><p>Heat pumps work by absorbing heat from the air outside — the colder it gets, the harder the units have to work to keep spaces warm. That’s where the doubt comes in: if heat pumps have to work overtime to create energy, are they really better than other heating sources? </p><p>Published Monday in the scientific journal Joule, the research found heat pumps are two to three times more efficient — or, use two to three times less energy — than their oil and gas counterparts, specifically in temperatures ranging from 10 C to -20 C. </p><div><div id="inline-newsletter-form"><div id="signup-form-container-mailchimp-signup-subscribe-block-mc-signup-newsletter-email-form"><p><h4>Get daily news from <span>Canada&#39;s National Observer</span></h4></p></div></div></div><p>The research debunks misinformation often spread about heat pumps, says Duncan Gibb, senior adviser with the Regulatory Assistance Project, an international NGO focusing on energy, which published the peer-reviewed paper with Oxford.</p><p>While a heat pump will have to work harder during sub-zero temperatures, it will still be more efficient than other sources of heat, explained Gibb.</p></div><div><p>The gas industry in Europe and the fossil fuel industry in Canada try to use the efficiency drop heat pumps have in cold weather as an argument to disqualify them as a practical home heating source, Gibb said.</p><p>Not so. “Their efficiency doesn&#39;t decline to such levels where they&#39;re disqualified,” said Gibb, who is from Nova Scotia but now lives in France.</p><div><div> <h3>What people are reading</h3> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <article role="article"> <figure> <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/09/12/news/tsx-investors-oil-gas-energy-transition"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/nat_teaser/public/img/2023/09/12/2023091113098-dab3e2eacf660e3daaa3ce1ae270192aa98cd536e2b2fb1b0809c9d5d8c19a76.jpg?itok=JggMqUeh" width="740" height="500" alt="" title="Pumpjacks draw out oil and gas from well heads near Calgary, Alta., on Friday, April 28, 2023.

The information they pulled all used the average coefficient performance, which measured how efficient the heat pump is, and the average outside temperature from varying kinds of heat pumps. The coefficient measurement shows a spectrum of 100 per cent efficient to 600 per cent efficient. If a heat pump is 200 per cent efficient, that means it’s creating double the amount of energy it uses.</p><figure><img height="500" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/body_img/public/img/2023/09/08/figure_2.jpg?itok=f22vuPhP" width="1000"/><figcaption>Graph courtesy of authors</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Heat pumps, which act as heaters in the winter and air conditioners in the summer, are becoming an increasingly popular swap for homes running on natural gas and oil. Heating systems that use fossil fuels can reach up to 98 per cent efficiency, while heat pumps can be <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/08/08/opinion/dont-let-myths-hold-back-heat-pump-policy">200 to 540 per cent efficient</a> because they transfer heat rather than generate it. Since they use much less electricity and don’t run on fossil fuels, they are a way to limit emissions, especially as Canada moves towards its goal of a <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/09/08/news/heat-pumps-challenge-chill#:~:text=net%2Dzero%20building%20sector">net-zero building sector</a> and net-zero emissions by 2050. </p><p>Heat pumps run on electricity, like electric heat, and depending on where you live, the energy varies in cleanliness. In <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-british-columbia.html">British Columbia</a>, most of the energy produced comes from hydropower, while in <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-nova-scotia.html">Nova Scotia</a>, it comes from a mix of natural gas and coal. Because heat pumps use far less energy than other forms of heating, it makes them better for the planet. </p><p>Efficiency measurements don’t measure comfort, explained Gibb, but he said there are consumer surveys showing those who use heat pumps fare well in cold temperatures. A <a href="https://www.coolproducts.eu/heating-and-cooling/heat-pumps-perform-successfully-across-europe-new-consumer-analysis/">2022 consumer analysis</a> in Europe found 81 per cent of respondents said their comfort improved after installing a heat pump. Another <a href="https://cadmusgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Residential-ccASHP-Building-Electrification-Study_Cadmus_Final_060322_Public.pdf">study</a> conducted in New York and Massachusetts, which installed monitoring equipment in heat pump users&#39; homes, found 32 of the 42 people who participated said they were more comfortable post-heat pump.</p></div><div><p>While Gibb hopes the study might change the minds of people concerned about heat pumps operating in cold weather, he said it also stresses the need for more supports for low-income people to install heat pumps to save money and limit emissions. In P.E.I., the province offers <a href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/free-heat-pump-program">free heat pumps</a> to people with an annual household net income of $75,000 or less; Nova Scotia has <a href="https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20221213002">similar funding</a>. In June, Efficiency Canada <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/06/23/news/energy-efficiency-programs-leave-renters-behind-new-paper-says-there-way-forward">called for</a> a tenants&#39; bill of rights in a paper that digs into the inequity renters face around gaining benefits from efficiency measures such as heat pumps and makes policy suggestions on how Canada could lead the way by marrying rental protections with energy-efficiency programs.</p><p>Examining the big picture of data available on heat pumps proves they can play a much greater role in Canada and beyond, Gibb said. Yannick Monschauer, an energy analyst with the International Energy Agency, agrees.</p><p>&#34;Thanks to continuous efforts on research and development — including by collaborators within the IEA’s Technology Collaboration Program — manufacturers have developed specialized heat pumps that work very efficiently in cold climates,” said Monschauer.</p><p>“Worldwide, the share of heat pumps in heating equipment sales is set to more than double by 2030 under today’s policies, as deployment also accelerates in colder climates.&#34;</p></div>
