    <h1>Werner Herzog on beer, yoga and what he would ask God</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>“C</span>an you see me? Can you hear me?” implores <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wernerherzog" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Werner Herzog</a>, as we pop up in our little boxes – or don’t – at the start of our video call. I can both see and hear him without distortion: that idiosyncratic German timbre, so familiar from his 60 years of film-making, couldn’t be anyone else. But the problem is with my connection. “You’re frozen,” he sighs, with palpable anguish. “It’s very… disquieting. I see your face and wait for lip movements or some life, but there ain’t any life.”</p><p>This (one-sided) exchange is the perfect introduction to the 81-year-old Herzog, who has written and directed more than 60 films and who is, no question, one of the most pioneering documentarians of our age. He also acts, stages operas and is a gifted author. To all of these projects Herzog brings his voice, a searing intensity and a wry humour that he tends not to explicitly acknowledge, which makes it even funnier.</p><p>So, as we struggle to resolve our IT issues, it’s a little stressful, but I’m also struggling to suppress a laugh. Eventually, Herzog decides it’s a problem with the Teams video-call platform we are using: he delivers this information like he’s been prophesising this disaster for years but no one’s heeded him. “I’ve had it a dozen times before, it’s very, very frustrating,” he says. “And I keep predicting that if we do not do Zoom, we will lose the conversation. I hang up now.”</p><figure id="36b0a84f-8f99-40dc-b293-c4b88a8b7036" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Herzog filming 1982’s Fitzcarraldo." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c382d4cf7393848167eac947fea2393011c6393/0_0_5315_3543/master/5315.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.6387582314205" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Filming 1982’s Fitzcarraldo.</span> Photograph: Jean-Louis Atlan/Sygma/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Five minutes later – turns out he’s right! – we catch up again on the Herzog-endorsed Zoom. He is holed up in a cabin in Styria in the Austrian Alps. It’s mid-morning and behind him a curtain is pulled to exclude harsh sunlight, which has the effect of making him look as if he’s in a witness-protection scheme. Instead, he’s retreated here from his usual base in Los Angeles, where he lives with his third wife, Lena, a visual artist whom he married in 1999, to record the audio version of his new book. I assume Herzog is referring to his memoir, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/every-man-for-himself-and-god-against-all-9781847927248" data-link-name="in body link">Every Man </a></em><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/every-man-for-himself-and-god-against-all-9781847927248" data-link-name="in body link">for Himself and God Against All</a></em>, which is released in the UK this month. But no, he’s already completed the next one.</p><p>“It’s called <em>The Future of Truth</em>,” says Herzog. “There’s a rural rocker who lives here [in Austria], who has built himself a small sound studio, and when he doesn’t rock, he milks the cows.”</p><p>From Herzog’s memoir, I know that he has a history with cows. He learned how to milk them as a child, growing up beside a farm in the Bavarian Alps; he still believes that he can instinctually spot a person who can milk a cow “just as you can sometimes identify a lawyer or a butcher”. This skill came in useful when he was making his 2005 sci-fi film <em>The Wild Blue Yonder</em> and wanted to recruit Nasa astronauts to appear in it. In Houston, Herzog’s pitch was falling flat until he turned to one of the astronauts, Michael McCulley, and bet him that he was able to milk a cow. Herzog, again, was correct, and the astronauts all signed up.</p><p>So, this new book he’s just written about the Austrian musician-cum-dairy-farmer combines two of Herzog’s passions then? “Neither is milking cows a great love of mine nor is rocking so…” he replies with an amused smirk. “But I understand. I catch your drift.”</p><p>Herzog is probably best known for his documentary films, which include 2005’s <em>Grizzly Man</em>, the tale of bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell in Alaska, and <em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em>, made in 3D in 2010 from footage shot inside the prehistoric Chauvet Cave in southern France. Increasingly, though, Herzog devotes his creative energies to writing. In 2021, he published his first novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-twilight-world-9781529116243" data-link-name="in body link">The Twilight World</a></em>, based on the Japanese army lieutenant Hiroo Onoda, who refused to believe the second world war was over and only emerged from the jungle and surrendered in 1974.</p><figure id="8b7e1215-81c7-4cff-8df1-9dc57172b8c3" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Timothy Treadwell in Herzog’s 2005 documentary Grizzly Man." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d34b644910c986805e32988520b13181d4659144/176_0_1912_1148/master/1912.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.18619246861925" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Films are my voyage’: Timothy Treadwell in Herzog’s 2005 documentary Grizzly Man.</span> Photograph: Discovery/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>“I’ve been a writer from the very beginning,” he says. “And it’s important to say one thing because people are puzzled: films are my voyage, and writing is home. And since 40 years, I keep preaching to deaf ears that my writing will arguably outlive my films, all of them.”</p><p>Certainly, <em>Every Man for Himself and God Against All</em> is a joyous, fulfilling read. It tells how he discovered cinema, unimpressed, watching a pair of nature films projected on a bedsheet in his village school. And also how Herzog accidentally ended up supplying the distinctive voiceovers to many of his films. But much of the book concentrates on his childhood and there are some terrific, wild stories: the time when a fight with his older brother got out of control and he ended up slashing him twice with a penknife; and the traumatic experience of watching his best friend crash spectacularly on a homemade ski-jumping ramp.</p><p>But when I tell Herzog that he has lived an extreme and extraordinary life, he corrects me. “You shouldn’t look so much about events and stories. It’s the literature of it, the style, that will make it live very long. You see, there is no one who writes like me.”</p><p>Why did Herzog decide to write his memoir now? “My wife admonished me: do it yourself because some idiot will come along and do it instead of you,” he replies.</p><figure id="65abb9af-5f69-4086-9b69-081591220d18" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Filming Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009) with Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f32ebf4cc2e0ecbdbc32b41bf21d25db9e230b/96_549_4473_3134/master/4473.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="311.78850883076234" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>On the set of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009) with Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes.</span> Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Herzog, though, still has considerable ambitions as a film-maker. One long chapter of the book called “Unrealised Projects” gives a tantalising look at the films he never quite got round to making, on subjects from Mike Tyson to the poet Quirinus Kuhlmann. Herzog hopes that his next feature will be on the British identical twins Freda and Greta Chaplin, who had brief tabloid notoriety in the early 1980s when they became sexually infatuated with their nextdoor neighbour, a lorry driver, who eventually took out a restraining order on them. More interesting to Herzog, who met them on a few occasions before their deaths, is that they are the only known twins who spoke synchronously. The film will be called <em>Bucking Fastard</em>, after a verbal slip the twins made simultaneously when they were in court.</p><p>For Herzog, the problem is that there are always more ideas than time to accomplish them. “I name at least 10 projects, there are 20 more behind that,” he says. “It’s like if you walk along a creek and you try to keep abreast with the flow of the water. But it’s always faster than you can walk.”</p><ul>

You see it in titles where God appears, such as <em>Every Man </em><em>for Himself and God Against All</em>; <em>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</em>; <em>The Lord and the Laden</em>; <em>God’s Angry Man</em>; and on and on. So there must be some echo. And it is a quest that I think every real poet or every real film-maker is pursuing.</p><p>And I salute her back with my warmest regards.

And I like all of my acting experiences. I was very careful to choose. You see, I’ve never accepted a film where there was a stupid story or where I didn’t feel to fit well into it. And I don’t have time to waste my life hanging around in auditions. I want people who know what I’m capable of. And be proud to invite me. So when it comes to play a dysfunctional father who is utterly hostile to his children, like in Harmony Korine’s <em>Julien Donkey-Boy</em>, I know I can do that. Although in real life, I’m totally the contrary. Or to play the bad-ass bad guy in <em>Jack Reacher</em>, I can deliver. And I only had to scare the audience.</p><p>And in many of these things like <em>The Mandalorian</em>, it’s not very highly paid. Or <em>The Simpsons</em>, not particularly highly paid. But it’s OK.

But are you an environmentalist? Why?<br/></strong><em>Karen</em> <em>Thomas, editor, The Environment magazine, London</em></p><p>The question itself is, I feel, too one-sided, because I point out, I have made nine films on death row. And it cannot be more unnatural. All these prisoners are in tight concrete cubicles, they don’t even see the sky out there. Zero. So a more complete absence of nature is not possible.</p><p>But nature itself, yes, I’m doing fine shooting out there in the jungle, or in the Himalayas or in the Sahara desert. It’s true. I am, of course, like every thinking human being, for the environment, but I try to do the things not waiting for governments to take action. Collectively, internationally, they are incapable of doing it. What I’m doing is I contain my consumerism. In America, 40% of food is being thrown away. I throw away only 2% maximum. Managing your fridge, there’s a lot every single one of us can do without living an impoverished life. You just watch out what is too long in the fridge, and you better make a meal from that. I drive my car only 10% what I used to do 20 years ago.</p><p>But there are two problems with pure environmentalists. One is they look too much about the wellbeing of whales and the great panda bear and the snow leopards and they overlook that we are losing a language every 10 days or 12 days. While we are sitting here probably a language has died out. That means an entire culture, an entire worldview without a trace.

Instead of an answer, I’m asking two questions. Do we have to cancel Caravaggio, taking his paintings out of churches and museums, because he was a murderer? Would we do that? Second, would we dismiss the Old Testament because Moses committed manslaughter as a young man? And the manslaughter he committed was, in my opinion, when you look at what the Bible says, it was closer to first-degree murder, pre-mediated with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Do we have to cancel Moses? And do we have to cancel the Ten Commandments? So, those questions are my answers.</p><p><strong>If you had a question you could ask God, what would it be?<br/></strong><em>Rui, Portugal</em></p><p>I wouldn’t ask God, but in general: why is there existence, rather than nothingness? It’s the biggest of all questions and it’s not my question. It was posed 2,500 years ago by Greek philosophers. It’s the question of questions and, of course, there’s no answer.</p></div></div></div>
