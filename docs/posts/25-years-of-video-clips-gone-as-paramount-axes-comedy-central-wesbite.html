<p>First on LateNighter: One of the richest repositories of late-night videos is no longer. </p>



<p>ComedyCentral.com had been home to clips from every episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> since 1999, and the entire run of<em> The Colbert Report</em>, but as of Wednesday morning, the site is gone. </p>



<p>Instead, visitors to the Comedy Central site are greeted with this message: “While episodes of most Comedy Central series are no longer available on this website, you can watch Comedy Central through your TV provider. You can also sign up for Paramount+ to watch many seasons of Comedy Central shows.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those in search of older episodes of <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-daily-show/">The Daily Show</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-colbert-report/">The Colbert Report</a></em>, neither can be found on Paramount+.</p>



<p>Other content lost in the purge were clips and full episodes of other short-lived late-night entries like <em>The Opposition with Jordan Klepper</em>, <em>The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em>, the Chris Hardwick-hosted <em>@midnight</em> (predecessor to <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/after-midnight">After Midnight</a></em>), and <em>Lights Out with David Spade</em>.</p>



<p>This morning’s closure of ComedyCentral.com comes days after two other Paramount-owned sites—MTV.com and CMT.com—<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also went dark</a>.  </p>



<p>The move would appear to be part of continued belt-tightening measures at Paramount, which is more than $14 billion in debt, led by losses at Paramount+ and its aging cable networks. The company had been in merger talks with Skydance up until earlier this month when Shari Redstone, Paramount’s largest shareholder, is reported to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/paramount-special-committee-meets-vote-skydance-deal-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed the deal</a> at the eleventh hour.</p>



<p>Those hoping to view clips from Comedy Central’s golden age of late-night programming will still find some clips on YouTube, but nothing near the complete collection that had been available on ComedyCentral.com.</p>
