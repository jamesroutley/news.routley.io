<p>Thinking in bets is a decision-making framework developed by former professional poker player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYNsSeYjkp4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Duke</a>. </p>



<p>In this article, you’ll find two real-life examples of how people —mistakenly— evaluate decisions based on their <a href="https://fronterablog.com/input-goals-vs-output-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcomes</a>. Then, you’ll see why it’s wrong and how to take luck into consideration by thinking like a poker player. </p>











<h2>Bad decision, good luck</h2>



<p>Mike was excited when he heard about a new cryptocurrency from his close friend.</p>



<p>Everybody was talking about its growth potential on Reddit.</p>



<p>He thought he was finally early enough to get huge returns in a short time.</p>



<p>And he was so convinced; that he invested <strong>all his savings</strong> in it.</p>



<p>After two weeks, his dreams came true.</p>



<p>His investment got 10x higher and he cashed out.</p>



<p>Mike told himself: “<em>That was the best decision of my life.</em>“</p>



<h2>Good decision, bad luck</h2>



<p>Jane was working in the Marketing department of a consumer goods company.</p>



<p>One day, she received a job offer from the tech industry.</p>



<p>The offer was good: a promotion, stock options, and leading a team…</p>



<p>After thinking about it for a week, she decided to take the offer.</p>



<p>It was <strong>a great opportunity</strong> and the tech industry was better for her future.</p>



<p>But 5 months later, a recession started.</p>



<p>The tech industry was hit hard, and stocks plummeted. Her new company decided to go through a restructuring and let her go.</p>



<p>As she was new, she got almost no severance. And finding a new job was impossible during a recession.</p>



<p>Jane told herself: “<em>That was the worst decision of my life.</em>“</p>



<h2>Thinking like a poker player</h2>



<p>Life is a <strong>decision-making game</strong>.</p>



<p>Investments, what projects to work on, career changes…</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fronterablog.com/second-order-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">better decisions you make</a> over the long term, the more <a href="https://fronterablog.com/how-to-define-your-own-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful</a> you get.</p>



<p>But people make one common mistake while assessing their decisions.</p>



<p>They judge the quality of the decisions <strong>based on the outcomes</strong>. And this is a flaw that creates a dangerous illusion for future decisions.</p>



<p>Because life is not chess. It’s poker.</p>



<p>Luck plays a bigger role than you think.</p>

<p>Mike made a <em>terrible</em> decision by risking all his savings, but he got lucky.</p>



<p>Jane made a good decision by taking an opportunity with better conditions, but luck was not on her side.</p>



<p>Thinking in bets allows you to take luck (and probabilities) into consideration and makes you a better decision-maker in the game of life.</p>



<h2>How to think in bets in three steps:</h2>



<h3>1. Imagine a bet with a friend</h3>



<p>Let’s say you want to buy real estate. You expect to get a good return in three years.</p>



<p>Imagine a friend betting against your prediction: “<strong>Wanna bet?</strong>“</p>



<p>This will make you think about what your friend might know that you’re missing.</p>



<p>So you can find the <a href="https://fronterablog.com/hindsight-bias-meaning-and-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blind spots in your thinking</a> before you make the decision.</p>



<h3>2. Calculate the expected value</h3>



<p>Professional poker players decide to bet (or not) on a hand by calculating the <strong>expected value</strong> of the bet.</p>



<p>Let’s say there is $300 in the pot — that’s the total money you can earn.</p>



<p>You need $50 to call your opponent’s bet and you estimate a 25% chance of having the winning hand.</p>



<p>So the expected value of that bet would be 25% of the $300, which is <strong>$75</strong>.</p>



<p>Since the expected value ($75) is higher than the bet ($50), it makes sense to bet 50 bucks for that hand.</p>



<p>Do the same for your life decisions.</p>



<p>Compare the expected value and your “bet” by estimating:</p>



<ul><li><strong>The potential reward of the decision</strong> — not only monetary but also joy, freedom, or time</li><li><strong>Probability of getting it</strong> — you cannot know the exact probability, but estimate it the best way you can (remember the bet with a friend)</li><li><strong>The resources (time/effort/money) to bet to get the reward</strong> — also consider the opportunity cost</li></ul>



<p>If the expected value is higher than your bet, it’s a good decision.</p>



<h3>3. Analyze your past decisions</h3>



<p>Another way to make better decisions is to examine your past choices.</p>



<p>But remember, <strong>regardless of the outcome</strong>.</p>



<p>What made you win big in that investment? Your good decision or luck?</p>



<p>Was starting that business a good decision despite the failure?</p>



<p>If you don’t find your mistakes, you run the risk of <strong>repeating them</strong>.<br/></p>



<blockquote><p>There are exactly two things that determine how our lives turn out: the quality of our decisions and luck. Learning to recognize the difference between the two is what thinking in bets is all about.</p><cite><em>Annie Duke</em></cite></blockquote>
