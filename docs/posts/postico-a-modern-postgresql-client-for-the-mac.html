		<h2>A Modern PostgreSQL Client for the Mac</h2>
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p><small id="download-info">
				Postico requires macOS 10.10 or later. Version 1.5.20 was released on Nov 4, 2021. Read the <a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/docs/?file=changelist.html">Changelist</a>.</small></p>

		<p>
			PostgreSQL is an absurdly powerful database, but there&#39;s no reason why using it should require an advanced degree in relational theory.
			Postico provides an easy to use interface, making Postgres more accessible for newcomers and specialists alike.
		</p>
		<p>
			Postico will look familiar to anyone who has used a Mac before.
			Just connect to a database and begin working with tables and views.
			Start with the basics and learn about advanced features of PostgreSQL as you go along.
		</p>
	</div>


	
	<div>
		<p>
			Postico is an intuitive app for looking at data.
			Filter rows, sort them, rearrange columns.
			You can examine long text or images conveniently in the sidebar.
			Even related rows from referenced tables are shown.
		</p>
		<p>
			Edit rows directly, or use the sidebar — a great choice for long text. You can even change multiple rows at once.
			Batch saving (with SQL preview) lets you commit changes to multiple rows in a single transaction.
		</p>

	<div>
		<p>
			Add and remove columns, rename them, change types.
			Modify tables and views without having to remember the ALTER TABLE syntax.
		</p>
		<p>
			The unified structure editor displays everything you need to know about a table.
			Comments and constraints are shown right next to the columns.

		<p>
			When you need hard questions answered, PostgreSQL offers many advanced tools for data analysis:
			Common table expressions, recursive queries, filter aggregates, window functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			To access these tools, Postico sports a powerful query view with support for multiple result sets.
			The editor has all the standard features you expect, like syntax highlighting and automatic indentation.
