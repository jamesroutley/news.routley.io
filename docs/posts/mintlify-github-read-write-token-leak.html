    <h1>Mintlify GitHub read/write token leak</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mintlify.com/blog/incident-march-13/thumbnail.png" alt="blog thumbnail"/></p><h2>Summary (TL;DR)</h2>
<p>On March 1st, we received an email raising concerns about the security of our endpoints. This in turn prompted us to rake through our logs and we discovered unusual requests to our servers originating from an unrecognized device.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, we noticed that some of these requests targeted sensitive API endpoints and were successful in their attempts. This unusual activity indicated that the actor behind these requests had possession of our private admin access tokens, granting them unauthorized access to our endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>We received confirmation that GitHub tokens stored within our databases were used to access a customer’s repository. While we do not have evidence of any other such instances, we cannot confirm that no other such instances occurred.</strong></p>
<p>We took immediate action by revoking all GitHub token access, rotating our admin access tokens, and implementing stringent security measures to all of our APIs to mitigate any further unauthorized access. Additionally, we have patched the vulnerability that led to the exposure of our admin access tokens.</p>
<p>We have also since partnered with third-party cybersecurity vendors to conduct an extensive investigation, and have implemented other security measures to ensure that this type of unauthorized access cannot occur again. For the security of our users, we decided to implement those security measures before making this public announcement.</p>
