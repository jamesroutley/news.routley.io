<p><span id="more-21516"></span>When it comes to cooking, I am a solid home cook and am very good at feeding people. What is seriously lacking is any artistic flourish to what is served. I very rarely think of adding a garnish of edible flowers or a slick of herb oil or a sprinkling of seeds and nuts onto any dish I have cooked. The most my mother ever did was to slice some red chilli and spring onion to put onto fried noodles. I cannot recall my grandmother ever embellishing any dish. Food was for eating, not for decorating.</p>
<p>Chinese practicalities notwithstanding, it is sometimes fun to add finishing touches to what we cook. This should be my aim for this year. I am starting with this pecan nut topping which is coated with miso and maple syrup before being baked for a short time. This is adapted from <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com">Bon Appétit</a> where it is used in their <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/miso-and-maple-pecan-butter-mochi-cake">Miso-and-Maple-Pecan Butter Mochi Cake.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Pecan-Miso-Maple Topping:</p>
<p>200 g whole pecan nuts</p>
<p>2 tablespoons maple syrup</p>
<p>2 teaspoons golden caster sugar</p>
<p>2 teaspoons white or yellow miso</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Preheat the oven to 160°C fan / 180°C regular.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Place the pecans, maple syrup, sugar and miso in a medium bowl. Stir until everything is well mixed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Spread the nuts on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Cool completely before using whole or chopped up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I used the topping on a <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2025/02/the-ultimate-banana-bundt/">Banana Bundt</a> and on top of French toast with bananas and maple syrup. This topping is also very good on <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2024/09/sticky-toffee-bundt/">Sticky Toffee Pudding</a> and with vanilla / banana / chocolate ice cream. In its unchopped form it makes a very more-ish snack. I am also thinking that adding a tablespoon of sesame seeds might enhance its nuttiness. If the nuts have softened (where it has not been used up immediately) you can refresh it in a medium hot oven for a few minutes and it will crisp up again. The most efficient way of doing this is to place the nuts in the oven after you have baked a cake, when the heat has been switched off. The residual heat is enough to crisp up the nuts.</p>
