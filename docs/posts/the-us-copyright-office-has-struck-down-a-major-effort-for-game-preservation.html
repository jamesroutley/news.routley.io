    <h1>The US copyright office has struck down a major effort for game preservation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>A three-year fight to help support game preservation has come to a sad end today. The US copyright office has denied a request for a DMCA exemption that would allow libraries to remotely share digital access to preserved video games.</p><p>&#34;For the past three years, the Video Game History Foundation has been supporting with the Software Preservation Network (SPN) on a petition to allow libraries and archives to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/comments/Class%206(b)%20-%20Initial%20Comments%20-%20%20Software%20Preservation%20Network%20and%20Library%20Copyright%20Alliance.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/comments/Class%206(b)%20-%20Initial%20Comments%20-%20%20Software%20Preservation%20Network%20and%20Library%20Copyright%20Alliance.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">remotely share digital access to out-of-print video games in their collections</a>,&#34; VGHF explains in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/" target="_blank" data-url="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">statement</a>. &#34;Under the current anti-circumvention rules in Section 1201 of the DMCA, libraries and archives are unable to break copy protection on games in order to make them remotely accessible to researchers.&#34;</p><p>Essentially, this exemption would open up the possibility of a digital library where historians and researchers could &#39;check out&#39; digital games that run through emulators. The VGHF argues that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" data-url="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">around 87% of all video games released in the US before 2010 are now out of print</a>, and the only legal way to access those games now is through the occasionally exorbitant prices and often failing hardware that defines the retro gaming market.</p><p>Still, the US copyright office has said no. &#34;The Register concludes that proponents did not show that removing the single-user limitation for preserved computer programs or permitting off-premises access to video games are likely to be noninfringing,&#34; according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">final ruling</a>. &#34;She also notes the greater risk of market harm with removing the video game exemption’s premises limitation, given the market for legacy video games.&#34;</p><p>That ruling cites the belief of the Entertainment Software Association and other industry lobby groups that &#34;there would be a significant risk that preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes.&#34; We cannot, of course, entertain the notion that researchers enjoy their subjects for even a moment. More importantly, this also ignores the fact that libraries <em>already</em> lend out digital versions of more traditional media like books and movies to everyday people for what can only be described as recreational purposes.</p><p>Members of the VGHF are naturally unhappy with the decision. &#34;Unfortunately, lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups continue to hold back progress,&#34; the group says in its statement, noting the ESA&#39;s absolutist position that it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-esa-says-its-members-wont-support-the-one-form-of-game-preservation-that-might-actually-work/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-esa-says-its-members-wont-support-the-one-form-of-game-preservation-that-might-actually-work/">not support a similar sort of copyright reform under any circumstances</a>.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m proud of the work we and the orgs we partnered with did to try and change copyright law,&#34; VGHF founder and director Frank Cifaldi says on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849869475782459704" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849869475782459704" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Twitter</a>. &#34;We really gave it our all, I can&#39;t see what else we could have done. This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it&#39;s really disappointing.&#34;</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-fdSYVfdKPF5N2AbJW46cMW"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more</p></section></div></div></div><p><em>Your legal access to the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-of-all-time/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-of-all-time/"><em>best games of all time</em></a><em> is not a guarantee.</em> </p>
