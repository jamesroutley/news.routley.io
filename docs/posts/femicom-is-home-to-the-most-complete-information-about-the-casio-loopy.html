<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><span>How many games were released for the Casio Loopy?</span> There were 10 software titles released for the Loopy, plus <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/magical-shop">Magical Shop</a>, which is a hardware peripheral that also has built-in software, bringing the total to 11.</p>

<p><span>Did Casio develop all of the software titles in house?</span> No, many of the titles were developed by third-party developers such as Alfa System (<a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/wanwan-aijou-monogatari">Wanwan Aijou Monogatari</a>, <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/dream-change-kokinchan-no-fashion-party">Dream Change: Kokinchan no Fashion Party</a>) and Armat (<a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/magical-shop">Magical Shop</a>, <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/chakurakun-no-omajinai-paradise">Chakurakun no Omajinai Paradise</a>).</p>

<p><span>Why is Dream Change: Kokinchan no Fashion Party sometimes referred to by different names on different websites?</span> Prior to 2012, almost all English-language Loopy websites listed the subtitle of the game <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/dream-change-kokinchan-no-fashion-party">Dream Change</a> as &#34;Kogane-chan no Fashion Party.&#34; However, the Japanese word 小金 can be read as &#34;Kogane&#34; or &#34;Kokin.&#34; The phonetic reading that appears on the game&#39;s box and cartridge label indicates that 小金 should be pronounced &#34;Kokin&#34; rather than &#34;Kogane.&#34; FEMICOM has since worked to correct this on Wikipedia and other game databases, but some older references to &#34;Kogane&#34; may remain.</p>

<p><span>What Loopy game is the rarest?</span> <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/chakurakun-no-omajinai-paradise">Chakurakun no Omajinai Paradise</a> is the last game sold for the Loopy. Due to its limited time on shelves, it is the rarest game. <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/nigaoe-artist">Nigaoe Artist</a> and <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/loopy-town-no-oheya-ga-hoshii">Loopy Town no Oheya ga Hoshii!</a> are slightly rare.</p>

<p><span>How rare are pink and purple versions of the Casio Loopy console?</span> There are no color variants of the Casio Loopy. The plastic body of all Casio Loopy consoles is a cool, slightly-purplish gray color. Like the Super Nintendo, the Loopy and its cartridges were made with a plastic that tended to yellow with age, causing the color to go from a cool gray to a neutral or warmer shade. Some of the images that can be found online depict a bright purple Loopy is purple rather than gray. These images have been digitally manipulated, often by Casio, to look purple in marketing materials.</p><p>Some resources, such as the <a href="http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/golden/casio_loopy.htm" target="new">Ultimate Console Database</a>, reports that there is a hot pink version of the console, but this is not correct. All Loopy consoles, both those released at launch and those released later on with included games, were made in a single production run; creating an alternate body color would have been prohibitively expensive for the manufacturer. There are hot pink versions of other video-game consoles, however. Notable among these are the pink Game Boy Color, the Epoch Super Cassette Vision Ladies Set, and the <a href="http://femicom.org/collection/item/sega-master-system-girl">Sega Master System Girl</a>.</p>
