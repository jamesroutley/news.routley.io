    <h1>A brief history of Times New Roman</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><topic>A brief history of Times New Roman</topic><p><img src="https://typographyforlawyers.com/images/tally-of-types.jpg"/></p><p>Times New Ro­man gets its name from the <em>Times</em> of Lon­don, the British news­pa­per. In 1929, the <em>Times</em> hired ty­pog­ra­pher Stan­ley Mori­son to cre­ate a new text font. Mori­son led the project, su­per­vis­ing Vic­tor Lar­dent, an ad­ver­tis­ing artist for the <em>Times</em>, who drew the <span>letterforms.</span></p><p>Even when new, Times New Ro­man had its crit­ics. In his ty­po­graphic mem­oir, <book>A Tally of Types</book>, Mori­son good-na­turedly imag­ined what William Mor­ris (re­spon­si­ble for the open­ing il­lus­tra­tion in <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/page-layout.html">page lay­out</a>) might have said about it:<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “As</dquo-open-pull> a new face it should, by the grace of God and the art of man, have been broad and open, gen­er­ous and am­ple; in­stead, by the vice of Mam­mon and the mis­ery of the ma­chine, it is big­oted and nar­row, mean and <span>puritan.”</span></p><p>Be­cause it was used in a daily news­pa­per, the new font quickly be­came pop­u­lar among print­ers of the day. In the decades since, type­set­ting de­vices have evolved, but Times New Ro­man has al­ways been one of the first fonts avail­able for each new de­vice (in­clud­ing per­sonal com­put­ers). This, in turn, has only in­creased its <span>reach.</span></p><p>Ob­jec­tively, there’s noth­ing wrong with Times New Ro­man. It was de­signed for a news­pa­per, so it’s a bit nar­rower than most text fonts—<strong>es­pe­cially the bold style</strong>. (News­pa­pers pre­fer nar­row fonts be­cause they fit more text per line.) <em>The italic is mediocre.</em> But those aren’t fa­tal flaws. Times New Ro­man is a work­horse font that’s been suc­cess­ful for a <span>reason.</span></p><p>Yet it’s an open ques­tion whether its longevity is at­trib­ut­able to its qual­ity or merely its ubiq­uity. Hel­vetica still in­spires enough af­fec­tion to have been the sub­ject of a 2007 doc­u­men­tary fea­ture. Times New Ro­man, mean­while, has not at­tracted sim­i­lar acts of <span>homage.</span></p><p>Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Ro­man ap­pears in a book, doc­u­ment, or ad­ver­tise­ment, it con­notes ap­a­thy. It says,<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “I</dquo-open-pull> sub­mit­ted to the font of least re­sis­tance.” Times New Ro­man is not a font choice so much as the ab­sence of a font choice, like the black­ness of deep space is not a color. To look at Times New Ro­man is to gaze into the <span>void.</span></p><p>This is how Times New Ro­man ac­crued its rep­u­ta­tion as the de­fault font of the le­gal pro­fes­sion—it’s the de­fault font of every­thing. As a re­sult, many law­yers er­ro­neously as­sume that courts de­mand 12-point Times New Ro­man. In fact, I’ve never found one that does. (But there is one no­table court that for­bids it—see <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/court-opinions.html">court opin­ions</a>.) In gen­eral, law­yers keep us­ing it not be­cause they must, but be­cause it’s fa­mil­iar and en­trenched—much like those ob­so­lete <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/typewriter-habits.html">type­writer habits</a>.</p><p>If you have a choice about us­ing Times New Ro­man, <strong>please stop</strong>. You have plenty of bet­ter al­ter­na­tives—whether it’s a dif­fer­ent <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/system-fonts.html">sys­tem font</a> or one of the many pro­fes­sional fonts shown in this <span>chapter.</span></p></div></div>
