<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/39227723">&#34;Shadow Sight&#34;</a> with Veronica Barron, James Patrick Nelson. Veronica and I got invited to this festival which was a flash mob of U-Hauls / art performance. We had a military grade thermal camera at sprout. We made a whole dance piece. What happens when the audience can see heat, cold, ice water, the residue of touch - normally only visible to the performers? Live you saw the dancers + a projection of the thermal image. 2012</p>

<p>I founded Kaleidoscope Education in 2006. I used it to build Camp Kaleidoscope, a way to try out a constructionist learning approach in a John Holt led relational style of falling children&#39;s core interests.</p>
<p>It is no longer running. My friends Will Macfarlane and Katie Gradowski iterate on Camp Kaleidoscope to make <a href="http://www.partsandcrafts.org">Parts and Crafts</a>. They&#39;ve stepped down from leadership, but a version of the project still runs.</p>
<p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.thesprouts.org">sprout</a> in 2008 with Alec Resnick and Shaunalynn Duffy. In the four years we co-led, it primarily existed as a community science studio which was an open workshop to the public with courses focusing on creative scientific inquiry.</p>
