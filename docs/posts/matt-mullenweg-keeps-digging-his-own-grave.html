<p>Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, is required to remove a controversial login checkbox from WordPress.org and let WP Engine back into its ecosystem after a judge granted WP Engine <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25452383-wpengine_automattic_preliminjunction/?ref=404media.co#document/p1" rel="noreferrer">a preliminary injunction</a> in its ongoing lawsuit. </p><p>In addition to removing the checkbox—which requires users to denounce WP Engine before proceeding—the preliminary injunction orders that Automattic is enjoined from “blocking, disabling, or interfering with WP Engine’s and/or its employees’, users’, customers’, or partners’ access to wordpress.org” or “interfering with WP Engine’s control over, or access to, plugins or extensions (and their respective directory listings) hosted on wordpress.org that were developed, published, or maintained by WP Engine,” the order states.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the decision, Automattic founder and CEO Matt  Mullenweg asked for his account to be deleted from the Post Status Slack, which is a popular community for businesses and people who work on WordPress’s open-source tools. </p><p>“It&#39;s hard to imagine wanting to continue to working on WordPress after this,” he wrote in that Slack, according to a screenshot viewed by 404 Media. “I&#39;m sick and disgusted to be legally compelled to provide free labor to an organization as parasitic and exploitive as WP Engine. I hope you all get what you and WP Engine wanted.” His username on that Slack has been changed to “gone 💀”</p><p>Mullenweg began to publicly denounce WP Engine in September, calling the web hosting platform a “cancer” to the larger Wordpress open-source project and accusing it of improperly using the WordPress brand. He’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/automattics-new-site-tracks-how-many-websites-left-wp-engine-following-feud-with-matt-mullenweg/?ref=404media.co"><u>“at war” with WP Engine</u></a>, in his own words. </p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/"><u>In October</u></a>, Mullenweg added a required checkbox at login for WordPres.org, forcing users to agree that they are not affiliated with WP Engine. The checkbox asked users to confirm, “I am not affiliated with WP Engine in any way, financially or otherwise.” The <a href="https://archive.is/wip/bf9Ki?ref=404media.co"><u>checkbox was still present</u></a> and required on the WordPress.org login page as of Wednesday morning. Automattic and Mullenweg have 72 hours from the order to take it down, according to the judge’s order. </p><p>WP Engine sent a cease and desist demanding that he “stop making and retract false, harmful and disparaging statements against WP Engine,” the platform <a href="https://x.com/wpengine/status/1838350670564377051?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">posted on X</a>. </p><p>Automattic sent back its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/legal-ping-pong-in-the-wordpress-world-continues-automattic-now-sends-wp-engine-a-cease-and-desist-letter-alleging-trademark-infringement/?ref=404media.co"><u>own cease and desist</u></a>, saying, “Your unauthorized use of our Client’s intellectual property has enabled WP Engine to compete with our Client unfairly, and has led to unjust enrichment and undue profits.” WP Engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/?ref=404media.co"><u>filed a lawsuit</u></a> against Automattic and Mullenweg, accusing them of extortion and abuse of power. In October, Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment?ref=404media.co"><u>announced</u></a> that he’d given Automattic employees a buyout package, and 159 employees, or roughly 8.4 percent of staff, took the offer. “I feel much lighter,” he wrote. But shortly after, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/matt-mullenweg-says-automattic-is-very-short-staffed-amid-wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama/?ref=404media.co"><u>he reportedly complained</u></a> that the company was now “very short staffed.”  </p><p>All of this has created <a href="https://www.404media.co/automattic-buyout-offer-wordpress-matt-mullenweg/" rel="noreferrer">an environment of chaos and fear within Automattic</a> and in the wider WordPress open-source community. </p>

<p>Within 72 hours of the order, Automattic and Mullenweg are also required to remove the “purported” list of WP Engine customers contained in the ‘domains.csv’ file linked to Automattic’s website wordpressenginetracker.com, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268637/wordpress-org-matt-mullenweg-acf-fork-secure-custom-fields-wp-engine?ref=404media.co"><u>Automattic launched in November</u></a> and tracks sites that have left WP Engine. It’s also required to restore WP Engine’s access to WordPress.org, including reactivating and restoring all WP Engine employee login credentials to wordpress.org resources and “disable any technological blocking of WPEngine’s and Related Entities’ access to wordpress.org that occurred on or around September 25, 2024, including IP address blocking or other blocking mechanisms.” The judge also ordered Mullenweg to restore WP Engine’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/12/in-latest-move-against-wp-engine-wordpress-takes-control-of-acf-plugin/?ref=404media.co"><u>access to its Advanced Custom Fields (“ACF”)</u></a> plugin directory, <a href="https://x.com/wp_acf/status/1845169499064107049?ref=404media.co"><u>which its team said was</u></a> “unilaterally and forcibly taken away from its creator without consent” and called it a “new precedent” in betrayal of community access.</p><p>“We are grateful that the court has granted our motion for a preliminary injunction,” a spokesperson for WP Engine told 404 Media. “The order will bring back much-needed stability to the WordPress ecosystem. WP Engine is focused on serving our partners and customers and working with the community to find ways to ensure a vigorous, and thriving WordPress community.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Automattic told 404 Media: “Today’s ruling is a preliminary order designed to maintain the status quo. It was made without the benefit of discovery, our motion to dismiss, or the counterclaims we will be filing against WP Engine shortly. We look forward to prevailing at trial as we continue to protect the open source ecosystem during full-fact discovery and a full review of the merits.” </p>
