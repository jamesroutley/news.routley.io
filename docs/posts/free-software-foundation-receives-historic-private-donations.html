    <h1>Free Software Foundation receives historic private donations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                   Boston, Massachusetts, USA (Wednesday, December 24, 2025) -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced it received two major contributions totaling around $900,000 USD.

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>These extraordinary donations, both made to the FSF in the
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/ways-to-donate">cryptocurrency Monero</a>, are among some of the largest private
gifts ever made to the organization. The donors wish to remain
anonymous.</p>
<p>&#34;These incredible acts of generosity are a true gift in a
challenging time for many, including many organizations like
ours,&#34; said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF. &#34;It
proves that software freedom is recognized more and more as a
principal issue today, at the core of several other social
movements people care about like privacy, ownership, and the
right to repair.&#34;</p>
<p>The organization is in its annual winter <a href="https://www.fsf.org/appeal?mtm_campaign=winter25&amp;mtm_source=pr">fundraising drive</a>,
currently at three-quarters of its <a href="https://my.fsf.org/donate?mtm_campaign=winter25&amp;mtm_source=pr">$400,000 USD winter goal</a>, and
will now switch its focus to a member drive thanks in part to
these donations. Contributions to the FSF have always been
driven by individual giving and a strong supporter base of
associate members.</p>
<p>&#34;We are proudly supported by a large variety of contributors who
care about digital rights. All donations matter, whether $5 or
$500,000,&#34; Kooyman added. &#34;Naturally, a large donation of this
size boosts our work tremendously, but year after year we rely on
a considerable number of donations, which maintains our
independence. It makes it all the more special that these donors
did not ask to be recognized.&#34;</p>
<p>The donation will support the organization&#39;s technical team and
infrastructure capacity, as well as strengthen its campaigns,
education, licensing, and advocacy initiatives, and future
opportunities. </p>
<p>The FSF is seeking <a href="https://my.fsf.org/donate?mtm_campaign=winter25&amp;mtm_source=pr">donations</a> until year-end after which they
aim to gain <a href="https://www.fsf.org/join?mtm_campaign=winter25&amp;mtm_source=pr">100 associate members</a> through its year-end
fundraising ending January 16. <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/ways-to-donate">Ways to contribute</a> to the FSF
are published on its site.</p>
