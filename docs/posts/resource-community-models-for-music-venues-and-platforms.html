  <p>Published a short piece in <a href="https://rave.cafe" target="_blank"><em>Rave Cafe Zine v.003: Resistance</em></a> on <strong>Community Models for Music Venues and Platforms</strong> &lt;3 </p><p>—</p><p>“What are possible models for community-supported and community-governed spaces for music, art, and culture? DIY music venues are constantly under threat of raised rents and shuttering down. Most musicians are not able to make a living wage, especially from current streaming and royalty models.</p><p>Emerging models for community venues and platforms may provide alternative cooperative frameworks for supporting music, culture, and creative workers. Through experimentation and collective organizing, building sustainable infrastructure and creating systemic change may be possible.”</p>
