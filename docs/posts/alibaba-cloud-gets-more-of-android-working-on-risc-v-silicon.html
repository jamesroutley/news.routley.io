    <h1>Alibaba Cloud gets more of Android working on RISC-V silicon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Alibaba Cloud has advanced its work to port Android to the RISC-V architecture.</p>
<p>The Chinese cloud giant has spent more than a year working on a port of the Google-spawned OS and in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/21/android_riscv_port/">January 2021</a> showed off a GUI powered by Android 10 running on silicon designed by T-Head Semiconductor – an Alibaba subsidiary that designs its own RISC-V chip.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud has now revealed it&#39;s working on Android 12, and has integrated third-party vendor modules. The result is Android on RISC-V that&#39;s capable of playing audio and video, running Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, and driving cameras.</p>

    

<p>The company has also &#34;enabled more system enhancement features such as core tool sets, third-party libraries and SoC board support package on RISC-V,&#34; which collectively make RISC-V a better target for Android.</p>

        


        

<p>Another advance is successful trials of TensorFlow Lite models on RISC-V. That effort means Android on RISC-V should be capable running workloads like image and audio classification and Optical Character Recognition.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud hasn&#39;t detailed whether its porting efforts are directed to any particular processor, but is keen to point out that its homegrown Xuantie C906 processor recently aced the MLPerf Tiny v0.7 benchmark – a test applied to Internet of Things devices. The company has also pointed out that its home-grown RISC-V kit has already been employed in smart home appliances, automotive applications, and edge computing.</p>

</ul>
<p>Those uses – plus the emphasis on AI and IoT – suggest Alibaba Cloud is most interested in using the combination of RISC-V and Android to power devices other than smartphones. The reference to working cameras and wireless comms is as relevant to non-phone devices as it is to those seeking to erode chip design firm Arm&#39;s dominance of the handset market.</p>
<p>The Xuantie C906 uses Alibaba-designed cores that are – as required for RISC-V users – available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/T-head-Semi/">on GitHub</a>.</p>

        

<p>The firm has not offered a timeline for when it aims to have a complete version of Android on RISC-V.</p>
<p>Whenever it happens, the feat will be an important step towards China&#39;s goal of reducing its reliance on technology that other nations can control with restrictions such as trade bans. As RISC-V is open source, preventing its flow to China is all but impossible. ®</p>
