No coffee-room, no smoking-room. No place where you can go and quietly sip a cup of coffee or drink a glass of beer with a cigar. You can have a drink at the bar, and then go and sit down in the hall among the crowd. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>Life in an American hotel is an alternation of the cellular system during the night and of the gregarious system during the day, an alternation of the penitentiary systems carried out at Philadelphia and at Auburn. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>It is not in the bedroom, either, that you must seek anything to cheer you. The bed is good, but only for the night. The room is perfectly nude. Not even ‘Napoleon’s Farewell to his Soldiers at Fontainebleau’ as in France, or ‘Strafford walking to the Scaffold’ as in England. Not that these pictures are particularly cheerful, still they break the monotony of the wall paper. Here the only oases in the brown or gray desert are cautions. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>First of all, a notice that, in a cupboard near the window, you will find some twenty yards of coiled rope which, in case of fire, you are to fix to a hook outside the window. The rest is guessed. You fix the rope, and—you let yourself go. From a sixth, seventh, or eighth story, the prospect is lively. </span></p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMO4_vdNBx2NpykS9fuGqRIRMf4uP0C81wt07807pBMSMXvrHIl0tsAtUvh9giwI8uM_fZOtggGdfRc-zKFBsR-DlhYBgad0REVUGSMRVKAYVa4aZncu6UA5TNlSxkJsNDH9L7R6KqIB3UnIa4vTTNaCUq2dS-SMCFIx0rBCP87JURQAS76E5MLoRM/s610/img041.jpg"><img data-original-height="610" data-original-width="424" height="394" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMO4_vdNBx2NpykS9fuGqRIRMf4uP0C81wt07807pBMSMXvrHIl0tsAtUvh9giwI8uM_fZOtggGdfRc-zKFBsR-DlhYBgad0REVUGSMRVKAYVa4aZncu6UA5TNlSxkJsNDH9L7R6KqIB3UnIa4vTTNaCUq2dS-SMCFIx0rBCP87JURQAS76E5MLoRM/w274-h394/img041.jpg" width="274"/></a></p><p><span><p><span><p><span><span>“</span>Another caution informs you of all that you must not do, such as your own washing in the bedroom. Another warns you that if, on retiring, you put your boots outside the door, you do so at your own risk and peril. Another is posted near the door, close to an electric bell. With a little care and practice, you will be able to carry out the instructions printed thereon. The only thing wonderful about the contrivance is that the servants never make mistakes. </span></p></span></p>Press once for ice water </span></p></div><p><span>Press twice for hall boy </span></p><p><span>Press three times for fireman </span></p><p><span>Press four times for chambermaid </span></p><p><span>Press five times for hot water </span></p><p><span>Press six times for ink and writing materials </span></p><p><span>Press seven times for baggage </span></p><p><span>Press eight times for messenger </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>In some hotels I have seen the list carried to number twelve. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>Another notice tells you what the proprietor’s responsibilities are, and at what time the meals take place. Now this last notice is the most important of all. Woe to you if you forget it! For if you should present yourself one minute after the dining-room door is closed, no human consideration would get it open for you. Supplications, arguments would be of no avail. Not even money. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>‘What do you mean?’ some old-fashioned European will exclaim. ‘When the table d’hôte is over, of course you cannot expect the menu to be served to you; but surely you can order a steak or a chop.’ </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>No, you cannot, not even an omelet or a piece of cold meat. If you arrive at one minute past three (in small towns, at one minute past two) you find the dining-room closed, and you must wait till six o’clock to see its hospitable doors open again. </span></p><p><span>.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .</span></p><p><span><span>“</span>When you enter the dining-room, you must not believe that you can go and sit where you like. The chief waiter assigns you a seat, and you must take it. With a superb wave of the hand, he signs to you to follow him. He does not even turn round to see if you are behind him, following him in all the meanders he describes, amid the sixty, eighty, sometimes hundred tables that are in the room. He takes it for granted you are an obedient, submissive traveler who knows his duty. Altogether I traveled in the United States for about ten months, and I never came across an American so daring, so independent, as to actually take any other seat than the one assigned to him by that tremendous potentate, the head waiter. Occasionally, just to try him, I would sit down in a chair I took a fancy to. But he would come and fetch me, and tell me that I could not stay there. In Europe, the waiter asks you where you would like to sit. In America, you ask him where you may sit. He is a paid servant, therefore a master in America. He is in command, not of the other waiters, but of the guests. Several times, recognizing friends in the dining-room, I asked the man to take me to their tables (I should not have dared go by myself), and the permission was granted with a patronizing sign of the head. I have constantly seen Americans stop on the threshold of the dining-room door, and wait until the chief waiter had returned from placing a guest to come and fetch them in their turn. I never saw them venture alone, and take an empty seat, without the sanction of the waiter. </span></p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMwqJM2UAArXJ7VAN8_kokhtWFdevkw_Q7G3CwpuaGAUVuafyocDtJtYNz2TfnEbNqm-EuxmywXy8vHCkB1Ez5guCWxnrB2Gw2zrQad2Ut0EGM-XVNxOUJXqgZY2QlHsMFSLmXAoD8jNS5nOVVdK9mGmvDeePFkto11APLKdfnavWJkn3ij6Cu9pbU/s610/hotel%202.jpg"><img data-original-height="610" data-original-width="493" height="395" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMwqJM2UAArXJ7VAN8_kokhtWFdevkw_Q7G3CwpuaGAUVuafyocDtJtYNz2TfnEbNqm-EuxmywXy8vHCkB1Ez5guCWxnrB2Gw2zrQad2Ut0EGM-XVNxOUJXqgZY2QlHsMFSLmXAoD8jNS5nOVVdK9mGmvDeePFkto11APLKdfnavWJkn3ij6Cu9pbU/w320-h395/hotel%202.jpg" width="320"/></a></p></div><p><span><span>“</span>The guests feel struck with awe in that dining-room, and solemnly bolt their food as quickly as they can. You hear less noise in an American hotel dining-room containing five hundred people, than you do at a French table d’hôte accommodating fifty people, at a German one containing a dozen guests, or at a table where two Italians are dining <i>tête-à-tête</i>. </span></p><div><p><span><span>“</span>The head waiter, at large Northern and Western hotels, is a white man. In the Southern ones, he is a mulatto or a black; but white or black, he is always a magnificent specimen of his race. There is not a ghost of a savor of the serving man about him; no whiskers and shaven upper lips reminding you of the waiters of the Old World; but always a fine mustache, the twirling of which helps to give an air of <i>nonchalant</i> superiority to its wearer. The mulatto head-waiters in the South really look like dusky princes. Many of them are so handsome and carry themselves so superbly that you find them very impressive at first and would fain apologize to them. You feel as if you wanted to thank them for kindly condescending to concern themselves about anything so commonplace as your seat at table.</span><br/></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcKykkyU7d0iCSDtEOih6y3Z-3X73N--MzYGt2nAu3qjtC3fpM14eGHNY6H2l60Lu_qu3gYaIx2qrE-Bi5844fDd6dpSO91dAKKmok5roxS84o8exVPtfhI9Pr_ysG8E2r4YUuQSrkjwXb9UObLTBcSK81RwApVVj0tEy5Ak6wYskFpKRpLNicFwrY/s2310/43%20Kimball%20House%20Atlanta%201888%201.jpg"><img data-original-height="2310" data-original-width="1468" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcKykkyU7d0iCSDtEOih6y3Z-3X73N--MzYGt2nAu3qjtC3fpM14eGHNY6H2l60Lu_qu3gYaIx2qrE-Bi5844fDd6dpSO91dAKKmok5roxS84o8exVPtfhI9Pr_ysG8E2r4YUuQSrkjwXb9UObLTBcSK81RwApVVj0tEy5Ak6wYskFpKRpLNicFwrY/w254-h400/43%20Kimball%20House%20Atlanta%201888%201.jpg" title="Kimball House, Atlanta, 1888." width="254"/></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqe3MOxjSlhwlONcn7g2LH3mvsSgJqLHeq3UwqAu1KazJtH5feu7m51g4wOUm65kuQd-D8TWkzoTSoiXfpib2KucnQ4Bw6B2ZM-YpquFAx2CO_L-eatgXrgdpZS2wq3ZrALKES1oVvTCKcArgtx8TpKptKRsHQFosf8Fg4OEszYgZyFocosOL6iv2O/s450/hotel%203.jpg"><img data-original-height="450" data-original-width="339" height="395" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqe3MOxjSlhwlONcn7g2LH3mvsSgJqLHeq3UwqAu1KazJtH5feu7m51g4wOUm65kuQd-D8TWkzoTSoiXfpib2KucnQ4Bw6B2ZM-YpquFAx2CO_L-eatgXrgdpZS2wq3ZrALKES1oVvTCKcArgtx8TpKptKRsHQFosf8Fg4OEszYgZyFocosOL6iv2O/w297-h395/hotel%203.jpg" width="297"/></a></p><p><span><span>“</span>A regally handsome woman always ‘goes well in the landscape,’ as the French say, and I have seen specimens of these waitresses so handsome and so commanding-looking that, if they cared to come over to Europe and play the queens in London pantomimes, I feel sure they would command quite exceptional prices, and draw big salaries and crowded houses.</span></p></div><p><span><p>.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .</p><span>“</span>The thing which strikes me most disagreeably, in the American hotel dining-room, is the sight of the tremendous waste of food that goes on at every meal. No European, I suppose, can fail to be struck with this; but to a Frenchman it would naturally be most remarkable. In France, where, I venture to say, people live as well as anywhere else, if not better, there is a horror of anything like waste of good food. It is to me, therefore, a repulsive thing to see the wanton manner in which some Americans will waste at one meal enough to feed several hungry fellow-creatures. </span></p><p><span><span>“</span>In the large hotels conducted on the American plan, [in which room and board are included in the daily rate], there are rarely fewer than fifty different dishes on the menu at dinner-time.</span></p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM0WLfttafSR19T6B4Gt-vowgSxGc4bz690GruqiVWldCqTLbojDpHLWcY1-jTMZIJvsag1UOfSimN0H_n1vu2T8fkQfluiPHUjx0ZZrnZGkjBlvHgZM4Jb7qrGaRULzZJX2aM2ZyCxt8-P9Yh_IY_kQjWds99I1s58MvoqR7BZPmqd9OKwLuTeMs5/s2076/img163%20(2).jpg"><img data-original-height="2076" data-original-width="1350" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM0WLfttafSR19T6B4Gt-vowgSxGc4bz690GruqiVWldCqTLbojDpHLWcY1-jTMZIJvsag1UOfSimN0H_n1vu2T8fkQfluiPHUjx0ZZrnZGkjBlvHgZM4Jb7qrGaRULzZJX2aM2ZyCxt8-P9Yh_IY_kQjWds99I1s58MvoqR7BZPmqd9OKwLuTeMs5/w260-h400/img163%20(2).jpg" title="Leland Hotel, Chicago, 1886." width="260"/></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjV5193LJ7EWYnLEeyXNpWNXFVWkiQ3H-XooiIrNq8PGQKscECNYYLfV0ODo48IrJK8wSqRbfoV68UZwjU3NpjGog69xfl6H2rzBR1ec2ypPVDMPl6r-gPiUNev0ZYG-xbYjV2DAUXtRM5IPWsWWcRmnUv2Kk72s3LKJHLYdME7Y-3kJJPLuQeHmvgx/s2114/img169%20(2).jpg"><img data-original-height="1366" data-original-width="2114" height="259" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjV5193LJ7EWYnLEeyXNpWNXFVWkiQ3H-XooiIrNq8PGQKscECNYYLfV0ODo48IrJK8wSqRbfoV68UZwjU3NpjGog69xfl6H2rzBR1ec2ypPVDMPl6r-gPiUNev0ZYG-xbYjV2DAUXtRM5IPWsWWcRmnUv2Kk72s3LKJHLYdME7Y-3kJJPLuQeHmvgx/w400-h259/img169%20(2).jpg" title="Palmer House, Chicago, 1884." width="400"/></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn237E3IzZz_7liqHqJjbc8CFJo63MGOCAWLmfjWPTzEWNNX4QRXHA0Koirl-yIss6Nd3Bw25VPnsRMav8Z4Rsw-raTdBxWcowWrXZd2XI6197qbrPXexMXxk06W5ozQ4VUo3IwbQwhT00VEZEWf67TR4Nm9SuCYNu_5xt6QSrRjldtBqcXP7bU65U/s2158/img167%20(2).jpg"><img data-original-height="2158" data-original-width="1340" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn237E3IzZz_7liqHqJjbc8CFJo63MGOCAWLmfjWPTzEWNNX4QRXHA0Koirl-yIss6Nd3Bw25VPnsRMav8Z4Rsw-raTdBxWcowWrXZd2XI6197qbrPXexMXxk06W5ozQ4VUo3IwbQwhT00VEZEWf67TR4Nm9SuCYNu_5xt6QSrRjldtBqcXP7bU65U/w249-h400/img167%20(2).jpg" title="Grand Pacific Hotel, Chicago, 28th Annual Game Dinner, 1883." width="249"/></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdYTQHYFj_5JnUMKkROnm7DnKDW_Ubx1NwYguiXThGxL2JItt9B-_istIXAsi5vrCZRgpdtove35CU2HWBeSs0bfoBiVxcEPDMH-JYntXqN5nPzDXERptzg6y3_fxxLRewme9etwdFiaSmOB7bzVN2hoZsYu0nX08QD93qZ7jQ1dC9aQi7PWBxCWvT/s2183/img172%20(3).jpg"><img data-original-height="2183" data-original-width="1373" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdYTQHYFj_5JnUMKkROnm7DnKDW_Ubx1NwYguiXThGxL2JItt9B-_istIXAsi5vrCZRgpdtove35CU2HWBeSs0bfoBiVxcEPDMH-JYntXqN5nPzDXERptzg6y3_fxxLRewme9etwdFiaSmOB7bzVN2hoZsYu0nX08QD93qZ7jQ1dC9aQi7PWBxCWvT/w251-h400/img172%20(3).jpg" title="Brunswick Hotel, New York City, 1887." width="251"/></a></p></div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhR53sO29Wtc-42qJRNhc0r-0sSrZkiYGms47iX4wopDysirauO4U5vWe6WMQXKANdiscIhyhg4Yj3snjn_oRHJlU6bFniJASisyvWeotIBdcgLfNpKVXjrlFEMDntDhgNQOlptuC7a_9asyNDBivZAku5Ff2xf2mQdvXw2JTtbHa5wpDix0sZrYGXv/s2801/img162.jpg"><img data-original-height="2801" data-original-width="2198" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhR53sO29Wtc-42qJRNhc0r-0sSrZkiYGms47iX4wopDysirauO4U5vWe6WMQXKANdiscIhyhg4Yj3snjn_oRHJlU6bFniJASisyvWeotIBdcgLfNpKVXjrlFEMDntDhgNQOlptuC7a_9asyNDBivZAku5Ff2xf2mQdvXw2JTtbHa5wpDix0sZrYGXv/w314-h400/img162.jpg" title="Richelieu Hotel, Chicago, 1886" width="314"/></a></p></div></div>
