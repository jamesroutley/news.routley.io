				<p>You may recall that last March, a container ship named the “Ever Given” blocked the Suez Canal for almost a week. Recently, a sister ship from the same Evergreen Marine shipping company joined it in infamy. The hilariously named “Ever Forward” ran aground in the Chesapeake, and it <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2022/03/18/ever-forward-evergreen-stuck-container-ship-chesapeake-bay-maryland/">stopped moving forward</a>, or indeed anywhere at all. This time around, the transport was outside the shipping channel, and thus didn’t interfere with any other vessels. As a result, it was much less of a major news story. Still, I’ve been following it, and after more than a month of work, the ship is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/chesapeake-bay-cargo-ship-stuck-free-ever-forward.html">finally free</a>.</p>

<p>This will surely not be the last giant boat to get stuck somewhere, and the odds are decent that the next one will be an Evergreen vessel too. The company operates a fleet of approximately 200 ships, and many of them follow that same rather strange “Ever ______” naming convention. Some are bland, like the “Ever United” or the “Ever Leader”. But many others are quite amusing. Let’s take a look at the names of a few of the Evergreen crafts we might see stuck in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<h4>A Look at an Assortment of Names Given to Evergreen Vessels</h4>

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Ever Ample, Ever Burly, Ever Mighty, Ever Strong</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Dainty</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Clever</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Forever</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Full, Ever Loading</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Lasting</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Cozy</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Chaste</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever After</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Unicorn</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Clear</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Alot</strong>
	</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>Ever Lucky</strong>
	</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The above list is all real, save for one name, which I invented. Can you guess which one?</p>

    <p>At present, the “Ever After” is <em>not</em> a ship in Evergreen’s fleet. I’m surprised!</p>
