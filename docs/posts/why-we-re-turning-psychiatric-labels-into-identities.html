    <h1>Why We&#39;re Turning Psychiatric Labels into Identities</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>These contradictions sit at the heart of Gagne’s memoir. She craves diagnosis and uses clinical labels as a framework for self-understanding. But the fit is always awkward, and the implications are disheartening. “I don’t want to feel like things like relationships and love and family are out of reach just because I don’t ‘internalize emotions’ the same way everybody else does,” she says at one point. Confronted with the failure of existing schemes to explain her distress, she sees not a broken system but a space for a new diagnosis of her own devising: “sociopathic spectrum disorder.” To be named is to be acknowledged, to be situated in a natural order.</p><p>If Gagne’s sociopathy falls outside <em>DSM</em> diagnoses, borderline personality disorder cuts across them. A condition of volatility, B.P.D. is defined by sudden swings in mood, self-image, and perceptions of others. Patients with B.P.D. tend to have intense, unstable relationships and often describe an agonizingly raw sensitivity. The psychologist Marsha Linehan has compared B.P.D. to a psychological third-degree burn: “Even the slightest touch or movement can create immense suffering.”</p><p>B.P.D.’s nebulous nature is encoded in its name. The concept is generally attributed to the psychoanalyst Adolph Stern, who used it in 1937 to describe patients who were neither neurotic nor psychotic and thus “borderline.” The committee charged with designing measures for personality disorders for the <em>DSM-III</em> discussed its confusing status when debating its inclusion. Some members noted that key symptoms such as identity disturbance, outbursts of anger, and unstable interpersonal relations also featured in narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders. During the internal deliberations, Donald Klein, then a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, complained that “every conceivable variety of character disorder has been described as borderline at one time or another.” In “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Disorders-Narcissistic-Borderline-Antisocial/dp/1421446103/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Disorders-Narcissistic-Borderline-Antisocial/dp/1421446103/&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Disorders-Narcissistic-Borderline-Antisocial/dp/1421446103/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Personality Disorders: A Short History of Narcissistic, Borderline, Antisocial, and Other Types</a>” (2023), Allan Horwitz, the medical sociologist, asks why the <em>DSM</em> still treats B.P.D. as a disorder of personality rather than of mood. “Its trademark indicator—emotional dysregulation—is virtually the opposite of the rigidity that characterizes a PD,” he writes.</p><p>Alexander Kriss, in “Borderline: The Biography of a Personality Disorder,” embraces this categorical quagmire. A psychotherapist and a professor of psychology at Fordham University, Kriss takes an expansive view of B.P.D., finding traces of it in Hippocratic writings about hysteria, early-modern accusations of witchcraft, and a range of diagnostic categories, including complex P.T.S.D. His book is eerie, lyrical, and erudite—fitting for a man who, as we learn, switched to clinical psychology from playwriting, and who seems more interested in Freudian theories than in modern psychiatric constructs. He prefers not to make declarative statements about the nature of B.P.D., choosing, instead, to study it through others’ attempts to name, treat, and demonize psychological instability.</p><p>He’s openly contemptuous of the <em>DSM</em>. By distancing itself from its psychoanalytic roots, he says, the manual abandoned useful insights about etiology and treatment, and about psychological mechanisms like splitting and projection. He also condemns its “categorical approach to illness,” which he thinks poorly represents reality. “A disease was a disease because the book said it was disease,” he writes, comparing the <em>DSM’s</em> institutional authority to religious scripture. “Perhaps it is time to reject the naming of things once and for all,” he suggests at one point. “To at least consider the possibility of leaving the world of categories behind.”</p><p>Kriss recognizes how the process of labelling reifies categories, especially in the age of the Internet. Online communities such as the subreddit r/BPD crystallize psychiatric tags into identities to be socially accommodated and invite people to diagnose themselves. Such communities, Kriss fears, can “pervert” B.P.D. into a self-serving justification for misconduct. He cites the musician Abby Weems’s post about her relationship with the podcaster Dustin Marshall: “He made it so easy to rationalize his behavior, telling me ‘that’s just what happens when someone has BPD.’ His personality disorder made up so much of his identity that any abusive behavior fell under the umbrella of his condition.”</p><p>What’s more striking is that Kriss, for all his misgivings, doesn’t just diagnose patients as having the disorder; he also advertises himself as someone who specializes in B.P.D. The market demands it, he says. You need to be known for knowing something, and people presumably look up therapists proficient with existing <em>DSM</em> labels. “Even as I was discovering that being borderline was not so ‘special,’ that it was common and somehow related to the human condition, including my own, I wanted people to see me as an expert,” he reflects. Despite his exceptional resistance to the <em>DSM</em>, Kriss, like his patients, finds himself inhabiting its categories.</p><p>If the existing taxonomy is such a mess, what would a better diagnostic system look like? In 2015, following the disappointment that greeted the release of the <em>DSM-5</em>, three psychologists formed a consortium to build one. Two of them, David Watson and Robert Krueger, had been involved in the revision of the <em>DSM</em>; a third, Roman Kotov, was a young researcher who sensed that the profession would be grateful for a different system. Two years later, they and thirty-seven other researchers, including Steven Hyman, the former N.I.M.H. director, published a proposal for a new approach to classifying mental illness. They called it the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, or <em>H</em>i<em>TOP</em>.</p><p>The taxonomy sets aside existing diagnoses and starts by asking what goes with what. Symptoms and traits that occur together constitute syndromes, and so on, up the hierarchy, giving rise to “subfactors,” “spectra,” and “super-spectra.” Everything is measured continuously; the taxonomy consists of dimensions rather than categories. The result is a provisional scheme of up to six spectra, including “internalizing,” which covers symptoms of anxiety and depression; “externalizing,” which splits into disinhibition and antagonism; and “thought disorder,” which encompasses psychotic and some bipolar symptoms.</p><p>The creators of <em>H</em>i<em>TOP</em> claim that it overcomes some of the biggest issues of the <em>DSM:</em> It embraces continua rather than black-and-white entities; it avoids the wild heterogeneity of some disorders; it results in fewer patients like Gagne, who experience dysfunction yet struggle to meet the criteria for any disorder. They also say that it fits better with findings from the fields of genetics and neuroscience. <em>H</em>i<em>TOP</em> has garnered an enormous amount of excitement. In just seven years, the article presenting the system has been cited nearly three thousand times. The consortium, meanwhile, has expanded more than fourfold.</p><p>As the hype has grown, so has criticism. Detractors argue that a taxonomy designed using superficial commonalities is still a long way from mapping the nature of psychopathology. They also point out that <em>H</em>i<em>TOP</em> draws partly from self-reports of symptoms, which can be unreliable, and suggest that, whatever its lofty claims, it has replaced one set of abstractions with another.</p><p>Yet there’s a broader issue here. People’s symptoms frequently evolve according to the labels they’ve been given. Following Layle’s visit to the psychiatrist, her mother observed, “You’ve been acting more and more autistic since we got the diagnosis.” Layle took the comment as a sign that her mom didn’t understand her—“I hate it when someone thinks I’m a liar,” she writes—but people everywhere encounter models of illness that they unconsciously embody. Some instances are subtle; others are dramatic and startling. In 2006, a student at a Mexican boarding school developed devastating leg pain and had trouble walking; soon hundreds of classmates were afflicted. A fifteenth-century German nun started biting her companions; eventually, the strange hysteria infected convents from Holland to Italy. Ian Hacking, the philosopher, argued that such a dynamic fuelled the epidemic of multiple personality disorder in the late twentieth century, and something similar seems to be playing out now with the growing portrayal of dissociative identity disorder, the current name for M.P.D., on social media. One of Kriss’s patients, a student who went by Haku, developed a multiplicity of selves after being introduced to the concept of dissociative identity disorder. “It’s not that I thought he was faking it,” Kriss recalls. “It seemed more that Haku <em>wanted</em> to have multiple personalities, even if that meant he had to force himself and others to believe in it.”</p><p>Any new psychiatric taxonomy develops in the shadow of the old. It must contend with the echoes of the previous scheme, with people whose selves have been cast in the shape of their former classification. By failing to take these into account, models such as <em>H</em>i<em>TOP</em> risk re-creating the categories of their predecessors. Psychiatric diagnosis, wrapped in scientific authority and tinged with essentialist undertones, offers a potent script. As Layle wondered after she was told about her autism, “How did I know what was truly me, and what I had convinced myself I was?” ♦</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article failed to make clear that Patric Gagne completed her dissertation and received her doctoral degree.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div>
