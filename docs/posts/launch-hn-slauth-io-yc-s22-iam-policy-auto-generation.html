    <h1>Launch HN: Slauth.io (YC S22) â€“ IAM Policy Auto-Generation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN, we are Daniel and Tal, Co-founders of Slauth.io (<a href="https://www.slauth.io">https://www.slauth.io</a>). Slauth auto-generates IAM policies in order to save engineering time and make your policies more secure.</p><p>If you&#39;re an engineer, you probably know how tedious and error-prone it can be to manually write IAM policies. We surveyed over 70 engineers and found out that a majority are using or have used wildcards (*) in order to quickly write IAM policies.</p><p>By using client-side monitoring or via a proxy, Slauth.io observes all of the API activity and generates a policy based on functionality and least privileges.</p><p>Once deployed in a remote environment, or run locally, you will need to run an end-to-end test using a wildcard policy. Slauth will observe the activity, apply its logic based on large amounts of behavioral patterns of the service you deploy, and create a high quality IAM policy.</p><p>The IAM policy will be presented through the Slauth Dashboard where it can be copy/pasted or as a pull-request into your Git repository ready to be reviewed. Integrations with IaC services such as Terraform are also available.</p><p>Our objective is to automate manual error-prone IAM policy writing in order to increase engineering velocity, reduce friction and harden security.</p><p>Would love your feedback on the value proposition and if you would use the AWS SDK or Slauth proxy for onboarding.</p><p>Feel free to also sign up for Beta usage! <a href="https://www.slauth.io">https://www.slauth.io</a></p></div></div></div>
