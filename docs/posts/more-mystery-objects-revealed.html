              <p>
                Since I launched my <a href="https://palomakop.tv/zine-club">Zine Club</a> project
                in spring of 2024, I&#39;ve mailed out a total of over 200 Mystery
                Object packages to people in 8 countries. It&#39;s been a fun (and
                sometimes challenging) project that helps keep me creating weird
                art and brainstorming new ideas regularly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole point of the Mystery Objects is that no one who
                subscribes to them knows what the next one will be until they
                open their bimonthly package. Last November, after sending out
                the first few Objects of the project, I made a
                <a href="https://palomakop.tv/blog/2024-11-23_first-few-mystery-objects-revealed/">reveal post</a>
                where I shared everything that had been sent so far. Well, it&#39;s
                been almost a year since then, so I am sharing another batch of
                Objects that I&#39;ve made since then... Here is the reveal!

              <p>
                <em>Support Weird Art</em> is the official slogan of Zine Club.
                So of course I had to make something to let people spread the
                word. These holographic stickers seemed pretty effective, and
                they have the bonus of being kind of weird themselves.

              <p>
                <em>Interdependence</em> is a card from my
                <a href="https://palomakop.tv/art/tarot-of-subtle-forms/">tarot of subtle forms</a>
                deck. For this Object, I laser-cut and engraved the design into
                wood. This was my first time using the laser cutter at my local
                makerspace, and I was quite happy with the results.

                <a href="https://palomakop.tv/img/magnetic_maze-2000w-oZSaft6JBY.jpeg"><img alt="A silkscreen print of a maze-like pattern in white ink on black paper" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://palomakop.tv/img/magnetic_maze-720w-oZSaft6JBY.jpeg" width="720" height="480"/></a>

              <p>
                I love silkscreen because it allows for printing with light ink
                on a dark background (a difficult task for most other print
                methods). However, before moving to New Haven and joining the
                makerspace, it had been a long time since I&#39;d had access to
                screen printing equipment. This is the first print I made after
                gaining access to the print shop there, and I am super excited
                to do more with it soon. The design of this print is a still
                from some footage I recorded of ferrofluids, and it&#39;s titled
                <em>Magnetic Maze</em>.

              <p>
                This is a fridge magnet! The abstract design is based on a very
                weird analog video feedback recording called
                <em>Morphogenesis I</em>, which is part of my
                <a href="https://palomakop.tv/art/experiments-in-public/">Experiments in Public</a>
                series. I&#39;ll embed it below so you can see the origins:

                Lastly, I made this small print on textured gray cardstock, with
                an insert of diffraction grating in the cutout of the eye. That
                is the kind of thin plastic film that splits apart wavelengths
                of light and makes everything look like rainbows! (Miniature
                Venus de Milo statue not included.)
