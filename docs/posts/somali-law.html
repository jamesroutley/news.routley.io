    <h1>Somali Law</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> <b>Somali Law</b></SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> “<i>Few societies can so
          conspicuously lack those judicial, administrative, and
          political procedures which lie at the heart of the western
          conception of government. The traditional northern Somali
          political system has no chiefs to run it and no formal
          judiciary to control it. Men are divided amongst political
          units without any administrative hierarchy of officials and
          with no instituted positions of leadership to direct their
          affairs.”</i> (Lewis 1961 p. vii)</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Somalia was created in 1960 out
        of the colonies of British Somaliland (north) and Italian
        Somaliland (south). The exiting colonial powers set up a
        democratic central government, possibly not the best option for
        a society whose traditional institutions were decentralized and
        stateless. The democracy lasted for nine years and was followed
        by the dictatorship of Siad Barre. He was ousted in 1991, the
        central government disintegrated, and the Somalis were back with
        their traditional system. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> With two differences. First, the
        experience of a past central government and the expectation of a
        future one encouraged some, especially those near the capital of
        Mogadishu, to engage in a power struggle aimed at putting
        themselves in the very profitable role of rulers instead of the
        very unprofitable role of ruled. Second, outside powers, acting
        through the U.N. in the belief that the country needed a central
        government, attempted to reestablish one by military force. The
        result has been an extended period of violence and chaos,
        especially in and near the capital, by groups acting outside of,
        and often in violation of, the traditional legal system.<sup><a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Elsewhere, especially in what had
        been British Somaliland and now calls itself simply the Republic
        of Somaliland,<sup><a name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>
        the traditional system of customary law reestablished itself.
        While Somaliland has a government—arguably created in part as a
        so far unsuccessful attempt to persuade foreign states of its
        legitimacy—it is a government based on traditional institutions,
        with an upper house of clan elders, and one that seems for the
        most part to defer to customary law privately enforced in the
        traditional manner—the same policy followed earlier by the
        British officials.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> This chapter is based primarily
        on the work of I.M. Lewis, a British anthropologist who has been
        writing about Somalis since the 1950’s, especially on the
        detailed description of the institutions of the northern Somali
        pastoralists in his <i>A Pastoral Democracy: A Study Of
          Pastoralism And Politics Among The Northern Somali Of The Horn
          Of Africa</i>. My other source is <i>The Law of the Somalis</i>,
        written by Michael Van Notten, a Dutch legal scholar who married
        a Somali wife and lived as part of the Samaron clan of
        North-west Somaliland for twelve years, until his death in 2002.
        The book was edited and published by Spencer MacCallum, a social
        anthropologist with an interest in stateless societies. As Van
        Notten makes clear, his description applies in detail only to
        the area where he lived (Awdal), but traditional law elsewhere,
        while not identical, is generally similar.<sup><a name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1">Both of my sources are concerned primarily with the
        pastoralists of northern Somalia, and it is their legal system I
        will be describing. The institutions in the south, where camel
        herding is to a considerable extent replaced by agriculture,
        appear to be somewhat less based on kinship, more on geography.<sup><a name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a></sup> Van Notten’s
        observations were from about 1990 to 2002; Lewis based his
        detailed account on observations made in the 1950’s, when
        northern Somalia was still under British control. The accounts
        are broadly similar, allowing for the difference in the time
        periods and the fact that Van Notten is dealing with a more
        restricted area.<sup><a name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a></sup></SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The institutions through which
        the Somali enforce rights and settle disputes are based on two
        principles—kinship, primarily agnatic kinship (defined through
        the paternal line) and contract. Every Somali memorizes, as a
        child, his genealogy through the paternal line up many
        generations, an important piece of information since it defines
        his relationship to every other Somali. A clan, which may number
        in the hundreds of thousands, consists of individuals all of
        whom<sup><a name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> are believed
        to be descendants of a common ancestor in the paternal line,
        possibly twenty or thirty generations up. The closer the linkage
        between two Somalis—the smaller the number of generations to a
        common ancestor—the more likely they are to be allies, <span>ceteris paribus</span>.<sup><a name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a></sup> “As the Somali
        themselves put it, what a person’s address is in Europe, his
        genealogy is in Somaliland.”<sup><a name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The system of alliances through
        which the legal system works is fluid in two sense. To begin
        with, coalitions are created by agnatic kinship at multiple
        levels. If, to simplify considerably, there is a conflict
        between two individuals whose common great-great-grandfather in
        the paternal line had two sons, the group that becomes engaged
        on the side of each will be the descendants of the sons from
        whom he is descended. If a conflict arises involving a member of
        one of those groups against someone whose genealogy links with
        theirs higher up the genealogical tree, the two groups that were
        enemies in the first round may ally. In the case of a conflict
        between individuals in different clans, all of each clan is, in
        principle if not always in practice, allied in support of its
        member.<sup><a name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym"><sup>9</sup></a></sup></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The coalitions are not defined
        entirely by kinship. The nearest thing to a well defined and
        stable unit below the clan level is what Lewis, following the
        practice of the British administrators, refers to as a “<i>dia</i>-paying
        group” (“<i>dia</i>” is the Arabic term for blood money, the
        Icelandic wergeld).<sup><a name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym"><sup>10</sup></a></sup>
        The dia-paying group is responsible for paying for offenses by
        its members, collecting for offenses against its members, and,
        in the latter case, using force or the threat of force to obtain
        payment.<sup><a name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym"><sup>11</sup></a></sup> It also
        deals with conflicts between its members, under rules defined in
        part by contract.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The <i>dia</i>-paying group’s
        membership and internal rules are defined by explicit contract.<sup><a name="sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym"><sup>12</sup></a></sup> In most
        cases it is made up of a number of jiffo-paying groups, each of
        which may consist of the descendants in the paternal line of a
        single common ancestor, or several such. Within the dia-paying
        group, the separate jiffo-paying groups have special
        responsibility for the offenses of their members defined by the
        group’s contract, usually paying all of the cost up to some
        limit, commonly a third of the payment for a killing. The
        division of costs above that point among the components of the
        larger group is also defined by contract, usually in proportion
        to either the number of males in each Jiffo-paying group or its
        wealth in livestock.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The separate jiffo-paying groups
        within a dia-paying group may or may not be linked by agnatic
        kinship. If smaller groups not so linked wish to combine for the
        purpose, they may take advantage of links through maternal
        kinship to do so, producing a uterine alliance, and similarly
        for coalitions at other levels of the system. Sometimes
        coalitions are formed with neither agnatic nor uterine links as
        justification<SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman">; such are
          referred to as </SPAN><SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman"><i>gaashaanbuur</i></SPAN><SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman">, meaning literally &#39;pile of
          shields</SPAN><SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman">,</SPAN><SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman">&#39;</SPAN><sup><SPAN face="Times,
            Times New Roman"><a name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym"><sup>13</sup></a></SPAN></sup><SPAN face="Times, Times New Roman"> since they are made in order to
          acquire sufficient fighting strength.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> By Lewis’ account, the size of a
        dia-paying group is limited at the low end, about 300 males, by
        the need for enough resources to pay blood-money when necessary
        without an undue burden on any individual and for sufficient
        military power to enforce claims for payment of blood-money. It
        is limited at the high end, about 3000 men, by the problems of
        internal conflict—too many able and ambitious would-be leaders,
        situations where one of the component groups feels it is being
        unfairly burdened by payments for offenses by members of other
        groups, and similar problems. Component groups can and do split
        off, to form their own dia-paying group or join with a different
        one. And if circumstances force an alliance among multiple
        dia-paying groups, they may temporarily constitute themselves as
        a single such group.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Somalis distinguish between
        general laws, applying to all members of the clan, and special
        laws, applying to members of a particular group, in particular a
        dia-paying group, judged within the group. Special laws are
        established by explicit contract,<sup><a name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a></sup>
        general law seen as a set of broad principles, with the
        application up to the particular judge; thus there are, in
        principle, no situations on which the law is silent. Decisions
        are to be based on customary practice. A sufficient number of
        consistent decisions may result in a rule followed by judges
        coming to be treated as a law; in this sense it is a system of
        informal case law.<sup><a name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a></sup>
        Within a clan, significant differences among judges tend to
        disappear over time, but such difference between the
        jurisprudence of different clans may persist.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Judges are not officials with a
        position and salary but arbitrators accepted by the disputants.
        A judge has no special rights,<sup><a name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym"><sup>16</sup></a></sup>
        such as the right to summon or cross-examine a witness. Nor is
        the judge viewed as an authoritative source of law. His job is
        to settle conflicts by applying the rules that people in the
        community normally observe. A judge who produces verdicts that
        meet general disapproval is unlikely to be asked to judge cases
        in the future. To quote Van Notten:</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> “A Somali judge is free to
        develop his own principles of law and his own doctrines. The
        test of whether such principles and doctrines are acceptable to
        the community comes as soon as he has given his verdict on a
        conflict. If a verdict deviates from what the community finds
        reasonable and just, there is little chance that its author will
        be asked again to sit as a judge.”<sup> <a name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym"><sup>17</sup></a></sup></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Neither politicians nor religious
        dignitaries are responsible for developing or interpreting the
        general law, and, as a rule, neither can function in the law as
        judge, witness, or enforcer. Folk wisdom includes the sayings
        “One can change one’s religion; one cannot change the law” and
        “Between religion and tradition, choose tradition.”</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> One notable exception to the
        separation of law and religion is that matters of marriage and
        inheritance are usually brought before a judge who applies
        Koranic law, almost all Somalis being Muslims.<sup><a name="sdfootnote18anc" href="#sdfootnote18sym"><sup>18</sup></a></sup> A second
        exception is that a judge who needs to know the extent of injury
        of an assault victim will ask a religious leader to investigate
        the question and testify on it. The schedule of payments of
        blood-money for death or injury is based on that in Shari’a,
        modified by custom and contract, with the amount sometimes
        larger or smaller depending on the relationship between offender
        and victim. The contract for a dia-paying group may specify a
        lower charge for injuries of one member of the group by another,
        a larger sum may be paid for death or injury to a particularly
        well respected victim or occurring under especially ugly
        circumstances, and groups sometimes agree to increase the amount
        in order to reduce intergroup violence. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Somali political institutions at
        the clan level exist but are limited. Traditionally, most clans
        had a titular head, appointed for life, whose functions were
        mostly ceremonial. The position is apparently not essential,
        since in recent years several clans have failed to choose any
        replacement for one who died.<sup><a name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym"><sup>19</sup></a></sup>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1">Each clan also has an assembly (<i>Guurti),</i> made
        up of the heads of the most important families. It has the power
        to declare war or peace with other clans, but not to conscript
        or hire soldiers. It can recommend changes in the traditional
        law but has no power to legislate them. Decision making in the <i>Guurti</i>,
        as in the <i>kris</i> of the Vlach Rom, is not by majority vote
        but by consensus,<sup><a name="sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym"><sup>20</sup></a></sup>
        with the result that meetings can last for months. If a
        conclusion is reached that some members still oppose, they (and,
        presumably, their families) have no obligation to help implement
        it.</SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> <b>Mechanics</b></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The mechanics of trial and law
        enforcement as described by Van Notten are straightforward. When
        a dispute arises between members of different <i>dia</i>-paying
        groups, the elders (<i>oday</i>) from each side<sup><a name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym"><sup>21</sup></a></sup> form a court
        with themselves as judges, ask the parties to state their cases,
        hear witnesses and state a verdict. Judges may, before agreeing
        to judge a dispute, require the parties to agree, sometimes in
        writing, to obey their verdict. If force is needed to make the
        losing party obey the verdict in an intra-clan dispute, the
        judges can recruit all able-bodied male villagers for the
        purpose; anyone who refuses is considered an associate of the
        defendant and owes a fine to the plaintiff’s family. In the case
        of an inter-clan dispute, however, enforcement is up to the clan
        of the victim. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> What if no court is agreed on in
        time, or the <i>oday </i> of one party’s family refuses to
        participate (particularly likely if the parties are from
        different clans), or the court fails to give a verdict? At that
        point, the victim and his family are entitled to self-help,
        imposing restitution or compensation by force. If the other
        party believes that excessive force was used or excessive
        compensation extracted he is entitled to sue for compensation. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Thus the Somali system is
        ultimately a feud system, one in which law is enforced by the
        private application of force or the threat of force, but a feud
        system with institutions for avoiding violence via widely
        respected mechanisms to arbitrate disputes.<sup><a name="sdfootnote22anc" href="#sdfootnote22sym"><sup>22</sup></a></sup> Part of what
        makes it successful, according to Van Notten, is that families
        are obligated to help defend their kin but not to help attack
        their opponents, with the result that armed conflicts are likely
        to lead to stalemate, and from there to arbitration.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Conviction for what we would
        regard as a civil or criminal offense usually results in a fine,
        traditionally stated in camels. The offender’s <i>dia</i>-paying

        group (like the Irish <i>fine</i><sup><i><a name="sdfootnote23anc" href="#sdfootnote23sym"><sup>23</sup></a></i></sup><i>) </i>is
        a guarantor for payment of the fine. In inter-clan disputes, the
        clan is the guarantor. If an individual repeatedly violates the
        law and is unable to pay the resulting fines, his <i>dia</i>-paying

        group may publicly announce that it is no longer responsible for
        him. Since there is now not only nobody to guarantee his fines
        but nobody to defend him or threaten force in vindication of his
        rights, he is effectively an outlaw, and likely to leave the
        territory for that of another clan. In less extreme situations,
        the kin group, having had to pay for the offense of its member,
        may restrict him in ways designed to prevent a repeat offense,
        for example by forbidding him from going armed.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Both plaintiff and defendant have
        the right to appeal a verdict, with the number of appeals
        permitted depending on the rules of their clan. The appeals
        court must have more judges than the court that produced the
        original verdict, drawn from a wider group of families or clans;
        if one party refuses to go along with an appeal, the family of
        the other is entitled to self-help.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> In the course of a trial, a
        disputed fact is admitted as evidence only on the testimony of
        three witnesses. Parties can call in experts and character
        witnesses to support their case. Each party gets to state his
        case, or have a representative do so for him, call witnesses and
        present evidence; witnesses are not normally subject to
        cross-examination. In some cases the judge of the defendant may
        simply agree, on behalf of his clan or kin group, to pay the
        required compensation. As in some other legal systems, oaths are
        sometimes required as part of the legal process. If a fact is
        disputed, or supported by fewer than three witnesses, parties
        may be required to swear one of several different oaths to the
        truth of their position. One such oath consists of the
        oath-giver swearing by his marriage; if it later turns out that
        his oath was false, the marriage is dissolved. If the plaintiff
        fails to establish his case, the defendant must still swear to
        his innocence before the case will be dismissed.</SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> If the convicted defendant
        refuses to pay within the specified time, he is subject to
        penalties ranging from a fine in honey to having one of his
        animals slaughtered, cooked, and eaten by the villagers each
        day.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> As with Arabic <i>jinayat, </i>penalties
        are computed in camels—in the Somali case, healthy she-camels
        aged three to six years. It may be paid in other livestock, at a
        fixed customary rate, by agreement between the parties, or in
        money. The payment goes to the family of the victim. There
        exists a standard schedule of fines for unintentional bodily
        injury. The family of the victim may, and often will, accept
        less, possibly as a good will gesture. For an intentional
        injury, fines are doubled.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> For intentional murder, the
        penalty is a life for a life; if the murderer succeeds in
        fleeing abroad, a member of his family of equal status may be
        put to death in his stead, a rule that gives his family a strong
        incentive not to help him escape. In most cases the victim’s
        family can choose to accept blood-money instead, at a rate of
        100 camels for a man and 50 for a woman, although if the murder
        was sufficiently outrageous the court may insist on execution of
        the murderer. If the killer and victim are of different clans,
        the victim’s family are less likely to accept blood-money; if
        the killer escapes, his family owes two lives instead of one.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The fines in Somali law are based
        on the fines specified in <i>jinayat</i>, on which the Somali
        system is based, although the rules differ in detail.<sup><a name="sdfootnote24anc" href="#sdfootnote24sym"><sup>24</sup></a></sup> <i>Jinayat</i>
        fines for intentional death or injury are specified as a number
        of female camels, equally divided between one, two, three, and
        four year old (the heavier <i>diya</i><sup><i><a name="sdfootnote25anc" href="#sdfootnote25sym"><sup>25</sup></a></i></sup><i>) </i>
        and, for accidental homicide, as a number of camels from a group
        of which one fifth are male one-year olds and the rest female
        camels equally divided between one, two, three and four year
        old. The Somali rules do not, and the <i>jinayat</i> rules do,
        treat the loss of a body part of which the victim only has one
        as equivalent to the loss of life. Otherwise the patterns are
        similar but not identical.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Somali legal rules for bodily
        injury have one other interesting feature. If a man seriously
        wounds another, his family must take the victim into their
        household and nurse him back to health—the same requirement as
        in ancient Irish law.<sup><a name="sdfootnote26anc" href="#sdfootnote26sym"><sup>26</sup></a></sup>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> The rules for accidental damage
        to property, including animals, are the same as in modern tort
        law. The person responsible must make the victim whole by
        replacing the property or its value. The penalty for stealing an
        animal, however, is the return of two.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Somali customary law also covers
        subjects such as breach of contract and defamation. The legal
        rules with regard to property are complicated by the fact that
        not all sorts of property can be privately owned. Grazing land
        is treated as a commons, with a rule of first come, first
        served—once one herd is grazing in a particular pasture or
        drinking at a water hole, it has temporary ownership. When water
        is scarce, grazing land and water sources in a clan’s territory
        get treated as possessions of the clan, which others are
        supposed to use only with permission. The definition of clan
        territory is based on past practice, and imprecise. It sounds
        from Lewis’ description as though the combined effect of the
        imprecision between clans and the lack of well defined property
        rights to grazing within clans results in a good deal of
        conflict.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> Most of the people in the area
        studied by Von Notten were nomadic pastoralists, but there are
        also partly or entirely sedentary populations that recognize
        individual ownership of small parcels of grazing land, with the
        restriction that they may only be sold within the clan and lent
        or rented only to clan members or outsiders who have some tie
        with the clan, such as marriage to a clan member. Agricultural
        land in areas where the locals practice agriculture is similarly
        subject to a restricted form of ownership. Some land also
        belongs to groups or an entire clan, and can be divided and
        allocated to individual members only with the assent of all male
        members of the group.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> One odd feature of Somali
        customary law that is that a wealthy man is required, with
        detailed legal rules, to share his wealth with neighbors and
        relatives. Seen from one angle this can be viewed as a form of
        social insurance, from another as a disincentive to successful
        business dealings.</SPAN></p>
    
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> <b>Appendix: Dealing With
          Foreigners: A Case</b></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="+1"> <b>The state of Ethiopia dealt
          with as a clan: </b>In 1992, a year after the Tigraens took
        control of the Ethiopian government, some federal soldiers
        wantonly killed a Somali merchant near the village of Sheddher.
        Their reason was that he had refused to give them some of his
        merchandise, which happened to be qhat. An hour later, the
        family of the victim killed two federal soldiers who happened to
        be passing through the village. The military commander of the
        Somali region thereupon ordered a punitive expedition and sent
        an entire platoon to Sheddher. On its arrival, the soldiers
        learned that the villagers could have killed several more
        federal soldiers that day but had not done so. They had acted
        according to their customary law, which stipulates that when
        someone of another clan murders a clansman, two members of that
        other clan will be killed. Shortly thereafter, a similar
        incident happened in the same territory, in the village of
        Lafaissa, where a federal soldier had sought refuge in a
        military camp after wantonly killing a Somali. The family of the
        victim went to a military camp in the nearby village of Herigel
        and killed two federal soldiers. The military commander in Harar
        chose to take no action against the clan and informed his
        soldiers that henceforth they had to respect the customary law.
        As a result, no more killings occurred in the territory. (Van
        Notten, pp. 181-182)</SPAN></p>
