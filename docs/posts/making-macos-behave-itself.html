    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://danmackinlay.name/images/saturated_apple.webp"/></p><p>See also <a href="https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/command_lines.html">command lines it is tedious to remember</a>
for general POSIX commands.</p><p>⚠️ Most of these commands are supposed to be run sudo root,
and each may irremediably ruin your computer,
your life, and soil everything you have ever loved.
Certainly, some of them have done that for me.
Then it might challenge you to a break dance battle, I dunno.
None of that will be my responsibility.
The only guarantee I provide here is that stuff helped me at least one time.</p><p>So many of these were filesystem-specific hacks that I broke out those into a specific
<a href="https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/macos_fs_hacks.html">filesystem-specific hacks</a> section.
And others were about easing the pains of
<a href="https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/network_hacks.html#macos">using macOS in the low-bandwidth majority world</a> or
<a href="https://danmackinlay.name/post/surviving_osx_server.html">macOS server</a>.</p><p>The remaining tips are arranged so that the further you get down the
list the longer it has been since I have needed to know it; the later ones probably
don’t work on modern macOS.</p><div id="ocr-from-screen"><h2>OCR from screen</h2><p>macOS supports an OCR system called <a href="https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/how-to-use-live-text-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Live Text</a> which notionally means any time I can see text on the screen I should be able to copy and paste it (e.g. I should be able to use links that I see in a video chat).
However, only some apps seem to support this feature, so I end up doing circuitous round trips from screenshots to supported apps.
There are better ways.</p><p>Markus Schappi’s <a href="https://github.com/schappim/macOCR">macOCR: Get any text on your screen into your clipboard.</a></p><pre><code># install
brew install schappim/ocr/ocr
# invoke
ocr</code></pre><p>This is a good solution for me because I have a terminal open 100% of the time.
I have also noticed <a href="https://mybyways.com/blog/extract-text-from-a-screenshot-with-shortcuts">Extract Text from a Screenshot with Shortcuts</a> but I cannot work out where to download it.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/qn4hwi/macos_monterey_ocr_screenshot/">ltxlouis has a Siri-based solution</a> but that just leads me to a download page for an app that claim that Siri does not work on my laptop, which is weird because it is RIGHT THERE.</p></div><div id="imessage-doesnt-know-how-country-prefixes-work-any-longer"><h2>iMessage doesn’t know how country prefixes work any longer</h2><p>Apparently we now need to manually add country prefixes to any phone numbers in our inbox that arrive without country prefixes?
Here is a script to <a href="https://gist.github.com/mzcu/3771916">add country code to OS X Address book entries</a>:</p><pre><code>tell application &#34;Contacts&#34;
    repeat with eachPerson in people

            if (theNum does not start with &#34;+&#34; and theNum does not start with &#34;61&#34; and theNum starts with &#34;0&#34;) then
                -- log &#34;+61&#34; &amp; (get text 2 thru (length of theNum) of theNum)
                set value of eachNumber to &#34;+61&#34; &amp; (get text 2 thru (length of theNum) of theNum)

I REALLY hate them being played promiscuously through arbitrary bluetooth devices.
I have done my best to turn them off.</p><div><p><img src="https://danmackinlay.name/images/macos_no_alerts.webp"/></p><p><span>to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee.</span></p></div><p>I do not want them.
If they really must play themselves, they can play on my laptop’s internal speakers thank you very much.
Even better would be the laptop speakers of someone else.
Maybe a convicted criminal who needs this kind of low-level irritation as part of their state-mandated punishment?
Or Apple bluetooth devs needing operant conditioning
I <em>particularly</em> do not want beeps on audio outputs to which they are not invited and have never been invited.</p><p>MacOS audio alerts, though are rude intruders.
For me, every time a new bluetooth audio device or HDMI device is connected (or reconnects because a bird flies past or an angel sighs), MacOS will use it for error beeps and miscellaneous notifications.
Ths OS is a sex pest when it comes to bluetooth devices, constantly attempting to interfere with them by non-consensual error beep interference.
This is incredibly uncomfortable to be around.</p><p>Or: A macos beep is a guy who gets in the elevator with me, farts, then leaves again before the door closes.
Why did that guy come here just to fart?
He did not get anything out of it.
Could he not have farted somewhere else?
I could have tolerated him farting if he had not made it weird, but now it’s weird because he came in here and farted pointedly <em>at</em> me so I’m kind of <em>obligated</em> to be offended I guess?</p><p>Here are two apps that claim to prevent macos from imposing its error beeps on random devices:</p><ul><li><del><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/audio-profile-manager/id1484150558?mt=12">Audio Profile Manager</a></del> (USD5)
Audio Profile manager does not do this thing. I tried.
It managed other system sounds OK but apparently cannot stop system alert beeps playing from inappropriate devices.
Macos will still frantically switch to whichever bluetooth device is most irritating.</li><li><a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/">SoundSource</a> (USD43)
I am not yet psychologically prepared to spend USD43 because something in my heart feels there must be another way.</li></ul></div><div id="typing-emoji"><h2>Typing emoji</h2><p>As seen in <a href="https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/typography.html">typography</a>.

It’s called <em>Applescript</em>.
After much time trying to persuade it to do things for me I feel comfortable
asserting that using it will never save me time, although occasionally I execute
a one-liner via <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/osascript.html">osascript</a>.
There are some attempts
to in-principle open up macOS’s cocoa to, e.g. javascript by
<a href="http://jstalk.org/">jstalk</a>
or python via <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/">PyObjC</a>
but that’s a brutally low level to do things from unless you are an app
developer, and the documentation is even worse. (and then why not just use Swift?)</p><p>However, people seemed to have converged on the
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/">UIKit accessibility API</a>
as a reasonable interface to script.</p><p>On this front, try <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/">Hammerspoon</a>/Phoenix.
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyatomac/">pyatomac</a> does the same for python but seems
designed for UI testers not for UI users.
You can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/AutomatetheUserInterface.html">do it with Applescript</a>
of course, if your heart overunneth with bituminous hate.</p></div><div id="itunes-never-finishes-syncing-my-phone"><h2>iTunes never finishes syncing my phone</h2><p>It stays stuck on “importing photos”?
Because you don’t use iCloud, right?
For one thing, why would you voluntarily put your

For another, even if you wanted to, if you live in a bandwidth-poor country,
iCloud sync is not just bad, it’s <em>comedically</em> bad.
Atrociously, OS-floggingly slow and glitchy. “iClod”, let us call it.
So you sync using a cable and iTunes, of course.</p><p>Except that, every couple of days, that breaks.
