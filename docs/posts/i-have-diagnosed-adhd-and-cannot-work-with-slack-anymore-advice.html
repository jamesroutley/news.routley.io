    <h1>Ask HN: I have diagnosed ADHD and cannot work with Slack anymore â€“ advice?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>10 months ago, I started to work at a company that uses Slack heavily. They have 1000+ channels and my team is tagged in a lot of stuff so I get a lot of notifications.</p><p>I can&#39;t concentrate at all. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s annoying, I simply cannot work.</p><p>I have been spending 10x more energy since I started to just keep above the water but now, after 10 months, I&#39;m simply drowning and my tickets are all piling up.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be that person that&#39;s not reachable but more and more, I&#39;m thinking about closing Slack and opening it 2-3x a day.</p><p>Any advice?</p></div></div></div>
