    <h1>Finnish as a World Language?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>
Is it now the time for <a href="http://www.hut.fi/~jkorpela/finnish-intro.html">Finnish</a> to take its place as the international language?
</p>
<p>
It is obviously difficult to answer this question with
certainty.  At the moment there seem to be several factors which would
hinder such a development.
</p>
<p>
First of all, Finnish is currently spoken by a mere .05% of the world&#39;s population; secondly one cannot learn the language in ten easy lessons; thirdly, a large number of Finns still do not understand it.
</p>
<p>
Although the advancement of Finnish has been a bit slow, there
are Finns who point out the following advantages Finnish would have as
a world language:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It is an essentially logical language.  The rules are absolute and
reliable in all situations, except exceptions.
</li><li>It is a good sounding language; in other words, it is pleasing to
the ear.  This has to do with its wealth of vowels, which rules out
ugly consonant clusters.  It was recently suggested that some vowels
should be exported to Czechoslovakia, where a shortage of vowels is
imminent, and that some Czech consonants should be imported to
Finland.  However, negotiations collapsed at an early stage.  The
Finns would not deal with a language that calls ice-cream &#39;zrmzlina,&#39;
while the Czechs in turn distrusted a language that calls it
&#39;jäätelöä.&#39;
</li><li> It is a concise language.  One Finnish word can mean several
different things in English.  Why lose time and energy saying &#39;the
committee that takes care of negotiations concerning the truce&#39; when
you can use a simple little word like &#39;aseleponeuvottelutoimikunta?&#39;
</li><li> Learning Finnish builds confidence.  If you can learn Finnish, then
you can learn anything.
</li><li> Finnish has longer and better swear words than any other
language.
</li></ol>
<p>
In light of these facts we can see that the introduction of
Finnish as a world language would be a blessing to all mankind.  The
problem we now face is how to convince the remaining 99.95% of the
global population to learn Finnish.  We hope the world can receive the
benefit of our own experience with the language.  After a few months
of intensive (and sometimes downright desperate) research we have
developed a method of fording this linguistic barrier which has so far
proved to be one of the world&#39;s most formidable ones.
</p>
<h2>Nouns and Their <a href="http://www.hut.fi/~jkorpela/finnish-cases.html">
Cases</a></h2>
<p>
Remember, self-confidence is the key to success.  Never hesitate.
When you are about to use a noun, always reflect according to the
following pattern:
</p>
<ol>
<li>which is the corresponding noun in Finnish?
</li><li>singular or plural?
</li><li>what case?  Nominative, accusative, genitive, essive, partitive,
translative, inessive, elative, illative, adessive, ablative,
allative, abessive, comitative or instructive?
</li><li>is it possible to avoid using the noun?
</li></ol>
<p>
After you have contemplated this during the proverbial
fraction of a second, take a deep breath and pronounce the first half
of the noun in a huge, booming voice.  Then gradually weaken the voice
so that by the time you pronounce the case ending, it is only in a
hoarse whisper.  This method of demonstrating your mastery of case
usage is completely safe since, although you cannot prove that you
were right, nobody, Finn or otherwise, can ever prove that you were
wrong.  Above all, look confident.
</p>                
<h2>Numerals</h2>
<p>
Superficially, there are few similarities between the Finnish and
English systems.  For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#39;kolme&#39; and &#39;three&#39; each have five
letters
</li><li>&#39;viisi&#39; and &#39;five&#39; are both formed around the letter &#39;v&#39;
</li><li>&#39;seitsemän&#39; and &#39;seven&#39; seem to share a common root (apparently a
word beginning with &#39;s&#39;)
</li></ol>
<p>
Other cues for the acquisition of numerals:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Forget the English numerals altogether.  This done, you will have
to learn the Finnish ones in order to tell the time.  If you should
run into problems when using English at a later stage you can consult
a Finnish-English dictionary, or, when you need numerals up to twenty,
make use of fingers and toes.
</li><li> Do not waste time learning numerals higher than 20,000,000.  It is
unlikely that you will ever have that much money, even in Finnmarks. 
</li></ul>
<h2>Months and Days</h2>
<p>
Say &#39;the first day,&#39; &#39;the third day,&#39; &#39;the
second month,&#39; &#39;the next-to-last month,&#39; etc.  This will save you the
two years it takes to learn these names and shifts the burden of
labour over to the person you are talking to.
</p>
<h2> The Direct Object</h2>
<p>
Most Finnish grammars are particularly easy to understand on this
point.  The basic idea is: In Finnish the direct object (commonly
called the accusative object) may occur in the nominative, the
genitive, or the partitive case.  In order to make things easier to
understand, nominative and genitive are called accusative.  There is
also a real accusative which is not called anything at all.  Utmost
care must be applied when interpreting the grammatical terminology.
If you encounter the word &#39;accusative,&#39; it can mean nominative or
genitive, but never the real accusative.  The term &#39;nominative&#39; can mean
accusative or, possibly, nominative.  &#39;Genitive&#39; can mean accusative
or simply genitive, while partitive is always called partitive,
although it may be accusative.
</p>
<h2> <a href="http://eunuch.ddg.com/LIS/InfoDesignF97/paivir/finnish/verbs.html">Verbs</a></h2>
<p>
The best piece of advice is do not use verbs at all.  Sometimes you
may find it a little difficult to pursue a meaningful conversation
without one, but with dilligent practice you will become adept at
this.  We reduced the number of conversational errors by 20% after
discovering the method of omitting verbs.  Another 15% can be
eliminated by omitting all adjectives, adverbs and pronouns, although
at this point conversation tends to sink to an extremely superficial
level, unless you are very good with your hands.
</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.hut.fi/u/jkorpela/finnish.pronunciation.html">
Pronunciation</a></h2>
<p>
Some difficult sounds:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ää: like &#39;e&#39; in &#39;expatiatory,&#39; but longer and more intense.  Mouth as open as possible, ears backward and  plastered to head.<br/>
</li><li>äy: half palatal, half alveolar, half
dental.  Look disgusted.<br/>
</li><li>yö: be very, very careful with this one.<br/>
</li><li>uu: as in Arabic. <br/>
</li><li>r: a forceful trill.  Loose dentures will be an advantage here.
</li></ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
We hope that this article will be of great help to all
those who wrestle with the question of whether to study Finnish.  For
those already studying the language, this method can provide helpful
and easy applications for using conversational Finnish.  As to the
question of the prospect of Finnish as a global language, I think I do
not misspeak myself by saying that the work of this article should
settle the matter clearly and finally.
