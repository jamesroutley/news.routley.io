From August 22, the maximum fee will be $1,000, Airbnb said in <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/resources/hosting-homes/a/changing-our-policy-on-avoidable-host-cancellations-537" data-analytics-module="body_link">blog post</a> Wednesday. Fees are deducted from hosts&#39; future payouts.</p><p>Airbnb said it is changing its policy to crack down on hosts cancelling on guests unfairly.</p><p>&#34;When Hosts cancel on guests for preventable reasons — such as accidentally double-booking or wanting to host friends and family instead — guests lose the confidence to book on Airbnb, and this affects all Hosts and hurts our entire community,&#34; the company said.</p>
                        
                        <p>&#34;We found that this fee structure doesn&#39;t adequately reflect the costs of moving guests into a similar or better place, often at the last minute, after a Host cancels for an avoidable reason,&#34; it added.</p><p>Airbnb did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider to ask why it is waiting until near the end of the summer holiday season to enact the new policy.</p><p>Hosts will still be able to apply for exemptions to the fees if they have to cancel for a valid reason such as emergency repairs to the property or personal illness.</p><p>Hosts are also allowed to cancel reservations if they can prove a guest intends to throw a party at their property.</p>
