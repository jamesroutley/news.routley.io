Special Rapporteur David Boyd, concluded.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;I think we have an ethical and now a legal obligation to do better by these people,&#34; he told Reuters later in an interview.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Due to be presented next month to the U.N. Human Rights Council, which has declared a clean environment a human right, the document was posted on the Council&#39;s website on Tuesday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">It urges a ban on polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl, man-made substances used in household products such as non-stick cookware that have been linked to cancer and dubbed &#34;forever chemicals&#34; because they don&#39;t break down easily.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">It also seeks the clean-up of polluted sites and, in extreme cases, the possible relocations of affected communities - many of them poor, marginalized and indigenous - from so-called &#34;sacrifice zones&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">That term, originally used to describe nuclear test zones, was expanded in the report to include any heavily contaminated site or place rendered uninhabitable by climate change.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;What I hope to do by telling these stories of sacrifice zones is to really put a human face on these otherwise inexplicable, incomprehensible statistics (of pollution death tolls),&#34; Boyd said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Boyd considers the report, his latest in a series, to be his most hard-hitting yet and told Reuters he expects &#34;push back&#34; when he presents it to the Council in Geneva.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">U.N. rights chief Michelle Bachelet has called environmental threats the biggest global rights challenge, and a growing number of climate and environmental justice cases are invoking human rights with success. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-passes-resolution-making-clean-environment-access-human-right-2021-10-08/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Chemical waste is set to be part of negotiations at a U.N. environment conference in Nairobi, Kenya, starting on Feb. 28, including a proposal to establish a devoted panel, similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Emma Farge; editing by John Stonestreet and Grant McCool</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
