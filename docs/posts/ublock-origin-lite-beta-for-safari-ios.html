<h2>Getting started</h2><p>To test beta versions of apps and App Clips using TestFlight, you’ll need to accept an email or public link invitation from the developer and have a device that you can use to test.

You must have the preferred device and OS in order to accept the invitation. You can tap or click Learn More in the invite to view the specific device and OS requirements the developer is looking for.</p><p>If you’re a member of the developer’s team, the developer can give you access to all builds or certain builds</p><h3>Required OS by platform</h3><ul><li>iOS or iPadOS apps: iPhone, iPad, or <span>iPod touch</span> running <span>iOS 14</span> or <span>iPadOS 14</span> or later.

<h2>Installing and testing beta apps</h2><p>Each build is available to test for up to 90 days, starting from the day the developer uploads their build. You can see how many days you have left for testing under the app name in TestFlight. TestFlight will notify you each time a new build is available and will include instructions on what you need to test. Alternatively, with TestFlight 3 or later, you can turn on automatic updates to have the latest beta builds install automatically.</p><p>When the testing period is over, you&#39;ll no longer be able to open the beta build. To install the <span>App Store</span> version of the app, download or purchase the app from the <span>App Store</span>. In-app purchases are free only during beta testing, and any in-app purchases made during testing will not carry over to <span>App Store</span> versions.</p><p>Note: To automatically download additional in-app content and assets in the background once a beta app is installed in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 18.4, or visionOS 2.4, turn on Additional In-App Content in your App Store settings for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/manage-purchases-subscriptions-settings-iph3dfd91de/ios">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/manage-purchases-subscriptions-settings-ipadee10c6e7/ipados">iPad</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/app-store/change-app-store-preferences-mchlp2257/3.0/mac/13.0">Mac</a>, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3><p>To get started, install TestFlight on the device you’ll use for testing. Then, accept your email invitation or follow the public link invitation to install the beta app. The public link invitation will include a description of the beta app and may also include screenshots, the app category, and criteria you must meet to join the beta. You can install the beta app on up to 30 devices.</p><p>If you do not meet the tester criteria, the beta invitation will inform you that the developer requires you to test with a specific device and OS when you tap or click Learn More on the beta invitation. If you have a device that meets the critiera, you can install TestFlight on the device and then accept the beta invitation.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can accept an invitation on a non-preferred device as long as you have a device associated with TestFlight that meets the criteria set by the developer.</p><p>If you do not wish to accept an invitation, you can easily <a href="#giving-feedback">give feedback</a> to help the developer by letting them know why.</p><p><span>Note:</span> When testing your app&#39;s subscriptions in TestFlight, the renewal rate is accelerated. Each subscription is renewed daily, up to 6 times within a one-week period, regardless of the subscription&#39;s duration.</p><p><span>Note:</span> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210737"><span>Managed Apple Accounts</span></a> can&#39;t be used to test builds.</p>
