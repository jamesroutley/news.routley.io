    <h1>aligning Markdown tables in Helix</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, March 13, 2023</em></p><p>One of the things I like most about using <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix</a> (and <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>, when I used it before) is the multiple cursor support. I use them whenever I can! Today, I want to share how Helix solves a common task: formatting a Markdown table.</p><p>When I first write Markdown tables, they tend to look like this (with some data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/lego-database?select=parts.csv">this LEGO Database on Kaggle</a>.) Ragged-right formatting and just enough syntax for a parser to tell the headers from the rows:</p><pre data-lang="markdown"><code data-lang="markdown"><span>| ID | Name | Category ID |
</span><span>|-|-|-|
</span><span>| 11092 | Gorilla Fist | 27 |
</span><span>| 11212 | Plate 3 x 3 | 14 |
</span><span>| 11209 | Tyre 21 x 9.9 | 29 |
</span><span>| 11640pr0003 | ELECTRIC GUITAR SHAFT Ø3.2 NO. 3 | 27 |
</span></code></pre><p>This looks fine when rendered, but it&#39;s somewhat annoying in the source. In other editors I&#39;ve used, you either need to do the alignment by hand (tedious!) or use some plugin. In Helix and Kakoune, doing this is fairly simple: you just need to combine some editing primitives.</p><p>Bottom-line-up-front, the key sequence is <code>mips\|&lt;ret&gt;&amp;</code>. But that looks just like line noise, so let&#39;s break it down:</p><p>First, I hit <code>mip</code> to select the whole paragraph, then select pipes (<code>s\|&lt;ret&gt;</code>.) That gives me one selection per pipe character:</p><p><img src="https://stripe.com/images/one-selection-per-character-in-a-markdown-table.png" alt="screenshot of Helix, in which each pipe character from the code sample above is selected by a rectangular cursor."/></p><p>Then I hit <code>&amp;</code>, the “align selections” operator, which gets me the final alignment:</p><pre data-lang="markdown"><code data-lang="markdown"><span>| ID          | Name                             | Category ID |
</span><span>|-            |-                                 |-            |
</span><span>| 11092       | Gorilla Fist                     | 27          |
</span><span>| 11212       | Plate 3 x 3                      | 14          |
</span><span>| 11209       | Tyre 21 x 9.9                    | 29          |
</span><span>| 11640pr0003 | ELECTRIC GUITAR SHAFT Ø3.2 NO. 3 | 27          |
</span></code></pre><p>This still renders just fine, but it&#39;s a little nicer reading experience to have the line separating the headers from the body rows full of hyphens. That one&#39;s easy too: after dismissing the selections with <code>,</code>, you can navigate to the row, hit <code>x</code> to select the whole line, then <code>s</code> to select characters, enter space as the section, and <code>r-</code> to replace all the selections with hyphens. Now it&#39;s a perfectly nice Markdown table that&#39;s very pleasant to read in the source:</p><pre data-lang="markdown"><code data-lang="markdown"><span>| ID          | Name                             | Category ID |
</span><span>|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
