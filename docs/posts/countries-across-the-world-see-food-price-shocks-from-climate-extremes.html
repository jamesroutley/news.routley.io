<blockquote><p><strong><span><span>&#34;Until we get to net-zero emissions, extreme weather will only get worse, and it&#39;s already damaging crops and pushing up the price of food all over the world,” said Maximilian Kotz, BSC researcher and lead author of the study.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>British potatoes, Californian vegetables, South African maize and Indian onions are among many foods affected by recent price shocks driven by weather extremes, according to a team of international scientists.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ade45f" target="_blank">study</a>, led by Maximillian Kotz of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center-Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS), investigated 16 examples across 18 countries over a two-year period (2022-2024), where price spikes were associated with extreme heat, drought or heavy precipitation events, many of which were so extreme they exceeded all historical precedent prior to 2020.</p>
<p>Among these examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the UK, potato prices increased 22% (from Jan to Feb 2024) following extreme winter rainfall that scientists <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/autumn-and-winter-storms-over-uk-and-ireland-are-becoming-wetter-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank">said</a> was made 20% heavier and 10 times more likely by climate change.</li>
<li>In California and Arizona in the United States, vegetable prices increased 80% in November 2022 after the extreme summer drought in western states, which <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/high-temperatures-exacerbated-by-climate-change-made-2022-northern-hemisphere-droughts-more-likely/" target="_blank">faced</a> water shortages, extreme heat, and soil moisture drought conditions throughout the summer of 2022.</li>
<li>In Ethiopia, food prices were 40% higher in March 2023 following the 2022 drought in the Horn of Africa, the worst in 40 years, which scientists <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/human-induced-climate-change-increased-drought-severity-in-southern-horn-of-africa/" target="_blank">said</a> was made &#34;much stronger&#34; and &#34;about 100 times more likely&#34; by climate change.</li>
<li>In Spain and Italy, the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/drought" target="_blank">2022-2023 drought in southern Europe</a>, for which scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01559-2" target="_blank">said</a> &#34;global warming contributed for more than 30% of the (2022 summer) drought intensity and its spatial extent via enhanced evaporation&#34;, drove an increase in the price of olive oil of 50% year-on-year across the EU by January 2024, on top of price increases the previous year. Spain produces over two fifths of the world&#39;s olive oil.</li>
<li>Global cocoa prices were almost 300% (280%) higher in April 2024 following the heatwave in Ivory Coast and Ghana just two months earlier, which scientists <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/dangerous-humid-heat-in-southern-west-africa-about-4c-hotter-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank">said</a> was made 4<span>∘</span>C hotter by climate change. Together, these two countries account for nearly two thirds (60%) of global cocoa production.</li>
<li>The global coffee market has also taken serious hits. Brazil is the world&#39;s biggest exporter of Arabica, while Vietnam is the biggest exporter of Robusta. Global coffee prices were 55% higher in August 2024 following the 2023 drought in Brazil, which scientists <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-not-el-nino-main-driver-of-exceptional-drought-in-highly-vulnerable-amazon-river-basin/#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20the%20likelihood%20of%20the%20meteorological%20drought%20occurring%20has%20increased%20by%20a%20factor%20of%2010%2C%20while%20the%20agricultural%20drought%20has%20become%20about%2030%20times%20more%20likely.%C2%A0" target="_blank">said</a> was made 10-30 times more likely due to climate change, while Robusta coffee prices were 100% higher in July 2024 following <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme/" target="_blank">record-breaking heat</a> a few months earlier in Vietnam and across Asia.</li>
<li>In India, the price of onions and potatoes jumped by over 80% in the second quarter of 2024 after a heatwave in May, a <a href="https://www.climameter.org/20240526-29-india-heatwave" target="_blank">&#34;largely unique event&#34;</a> that was made at least 1.5°C warmer by climate change.</li>
<li>In Japan, rice prices were 48% higher in September 2024 after the August heatwave, as the country <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/09/02/japan/2024-joint-hottest-summer/" target="_blank">experienced</a> its hottest summer (on a par with 2023) since regional records began in 1946, with summer temperatures 1.76<span>∘</span>C higher than average.</li>
<li>In South Korea, cabbage prices were 70% higher in September 2024 after the August heatwave. The country <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/record-july-temperatures-as-south-korea-grapples-with-heatwave#:~:text=experienced%20in%202024%20its%20highest%20average%20summer%20time%20temperature%20since%20such%20records%20began%20half%20a%20century%20ago%20%E2%80%93%20nearly%20two%20degrees%20higher%20than%20the%20historic%20average" target="_blank">experienced</a> its highest average summer time temperature since such records began half a century ago - nearly two degrees higher than the historic average.</li>
<li>Pakistan experienced a 50% increase in rural food prices in weeks following the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-025-00109-z" target="_blank">August 2022 floods</a>, with monsoon rains 547% above average and record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200 mm) on already saturated soils as the pre-monsoon rainfall was 111% higher than the long-term average since 1951.</li>
<li>In Mexico, fruit and vegetable prices were 20% higher in January 2024 following the 2023 drought, one of the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152908/drought-parches-mexico" target="_blank">most severe droughts</a> that Mexico has faced in more than a decade.</li>

<p>Research by the Food Foundation <a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/publication/broken-plate-2025" target="_blank">shows</a> that, on average, healthy food is twice as expensive per calories as less healthy food. When prices increase, low- income households are likely to cut back on nutritious foods like fruit and vegetables because they can&#39;t afford them.</p>
<p>Climate change-induced food price shocks could therefore exacerbate a range of health outcomes, from malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients, which is a particular concern for children whose nutritional needs are higher) to a range of chronic diet-related conditions including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and many cancers. There is also a growing body of evidence connecting food insecurity and poor diets with mental health outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Maximillian Kotz, Marie-Curie post-doctoral fellow at BSC and lead author of the study</b>, said:</p>
<p>&#34;Until we get to net-zero emissions, extreme weather will only get worse, and it&#39;s already damaging crops and pushing up the price of food all over the world.</p>
<p>&#34;People are noticing, with <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2626%7Ee86e2be2b4.en.pdf" target="_blank">rising food prices</a> number two on <a href="https://globescan.com/2024/09/25/insight-of-the-week-top-ways-people-are-experiencing-climate-change/" target="_blank">the list of climate impacts</a> they see in their lives, second only to extreme heat itself.</p>
<p>&#34;Sadly, when the price of food shoots up, low-income families often have to resort to less nutritious, cheaper foods. Diets like this have been linked to a range of health conditions like cancer, diabetes and heart disease.&#34;</p>
<p>Central bank mandates for controlling inflation may become harder to deliver as increasingly extreme weather makes food prices more volatile domestically and in global markets.</p>
<p>The research comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.unfoodsystemshub.org/un-food-systems-summit-4-stocktake/" target="_blank">UN Food Systems Summit Stocktake</a> on Sunday 27 July, where world leaders will meet to discuss threats to the global food system. The event is co-hosted by Ethiopia and Italy, both of whom have been hit by climate change-induced food price shocks and are featured in the study.</p>
<p>When it comes to the UK, potatoes aren&#39;t the only British-grown commodity affected by climate change. Cereals, onions, sugar beet, cauliflowers and broccoli have also been hit over the past few years, all while <a href="https://globescan.com/2024/09/25/insight-of-the-week-top-ways-people-are-experiencing-climate-change/" target="_blank">&#39;back-up&#39; imports from other countries have been failing</a> due to climate impacts abroad.</p>
<p><b>Amber Sawyer, analyst at the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU),</b> said:</p>
<p>&#34;Last year, the UK <a href="https://eciu.net/media/press-releases/2024/uk-harvest-hits-near-record-lows-following-government-food-security-warnings" target="_blank">had</a> its third-worst arable harvest on record, and <a href="https://eciu.net/media/press-releases/2024/confirmed-england-has-second-worst-harvest-on-record-with-fears-mounting-for-2025" target="_blank">England its second worst</a>, following extreme rainfall that scientists <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/autumn-and-winter-storms-over-uk-and-ireland-are-becoming-wetter-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank">said</a> was made about 10 times more likely and 20% more intense by climate change.</p>
<p>&#34;But it&#39;s not just that. British farmers have been yo-yoing between extremes for the past few years. They&#39;ve gone from having to contend with extreme heat in 2022, when temperatures <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/without-human-caused-climate-change-temperatures-of-40c-in-the-uk-would-have-been-extremely-unlikely/" target="_blank">reached</a> 40°C for the first time, to <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/autumn-and-winter-storms-over-uk-and-ireland-are-becoming-wetter-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank">extreme rain in late 2023 and early 2024</a>, both of which ruined their crops. Fast forward to now, and they&#39;ve just <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2025/double-record-breaker-spring-2025-is-warmest-and-sunniest-on-uk-record" target="_blank">faced</a> the warmest spring since records began and the sixth driest. For them, climate change isn&#39;t a distant warning: it&#39;s a reality they&#39;re living every day.</p>
<p>&#34;These extremes are also hitting consumers. In the UK, climate change <a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2023/climate-fossil-fuels-and-uk-food-prices-2023" target="_blank">added</a> £360 to the average household food bill across 2022 and 2023 alone. We&#39;ve seen much more extreme weather since then.&#34;</p>
<p>The world <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2025/2024-record-breaking-watershed-year-for-global-climate" target="_blank">has currently warmed</a> by an average of about 1.3<span>∘</span>C above pre-industrial levels, but analysis by the UN <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024" target="_blank">has found</a> that the current trajectory is for around 3°C of warming, which it says will be &#39;debilitating.</p>
<p>2023. the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2024/2023-the-warmest-year-on-record-globally" target="_blank">hottest year ever recorded</a>, was then <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2025/2024-record-breaking-watershed-year-for-global-climate" target="_blank">overtaken</a> by 2024. As early as December last year, experts at BSC, WMO and Met Office <a href="https://www.bsc.es/news/bsc-news/bsc-wmo-predict-2025-the-second-warmest-year-record">predicted</a> that 2025 will be one of the top three hottest years alongside them.</p>
<p>While the 2023/24 El Niño likely played a role in amplifying these extremes, their increased frequency and intensity is in line with the expected and observed effects of human-induced climate change.</p>
<p>The research was conducted by an interdisciplinary team from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), European Central Bank (ECB), University of Aberdeen and the Food Foundation.</p>
