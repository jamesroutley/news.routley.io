    <h1>Tor is fighting and beating Russian censorship</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><span>For years, the</span> anonymity service <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-grand-tor/">Tor</a> has been the best way to stay private online and dodge web censorship. Much to the ire of governments and law enforcement agencies, Tor encrypts your web traffic and sends it through a chain of computers, making it <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tor-anonymity-easier-than-ever/">very hard for people to track you online</a>. Authoritarian governments see it as a particular <a data-offer-url="https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/&#34;}" href="https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">threat</a> to their longevity, and in recent months, Russia has stepped up its long-term ambition to block Tor—although not without a fight.</p><p>In December 2021, Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, enacted a 4-year-old court order that allows it to order internet service providers (ISPs) to block the Tor Project website, where the <a data-offer-url="https://www.torproject.org/download/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.torproject.org/download/&#34;}" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tor Browser can be downloaded</a>, and restrict access to its services. Since then, censors have been locked in a battle with Tor’s technical team and users in Russia, who are pushing to keep the Tor network online and allow people to access the uncensored web, which is otherwise <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-splinternet-censorship/">heavily restricted</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ukraine-social-media/">in the country</a>.</p><p>Russia’s efforts to block Tor come in two flavors: the technical and the political. So far, Tor has had some success on both fronts. It has found ways to avoid Russian blocking efforts, and this month, it was <a data-offer-url="https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/the-tor-project-unblocked/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/the-tor-project-unblocked/&#34;}" href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/the-tor-project-unblocked/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">removed</a> from Russia’s list of blocked websites following a legal challenge. (Although this doesn’t mean blocking efforts will instantly end.)</p><p>“We are being attacked by the Russian government, they are trying to block Tor,” says Gustavo Gus, community team lead of the Tor Project. The past few months have seen Russian officials adapt their tactics, Gus says, while the Tor Project’s anti-censorship engineers have successfully launched updates to stop its services from being blocked. “The fight is not over,” Gus says. “People can connect to Tor. People can easily bypass censorship.”</p><p>In Russia, the internet infrastructure is relatively decentralized: ISPs can receive blocking orders from Roskomnadzor, but it’s up to individual companies to implement them. (China is the only country to have effectively blocked Tor, which was possible due to <a data-offer-url="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ypwevy/russia-wants-to-block-tor-but-it-probably-cant" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/ypwevy/russia-wants-to-block-tor-but-it-probably-cant&#34;}" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ypwevy/russia-wants-to-block-tor-but-it-probably-cant" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more centralized internet control</a>). While Russian authorities have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-splinternet-censorship/">installing new equipment</a> that uses <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/russia-internet-censorship-putin.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/russia-internet-censorship-putin.html&#34;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/russia-internet-censorship-putin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">deep packet inspection</a> to monitor and block online services, the effectiveness of these blocks is mixed.</p><p>“The censorship that’s happening in Russia is not constant and uniform,” Gus says. Gus explains that because of different ISPs, Tor may be blocked for some people but not others, even those in the same city. Both Tor’s metrics and external analysis appear to show the dwindling effectiveness of Russian censorship.</p><p>Tor’s data shows that since the end of 2021 there has been a <a data-offer-url="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/metrics-country.html?start=2021-01-01&amp;end=2022-07-26&amp;country=ru" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/metrics-country.html?start=2021-01-01&amp;end=2022-07-26&amp;country=ru&#34;}" href="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/metrics-country.html?start=2021-01-01&amp;end=2022-07-26&amp;country=ru" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">big drop</a> in the number of people directly connecting to Tor in Russia.
