</i></span><span></span></a><span>into the era of networking and graphics.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has described Plan 9 as &#34;an argument&#34; for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as &#34;UNIX, only moreso.&#34;
</span></p>

<p>
<span>From
</span><span><i><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:</a> </i></span><span></span></p><ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it
is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support
for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>From the
<a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"></a></span><a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"><span><tt>intro(1)
</tt></span><span></span></a><span>man page:

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from
separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file
servers.  A user works at a terminal, running a window
system on a raster display.  Some windows are connected to
CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be
done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on
the terminal.  A separate file server provides file storage
for terminals and CPU servers alike.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:
</span></p>


<ul><span>•
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">private namespaces</a> (each process constructs a unique view of the hierarchical file system)
</span></ul>

<ul><span>•
<a href="http://man.9front.org/5/intro">file interfaces</a> (familiar from UNIX, but taken to the extreme: all resources in Plan 9 look like file systems)
</span></ul>


<p>
<span>Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.
</span></p>


<ul><span><i>Plan 9 really pushes hard on some ideas that Unix has that haven&#39;t
really been fully developed, in particular, the notion that just about
everything in the system is accessible through a file.  In other
words, things look like an ordinary disk file.  So all the devices are
controlled this way by means of ASCII strings, not complicated data
structures.  For example, you make network calls by writing an ASCII
string, not the files.  This notion is something that&#39;s actually
leaking quite fast.
</i></span></ul>

<ul><span><i>The second thing is sort of more subtle and sort of hard to appreciate
until you&#39;ve actually played with it.  That is that the set of files
an individual program can see depends on that program itself.  In a
standard kind of system, either with Unix remote file systems or
Windows attached file systems, all the programs running in the machine
see the same thing.  In Plan 9, that&#39;s adjustable per program.  You
can set up specialized name stations that are unique to a particular
program.  I mean, it&#39;s not associated with the program itself but with
the process, with the execution of the process.
