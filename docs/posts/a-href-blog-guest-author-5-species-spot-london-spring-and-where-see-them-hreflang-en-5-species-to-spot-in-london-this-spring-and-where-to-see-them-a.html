          <div><div><p>The bluebell is, perhaps, one of our most famous and unmistakable woodland flowers: look for long, narrow, drooping leaf fronds, and bending flower stems that are heavy with nodding, blue bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Where to see them: <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/nature-reserves/gutteridge-wood">Gutteridge Wood </a>and <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/nature-reserves/bramley-bank">Bramley Bank</a></p>
</div></div>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>The &#39;drumming&#39; of a great spotted woodpecker is a familiar sound. Great spotted woodpeckers drum in short bursts that fade out at the end. The drumming of the lesser spotted woodpecker is higher pitched, in a longer burst that stops abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>Where to see them: </strong><a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/nature-reserves/gunnersbury-triangle"><u>Gunnersbury Triangle</u></a></p>

          <div><p><h2>3. Snake’s-head fritillaries</h2>
</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The nodding, pink-and-purple-chequered flowers of the snake&#39;s-head fritillary are said to resemble a snake, hence the name. Declining with the loss of our meadows, this delicate plant can be seen in spring.</p>
<p><strong>Where to see them: </strong><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/nature-reserves/camley-street-natural-park"><u>Camley Street</u></a></p>
</div></div>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>These slinky water birds are famous for their wonderful courtship dance. On early spring mornings, great crested grebe pairs join together to perform this elegant ritual. Head shaking, bill-dipping, and preening culminates in the famous ‘penguin dance’; the pair rush together, feet frantically paddling until they are upright, chest to chest, flicking beaks full of water weed at each other. A final head shake, the weed is dropped, and the deal is sealed. </p>

          <div><div><p>Head to your local woodland to spot some of our fantastic woodland butterflies this spring, such as the speckled wood. Sunny glades, rides and woodland edges are some of the best places to look for a variety of species. </p>

<p>London’s wildlife is under real threat. Without our protection, special moments we spend in nature, such as seeing the first bluebells in spring, will become a thing of the past. We can’t let that happen.</p>
<p>London Wildlife Trust is a driving force for nature conservation across the capital. We take action every day to help wildlife flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Will you join us and help protect our precious wildlife in London?</strong></p>
