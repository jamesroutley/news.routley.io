    <h1>A reader asks how to avoid working for evil</h1>
    
    
<p>
This one came in a request from a reader.  They want to know my feelings 
about trying to "... avoid a company contributing to the downfall of 
humanity".  This one's tough, particularly given my own history.
</p><p>
I worked for a web hosting company that had a dubious history of keeping 
spammers around far too long.  Then while I was there, they had the 
so-called "adware" vendor.  They got mad if you called it "spyware".  I 
honestly thought it was random trash that people were installing on 
their own machines and so that's what they wanted.  I only found out 
recently that it apparently was distributed by way of Internet Exploder 
drive-by ActiveX/whatever shenanigans.  So, if you ran that cursed 
browser and landed on a page with their stuff in it, you got owned.
</p><p>
Now, that customer didn't last forever.  They got whacked by AUP after a 
bit, but they were still there for a good... six months or so?  And we 
definitely got bonuses in our paychecks when they upgraded their 
configs because we had managed to solve a bunch of their scaling 
problems.  Yes, we made them more efficient, and *they got bigger* as a 
result, and those of us on the support teams directly benefited in a 
paycheck or two.
</p><p>
Then I worked for a place that was doing web search and had gotten into 
the business of providing free web-based e-mail that was pretty good.  
They had also started doing a few other things.  They had a few simple 
*well delineated* ads on their result pages (and maybe a few other 
places), and that was it.  Lots of people were like "you should go work 
there", so I tried it, and somehow I got in.
</p><p>
During my tenure there, they went and ate a company that I had a real 
beef with as a spam-fighting sysadmin for a bunch of users before the 
web hosting job.  I'm convinced it's actually karma: eight years 
before, I had dinner with some people, including someone I had never 
met before.  When I found out where he worked, I asked him something 
like "what's it like working for an evil company like Doubleclick".  
Yeah, I actually said that.  *facepalm*
</p><p>
When the legalities of the merger were finished in 2008, I too worked 
for that evil company by extension.  By absorbing it instead of killing 
it, we became them (see also: Collabra).  The name was different, but 
the internal damage was done.  This lead to all kinds of other crazy 
shit that came down the line, all in the name of fellating the 
advertisers, like Emerald Sea, aka Google Plus.  That whole thing.  
</p><p>
They were trying to do all kinds of crazy stuff, like you'd be browsing 
around and it'd say "hey, this looks like your Twitter page, so would 
you like to link it to your profile?" - and it's like holy crap, the 
company has crossed the line, then dug it up and set the pit on fire.  
Just because you CAN make a dossier on someone with your damn crawling 
infra doesn't mean you DO IT.  That's where they were going.  Full on 
creeper land, with the immense power of their infrastructure.
</p><p>
Then I decided to go somewhere else that (as far as I could tell) 
existed because people willingly put their data there.  They uploaded 
pics and posted about going places and doing things.  All of the data 
was sent to the site.  The site didn't go out and scrape it off the web.  
I was okay with this.  I didn't use the site myself, but I figured that 
made me the weirdo, not the (then) billion-something people who did.  
Clearly, they find it useful, so what do I care?
</p><p>
Of course, while I toiled in the infra mines at this company, all kinds 
of truly evil shit was going on, including the installation of a fascist 
regime in my country, the apparent genocide in at least one other 
country, and so on.  It's like, someone even asked me about supporting 
the not-quite-UTF-8 language stuff they used in that country.  Now I 
wonder exactly what all was enabled by virtue of being able to support 
that encoding!  (Seriously, you know who you are.  Is that what 
happened?  Did that work let the bad people break loose out there?)
</p><p>
Then there's the joint which tried to look like they were all about 
smarter use of cars, but which probably added to overall congestion.  
They didn't want the key people who actually do the real work to be 
employees and went to the mat with heavy lobbying to make it happen 
during an election cycle.  They also pulled out of a good-sized urban 
area in a very large state when the city put up requirements for 
background checks.
</p><p>
This is just the obvious stuff.  I haven't even mentioned any of the 
"how they treat their employees" incidents from these places.  Every 
company has at least a couple of these that I've actually witnessed, 
and far more that I heard about from trustworthy sources.
</p><p>
Sometimes I think about the fact that I've made some bad things more 
reliable so they can go about doing evil more efficiently, quickly, or 
just at all.  It sucks.
</p><p>
I 
<a href="/w/2013/01/26/takeover/">said</a>
this in 2013: "If your resources or reputation could be used to 
harm people, you owe it to them to jealously guard it lest it fall into 
the wrong hands."  I still think this has happened too many times.
</p><p>
However, I no longer think that people are capable of guarding it to 
keep the vampires out.  The only way to keep something with great power 
from being exploited might be to keep it from existing in the first 
place.
</p><p>
But what do I know, right?
