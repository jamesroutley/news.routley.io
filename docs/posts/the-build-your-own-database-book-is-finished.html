    <h1>The “Build Your Own Database” book is finished</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Databases are a fascinating topic. They are a foundation of modern
computing. Learning how they work should be an important part of
software engineering education.</p>
<p>As many of today’s (2023+) coders do not have a formal CS/SE
education, basic things such as databases, compilers, operating systems,
etc. are often seen as magical black boxes. That’s why I started the
“<em>Build Your Own X</em>” book series. To learn and teach the basics
in a “<em>from scratch</em>” approach, through <em>succinct</em> &amp;
condensed books.</p>
<p>There are some important topics that we can learn from database
systems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Persistence.</strong> How not to lose or corrupt your data.
Recovering from a crash.</li>
<li><strong>Indexing.</strong> Efficiently querying and manipulating
your data. (B-tree).</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency.</strong> How to handle multiple (large number
of) clients. And transactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with my other books, this book follows the step-by-step approach
while covering the 3 topics above. We start from a B-tree, then to a KV
store, finally to a mini database with a SQL-like query language.</p>
<p>The book is divided into 2 parts. Part I implements a KV store. Part
II implements a mini database and a query language based on the KV store
from Part I.</p>
<p>Part I is self-contained and can be used as a standalone book for
persistent KV stores, it is also <a href="https://build-your-own.org/database/">freely available
online</a>.</p>
<p>The whole book is available as <a href="https://build-your-own.org/database/90_end.html">paperback or ebook</a>.</p>
