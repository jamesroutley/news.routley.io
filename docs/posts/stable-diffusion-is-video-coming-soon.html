This transformative capability is very similar to the traditional deepfake functionality that emerged in 2017 (and which, for most people, still defines the term ‘deepfakes’). </p><p>The difference is that the Stable Diffusion model has also ingested vast amounts of environmental and incidental data, as well as data related to the general physical characteristics of celebrities (i.e., not just their inner faces), and can accurately reproduce people in their entirety, and in the context of the user’s choice (such as ‘studio setting’).</p><figure> <img width="1200" height="848" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ben-affleck-trampolining.jpg" alt="ben-affleck-trampolining" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ben-affleck-trampolining.jpg 1200w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ben-affleck-trampolining-300x212.jpg 300w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ben-affleck-trampolining-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ben-affleck-trampolining-768x543.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/><figcaption>Data trained into Stable Diffusion from the LAION database, which has generalized well enough on ‘trampolining’ and ‘Ben Affleck’ to be able to combine these two concepts.

Close examination of Tom Cruise’s hand in our earlier Stable Diffusion-prompted image reveals some problems:</p><figure> <img width="515" height="514" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cruise-hand.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cruise-hand.jpg 515w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cruise-hand-300x300.jpg 300w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cruise-hand-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px"/><figcaption>Tom Cruise’s hand is not in great shape, as Stable Diffusion has difficulty eliciting and representing complex poses and disposition of human limbs.<br/></figcaption></figure><p>As with GANs and autoencoder-based deepfakes, the closer two subjects are together, the more prone diffusion models are to become confused.

There are so many possible configurations and dispositions of limbs, particularly between multiple individuals within the same generated photo, that the process of generalization may only have 2-3 images for each pose at its disposal, where (for instance) hands are in different positions, leading to a ‘fusion’ of ‘multiple hands’. </p><h2>Grass-Roots, Global AI Training?</h2><p>Ultimately, increased training as well as higher volumes of images would be likely to alleviate the problem. There is currently talk in the Stable Diffusion developer community regarding the possibility of exploiting increased consumer-level GPU availability (brought about by Ethereum’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/the-merge-the-biggest-change-in-ethereum-history-explained/">switch to proof-of-stake</a>, and an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/nvidias-excess-inventory-means-the-gpu-shortage-is-officially-a-gpu-surplus/">unexpected surfeit</a> of NVIDIA GPU inventory) into a collective system that would distribute training tasks across a global community of contributing users.</p><p>This would allow perpetual networked training of the common models that underpin Stable Diffusion (rather than fine-tuning, which involves one user adding some pictures and continuing to train the public model so that it incorporates those images, which is likely to compromise the original rendering quality of the model).</p><p>In the meantime, it seems likely that proponents of Stable Diffusion output will develop their own set of ‘situations to avoid’, just as the autoencoder deepfake community has done.</p><h2>Square Dealing and Decapitation</h2><p>Not all the weird contortions and nightmare-style limb-manglings that Stable Diffusion can unwittingly generate are centered around poor training or inadequate data. Sometimes the system has to make unappealing compromises for prompts that are at odds with other factors.</p><p>The system has been consistently trained in a square aspect ratio, notwithstanding the (often differing) dimensions of the input training images. Because this can lead either to cropping or padding of the input image (depending on decisions that are automatically made at training time), this could be one of the reasons for several different types of rendering issue – most famously, the ‘extra anatomy’ that can appear when the source data was primarily ‘square’, but the user has set their resolution to a non-square mode such as 320×768:</p><figure> <img width="576" height="896" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/distortion.jpg" alt="distortion" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/distortion.jpg 576w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/distortion-193x300.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px"/><figcaption>Emma Watson gets some additional anatomy, as Stable Diffusion was ‘thinking square’ but required to output to portrait mode.

This happens most frequently in NSFW generations, where the text prompts are likely to emphasize below-the-neck anatomy, or the model is drawing on ‘anonymous’ pornographic content in the training data, which did not include faces:</p><p><img width="1300" height="661" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cut-heads.jpg" alt="cut-heads" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cut-heads.jpg 1300w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cut-heads-300x153.jpg 300w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cut-heads-1024x521.jpg 1024w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cut-heads-768x390.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px"/></p><p>This, again, appears to be either a potential mismatch in the aspect ratio most strongly associated with the concept that the user is eliciting (which may be at odds with the dimensions they have asked for); or else can occur because the prompt has focused Stable Diffusion’s attention excessively on the body area. The latter case can sometimes be remedied by adding face-based text content to the prompt.</p><p>Stable Diffusion can also ‘fix’ aspect ratio mismatches of this type by producing extra images inside the same image.

It’s capable of producing a few seconds of forward movement from an initial starting point, without the need for a ‘target’ frame. </p><p>In other words, it differs from many such interpretive systems, including <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-its-very-difficult-to-create-ai-based-slow-motion-tv1453wmu">DAIN</a> and other upscaling interpretive architectures, in that it is not just creating <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/video/discover/tweening.html">‘tween’ frames</a> between two real (or even unreal) images, but actually creating movement based on learned priors that are trained into the model from a dataset of 5.4 million captioned videos.</p><p>But even this enormous volume of training data can only capture limited instances of the wide range of human activities that might need to be represented in a video, which currently makes it impossible to seed complex motions (i.e. ‘woman stands up, stretches, walks towards camera, picks up magazine, returns to chair, sits down, reads magazine’) from a single image.</p><p>Therefore the standard method currently used by CogVideo enthusiasts, including in the Stable Diffusion communities, is to use the architecture to ‘fill in’ keyframes generated either by CogVideo itself, or ‘anchor frames’ that have been generated by static image synthesis systems such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2.</p><figure> <img width="312" height="312" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CogVideoWoman-1.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>A typical example of multiple inputs ‘tent-poling’ a more complex, albeit fairly repetitive animation, via CogVideo.

The results are crude and semi-hallucinatory, and very, very far from photorealistic, but exhibit far more temporal cohesiveness and narrative clarity than the DeepDream craze of several years ago (which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaTQYFG_pb8">LSD-laced style</a> has also lately <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyS8OwljFVY&amp;t=2s">been adopted</a> by Stable Diffusion users).</p><p>To develop these complex videos, the users have effectively extended the A&gt;B tweening scenario into an A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D etc. paradigm, where CogVideo begins a new interpretation where the previous segment finished up. This allows for a non-linear and non-repetitive video that can develop in ways that are unpredictable to the viewer.</p><p>However, the primary reason (besides sheer intensity of interest) that the earliest hyper-realistic AI videos are likely to be pornographic is that nearly all of the acts depicted in pornography are repetitious by nature, and as such already ideally suited to both A&gt;B ‘tweening’ via AI, and the creation of CogVideo ‘loops’ that amount to the same effect. </p><p>Here, as with LAION, the possible movements that can be depicted are limited to whatever was included in the dataset on which CogVideo was trained. To the best of my knowledge, none of the 5.4 million videos on which CogVideo was trained are NSFW, or depict sexual activity, though presumably some common human activities could be adapted to this cause. </p><p>Additionally, there is nothing to stop NSFW Stable Diffusion communities from developing exclusively pornographic video datasets that would be far more efficient at generating this kind of material after training. They are already doing so for static porn datasets:</p><p><img width="851" height="638" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NSFW-development.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-srcset="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NSFW-development.jpg 851w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NSFW-development-300x225.jpg 300w, https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NSFW-development-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px"/></p><p>What this effectively means is that some of the earliest Stable Diffusion videos are likely to consist of such NSFW loops, and will almost certainly be short enough to be shared as animated GIFs. </p><p>‘Racy’ GIFS are nothing new, and neither is deepfake porn; the difference here is that such videos, including videos of celebrities, will at last be genuinely easy to produce (as many believe – wrongly – deepfake porn currently is).</p><h2>Other Paths to Stable Diffusion Video Synthesis</h2><p>Stable Diffusion’s interpretive powers can be leveraged in other ways to create video. One such approach is ‘deepfake puppetry’. </p><figure> <img width="500" height="504" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/manson_jobs_et_al-1.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Far from real-time, but here Stable Diffusion is run over each individual extracted frame in a real-world face sequence. Source: https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/wyeoqq/turning_img2img_into_vid2vid/<br/></figcaption></figure><p>In the example above, the user has fed each extracted frame into Stable Diffusion, together with a prompt that identifies the celebrity that should be superimposed. The same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw8QG7Mwass">seed value</a> has been retained for each generation, and the code modified so that the same noise tensor is passed to the <i>stochastic_encode()</i> parameter every time – a trick that could easily be integrated into Stable Diffusion.</p><p>In contrast to real-time deepfake streaming systems such as DeepFaceLive, which only replace the internal facial features in videos which are otherwise genuine, puppetry allows real-world movement to control <i>completely synthetic</i> video output, a paradigm that Neural Radiance Fields has implemented as well, notably in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06481.pdf">RigNeRF</a>. </p><p>It remains to be seen to what extent code alterations could produce temporally and semantically consistent transformations, without that characteristic hallucinatory shimmer that currently hallmarks AI-generated synthetic content (unless it employs some kind of CGI routine to stabilize the output and dial down the level of <i>ad hoc</i> frame-based interpretation).</p><p>If these problems are solved, the path could eventually open up for authentic and 100% synthesized deepfake puppetry via diffusion-based image generators. For longer video clips, the process would need to become quite industrialized, but would represent a notable usability improvement over current explorations of the GAN latent space, and could pave the way for full-body deepfakes with photorealistic faces that correspond to people in the real world.</p><p>There are also a number of third-party applications and APIs that can add repetitive or simple movement to any input image – mostly circular, repetitive movement. While there’s nothing to stop Stable Diffusion users feeding their output (SFW or otherwise) into such systems, the results are limited, if momentarily engaging.</p><p>For instance, MyHeritage, an avid adopter of image synthesis frameworks, can bring static Stable Diffusion renderings to life via the <a href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2021/02/deep-nostalgia-goes-viral/">DeepNostalgia</a> architecture:</p><figure> <img width="800" height="338" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://metaphysic.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cruise_final_myheritage.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>A Stable Diffusion-generated image of Tom Cruise, animated by DeepNostalgia.

Source: https://twitter.com/FabianMosele/status/1552412134251892737<br/></figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty of maintaining a consistent appearance and style across multiple image generations, even by hacking the code, means that effective deepfake-style puppetry systems for frameworks such as Stable Diffusion will be a challenge to implement. Nonetheless, they may currently represent the best hope for hyper-realistic diffusion-based video in the near term.</p><p>If history is anything to go by (particularly the history of GANs), we’re in for 18 months of new research papers claiming new incremental victories in making diffusion-based image synthesis systems amenable to video generation, simply by exploring and manipulating their latent space.</p><p>After this, there’ll be another 18 months of further research papers that have abandoned that particular hope, and which instead offer frameworks that use parametric, CGI-style interstitial ‘bridges’ capable of bringing some kind of temporal consistency to diffusion-based video. </p><p>In the meantime, a new wave of SFW and NSFW implementations and APIs of Stable Diffusion are likely to emerge in the next six months, many of which will seek to differentiate themselves by offering ‘fine-tuned’ models that have added domains (certainly not excluding porn, in some cases) that are otherwise under-represented or absent in the official sources used by Stability.ai – or which offer facile training or fine-tuning, so that users can develop their own ‘specialized’ models – for a price (likely a subscription-based price).</p><p>The next thing to watch for with Stable Diffusion is not necessarily video, but new and better implementations of textual inversion than are currently available, which could obviate the need for further training of the core model, and which could represent a quantum leap forward in image synthesis – if hardware requirements, data issues, and other obstacles can be overcome.</p></div></div></div>
