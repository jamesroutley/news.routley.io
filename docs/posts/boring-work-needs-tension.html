  <div><p>We are all moved by great movies, cinematography, and stories. Watching them is fun because you can imagine yourself resonating with a character. You are thrilled by the tension the story creates and curious how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Many find software development a dull job where you have to write exactly what your PM or client asks for. It’s exciting at first, but it can become boring after a few iterations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever doesn’t excite you, change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we, as developers, push ourselves to be protagonists, we discover many problems to solve — a lot of tension to resolve. Here are a few good problems for everyday devs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your CI/CD takes a huge amount of time because you forgot to leverage caching.</li>
<li>You forgot to add connection pooling and your service bombarded the database, causing too many open connections.</li>
<li>You misconfigured the garbage collector and now you have a memory leak that keeps growing.</li>
<li>If it takes you more than 3 seconds to understand what you wrote last week, it’s poorly written.</li>
<li>Latency is high for your users in Mumbai because your servers are in Singapore.</li>
<li>The database becomes very slow when you start dumping data in batches.</li>
<li>You want consistent API responses for read operations for users in both Mumbai and Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not trivial problems; they happen every day. These are our villains — irritating, unwanted, and surprising. We should eliminate them.</p>
<p>Pick your fight. This is one way to make your day exciting. If you can’t tackle these at work, do it in your personal projects.</p>
<p>If you chase the right tension, a story will follow.</p>
