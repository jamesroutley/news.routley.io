Production of fruits and vegetables, including durian, will be hit worse than oil palm, as it requires higher quality fertiliser,&#34; said Teo Tee Seng, Malaysian managing director of agrochemical supplier Behn Meyer AgriCare.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-23">Albertus Wawan, an Indonesian oil palm smallholder who already cut fertiliser use by a third, will delay his next application to January to save on two month&#39;s usage.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-24">&#34;Once fertiliser prices increase, it won&#39;t go down,&#34; Wawan said. &#34;This is the challenge for farmers in the future.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-25">Recent dips in oil prices could provide some relief to fertiliser producers, but any future energy shocks caused by unexpected cold snaps would trigger higher food prices, according to an FAO report in November.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-26">&#34;We need to understand that all policy measures that lift energy prices will lift food prices,&#34; said Josef Schmidhuber, deputy director at FAO&#39;s trade and markets division. &#34;This must not mean that we de-emphasize climate change mitigation measures, but we need to find ways to increase fertiliser use efficiency... and critically review our energy policies.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Emily Chow in Beijing and Beijing newsroom, Roberto Samora and Brad Haynes in Sao Paulo, Bernadette Christina Munthe in Jakarta, Michael Hogan in Hamburg, Chu Mei Mei in Kuala Lumpur, Helen Reid in Johannesburg, Sarah El Safty in Cairo, Polina Devitt in Moscow, Nidhi Verma and Mayank Bhardwaj in New Delhi, Gus Trompiz in Paris, Julie Ingwersen in Chicago; editing by Shivani Singh, Gavin Maguire and Gerry Doyle</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
