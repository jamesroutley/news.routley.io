    <p>I operate an online service at <a target="_blank" href="https://ipv4.games/">https://ipv4.games/</a> that invites people to
send http requests to my web server from a lot of different IP addresses.
In order to claim an IP, you need to successfully make a tcp three-way
handshake with a VM on Google&#39;s network.

Somehow a player in Europe named femboy.cat has successfully managed to
claim 20 million IPs, which is 9% of all IPv4 hosts according to Censys.

Does anyone have any idea how they&#39;re doing it?

Would anyone here be willing to be their North American rival?</p>
