    </p><div><p>BlackBerry has sold a collection of legacy patents covering mobile technologies for $600M, a deal that will likely result in increased legal drama for smartphone producers like Apple in the future. 
</p><p>Announced on Monday, BlackBerry has <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2022/blackberry-agrees-to-sell-legacy-patents-for-600m">agreed</a> to a patent sale agreement, which has the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/31/zombie-blackberry-phones-will-finally-die-off-in-early-2022">former smartphone giant</a> handing over its non-core patent assets to Catapult IP Innovations for $600 million. The transaction will grant BlackBerry $450 million in cash and a promissory note for $150 million, as well as a license back for the patents. 
</p><p>The collection of patents relate to mobile devices, messaging, and wireless networking IPs. BlackBerry specifically says that the sale will not affect customers using its products or services. 
</p><p>While the assurance may be good for consumers, the deal may not be so fortuitous for tech firms in the mobile market. 
</p><p>Catapult IP Innovations is described by BlackBerry as &#34;a Delaware company&#34; that is a &#34;special purpose vehicle formed to acquire the BlackBerry patent assets.&#34; The company is funded by a $450 million senior secure loan, which includes $400 million of &#34;conditional commitments from a lending syndicate&#34; led by Third Eye Capital. 
</p><p>BlackBerry&#39;s sale is to what could be considered a &#34;Non-practicing entity,&#34; a company that doesn&#39;t earn revenue from product or services sales, but is more likely to do so through asset protection. Many refer to these sorts of entities as &#34;patent trolls.&#34; 
</p><p>Since there&#39;s an expected return on investment, it is likely that the patents will be used to encourage royalty payments from device producers, potentially through lawsuits. 
</p><p>Blackberry&#39;s patents have been used to sue other companies in the past, such as legal action in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/06/blackberry-sues-facebook-over-alleged-messaging-patent-infringement">March 2018</a> against Facebook over Facebook messenger. 
</p><p>Apple has also been a target of a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/02/12/apple-sued-over-rim-developed-usb-charging-technology-following-preemptive-action">patent lawsuit</a> based on the work of Research in Motion, BlackBerry&#39;s former name. In 2019, Non-practicing entity Fundamental Innovation Systems accused Apple of infringing on multiple payments concerning USB charging and communication technologies. 
</p><p>The patent sale is conditional upon the satisfaction of regulatory conditions, including the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the Investment Canada Act, which could take up to 210 days to complete. </p></div></div>
