<p>My latest side-project is finally ready to go live. Introducing‚Ä¶</p>
<p><a href="https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative"><img src="https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative/banner-og.png" alt="Let&#39;s Get Creative"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative"><strong>Let‚Äôs Get Creative</strong></a> is a collection of high-quality, free, online, creativity tools. The website is intended to be a safe, bookmarkable, creativity resource for kids and adults.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-background">A little background</h2>
<p>When the pandemic hit, we found ourselves with three bored school-aged kids at home. We were desperate to find productive-ish things they could do on their school Chromebooks without a lot of supervision. I started collecting links to creativity tools and <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/03/25/online-tools-for-creative-kids/">I published a list on this blog back in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The kids went back to school of course but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about creativity tools. I <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2023/03/17/theres-a-lot-to-like-about-the-web-share-api/">wrote about them</a> <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/12/07/using-the-url-to-build-database-free-web-apps/">a lot</a> and I kept collecting links whenever I came across them (often <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2022/04/28/links-5/">sharing them in</a> <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2023/05/11/links-7/">my links posts</a>).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure why I like them so much. I think they just live at the intersection of a lot of my interests. They use cool front-end web technologies. They encourage <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/03/28/the-unique-power-of-games-in-building-intuition/">exploration and experimentation</a>. They <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2018/02/18/the-cure-for-boredom-is-superpowers/">give you superpowers</a> and an opportunity to <a href="https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency">exercise your agency</a>. In a world of streaming services and <a href="https://www.health.com/what-is-bed-rotting-trend-7561395">bed-rotting</a>, I‚Äôve developed a strong belief that <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-belongs-to-creators/id1506329209">the future belongs to creators</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/james-clear-the-more-you-create.png" alt="Tweet: &#34;the more you create, the more powerful you become&#34;"/></p>
<p>Anyways, throughout this process I‚Äôve become something of a creativity tools snob. The ones on Lets Get Creative are among the best, so I thought that building a nice site to feature them would be a valuable contribution to the internet.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-i-got-carried-away-building-the-site">In which I got carried away building the site</h2>
<p>The idea for this site started out simple but quickly became much more ambitious. Sure, a single HTML file would work but I felt like the projects deserved a proper showcase, with a design that truly captured their creative essence. I started to dream up interactive features and before I knew it I was knee deep in JavaScript frameworks, fighting build errors and wrangling 3rd party libraries.</p>
<p>My motivation tanked. Weeks went by with me staring into the abyss. Eventually, I asked myself, <em>‚ÄúWhy am I not excited to work on this anymore?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>I found my answer. I had been building out this ambitious interactive header carousel thing but something was wrong. What was it? Was the feature a distraction? Was it tacky? Was it not worth the complexity? Whatever it was, my gut didn‚Äôt like it and just I couldn‚Äôt move forward. I ended up tearing out that code, trying something a bit simpler, and the motivation came roaring back. I learned a valuable lesson: sometimes your lack of motivation is trying to tell you something.</p>
<p>But I digress. The site finally feels right, so we‚Äôre going live even though the code is still a mess. I aspire to tidy it up some more post-launch. üòÖ</p>
<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>One of the goals of this project was to make it easy for anyone to contribute their own creativity tools. If you have a tool you‚Äôd like to share, there‚Äôs a nice <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-a-creativity-tool">CONTRIBUTING doc</a> that shows you what to do (it‚Äôs really just editing <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/blob/main/public/creativity-tools/data.json">this one JSON file</a>).</p>
<p>Besides that, you can also help me clean up my code if you want. Just check out the <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/issues">open issues</a>.</p>
