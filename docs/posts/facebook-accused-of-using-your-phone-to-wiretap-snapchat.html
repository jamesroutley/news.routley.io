    <h1>Facebook Accused of Using Your Phone to Wiretap Snapchat</h1>

It’s Meta’s in-house wiretapping tool to spy on data analytics from Snapchat starting in 2016, later used on YouTube and Amazon. This involved creating “kits” that can be installed on iOS and Android devices, to intercept traffic for certain apps, according to the filings. This was described as a “man-in-the-middle” approach to get data on Facebook’s rivals, but users of Onavo were the “men in the middle.”<br/></p><p>Meta’s Onavo unit has a history of using <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://gizmodo.com/do-not-i-repeat-do-not-download-onavo-facebook-s-vam-1822937825&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/do-not-i-repeat-do-not-download-onavo-facebook-s-vam-1822937825">invasive techniques</a></span> to collect data on Facebook’s users. Meta acquired Onavo from an Israeli firm over 10 years ago, promising users private networking, as most VPNs do.

Onavo could also be considered straight spyware, but also seems to fall under the definition of wiretapping, according to prosecutors.<br/></p><p>The court filings show chats and emails that depict Zuckerberg as being directly involved in these communications. In 2019, an email was sent to Zuckerberg <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.369872/gov.uscourts.cand.369872.736.0.pdf&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.369872/gov.uscourts.cand.369872.736.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explicitly asking for his decision</a></span> on whether SSL decryption (Project Ghostbusters) should stop. However, Meta denies its CEO was anywhere near this.</p><p>“The plaintiffs’ claims are baseless and completely irrelevant to the case,” said a Meta spokesperson in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. Meta also noted that there was “nothing new here,” continuing that this issue was reported on years ago.</p><p>Access to a competitor’s traffic analytics would have allowed Facebook a significant advantage when it comes to selling to advertisers. Meta has become a dominant force in the advertising industry in the last decade, and competitors like Snapchat don’t hold a candle to Meta’s analytics. Prosecutors allege Project Ghostbusters harmed competition in the ad industry, adding weight to their central argument that Meta is a monopoly in social media.<br/></p></div></div>
