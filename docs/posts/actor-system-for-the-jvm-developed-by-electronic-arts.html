    <h1>Actor system for the JVM developed by Electronic Arts</h1>

<p>Orbit is a framework to write distributed systems using virtual actors on the JVM. A virtual actor is an object that interacts with the world using asynchronous messages.</p>
<p>At any time an actor may be active or inactive. Usually the state of an inactive actor will reside in the database. When a message is sent to an inactive actor it will be activated somewhere in the pool of backend servers. During the activation process the actorâ€™s state is read from the database.</p>
<p>Actors are deactivated based on timeout and on server resource usage.</p>
<p>It is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/Orleans">Microsoft Orleans</a> project.</p>

<p>The Orbit documentation is located on this site. Please see the sidebar for navigation.</p>

<p>The core orbit framework and runtime code is located in the <a href="https://github.com/orbit/orbit">orbit/orbit</a> project.</p>

<p>A sample application has been built to demonstrate the most common scenarios for integrating with an Orbit Server at <a href="https://github.com/orbit/orbit-sample">orbit/orbit-sample</a></p>
