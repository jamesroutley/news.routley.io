            <span>Abstract:</span>  As social media continues to have a significant influence on public opinion,
understanding the impact of the machine learning algorithms that filter and
curate content is crucial. However, existing studies have yielded inconsistent
results, potentially due to limitations such as reliance on observational
methods, use of simulated rather than real users, restriction to specific types
of content, or internal access requirements that may create conflicts of
interest. To overcome these issues, we conducted a pre-registered controlled
experiment on Twitter&#39;s algorithm without internal access. The key to our
design was to, for a large group of active Twitter users, simultaneously
collect (a) the tweets the personalized algorithm shows, and (b) the tweets the
user would have seen if they were just shown the latest tweets from people they
follow; we then surveyed users about both sets of tweets in a random order.
