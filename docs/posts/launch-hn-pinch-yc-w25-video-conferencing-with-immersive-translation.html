    <h1>Launch HN: Pinch (YC W25) â€“ Video conferencing with immersive translation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN! I&#39;m Christian, and my co-founder Keyu and I are building Pinch (<a href="https://startpinch.com" rel="nofollow">https://startpinch.com</a>), a virtual conferencing platform with translation that mimics your voice and synchronizes your lips in real-time to make you sound and appear as a native speaker in over 15 languages.</p><p>Here&#39;s a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cu7KlbZ3gjw" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Cu7KlbZ3gjw</a>, but you can also try it for free on our website.</p><p>Over the last three years, Keyu and I were working in a company where we had to lead engineering and research teams across the U.S., China, India, and Europe.   We felt the language barrier actively limiting our team&#39;s potential in terms of collaboration + productivity. The existing tools we tried operated in low-bandwidth mediums (mostly text), which 1) means they are slower because they need to convert audio to text before translation, and 2) lose all information of <i>how</i> something was said.</p><p>At that point we knew there had to be a better way to connect across different languages and cultures, so we started building Pinch.  Shortly after, we found out how challenging translation truly was.  Balancing latency/accuracy for chunk-based audio translation, capturing inflection and tonality per statement, handling culturally specific phrasing, and making a seamless meeting experience are all unsolved problems we&#39;re taking on.</p><p>So far, we&#39;ve seen some really interesting use-cases (many we hadn&#39;t considered!), from personal connections like a first conversation with foreign in-laws, to more business-oriented usage in sales and meeting foreign clients.</p><p>After a long experience building conversation AI video/audio, we&#39;re incredibly excited to see what these same technologies can unlock for human&lt;&gt;human communication.</p><p>You can try a demo or create a meeting for free: <a href="https://startpinch.com" rel="nofollow">https://startpinch.com</a></p><p>All feedback is appreciated, and we&#39;d love to know how we&#39;re doing on the overall meeting UX and translation accuracy for your language. Thanks all!</p></div></div></div>
