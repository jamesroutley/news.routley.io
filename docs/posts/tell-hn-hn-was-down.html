    <h1>Tell HN: HN Was Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>- HN errored on all authenticated requests with 502 Bad Gateway. It did still respond to a limited amount of unauthenticated requests with presumably cached pages, which did not get updated. The last post on /newest claimed &#34;0 minutes ago&#34;, but was actually much older (1:32:57 PM GMT) and not the newest post.</p><p>- This status page actually identified the outage: https://hackernews.onlineornot.com/ - Pages by Hund and Statuspal did not show the outage.</p><p>- The last post before the outage was https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301823 (1:39:59 PM GMT). The last comment was https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301848 (1:41:54 PM GMT).</p><p>- There was an average of ~4 seconds per comment just prior to the outage. Based on this, HN likely went down at 1:41:58 PM GMT.</p></div></div></div>
