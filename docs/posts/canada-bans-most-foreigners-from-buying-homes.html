    <h1>Canada bans most foreigners from buying homes</h1>

<p>A ban on foreigners buying residential property in Canada took effect Sunday, aiming to make more homes available to locals facing a housing crunch.</p>
<p>Several exceptions in the act allow individuals such as refugees and permanent residents who are not citizens to buy homes.</p>
<p>In late December, Ottawa also clarified that the ban would apply only to city dwellings and not to recreational properties such as summer cottages.</p>
<p>The temporary two-year measure was proposed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the 2021 election campaign when soaring prices put home ownership beyond the reach of many Canadians.</p>
<p>&#34;The desirability of Canadian homes is attracting profiteers, wealthy corporations, and foreign investors,&#34; his Liberal Party said in its election plank at the time.</p>
<p>&#34;This is leading to a real problem of underused and vacant housing, rampant speculation, and skyrocketing prices. Homes are for people, not investors.&#34;</p>
<p>Following their 2021 election victory, the Liberals quietly introduced the ‘prohibition on the purchase of residential property by non-Canadians act.’</p>
<p>Major markets such as Vancouver and Toronto have also introduced taxes on non-residents and empty homes.</p>
<p>Despite a recent heyday, the country&#39;s real estate market has cooled for sellers as mortgage rates followed the Bank of Canada&#39;s aggressive monetary policy in a bid to rein in inflation.</p>
<p>According to the Canadian Real Estate Association, average home prices have fallen from a peak of more than $590,000 at the start of 2022 to just over $465,000 last month.</p>
<p>Many experts have also said the ban on foreign buyers — who accounted for less than 5% of home ownership in Canada, according to the national statistical agency — would not have the desired effect of making homes more affordable.</p>
<p>Rather they point to a need for more housing construction to meet demand. </p>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation — the national housing agency — said in a June report that close to 19 million housing units will be needed by 2030.</p>
<p>That means 5.8 million new homes must be built, or 3.5 million more than are currently anticipated to be built to meet that demand, it said.</p>
