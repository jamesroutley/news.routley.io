    <h1>Mass trespass on Dartmoor to highlight England&#39;s &#39;piecemeal&#39; right to roam laws</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Hundreds of people campaigning for the right to roam in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">England</a> are to descend on Dartmoor in an effort to highlight the limitations of the country’s system.</p><p>More than 90 years since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1932/apr/25/1" data-link-name="in body link">mass trespass of Kinder Scout</a>, which helped establish the principle of the right to roam in the UK, organisers say England’s partial right to roam is “ridiculous” and are calling for a system of access rights that echoes Scotland’s.</p><p>Supporters will gather at Vixen Tor in Devon on 24 February, in what organisers say will be the largest mass trespass in a generation.</p><p>They aim to highlight the current situation, where large swathes of the countryside that can be freely roamed upon can only be accessed by trespassing across private land.</p><p>In 2000 the Countryside and Rights of Way Act gave people a right to roam over certain landscape types, such as mountains, moorland, heathland, downland and commons.</p><p>However, the campaign group Right to Roam argues that this landscape – known as “access land” and covering about 8% of England – is often surrounded by farmed fields and other privately owned landscapes, creating inaccessible “islands” of free-to-roam land.</p><p>Lewis Winks, a Right to Roam campaigner, said: “The absurdity of access islands is a clear example of why our current system of access rights in England is broken.</p><p>“Often people don’t know where they have a right to go in the countryside. It’s ridiculous that the public have to trespass to reach these fragments of land where they have a legal right to roam – all because of our piecemeal approach to access in this country.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-8">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-8" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="dab939ad-bcc4-4edd-8b5d-e8baf416024d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:9,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Labour U-turns on promise of Scottish-style right to roam in England&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;dab939ad-bcc4-4edd-8b5d-e8baf416024d&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/25/labour-u-turns-on-promise-of-scottish-style-right-to-roam-in-england&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}" config="{&#34;renderingTarget&#34;:&#34;Web&#34;,&#34;darkModeAvailable&#34;:false}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-9 | 9" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>To raise awareness of the situation, trespassers will start at the wall that separates open-access and private land. Performers and musicians will bring a large boat to symbolically “sail” to the island, and participants have been asked to think of other creative ways to travel over inaccessible land.</p><p>In Scotland, countryside-lovers have a “right of responsible access” to the countryside, with exceptions, and the rights and responsibilities both of landowners and access takers, defined within the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/2/contents" data-link-name="in body link">Land Reform (Scotland) Act</a> and the <a href="https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/" data-link-name="in body link">outdoor access code</a>.</p><p>Last year the UK Labour party <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/18/labour-scottish-style-right-to-roam-law-england" data-link-name="in body link">pledged to introduce</a> a Scottish-style <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/27/labour-government-would-pass-right-to-roam-act-and-reverse-dartmoor-ban" data-link-name="in body link">right to roam</a> law in England if it won the next general election, but made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/25/labour-u-turns-on-promise-of-scottish-style-right-to-roam-in-england" data-link-name="in body link">a U-turn in October</a>. Instead of an assumed right of access, the party said it would find other ways to create more access to land in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england" data-link-name="in body link">England</a>, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/26/gates-left-open-and-crops-destroyed-the-risks-and-benefits-of-right-to-roam" data-link-name="in body link">some landowners’ groups</a> voiced concerns.</p><p>Winks said politicians in England should look to Scotland’s example to address the unworkable current system. “There are no access islands in Scotland … which created a default right of access to most land and water in 2003, to be exercised responsibly and subject to sensible exemptions and rules,” he said.</p><p>“With political parties pledging to increase access to nature in England, it’s vital they learn from the mistakes of the past, and look instead to follow successful examples like Scotland.”</p></div></div></div>
