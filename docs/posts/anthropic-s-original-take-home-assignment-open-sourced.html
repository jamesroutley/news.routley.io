    <h1>Anthropic&#39;s original take home assignment open sourced</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This repo contains a version of Anthropic&#39;s original performance take-home, before Claude Opus 4.5 started doing better than humans given only 2 hours.</p>
<p dir="auto">The original take-home was a 4-hour one that starts close to the contents of this repo, after Claude Opus 4 beat most humans at that, it was updated to a 2-hour one which started with code which achieved 18532 cycles (7.97x faster than this repo starts you). This repo is based on the newer take-home which has a few more instructions and comes with better debugging tools, but has the starter code reverted to the slowest baseline. After Claude Opus 4.5 we started using a different base for our time-limited take-homes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can try to beat Claude Opus 4.5 given unlimited time!</p>

<p dir="auto">Measured in clock cycles from the simulated machine. All of these numbers are for models doing the 2 hour version which started at 18532 cycles:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>2164 cycles</strong>: Claude Opus 4 after many hours in the test-time compute harness</li>
<li><strong>1790 cycles</strong>: Claude Opus 4.5 in a casual Claude Code session, approximately matching the best human performance in 2 hours</li>
<li><strong>1579 cycles</strong>: Claude Opus 4.5 after 2 hours in our test-time compute harness</li>
<li><strong>1548 cycles</strong>: Claude Sonnet 4.5 after many more than 2 hours of test-time compute</li>
<li><strong>1487 cycles</strong>: Claude Opus 4.5 after 11.5 hours in the harness</li>
<li><strong>1363 cycles</strong>: Claude Opus 4.5 in an improved test time compute harness</li>
<li><strong>??? cycles</strong>: Best human performance ever is substantially better than the above, but we won&#39;t say how much.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While it&#39;s no longer a good time-limited test, you can still use this test to get us excited about hiring you! If you optimize below 1487 cycles, beating Claude Opus 4.5&#39;s best performance at launch, email us at <a href="mailto:performance-recruiting@anthropic.com">performance-recruiting@anthropic.com</a> with your code (and ideally a resume) so we can be appropriately impressed, especially if you get near the best solution we&#39;ve seen. New model releases may change what threshold impresses us though, and no guarantees that we keep this readme updated with the latest on that.</p>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>python tests/submission_tests.py</code> to see which thresholds you pass.</p>
