    <h1>Apollo 13 in Real Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
This website replays the Apollo 13 mission as it happened. It consists entirely of
historical material, all timed to Ground Elapsed Time--the master mission clock. Footage of Mission
Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space have been
painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken,
and every word spoken.
</p>
<p>
<span>This project includes newly digitized and restored mission control audio. The
last tapes of these recordings were discovered in the National Archives fall of 2019 and were digitized
in February, 2020 and contain the time surrounding the onboard explosion. These recordings haven&#39;t been
heard since the accident investigation in 1970.</span>

Upon starting the application, select whether to begin one minute before launch, or click &#34;Now&#34; to drop in
to the mission using today&#39;s date and time.
</p>
<p>
Navigate to any moment of the mission using the time navigator at the top of the screen. The top bar is
the entire mission with two bars below it providing magnification. Clicking transcript items, photos,
commentary items, or guided tour moments also jumps the mission time to those events.
</p>
<p>
Main mission audio consists of space-to-ground (left ear), capcom loop (right ear), and on-board recorder
(center, when available). Selecting a Mission Control audio channel mutes the main audio, opens the
Mission Control audio panel, and plays the &#34;live&#34; audio of each selected Mission Control position. Change
channels by selecting the seats in Mission Control. Closing the Mission Control audio panel will unmute
the main audio and continue mission playback.
</p>
<p>
These 50 channels of Mission Control audio spanning the entire mission have only recently been digitized
and restored, and are made publicly available here for the first time. They total over 7,200 hours in
length.
