    <h1>Non-Correspondence texting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>Previously:</em>  <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/blog/correspondence-texting/">An Introduction to Correspondence Texting</a></p>
<p>In my previous post, I divided texts into three buckets: (1) respond immediately, (2) respond within 24 hours, and (3) respond when convenient. There, I focused on how I approach the third category (which I called &#34;correspondence&#34; texting), but now I want to say a couple of things about (2) and (1). </p>
<p>This is not meant to be a full piece, but a companion to the previous post.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-deadline-for-bucket-2">When is the deadline for bucket (2)?</h2>
<p>Buckets (1) and (3) are helpful to me because they have a clear call to action. (1) sets up a clear if-then statement: &#34;if I see the text, then I will respond.&#34; (3) doesn&#39;t have the same immediacy, but I&#39;ve set up a system to manage these types of texts.</p>
<p>(2) is more difficult, for a couple of reasons. First, the rule &#34;respond within 24 hours&#34; does not give a clear trigger. I can respond in time either on the same day, or in part of the day after. The &#34;in-bounds&#34; part of the following day varies by when I received the text, so there isn&#39;t a clear deadline in my head. Second, the rule doesn&#39;t batch to multiple responses very well, as every text has a different time-frame.</p>
<p>For both these reasons, I&#39;ve realized that it&#39;s better for me to think of (2) as &#34;respond by the end of the day&#34;.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> This gives me a clear deadline to respond to the text, and makes it easy to set aside a little bit of time at the end of each day to clear any such texts.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> It also naturally batches all the bucket (2) texts together.</p>
<h2 id="marking-bucket-2-texts-by-pinning-them">Marking bucket (2) texts by pinning them</h2>
<p>The other challenge with bucket (2) is that is difficult to tell which I need to respond to. With (1), I don&#39;t need to keep track; I just respond as soon as I see it. With (3), I mark texts unread and respond in a specific order (tips 4 and 5 of the previous post). Before I wrote this post, I didn&#39;t have a way to mark texts of intermediate priority.</p>
<p>After thinking about this problem more, I am trialing a solution: using iMessage&#39;s pinning feature.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> I used to pin people I texted frequently, like my parents, but I don&#39;t think this accomplished anything. In fact, it made it <em>harder</em> to respond to these people! Now, if I have a category (2) text, I pin the message until I&#39;ve responded.</p>
<p>This gives me a visual reminder of the people I need to respond to, and helps me prioritize my texts.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There&#39;s a tradeoff in bucket (1) between responding immediately and not constantly being on my phone/computer. </p>
<p>On the one hand, there are times when someone needs to reach me urgently. E.g. a friend is having a crisis; I&#39;m on call in a work setting.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The sooner I see a message and can respond, the better.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I&#39;m constantly screening texts to see if they are important, I&#39;m neutering my ability to focus for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found one solution that works for me: phone calls. They&#39;re distinct from texts and focus on a synchronous setting, which makes them ideal for urgent questions. There are other filtering strategies, but this seems like a natural one to follow.</p>
<h2 id="distinguishing-urgent-calls">Distinguishing urgent calls</h2>
<p>That being said, phone calls aren&#39;t perfect: there&#39;s no immediately obvious way to distinguish urgent phone calls from social ones. I like calling friends out of the blue to catch up, but that makes it easier to ignore a call &#34;because it&#39;s probably just social.&#34; I can think of a couple of ways to distinguish the two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call a second time if it&#39;s urgent</li>
<li>Use FaceTime/WhatsApp/etc. for social calls, and phone calls for important ones</li>
<li>Text ahead for social calls</li>
<li>Leave a voicemail for social calls and a text (with some details) for serious ones </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m still not sure which of these (if any) are the best norms to follow in general. Let me know if there are better strategies!</p>

<p>I do have a preference for what norm I would prefer my friends to follow with me, however. It&#39;s a combination of the first and fourth ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give me a call at my phone number</li>
<li>If I don&#39;t pick up, feel free to call me again</li>
<li>If I still don&#39;t pick up, shoot me a text saying a) it&#39;s urgent and ideally b) a couple of details</li>
</ol>
<p>If it&#39;s social, don&#39;t do steps 2 and 3. (Or just leave a text).</p>

<p>The above tips don&#39;t really have a narrative flow, but I&#39;ll list the couple which stood out to me:
<strong>Section A</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have my intermediate response time [bucket 2] be &#34;respond by the end of the day&#34;</li>
<li>Use iMessage&#39;s pinning feature to highlight bucket (2) texts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section B</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The central challenge to responding to urgent texts is filtering, and how to automate that filtering</li>
<li>Using a different medium can be one filter, but there are tradeoffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to note, however, how much I&#39;ve learned over these past two posts. I wrote the first post as a descriptive piece, but it quickly became a normative one too. I had to ask myself: How do I respond to medium urgency requests? What exactly is my policy for going through texts? When should people call me instead? Even though I have tended to describe what I already do, I&#39;ve found a lot of value in making explicit statement about what I&#39;m <em>trying</em> to do.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll try this experiment again, with a different part of my life.</p>
