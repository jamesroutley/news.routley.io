    <h1>Ask HN: Similar books to “Raytracing in one Weekend”?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I really liked the &#34;Raytracing in one Weekend&#34; Series [0], in terms of: explaining a complicated concept by programming a toy implementation of the thing itself and afterwards one is left with more knowledge and something to &#34;show&#34;.</p><p>Does someone know similar series on other subjects than raytracing? I know there is the Advent of Code, but that&#39;s more like solving a puzzle.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://raytracing.github.io" rel="nofollow">https://raytracing.github.io</a></p></div></div></div>
