    <h1>Extreme depth-of-field light field camera thanks to an extinct marine arthropod</h1>

<p>An article titled &#34;Trilobite-inspired neural nanophotonic light-field camera with extreme depth-of-field&#34; by Q. Fan <i>et al. </i>proposes a metalens design inspired by the bi-focal vision system of an extinct marine arthropod.</p><p><b>Abstract</b></p><p>A unique bifocal compound eye visual system found in the now extinct trilobite, Dalmanitina socialis, may enable them to be sensitive to the light-field information and simultaneously perceive both close and distant objects in the environment. Here, inspired by the optical structure of their eyes, we demonstrate a nanophotonic light-field camera incorporating a spin-multiplexed bifocal metalens array capable of capturing high-resolution light-field images over a record depth-of-field ranging from centimeter to kilometer scale, simultaneously enabling macro and telephoto modes in a snapshot imaging. By leveraging a multi-scale convolutional neural network-based reconstruction algorithm, optical aberrations induced by the metalens are eliminated, thereby significantly relaxing the design and performance limitations on metasurface optics. The elegant integration of nanophotonic technology with computational photography achieved here is expected to aid development of future high-performance imaging systems.</p><p><a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-29568-y/MediaObjects/41467_2022_29568_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="651" data-original-width="800" height="325" src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-29568-y/MediaObjects/41467_2022_29568_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp" width="400"/></a></p><p>a Conceptual sketch of extinct trilobite Dalmanitina socialis and its compound eyes. Each compound eye, composed of a lower lens unit and an upper lens unit with central bulge, can simultaneously focus the incident light to near and far point, similar to a coaxial bifocal lens. b The bioinspired photonic spin-multiplexed metalens array. The unit cell of metalens array is composed of rectangle amorphous TiO2 nanopillar sitting on a SiO2 substrate with Px=Py=450 nm, and height h=600 nm. c Optical microscope image of the fabricated metalens array.

Either the LCP component of close object or the RCP component of distant object could be focused well on the identical imaging plane. The nominal distance between the primary lens and metalens array is L=47.5 mm. The nominal distance between the imaging plane and metalens array is l=0.83 mm. The focal length and aperture size of the primary lens is F=50 mm and D=6 mm, respectively. c The captured PSFs at different depths for LCP, RCP, and UP (unpolarized) incident light. d Demonstration of working range for different polarization states. The light-blue region and light-red region represent the working range of LCP and RCP components, respectively. The vertical axis represents the PSF ranks, for which the smaller value corresponds to better imaging quality. The uncertainties are standard deviation for repeated measurements (six in total).</p><p><a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-29568-y/MediaObjects/41467_2022_29568_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="786" data-original-width="800" height="393" src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-29568-y/MediaObjects/41467_2022_29568_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp" width="400"/></a></p><p>a PSF capture and training-data generation. b Aberration removal with the proposed multiscale deep convolutional neural network.
