<p>In 2012, I was a mentor at the USNCO Study Camp, which prepares and selects the top students in the U.S. to send to the International Chemistry Olympiad. I wrote a question for the final exam which only 2 of the 20 students completed. Both students admitted to brute-forcing the system of equation in 5 unknowns. I found it hilarious at the time that I’d stumped the entire camp with a seemingly trivial problem. The students were not as amused! Without further ado:</p>
<p><strong>Balance the following equation. </strong></p>
<p><span>\[\ce{BH4- + BF3 -&gt;  B11H14- + BF4- + H2(g)}\]</span></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-328X(03)00460-1">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-328X(03)00460-1</a></p>
<p>This 11-boron, 14-hydrogen species has <span>\(C_{5v}\)</span> symmetry (dodecahedron with missing vertex), and its parent species <span>\(\ce{B11H11^2-}\)</span> is apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxional_molecule">fluxional</a>, rapidly interconverting with no one boron identifiable. If you’re wondering how I stumbled across such an obscure reaction, I decided at some point that boron was probably a simple enough element that I could learn <em>everything</em> there was to know about boron if I’d really tried. Boy, was I wrong! It turns out a lot of research went into obscure borohydride species as potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaborane(9)">energy-dense rocket fuels</a> during the Cold War.</p>
<p>A hint and solution for this equation comes after the spoiler break.</p>
<p>v v v v v v</p>

<h2 id="hint">Hint</h2>
<p>This is a redox equation. Find the two half-reactions.</p>
<p>v v v v v v</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The borohydride and fluoroborate species all have boron in their (+3) oxidation state, while the B11 species has a 15/11 oxidation state, which is about (+1.36) on average. The hydrogen, on the other hand, goes from hydride at the (-1) oxidation state to hydrogen gas at the (0) oxidation state. We’ll have to find the right ratios that lead to net electron transfer balance.</p>
<p>In a traditional redox reaction, typically what happens is that you first insert electrons to form the correct half-reaction, and then use <span>\(\ce{H2O}\)</span>, <span>\(\ce{H+}\)</span> or <span>\(\ce{OH-}\)</span> species to balance oxygens, hydrogens, and charges. As a simple example, for the reduction of Cr(+6) to Cr(+3):</p>
<p><span>\[\ce{CrO4^2- -&gt; Cr^3+}\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- -&gt; Cr^3+}\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- -&gt; Cr^3+ + 4H2O}\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[\ce{CrO4^2- + 3e- + 8H+ -&gt; Cr^3+ + 4H2O}\]</span></p>
<p>How do these steps apply to this problem? This isn’t an aqueous reaction - borohydrides are pyrophoric in air! Instead of using <span>\(\ce{H+}\)</span> to balance our charges, we’ll use <span>\(\ce{H-}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span>\[\ce{11BH4- + 20e- -&gt; B11H14- + 30H-}\]</span></p>
<p><span>\[\ce{2H- -&gt; 2e- + H2}\]</span></p>
<p>Balanced reaction:</p>
<p><span>\[\ce{11BH4- -&gt; B11H14- + 10H- + 10H2}\]</span></p>
<p>Free hydride is not in the final equation - this is where the fluoroborate species come in. You could see the role of <span>\(\ce{BF3}\)</span> as a hydride sponge.</p>
<p><span>\[\ce{4BF3 + 4H- -&gt; 3BF4- + BH4-}\]</span></p>
<p>Balancing and cancelling the hydrides, the final balanced equation is</p>
<p><span>\[\ce{17BH4- + 20BF3 -&gt; 2B11H14- + 15BF4- + 20H2}\]</span></p>
