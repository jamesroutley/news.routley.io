<p>Having launched ahead of schedule just a few days back, Activision Blizzard&#39;s <em><strong>Diablo Immortal</strong></em><strong> </strong>has been making headlines for a wide variety of reasons, not least of which is its microtransaction model. Namely, <a href="http://gamerant.com/tag/diablo-immortal/"><em>Diablo I</em><em>mmortal</em></a> is a free-to-play game and, as such, features a number of ways that players can support its continued development.</p>

<p>While this approach to sustainability is rather commonplace nowadays, <em>Diablo Immortal</em> may have taken things a step further than most players may have expected. According to YouTube channel Bellular News&#39; calculations, the game&#39;s unique monetization system is set up in a way that makes character min-maxing an exceedingly expensive endeavor.</p>
<!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! -->

<p>The crux of the issue, as per Bellular News&#39; recent video, is that <em>Diablo Immortal</em> allows players to buy the so-called Legendary Gems. These are one of the characters&#39; three progression pillars alongside regular gear and XP level, and they dictate one&#39;s endgame-tier progression beyond what is possible simply by reaching <a href="https://gamerant.com/diablo-immortal-level-cap-maximum/"><em>Diablo Immortal</em>&#39;s level cap</a>. As of right now, F2P players cannot earn top-rated Legendary Games, which are only available via some of the game&#39;s monetization options, and fully maxing-out a character effectively costs $110,000 in the game&#39;s current economy.</p>

<p>Matt and Michael of Bellular News also make an argument that <em>Diablo Immortal</em>&#39;s Legendary Gems are a deliberately convoluted system, explaining that it would take roughly 10 years of playtime for a F2P player to fully kit out a character in the game&#39;s current iteration. Specifically, Legendary Gems aren&#39;t even a guaranteed drop for paying players, as they are only randomly awarded upon purchasing Legendary Crests (i.e. loot boxes) - which may be the reason why <a href="https://gamerant.com/diablo-immortal-loot-boxes-belgium-netherlands/"><em>Diablo Immortal</em> didn&#39;t launch worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://gamerant.com/diablo-immortal-download-now/"><em>Diablo Immortal</em>&#39;s early launch</a>, the game does indeed seem to be a &#34;true <em>Diablo</em> experience&#34; in more ways than not. The community began praising the core gameplay loop almost immediately upon release, though there was a healthy dose of skepticism surrounding <em>Immortal</em>&#39;s monetization system, too, and that may well have been warranted if Bellular News&#39; findings are correct.</p>

<p>Since the game also came out on PC, it&#39;s worth considering the notion that <em>Diablo Immortal</em>&#39;s PC release is <a href="https://gamerant.com/diablo-immortal-pc-release-good-sign-warcraft-mobile-similar-approach/">good news for <em>Warcraft Mobile</em></a> once it comes out, as that game, too, may be available on a greater number of devices than was initially suspected. After all, for players uninterested in min-maxing, <em>Immortal</em>&#39;s potentially egregious monetization might not be an issue, though Gregg2G, another YouTuber, already pointed out that &#34;most F2P players [of <em>Diablo Immortal</em>]<em> </em>will never see a 5-star gem&#34; in the game as it currently stands.</p>
<p><em><strong>Diablo Immortal</strong></em><strong> </strong>is now available on iOS, Android, and PC.</p>
