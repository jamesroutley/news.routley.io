<p>The June 2016 medevac was first announced in <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138914">this NSF press release</a> issued on 15 June South Pole time (UTC+12, 14 June US/Canada Mountain Time) after the two Kenn Borek Air (KBA) Twin Otters had departed Calgary. The press release included the key statement, &#34;After comprehensive consultation with outside medical professionals, agency officials decided that a medical situation at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station warrants returning a member of the station&#39;s winter crew to a hospital that can provide a level of medical care that is unavailable at the station,&#34; and it was accompanied by the above file photo from the 2003 medevac...and of course that photo appeared in many other media reports that day.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Wallace (&#34;Wally&#34;) Dobchuck, who would be the lead pilot on the evolution, first learned about the possibility of the medevac about a week before it began...when he was at a review meeting in Boise with NSF where plans for Kenn Borek&#39;s upcoming season were to be discussed. Wally returned to Calgary where plans were being made and crews were being selected; on Saturday 11 June they were informed that the mission was on.</p>
<p>On the 14th, the two aircraft left Kenn Borek headquarters in Calgary, first flying to Centennial airport, south of Denver near the ASC offices. Here they picked up some essential mission equipment. They then continued on to McAllen, which is along the Rio Grande in far southern Texas. From this point, relief crews flew the Twin Otters south to Punta Arenas, while the primary crews continued south on commercial aircraft, so as to arrive well rested.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/ruta1.jpg"><img src="https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/ruta2.jpg" width="400" height="210" alt="flight plan map" title="crossing the Southern Ocean"/></a>The Twin Otters stopped in Liberia, Costa Rica as well as more than once in Chile, before reaching Punta Arenas (at right, a route map from <a href="http://www.eldiamaslargodemivida.com/en/2016/06/18/intento-de-rescate-en-el-polo-sur/">this blog post about the medevac</a> by 2012 IceCube winterover Carlos Pobes). This part of the timeline is not well documented... presumably the flight crews reached PA on commercial flights before the Twin Otters did, and had some extra down time. In any case, by the time the primary flight crews took over the Twin Otters, it was late evening in Punta Arenas, I&#39;m thinking about 2200 local time (UTC-4) on 17 June, or 1400 South Pole time (NZST, UTC+12) on 18 June. (All times are SP times unless otherwise indicated). Punta Arenas and Rothera time is UTC-3). The primary air crews had arrived earlier and had about 36 hours rest before the next leg. Meanwhile, the two Kenn Borek medics had also arrived in PA.</p>

They arrived about 6 hours later while it was still light enough to reconfigure both aircraft... including switching out their wheeled landing gear for skis (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138982&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news">NSF press release announcing the arrival at Rothera</a>--which also included the BAS file photo (left) of Rothera). After resting overnight, the next morning it looked like there would be a 48-hour weather window for a planned ~30 hour return trip to Pole. The primary flight crew, consisting of pilot Wally Dobchuck, copilot Sébastien Trudel, aircraft maintenance engineer Michael McCrae, along with medic Thai Verzone, left Rothera at about 0800 local time (UTC-3) on Tuesday 21 June (0100 SP time on Wednesday 22 June. The aircraft carried 7,000 lbs/1,000 gallons of fuel, including 2 250-gallon tanks in the fuselage, as well as 2 55-gallon drums. Things were a bit dicey early in the flight, as the weather had started to deteriorate, and it took a couple of hours for the aircraft to burn off enough fuel to be able to ascend above the icing zone. If this had not happened, Michael could have opened a valve to dump 1,500 lbs/~225 gallons of fuel...but this probably would have required a return to Rothera.</p>

<p>One of the details of the flights to/from Pole that was revealed later by the flight crew, is that they got caught up in singing the song &#34;In the jungle...the lion sleeps tonight&#34; despite not knowing all of the words. That tune has been recorded many times since it was written by a South African of Zulu origin in the 1920&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight">(Wikipedia article)</a>...it was more recently made famous by the <i>Lion King</i> movie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, preparations at Pole had been underway for awhile, lots of work for everyone on station:</p>

<div><p>[Robert Schwarz was the only person on station authorized by NSF to share photos</p></div></td></div><div><td colspan="2">
<p>Securing the aircraft took about half an hour. This included closing things up and setting up some heaters to keep the electronics and engines somewhat warm. After that, the flight crew headed into the station for a welcomed dinner of bison steak (extras from the midwinter dinner), well prepared by head chef Darby Butts and the rest of the galley crew. The flight crew then headed off to bed...using oxygen concentrators as Twin Otter crews normally do during their <span title="remaining (or resting or ?) overnight">RON</span> at Pole. Meanwhile, the Polies were enjoying the freshies from Rothera--boxes of apples, oranges, and tangerines, as well as sweets--tarts and biscuits (well, English biscuits aka cookies or brownies perhaps) and 900g of homemade Antarctic sea salt for Darby to do things with.</p>

<p>Eight hours after the landing, preparations began for the northbound flight.</p>
