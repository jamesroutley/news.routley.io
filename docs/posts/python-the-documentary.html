    <h1>Python: The Documentary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Attendees at EuroPython had the chance to preview part of
<em>Python: The Documentary</em> during <a href="https://programme.europython.eu/europython-2025/talk/JKZDUY/">a
keynote panel</a>. The full film, created by <a href="https://www.cultrepo.com/">CultRepo</a>, is now available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0">on YouTube</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the story of the world&#39;s most beloved programming language:
Python. What began as a side project in Amsterdam during the 1990s
became the software powering artificial intelligence, data science and
some of the world&#39;s biggest companies. But Python&#39;s future wasn&#39;t
certain; at one point it almost disappeared.</p>

<p>This 90-minute documentary features Guido van Rossum, Travis
Oliphant, Barry Warsaw, and many more, and they tell the story of
Python&#39;s rise, its community-driven evolution, the conflicts that
almost tore it apart, and the language&#39;s impact on... well...
everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf2AqQ5a38Y">video</a>
of the keynote is also available.</p>
