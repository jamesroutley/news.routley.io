<p>The official numbers from ACEA are out, and they confirmed that Tesla deliveries have crashed by 43% in Europe so far this year.</p>



<p>It should be concerning for Tesla as electric vehicle sales are up 31% during the period.</p>



<p>Based on the main European auto markets already having reported vehicle registrations earlier this month, we already had <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/05/tesla-tsla-sales-crash-continues-in-europe-with-germany-down-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good idea of Tesla’s performance in the market</a>, but now the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has made it official.</p>



<p>ACEA has released February registration numbers confirming that Tesla only delivered 16,888 units in the EU, EFTA, and UK markets in February 2025, compared to 28,182 units in 2024.</p>	
	



<p>For the first two months of the year, it totals 26,619 units, or 42.6% less than the 46,343 units delivered during the same period in 2024.</p>



<p>This is amid a 3.4% decline in automotive sales in Europe, but Tesla can hardly use that as an excuse since ACEA is reporting a 28.4% (31% in EU, EFTA, and UK) increase in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales this year despite Tesla’s erosion in the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Across the first two months of 2025</strong>, new battery-electric car sales grew by 28.4%, to 255,489 units, capturing 15.2% of total EU market share. Three of the four largest markets in the EU, accounting for 64% of all battery-electric car registrations, recorded robust double-digit gains: Germany (+41%), Belgium (+38%), and the Netherlands (+25%). This contrasted with France, which saw a slight decline of 1.3%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the EU, EFTA, and UK markets, BEVs account for 17% of the entire auto market, with PHEVs adding another 7%.</p>



<p>Tesla had the worst performance of all automakers in the market:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla fans are holding on to the idea that this is not a real problem because it is mostly due to the Model Y changeover, but that’s simply not true.</p>



<p>Model 3 registrations are also down in most European markets, despite Tesla having a similar situation as Model Y for Model 3 during this time last year.</p>



<p>In fact, Model 3 is down 29.4% in Europe so far this year despite plenty of inventory.</p>



<p>The shift to the new Model Y design is certainly having an effect, but it cannot account for the 43% drop in deliveries.</p>



<p>With deliveries of the new Model Y having started this month in Europe, we can see Tesla is still suffering in markets that report registration daily.</p>



<p>Tesla has only delivered 655 cars so far in March in Sweden compared to 2,524 for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>In Norway, Tesla is at 1,444 deliveries compared to 2,334 units for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>Tesla is already down 20,000 units in Europe for the first two months of the year compared to its 2024 performance, and that number could grow to 30,000 units by the end of the quarter.</p>
