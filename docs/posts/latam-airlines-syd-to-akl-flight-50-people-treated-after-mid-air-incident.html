<p>People &#34;flew through the cabin&#34; after an incident on board a flight to Auckland that left blood on the plane&#39;s ceiling, a person seriously injured, and saw 50 treated by Hato Hone St John Ambulance.</p>
<p>LATAM Airlines Group said flight LA800 had a &#34;technical problem during the flight which caused a strong movement&#34; on its way from Sydney to Auckland.</p>
<p><b><i>Were you on the flight? Email </i></b> iwitness@rnz.co.nz.</p>
<p>&#34;Some passengers and cabin crew were affected. They received immediate assistance and were evaluated or treated by medical staff at the airport as needed.&#34;</p>
<p>A passenger on board the flight, who gave his name as Jacinto, said there was a &#34;mid-air drop&#34; that affected multiple passengers.</p>
<p>&#34;People flew through the cabin,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>&#34;People got pretty injured.&#34;</p>
<p>A number of passengers were not wearing their seatbelts at the time, he said.</p>
<p>&#34;People were really scared as well.&#34;</p>
<h3>&#39;People just started screaming&#39;</h3>
<p>Passenger Brian Jokat said the plane &#34;just dropped&#34; about two-thirds of the way through the flight.</p>
<p>&#34;There was no pre-turbulence, we were just sailing smoothly the whole way,&#34; he said.</p>

<p>&#34;I had just dozed off and I luckily had my seatbelt on, and all of a sudden the plane just dropped.</p>
<p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t one of those things where you hit turbulence and you drop a few times ... we just dropped.&#34;</p>
<p>A passenger two seats away from him was not wearing his seatbelt, and flew up and hit the ceiling, Jokat said.</p>
<p>&#34;I thought I was dreaming. I opened my eyes and he was on the roof of the plane on his back, looking down on me. It was like <i>The Exorcist</i>.&#34;</p>
<p>The man then fell back to the floor, breaking his ribs on his arm rest, Jokat said.</p>

<p>Three or four other people had hit the ceiling too, breaking some of the plane&#39;s interior with their heads and shoulders, he said.</p>
<p>&#34;Then people just started screaming. I felt the plane take a nosedive - it felt like it was at the top of a rollercoaster, and then it flattened out again.&#34;</p>
<p>The incident took &#34;split seconds&#34;, Jokat said.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a few doctors on board &#34;patched up&#34; the injured, with the assistance of the flight crew.</p>
<p>There were &#34;some seriously injured people&#34;, he said - some had broken bones, while others had neck and head injuries.</p>
<p>Jokat said the pilot came to the back of the plane once the plane landed.</p>
<p>&#34;I asked him &#39;what happened?&#39; and he said to me &#39;I lost my instrumentation briefly and then it just came back all of a sudden&#39;.</p>
<p>&#34;I know he felt really bad for everyone.&#34;</p>
<p>Another passenger, Valentina, said the plane &#34;just stopped&#34; about 50 minutes out of Auckland.</p>
<p>&#34;People were flying around and everything was super scary,&#34; she said.</p>
<p>&#34;Blood was on the ceiling, people [flew] and broke the ceiling of the plane.&#34;</p>
<p>Valentina said she was &#34;very scared&#34; to get on a flight again.</p>
<p>She received minor injuries during the ordeal, but had been treated and was doing OK, she said.</p>
<h3>50 patients treated, 12 hospitalised</h3>
<p>St John Ambulance said it was notified of the incident at 3.58pm.</p>
<p>It sent 14 units including seven ambulances, two operations managers, two Major Incident Support Team vehicle, one Command Unit, and two rapid response vehicles rushed to Auckland International Airport.</p>
<p>&#34;Our ambulance crews assessed and treated approximately 50 patients, with one patient in a serious condition and the remainder in a moderate to minor condition,&#34; St John Ambulance said.</p>
<p>&#34;Twelve patients were transported to hospital - 10 were taken to Middlemore Hospital, including one patient in a serious condition, one patient was transported to Auckland City Hospital in a moderate condition, and one patient was taken to Starship Hospital in a moderate condition.&#34;</p>
<p>Auckland Airport said in a statement its emergency service team &#34;responded to a request for medical support&#34; from the LATAM flight.</p>
<p>The plane involved was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.</p>
<p>It landed at Auckland Airport about 4.30pm as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Ongoing flight cancelled</h3>
<p>LATAM Airlines Group said it regretted the &#34;inconvenience and injury&#34; the situation had caused its passengers.</p>
<p>The plane&#39;s next flight to Santiago - originally due to leave Auckland Airport at 6.40pm on Monday - had been cancelled.</p>
<p>A new flight - LA1130 - had been scheduled for Tuesday, departing Auckland at 8pm for Santiago.</p>
<p>&#34;LATAM is providing affected passengers with food and accommodation services due to the flight cancellation.&#34;</p>

<p>Three crew members were among those transported to hospital, the airline said.</p>
<p>LATAM is Chile&#39;s national airline and flies frequently between Auckland and Santiago.</p>
<h3>Problems with Dreamliners overseas</h3>
<p>It is not yet known what caused the &#34;technical problem&#34; on the flight to Auckland.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration last week reported an issue with Boeing Dreamliners&#39; de-icing systems, according to CNN.</p>
<p>The administration said a damaged seal could impact an engine inlet, risking serious damage to the plane.</p>
<p>The issue was moving through the administration&#39;s standard process for &#34;developing airworthiness directives&#34;, CNN said, which meant it did not believe the issue was severe enough to pull the planes from service.</p>
<p>Boeing&#39;s 737 Max has also come under scrutiny after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67906367">an emergency exit blew out</a> after taking off from Portland, Oregon on 5 January.</p>
<p>That plane landed quickly and no-one was hurt.</p>
<p>A Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson said the authority was aware of the incident.</p>
<p>&#34;The immediate response was handled by Auckland Airport alongside emergency services.</p>
<p>&#34;The incident has not yet been formally reported to CAA, though we would expect this in the coming days in accordance with CAA rules.&#34;</p>
<p>When the report was received, the authority would work with the operator to find out exactly what happened and why, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>It would also determine &#34;whether any subsequent actions are necessary from a safety perspective&#34;.</p>
