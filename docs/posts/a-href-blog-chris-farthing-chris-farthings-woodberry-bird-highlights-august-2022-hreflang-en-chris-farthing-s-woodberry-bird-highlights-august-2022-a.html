    <div><p>August is invariably a good month for birds here. A good selection of warblers is guaranteed, and flycatchers usually appear towards the end of the month. With migration going on throughout august, we usually get the odd surprise.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><p>We had to wait until the last day of the month for the biggest surprise, when a <strong>great white egret (above)</strong> visited. The bird was first seen approaching distantly from the southeast, before having a bit of a look around the lagoons and departing west. Remarkably, records show that the previous visit from this species was exactly a year earlier on August 31<sup>st</sup> 2021!</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>A pair of <strong>great crested grebes (above)</strong> had hatched three young at the end of July although they stayed well hidden at the nest for a while. Early in August they started to venture out onto the open water, and although one chick sadly didn’t make it, by the end of the month we had two well-grown youngsters.</p>
<p>The <strong>kingfisher (below)</strong> which started being seen regularly in mid-July continued to show well throughout August, being most frequently seen around the water inlet.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Duck numbers always build up in autumn, but it isn’t always the same species which builds up. After 2021 was the year of the <strong>shoveler</strong>, 2022 looks like being a <strong>pochard </strong>year, with around eighty present by the end of the month. Shoveler numbers so far this year reached about twenty, with the highest count of<strong> teal</strong> being three. Four <strong>wigeon</strong> arrived on the 27<sup>th</sup> and were seen on and off for the rest of the month.</p>
<p>The high water levels through August meant the chances of getting any passage migrant wading birds weren’t great, and we just had a few sightings of <strong>common sandpiper</strong> around mid-month. There has been some evidence in the last few years in London that <strong>hobby</strong> is starting to become more of an urban bird, and we had several sightings in august including a bird which landed in a tree along the woodland trail. A <strong>buzzard</strong> was seen overhead on the 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>We have lots of good habitat for warblers here, as well as the reed-bed there are plenty of bushes full of both berries and insects. Perhaps the best warbler hot-spot is the hedge which borders the private garden on the south side of the boardwalk. Warblers seen in august included both <strong>lesser whitethroat</strong> and <strong>common whitethroat (above)</strong>, <strong>sedge warbler </strong>and <strong>garden warbler</strong>, and possibly more <strong>willow warblers</strong> than any previous autumn.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>We had a couple of sightings of <strong>pied flycatcher</strong> towards the end of the month, and with <strong>spotted flycatcher (above)</strong> being more plentiful as usual. Another surprise was a <strong>nuthatch</strong> seen on the 27<sup>th</sup>. This species is strangely scarce here considering that several pairs breed in nearby Finsbury Park.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in august 2022 was 70, exactly equalling the average from the previous six Augusts.</p>
