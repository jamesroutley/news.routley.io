With Rivet, teams can effectively design, debug, and collaborate on complex LLM prompt graphs, and deploy them in their own environment.</p><p>At Ironclad, we struggled to build AI agents programmatically. Rivet&#39;s visual environment, easy debugger, and remote executor unlocked our team&#39;s ability to collaborate on increasingly complex and powerful LLM prompt graphs.</p><p><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/ironclad-logo.png" height="20px"/> is the leading digital contracting platform.<!-- --> <a href="https://ironcladapp.com/product/ai-based-contract-management/" target="_blank">Ironclad AI</a> <!-- -->helps legal teams with everything from reviewing contracts faster to answering questions about their obligations.<!-- --> <!-- -->Learn more at <a href="https://www.ironcladapp.com/" target="_blank">ironcladapp.com</a>.</p><p>Rivet is built and used by <img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/ironclad-logo.png" height="20px"/> Research.</p></div></div></section><section id="features"><div><h2>Why Rivet?</h2><div><div><h3>Visualize and Build</h3><p>Visualize and build complex chains to create applications for production — not just prototyping.</p></div><div><h3>Debug Remotely</h3><p>See what&#39;s under the hood and observe the execution of prompt chains in your application, in real-time.</p></div><div><h3>Collaborate</h3><p>Rivet graphs are just YAML files, so you can version them in your team&#39;s repository, and review them using your favorite code review tools.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="demo-video"><div><h2>See it in Action</h2><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HhgM9MiShwA?si=ULy6PThLVtV7D-Ab&amp;rel=0" title="Rivet Demo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p></div></section><section id="use-cases"><div><h2>What the Community is Saying</h2><div><div><p>Rivet&#39;s visual programming environment is a game-changer. The visual nature of the tool, paired with how collaborative it is, allows us to create complex chains for AI agents in drastically less time than it would take in other environments. It&#39;s the best tool out there.</p><p><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/profile-todd-berman.jpeg" alt="Todd Berman"/></p><p>Todd Berman, CTO</p><p><a href="https://www.attentive.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/logo-attentive.svg" alt="Attentive"/></a></p></div><div><p>Rivet really addressed some limitations that we were hitting up against... and some we didn&#39;t know we had. The visualization makes a big difference when working through agentic logic and really makes it easy to see what the AI is doing. But the ability to debug and collaborate across the team made a huge difference as well - we&#39;ve used it to launch our virtual mortgage servicing agent and are excited to see how the tool continues to evolve.</p><p><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/profile-teddy-coleman.jpeg" alt="Teddy Coleman"/></p><p>Teddy Coleman, CTO</p><p><a href="https://www.willowservicing.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/logo-willow.webp" alt="Willow Servicing"/></a></p></div><div><p>In order to build great product experiences we have to be able to iterate quickly. Leveraging tools like Rivet allows us to more accurately understand the tradeoffs between things like speed and quality as we build AI-powered experiences in Bento.</p><p><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/profile-emily-wang.jpeg" alt="Emily Wang"/></p><p>Emily Wang, CEO</p><p><a href="https://www.trybento.co/products/bentoai" target="_blank"><img src="https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/img/use-case-quotes/logo-bento.svg" alt="Bento"/></a></p></div><div><p>Rivet is an amazing tool for rapidly prototyping and visually understanding complex AI workflows. It&#39;s been wonderful collaborating with Ironclad to integrate AssemblyAI&#39;s audio transcription and understanding models into the Rivet ecosystem.
