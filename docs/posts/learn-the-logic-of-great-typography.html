The first mind seeds had been translated from DNA nine centuries before, when the polis founders had invented the Shaper programming language to recreate the essential processes of neuroembryology in software. But any such translation was necessarily imperfect, glossing over biochemical details in favor of broad, functional equivalence, and the full diversity of the flesher genome could not be brought through intact. Starting from a diminished trait pool, with the old DNA-based maps rendered obsolete, it was crucial for the conceptory to chart the consequences of the new variations to the mind seed. To eschew all change would be to risk stagnation; to embrace it recklessly would be to endanger the sanity of every child.</p>

				<!-- STEP 1: CHOOSING A BODY FONT -->
				<div id="body-font">
					
					<p>First, let’s choose a body font. For longform reading, our font must meet two criteria:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>It must be <strong>legible</strong></li>
						<li>It must <strong>match the overall brand</strong> of the design</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We’re typesetting a sci-fi book, so our brand is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Futuristic</li>
						<li>Scientific</li>
						<li>Techie</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Which of these body fonts feels most appropriate for a sci-fi book set in 2975?</p>

		<div data-modal="body-source">
			<div>
				
				<p>Some folks <em>might</em> use Source Sans here, but it’s not the best fit for something super technical and sci-fi feeling.</p>
				<p>One hint: I find that squared-off letterforms work better for techie brands such as this 😉</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="body-garamond">
			<div>
				
				<p>EB Garamond has a very <strong>classic, formal appearance</strong>. We want something that has a modern edge.</p>
				<p>One hint: I find that squared-off letterforms work better for techie brands such as this 😉</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="body-inter">
			<div>
				
				<p>Inter is a fantastic, legible font, but it feels very <strong>neutral and clean</strong>. Instead, we want to find something with a bit more personality.</p>
				<p>One hint: I find that squared-off letterforms work better for techie brands such as this 😉</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="body-noticia">
			<div>
				
				<p>Noticia Text meets both requirements of a body font – (1) high legibility and (2) matches the brand.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You know it’s highly legible since “Text” is in the name 😉</li>
					<li>The slightly squared letterforms – especially in a serif font – feel fresh and modern</li>
				</ul>
				<p><a href="#" id="go-to-line-length">Continue</a>
				<a href="#" id="go-to-side-margins">Continue</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="title-abolition">
			<div>
				
				<p>The angular, geometric Abolition works great with the brand – and with our slightly squared-off body serif. Nice 👍</p>
				<p><a href="#" id="go-to-title-font-size">Continue</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="title-karla">
			<div>
				
				<p>Karla has this sort of <strong>quirky friendliness</strong>, which works for things that are more casual. But for a sci-fi story taking place in the year 2975, we want something a little… <em>less casual</em>.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="title-nunito">
			<div>
				
				<p>The rounded Nunito is <strong>playful and fun</strong>, but our far-future sci-fi book demands something that feels more technical and mechanical.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="title-playfair">
			<div>
				
				<p>Playfair Display is formal and classic, but neither of these qualities make sense for our sci-fi setting. Instead, we want something that feels <em>like the future</em> — not the past.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="accent-bebas">
			<div>
				
				<p>Bebas Neue is a great font – and the punchiness of it certainy matches Abolition. But it’s simply no good for small sizes. It’s too compact, and its details too small.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="accent-carbon">
			<div>
				
				<p>Carbon is as sci-fi as they get. Works like a charm 😉</p>
				<p><a href="#" id="go-to-slub">Continue</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="accent-dm">
			<div>
				
				<p>DM Serif Display is a great font, but would feel more at home as, say, a newspaper headline (the &#34;Display&#34; in its name means it&#39;s great for titles). In addition, let&#39;s pick something with a bit more of a sci-fi vibe.</p>
				<p><a href="#">Pick Another Font</a>
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div data-modal="accent-varela">
			<div>
				
				<p>Varela Round has its place – potentially even in a futuristic brand too. But its soft friendliness conflicts too much with the angular, precise title font. What would complement it instead?</p>
