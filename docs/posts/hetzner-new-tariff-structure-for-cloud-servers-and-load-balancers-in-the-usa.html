    <h1>Hetzner - New tariff structure for Cloud servers and Load balancers in the USA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I tried finding a URL with the same news, but none exists. This is mildly redacted to fit 4000 characters.</p><p>---</p><p>Dear Mr XXX</p><p>** What will change? **</p><p>Starting on 1 December 2024, 01:00 am CET, we will begin charging new prices
for newly-created Cloud servers and introduce new amounts for included
traffic for Cloud Servers and Load balancers at the US locations in Ashburn
(ASH) and Hillsboro (HIL). This also applies to existing Cloud servers and
Load balancers that are switched to a different tariff using the
“Rescale” function. For any existing Cloud servers and Load balancers you
have at these locations, the new prices and the new amounts for included
traffic will apply later, starting on 1 February 2025, 01:00 am CET. The
price for traffic overage will remain unchanged in the new price structure.</p><p>What are the new prices and amounts of included traffic?</p><p>Product | Old price | New price | Old included traffic | New included traffic
CPX11 | € 3.85 | € 4.49 | 20 TB | 1 TB
CPX21 | € 7.05 | € 8.99 | 20 TB | 2 TB
CPX31 | € 13.10 | € 15.99 | 20 TB | 3 TB
CPX41 | € 24.70 | € 29.99 | 20 TB | 4 TB
CPX51 | € 54.40 | € 59.99 | 20 TB | 5 TB
CCX13 | € 11.99 | € 12.99 | 20 TB | 1 TB
CCX23 | € 23.99 | € 25.99 | 20 TB | 2 TB
CCX33 | € 47.99 | € 49.99 | 30 TB | 3 TB
CCX43 | € 95.99 | € 99.99 | 40 TB | 4 TB
CCX53 | € 191.99 | € 199.99 | 50 TB | 6 TB
CCX63 | € 287.99 | € 299.99 | 60 TB | 8 TB
LB11 | € 5.39 | unchanged | 20 TB | 1 TB
LB21 | € 16.40 | unchanged | 20 TB | 2 TB
LB31 | € 32.90 | unchanged | 20 TB | 3 TB
All monthly prices are excl. VAT and excl. IPv4 addresses.</p><p>** Why are we making these changes? **</p><p>With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our customers
around the world as fair as possible. To do that, we will calculate our
prices based on local conditions in Europe, Singapore, and the USA. Until
this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs,
in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to
make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best
possible price for the resources they use.</p><p>** What else do I need to know? **</p><p>Displayed prices and included traffic on Cloud Console</p><p>For technical reasons, we will display the new prices and amounts of included
traffic on the Cloud server and Load balancer detail pages on Cloud Console
starting on 1 December 2024. This will also be true for your existing Cloud
servers and Load balancers. However, the invoice will still be issued
according to the previous conditions. A corresponding note will be displayed
for your existing affected products. On the invoice preview on the
“Usage” page, you will see the correct existing price for your existing
servers.</p><p>Displayed prices on the Cloud API</p><p>In the transition time period between 1 December 2024 and 1 February 2025,
the Cloud API will already return the new prices and included traffic. This
will also be true for your existing Cloud servers and Load balancers. But
this will only affect the display here. The invoice preview will display the
correct existing price. And of course, your invoice itself will be for the
correct existing price.</p><p>Traffic warning</p><p>You may see early traffic warnings during the transition time period starting
on 1 December 2024 for your existing Cloud servers and Load balancers. Please
note that the previous traffic included for existing Cloud servers and Load
balancers remains valid until 31 January 2025.</p><p>If you do not agree with this adjustment, you can cancel the affected
products at any time. We ask for your understanding for why we are making
these changes. We truly believe that we can continue to offer you our Cloud
Servers and features at the best price-performance ratio despite these
adjustments.</p><p>Thank you for your trust and support.</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Hetzner Online</p></div></td></div></div>
