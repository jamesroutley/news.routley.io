    <h1>UK betting giant&#39;s unlawful marketing kept suicidal gambler hooked</h1>

Already deep in debt – having taken out 13 loans over three years, and with his marriage under strain – he had been desperate to quit.</p><p>But Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, operator of Sky Bet, Casino, and Vegas, had other ideas. Having labelled him a “high value” customer, and not realising he was at risk, it had sent him an email promising a £100 bonus if he spent £400 on a casino game. “Well done on making it past level 2. Can you make it even further this week?” it said. Soon after receiving it, Sam deposited £400.</p><figure id="5916aef8-56bc-4e76-9b6f-5e1cac5bfebb" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:2,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;UK betting giants under fire for ads targeting at-risk gamblers&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;5916aef8-56bc-4e76-9b6f-5e1cac5bfebb&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/01/uk-betting-giants-under-fire-for-ads-targeting-at-risk-gamblers&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:10,&#34;display&#34;:2,&#34;theme&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-2 | 2" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>At first glance, the promotion looked like any old junk email. Instead, it was the product of a sophisticated targeted marketing campaign based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of data used to profile him, predict his behaviour – and serve him personalised ads.</p><p>Over two years, when his gambling problem was at its height, the Sky Bet group emailed him multiple times a day, with staggering success. Internal records suggest that of the 1,389 emails it sent him offering free spins and bonus prizes, Sam engaged with 98% of them. “I wasn’t able to ignore them. They had this grip on me,” he said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2025/111.html" data-link-name="in body link">landmark legal ruling</a> that could have wide-ranging ramifications for the gambling industry, the high court has now ruled the targeting unlawful. While Sam may not have explicitly opted out, he had been gambling compulsively, and was in no state to consent to the use of his data for profiling and targeted marketing, the judge said.</p><figure id="b9316091-64c8-4060-8c84-1ab9ed2ccced" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66feab238ba90b115b818c5274c9e16dc1746b86/0_178_5332_3199/master/5332.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="The back of a person, face not visible, holding a smartphone in what looks like a park.

But his life was falling apart: he had lied to his wife, contemplated suicide and was facing “financial armageddon”. He “was not making decisions … on a fully autonomous basis at all”.</p><p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming says it “fundamentally disagrees” with the judgment and is considering an appeal. “Protecting our customers is the number one priority,” it said.</p><p>Now, as the wider gambling industry faces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/25/harm-from-problem-gambling-in-uk-may-be-eight-times-higher-than-thought-research-finds" data-link-name="in body link">mounting scrutiny</a> – and amid calls for regulators to intervene – the <em>Observer</em> can reveal the inner workings of the Sky Bet group’s “black box”: how it and its partners gathered 2,400 spreadsheets of data about a vulnerable customer, from his disordered spending habits to the exact times he played specific games, and used it to predict his behaviour and create marketing that was “hard to resist”.</p><p>Despite all the information they had access to about Sam – from location and deprivation data to the fact he’d closed and reopened his account – the company failed to identify him as someone in need of help. Instead, he was coded as a “high value customer” – a prime target for more marketing. And when he did eventually stop gambling, the software labelled him as someone to “win back”.</p><p>Sam, who is sharing his story on the condition of anonymity, was 21 when he gambled for the first time. It was April 2009 and he’d seen a newspaper ad offering a free football bet. “More or less straight away” he was hooked. He quickly graduated from £10 and £20 football bets to spending hundreds, then thousands, on racing, slot machines and online casinos. Soon he was losing “long, unbroken hours” gambling online – splashing money he had saved for a house deposit, including £11,000 in a single day.</p><p>But he felt powerless to properly benefit from the controls, raising the limit from £100 per day to £250 and eventually £1,000. By the end of that year, he felt he was facing “financial armageddon”, averaging monthly losses of £1,793, and found himself contemplating suicide.</p><p>As the grip of his addiction loosened, Sam’s focus shifted to the firm that had kept him hooked. He knew he had been bombarded with marketing that had felt constant and impossible to ignore. But why had Sky Bet targeted him so intensively? Had the company known how badly he was struggling? And had that information been shared?</p><p>In late 2018, he submitted subject access requests (SARs) asking for records of the data it had on him, such as his deposits, withdrawals and chat logs.</p><p>It replied to say it was suspending his account due to safer gambling concerns following his “unusual questions”. “Can you please complete my SAR as requested?” he wrote back.</p><p>Eventually, the company provided documents revealing that it and its partners held hundreds of thousands of pieces of data on him, gathered using the web tracking tools known as cookies and from other sources.</p><p>It had been used to create a “DNA” customer profile of his browsing habits, demographic characteristics and customer ID, plus details of his gambling: his favourite games, when he played them, his wins and losses, the links he clicked, the marketing he responded to, and his location coordinates at the time.</p><p>Reading through the documents, Sam remembers feeling “physically sick”. Among unintelligible spreadsheets listing pieces of code, his years of gambling were spelled out in black and white: his history of playing slots, his favourite sport (football), the number of deposits made since opening an account (2,514) and his completed bets (44,063).</p><p>Information had also been shared with at least 18 third parties for marketing – including Facebook, Google and others that were less well known. One recipient, the intelligence firm Signal, had used it to conduct sophisticated profiling that it sent back to Sky Betting &amp; Gaming to help it predict his behaviour and refine its ads.</p><p>This included labelling him as a customer of “high value” who they later wanted to “win back” – but no markers indicating he was at risk.</p><p>He was confused, then anxious. He had been trying to hide his gambling; now he feared it was going to get out. That quickly turned to anger. “I thought, well, if they had all this data on me, why didn’t they use it to protect me better?” he said.</p><p>This question was at the heart of the legal battle at the high court late last year. Over five days in November, the court heard not only how Sam was tracked and targeted, but about Sky Bet’s failure to realise he was at risk. Even as his gambling spiralled out of control, the company’s suppression measures – supposed to cut off marketing to people considered high risk – did not kick in.</p><p>And he had previously been identified as someone at potential risk. In 2014, he had been flagged by Sky Bet for a “responsible gambling proactive” phone call – after depositing £1,000 that had been funded by a loan – but he didn’t answer. The following year, he shut his account to try to stop gambling but reopened it the next day. In June 2016, he tried to close it again. In the process, he was asked via a chat tool whether he wanted to opt in to marketing via email or SMS. “No thank you,” he wrote back.</p><p>Sky Bet also had access to external data that could have helped them assess risk, including data correlating postcodes with deprivation, but didn’t use it. The court heard this was for “ethical reasons” – it didn’t want people to use risk factors such as social deprivation “to enhance the attractiveness of its marketing”.</p><p>Had it cross-referenced this information with details of his transactions, it might have twigged that he was in trouble and cut off its ads. Instead, its system relied on a financial trigger – how much money a customer was spending – to decide whether they were at risk.</p><p>As it stood, the court heard that even if Sam had spent every penny he had, his modest salary meant he could never reach that threshold. The triggers were set at levels “beyond the realistically possible reach” of his modest means, “even when he was spending all the money he could get his hands on and more,” the judge said.</p><p>She described Sky Bet’s system as “a cliff edge”: people hitting the threshold would stop receiving marketing altogether, while those falling just short could be labelled a potential “high value asset” and subject to “enhanced targeting”. It was “all or nothing”. “There were no intermediate stages in which marketing continued but was moderated or safeguarded, she said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-28">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-28" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The judge was also damning about Sky Bet’s process for obtaining consent. While Sam may have clicked a tick-box agreeing to marketing, he had not properly understood how he was being tracked and profiled, nor how his data would be used.</p><p>She ruled that while he was in the depths of his compulsive gambling habit, his ability to give consent was impaired, concluding that Sky Bet’s use of his data to serve marketing was unlawful. “He was not making decisions relating to his gambling in general – and these box-ticking decisions in particular – on a fully autonomous basis at all,” she said.</p><p>Sky Betting &amp; Gaming rejects the finding and is considering an appeal. A spokesperson for the company, bought by £38bn gambling giant Flutter in 2020, said: “We fundamentally disagree with this judgment, which relates to a specific case from 2017-19. Protecting our customers is the number one priority for Sky Betting &amp; Gaming and we have made significant changes to our controls and processes over the past six years.”</p><p>In recent years, the sector has faced stricter controls after warnings over gambling harms. In 2022 and 2023, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Gambling</a> Commission introduced tougher requirements for operators to identify and protect customers at risk of harm – including that they must “draw on all available sources of data to give a comprehensive picture”.</p><p>It has previously restricted marketing and promotional offers to customers showing strong indicators of harm. And from 1 May this year, operators will be barred from cross-selling new products to customers without explicit permission.</p><p>But seven years on from when Sam was being targeted, the industry still relies heavily on tracking and profiling to attract its customers, often through tick-box consent.</p><p>Ravi Naik of law firm AWO, representing the claimant, said he hoped the ruling would be a “death knell for this kind of pernicious activity: tick-boxes, mass surveillance and data sharing, all unbeknownst to the user”.</p><p>He said everyone was subject, all the time, to automated behavioural segmentation – tracking and profiling for ad purposes. But in his client’s case, “the mechanism was getting him to continue to gamble to the point of self-destruction”. “They had taken his addiction and turned it into code,” he said.</p><p>Will Prochaska, leader of the Coalition to End Gambling Ads, described the case as “frightening”<em><strong> </strong></em>and said it raised the question of whether other companies that market to problem gamblers, who could be considered unable to freely consent due to the compulsive nature of their gambling, are also breaking the law.</p><p>“The judge has picked up on the fact that addiction takes away agency: when you’re addicted, your agency has been impaired,” he said<em><strong>.</strong></em></p><p>He said profiling and targeting were “continuing and widespread” in the gambling industry and had been known “for years”. “This court case opens the lid on one operator’s practice but the real question is why the regulator allowed this to carry on for so long,” he said.</p><p>Charles Ritchie from the charity Gambling with Lives, which supports families bereaved by gambling, said: “Operators are using data and algorithms to target people with more incentives to gamble when they should be using that data to meaningfully intervene.</p><figure id="9644373e-2f02-4bf4-951a-e9368c1694ea" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="A screen grab from the Sky Vegas app Prize Surge tempts players with ‘There’s double the prizes to be won tomorrow!’" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53047896e94f33f88387bb9fdef535197075b479/0_0_632_537/master/632.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="378.10917721518985" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Sky Vegas app Prize Surge tempts players with ‘There’s double the prizes to be won tomorrow!’</span> Photograph: No Credit</figcaption></figure><p>“Gambling companies have been preying on people for many years in this way.
