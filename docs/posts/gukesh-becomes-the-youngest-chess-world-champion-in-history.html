<h2><a href="#recap" id="recap"></a>Recap</h2>
<p>GM <a href="https://lichess.org/fide/8603677/Ding_Liren">Ding Liren</a> once again had to defend a pawn-down endgame against GM <a href="https://lichess.org/fide/46616543/Gukesh_D">Gukesh D</a> after he was slightly better out of the opening. Ding chose to liquidate quickly into the pawn-down endgame and after a long struggle, he blundered abruptly as he allowed a rook trade into a losing king and pawn endgame.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:eAGiZJrHYRio:GBDBJP3N.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=169de767719624ab3709c0c428a4d33029fef088" alt=""/></p>
<p>For the second time in the match, Ding tried 1. Nf3, signaling his intention to sidestep major opening theory. After Gukesh’s principled 1...d5 reply, Ding played in the style of the hypermodernists, who eschewed pawn central control in favor of piece central control, by playing a fianchetto. As Gukesh continued to play classically with 2...c5 and 3...Nc6, Ding finally put a pawn in the center with 4. d4, and White found himself playing the Reversed Grünfeld — the Grünfeld Defense but from the White side.</p>

<p>It seemed clear that Gukesh was not at all surprised by Ding’s choice as he kept playing quickly, responding to the Reversed Grünfeld with a very concrete idea: clarifying the central tension with 5...cxd4. Following Ding’s 6. Nxd4, Gukesh once again shocked the world with another opening surprise and near-novelty: 6...Nge7!?. While a very strange-looking move, Gukesh’s idea was clear: to get rid of one pair of knights by playing 1...Nxd4 2. Qxd4 and then 2...Nc6 to gain a tempo on the queen.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#12</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:AKDtUimy6yaP:yFbRJ1ks.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=5182bf84b91b00ed2549ef353989e864b4ac6823" alt=""/></p>
<p>Ding allowed Gukesh’s plan and put a pawn in the center, which was Stockfish’s recommended move. Gukesh followed through on his plan and, continuing to play quickly, went for 9...d4, gaining space and again showing that he was in deep preparation.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#18</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:nNYtG6HF4T3Q:XhDQHktG.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=b9ed8a2f6f02f7901e93e3a7eb1f2b00022a42f7" alt=""/></p>
<p>Ding responded logically with 10. e3, challenging Gukesh’s grip on the center. After the central tension was resolved and Black’s bishop made its home on d4, it became obvious that White had a slight advantage as his light-squared bishop had a wide scope. Meanwhile, Black’s bishop was hemmed in by its own pawns, one of the key positional themes of the match.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#23</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:GQVRjokQiAcI:vCaf08LC.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=9a34b5081f3e6d52ad690936a990ba7cf338ecf3" alt=""/></p>
<p>Ding then proceeded to develop his dark-squared bishop while also gaining a tempo on Black’s dark-squared bishop. Said tempo did not matter too much as Black could afford to lose a tempo because White was already quite underdeveloped. With Gukesh’s bishop making it way to d4 once more, Gukesh’s central control looked quite powerful and ensured that he would never be significantly worse.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#30</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:L2fXPm8AZ90R:B6xeX2Se.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=b5a2782e87ca160b0f205cbf32670839bd7722a9" alt=""/></p>
<p>With 16...e5 and Black’s light-squared bishop now having the potential to develop, Ding had to act quickly if he wanted to gain any kind of advantage. 17. Qd2! and 18. Nd5! were two good moves that helped Ding further his goals, but Gukesh was alert and played the momentum-shifting and well-timed 18...b5! pawn break.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#36</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:6szemEOWMqu4:4sxDPWeN.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=f869cbdf83455c2f00b388af7571c4b2ffa605cb" alt=""/></p>
<p>A long, almost-forced computer line may have given White a nominal advantage with chances to play on, but at that point, Ding must have felt that there was not much left to play for, so he initiated a sequence of mass liquidation that started with 19. cxb5. Following 22...Rb8, the position looked very equal and the game looked to be heading toward a draw.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#44</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:q59HIpZMhKmk:z5G5IMIU.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=bdbffea1d38172c31873ccb0c3dab84d095f723a" alt=""/></p>
<p>However, as is frequently the case in such positions, there are a lot of ways for both sides to falter — and if not outright blunder, there are a lot of ways for one side to make the draw that much more difficult to achieve. Unfortunately for Ding, Gukesh’s rapid activity meant that he had to contend with a strong b4 pawn, which was able to freeze White’s queenside pawn majority.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#50</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:SuNxN2fp1j2g:7oiUaaGZ.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=e91773ce68c9630370ad56fc8369b919a1003ef4" alt=""/></p>
<p>After Ding’s 26. a4, it was evident that Ding wanted to defend a 3 vs. 2 rook (+bishop) endgame just as he did in yesterday’s round — except that with the addition of bishops, the position becomes slightly tougher to defend. Practically speaking, such a decision cannot be faulted because if one were to keep material parity with a move such as the engine’s 26. Rd3, matters could quickly get out of hand, especially with time trouble looming. Going into a 3 vs. 2, as long as the worse side’s defensive technique is up to par, can be a much better and more pragmatic choice. Having said that, Ding definitely did not want to have to make this decision after he was slightly better just a few moves ago.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#51</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:pnsE9vnpyAX3:zBBygMQM.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=a383bc141a12d6198a8cd900ac13e053faee2d9d" alt=""/></p>
<p>A few more “pretend” moves were played before the basically inescapable 3 vs. 2 rook + bishop endgame was on the board — there were other possibilities, of course, but the way both sides were playing, it was apparent they were both heading toward that position. On move 32 and with 22 minutes for 8 moves left, it was time to see if Ding would be able to hold the position.</p>
<p>https://lichess.org/study/embed/LtsCRK9D/YaARFAYu#63</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?fmt=webp&amp;h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=ublogBody:dNwcbAa6iAVb:Admc4WS0.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;sig=e54c10528eb193e096a8108637d3c3b01c023499" alt=""/></p>
<p>... And hold the position he did not. If one were to replay the game with engine analysis turned on, one would be under the false impression that Ding always had the draw in hand and mere perfunctory moves were being played. Such is surely not the case, though, and we again refer the reader to our stream of the event to follow all the twists and turns of this endgame. Indeed, Ding&#39;s blunder came about because of the tension, though of course his fellow elite chess players, such as our guest commentator Ivan Cheparinov, were critical of his blunder.</p>

<p>Some memorable quotes:</p>
<p>GM Ding Liren:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I played maybe my best tournament in the year. I could be better but considering yesterday&#39;s lucky survive it&#39;s a fair result to lose in the end. No regret.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will continue to play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GM Gukesh D:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly I would like to say a few words about my opponent. We all know who Ding is and, you know, he has been one of the best players in history for several years. To see him struggling, to see how much pressure he had to face and the kind of fight he gave in this match. It shows what a true champion he is. This match, champions they always step up to the moment. Obviously in the past two years he hasn&#39;t been in great shape, but he came here. He was obviously struggling during the games, he was probably not at the best physically. But he fought in all games. He fought like a true champion, and I&#39;m really sorry for Ding and his team. They put on a great show. I would like to thank my opponent first. This couldn&#39;t have been the same without my opponent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just living my dream!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will have to prepare my speech first. With the kind of emotions I&#39;m feeling right now I&#39;ll say something stupid!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just looked at Vishy Sir and Magnus and thought it would be really cool to be there one day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t change a single thing about my career.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t thank them [my parents] enough.</p>
</blockquote>
