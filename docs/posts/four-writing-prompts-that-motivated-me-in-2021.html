<p>Like many people, I&#39;ve often struggled to write down and share my ideas. This year I&#39;ve managed to post a bit more, and I&#39;ve been thinking about what helped. Here are some situations where I found it easier to get over the hump of publishing things in 2021:</p>
<h2>1. Catching Fleeting Thoughts</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, having a deadline prompted some of my most focused writing this year. I managed to crank out my <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/job-search-2021/">Job Search</a> and <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/joining/wave/">Joining Wave</a> posts in the hectic weekend before I started my current job, because I knew that once I started work, the perspective that I wanted to write from would evaporate quickly.</p>
<p>This also motivated me to write several internal documents at <a href="https://www.wave.com/">Wave</a>, sharing my onboarding experiences while I still had fresh eyes to see the organization as a newcomer.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just about changing life circumstances, it works for transient &#34;shower&#34; thoughts too. When I find myself temporarily fixated on an idea, it&#39;s the best (or maybe only) time to take a stab at articulating it. This motivated my <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/jodorowskys-dune/">Reflections on Jodorowsky&#39;s Dune</a> on the weekend that I watched that documentary.</p>
<p>Matt Webb echoes this in his <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak#:~:text=Only%20write%20what%E2%80%99s%20in%20my%20head%20at%20that%20exact%20moment.%20It%E2%80%99s%2010x%20faster.">10th rule for blogging</a>: &#34;Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.&#34;</p>
<h2>2. Marking the Trail I Was Looking For</h2>
<p>Lately, whenever it takes me longer than it &#34;should&#34; to track down or figure out some bit of information, I try to take the time to write the notes I wished I&#39;d found, and leave them somewhere I would have found them.</p>
<p>At Wave, this means writing a Quip doc or Slack post using the terms I was originally searching for. For broader technical things, it might mean <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60683702/silence-warning-could-not-create-compact-unwind-for-symbol-stack-subl-instru">creating and answering my own Stack Overflow question</a> so that it&#39;ll be easier to find later.</p>
<h2>3. Resharing for a Larger Audience</h2>
<p>Sometimes when I&#39;m writing an email to someone, I realize that it&#39;s motivated me to write a good explanation of a concept, and it&#39;s a shame that only one person will be able to read it.</p>
<p>On a good day, that&#39;s enough for me to spend the extra minutes to turn that explanation into its own post or document, and share a link to it instead. That way, I can reuse it in future messages, and hopefully other interested people can stumble across it on their own.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/law-of-data-maintenance/">Law of Data Maintenance</a> and <a href="https://trellick.work/writing/thought-strings-beggars-in-spain/">Beggars in Spain</a> posts started as this way, as things that I was writing to friends.</p>
<h2>4. Rewarding the Thoughts that Come Back</h2>
<p>Finally, there are some thoughts that didn&#39;t seem particularly notable at first, but that keep coming back to me. It might be a talk that I listened to a month ago that comes to mind in a work conversation, or something I&#39;ve said that I hear other people repeating.</p>
<p>Since this is a good clue that the thought is useful or interesting, it&#39;s more worthwhile to write it down for future reference.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just started a bunch of drafts based on this one that I plan to share in the coming weeks!</p>
