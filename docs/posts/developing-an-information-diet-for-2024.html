    <p>Itâ€™s 2024 and, as we all expected, the drumbeat of sensationalism is rampant in online news and discourse. Iâ€™ve been trying to develop an information diet that allows me to stay up-to-date with things I find interesting and relevant while avoiding the mental distress that the modern-day internet (and political situation) seems to feed off of. I <em>think</em> Iâ€™ve landed on something that works for me, and figured Iâ€™d share in case it can be an interesting for others.</p>

<p>For starters, Iâ€™ve opted for complete abstinence from algorithmically generated feeds. I found that I am no match for the dopamine hits these feeds generate, and as such am better off avoiding them entirely. This is a bit easier for me, as I deleted Facebook and Twitter years ago and never got involved with Instagram nor TikTok. More interestingly, this also means Iâ€™ve ditched the homepages of most commercial news outlets. I realized that I was opening the New York Times homepage and scrolling through headlines as if it were Instagram. The two arenâ€™t equivalents, but the addictive behavior was too much of a red flag to ignore.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Abstinence from the algorithms leaves a sizable void that I found needed to be filled, lest I end up quickly relapsing into old habits. For the time being Iâ€™ve been trying to limit myself to four information sources: El PaÃ­s, NPR podcasts<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, Mastodon and RSS.</p>

<p>El PaÃ­s serves to replace the NY Times for written coverage of current events. The key difference is Spanish. It applies <em>just</em> enough friction to reading that I canâ€™t abuse speed reading and scrolling through headlines and articles in the same way I can with English-language news. I assume El PaÃ­s employs similar algorithmic headline placement as the NY Times but itâ€™s no match for the mediocrity of my Spanish comprehension skills ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>

<p>NPR podcasts replace the high-quality journalism in my native language, but at a much slower pace. If something big and spicy happens Iâ€™ll have to wait until at least the next day to hear anything about it. The delay also means higher quality reporting, as journalists have had more time to process things. I also love that NPR is pretty bland and analytical in its coverage of events, making everything feel a bit less degrading than the constant sirens employed by other news outlines.</p>

<p>As for Mastodon, Iâ€™ve found that the community within which I dwell is usually more interested in sprouting lentils, sailing, and learning about esoteric programming languages than commenting on minute-by-minute political news. When we do dive into the political realm the discourse is almost always civil, mostly because weâ€™re in a bubble and generally have the same beliefs. Disabling boosts is also very helpful in dodging viral content that I donâ€™t consider to be very insightful nor productive.</p>

<p>Finally, thereâ€™s RSS. I donâ€™t use it much for current events, but more-so to follow blogs, tech communities, newsletters, or anything else I want to keep track of. The RSS dream is very much so still alive, and my <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2020/11/30/self-host-rss.html">self-hosted setup</a> ensures that itâ€™s a relatively quiet source of chronologically ordered content, all of which I have curated myself (ie no algorithms inserting recommended content).</p>

<p>Keeping to this slower and more boring information diet has required a lot of self-discipline which waxes and wanes over time. Even so, Iâ€™ve found it has paid off greatly in terms of balancing mental health with being informed. Iâ€™m constantly looking to improve it, so feedback is welcome in the comments section if you have thoughts.</p>
