    <h1>UK quietly scrubs encryption advice from government websites</h1>

<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. government appears to have quietly scrubbed encryption advice from government web pages, just weeks after demanding backdoor access to encrypted data stored on Apple’s cloud storage service, iCloud. </p>

<p>The change was spotted by security expert Alec Muffett, who wrote in <a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/112522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post on Wednesday</a> that the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is no longer recommending that high-risk individuals use encryption to protect their sensitive information.</p>







<p>The NCSC in October published a document titled “Cybersecurity tips for barristers, solicitors &amp; legal professionals,” that advised the use of encryption tools such as Apple’s Advanced Data Protection (ADP). </p>

<p>ADP allows users to turn on end-to-end encryption for their iCloud backups, effectively making it impossible for anyone, including Apple and government authorities, to view data stored on iCloud.</p>

<p>The URL hosting the NCSC document now redirects to a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different page</a> that makes no mention of encryption or ADP. Instead, it recommends that at-risk individuals use Apple’s Lockdown Mode, an “extreme” security tool that restricts access to certain functions and features.</p>

<p>Muffett reports that the original document, still accessible via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241102140713/https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyber-security-tips-for-barristers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wayback Machine</a>, has been “wholesale deleted from the internet.” TechCrunch wasn’t able to find any encryption advice on the U.K. government’s website. </p>

<p>The U.K. Home Office and NCSC did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions.</p>


<p>The removal of the encryption advice comes weeks after the U.K. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-demands-apple-backdoor-to-encrypted-cloud-data-report/">secretly ordered Apple to build a backdoor</a> that would give authorities access to users’ encrypted iCloud data. </p>

<p>Following the order, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Washington Post</a>, Apple pulled its ADP feature in the U.K., and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-feature-for-uk-users-after-government-demanded-backdoor/">confirmed</a> to TechCrunch that the feature will no longer be made available to new users in the U.K., and its current users would eventually need to disable it.</p>

<p>Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-demands-apple-backdoor-to-encrypted-cloud-data-report/">challenging</a> the U.K.’s data access order in the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd?shareType=nongift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Financial Times</a> reported this week. </p>
