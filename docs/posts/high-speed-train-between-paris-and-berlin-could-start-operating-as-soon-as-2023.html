    <h1>High speed train between Paris and Berlin could start operating as soon as 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>French rail operator SNCF and Deutsche Bahn are planning to launch a direct high-speed train between Paris and Berlin at the end of 2023.</p><p>The new rail line was announced on Tuesday by the head of the French company, who came to Strasbourg to celebrate 15 years of Franco-German high-speed cooperation.</p><p>&#34;We want to launch a TGV Paris-Berlin in December 2023,&#34; SNCF CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou told AFP.</p><p>&#34;It makes sense because we see that people are accepting longer and longer journeys. There are really people who are willing to spend five hours, six hours, seven hours on a train,&#34; he explained.</p><p>&#34;In this case, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2021/07/02/take-a-walk-through-ernest-hemingway-s-paris"><strong>Paris</strong></a>-Berlin is seven hours.&#34;</p><p>&#34;A few years ago, we thought it was a little long and we were afraid we&#39;d have no one. There are more and more people for whom this is not a problem, so much the better!&#34; he said, stressing, that &#34;taking the train is a way to reconcile mobility and nature protection.&#34;</p><h2>How many trains will run between Paris and Berlin?</h2><p>To start with, there will be one return trip per day on this link via <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2022/03/22/7-fantastic-cities-in-europe-you-don-t-have-to-fly-to"><strong>Frankfurt</strong></a>. It will be operated as a partnership between the SNCF and Deutsche Bahn with German ICE high-speed trains, according to Alain Krakovitch, director of TGV-Intercités at the SNCF.</p><p>In the future, a second daily round trip could also be completed with French TGVs (<a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2022/03/31/eurostar-and-thalys-merger-will-simplify-train-travel-between-five-european-countries"><strong>high-speed trains</strong></a>), he added.</p><p>&#34;It is quite symbolic of the evolution of our society, and the fact that many of our fellow citizens prefer the train,&#34; said the manager.</p><p>&#34;The observation we make today is that Paris-Milan and Paris-<a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2021/10/28/spain-is-planning-to-launch-a-high-speed-train-service-from-london-to-paris"><strong>Barcelona</strong></a> have amazing occupancy rates: on Paris-Milan, the offer has doubled with the arrival of Trenitalia (the Italian public company, which came to compete with the SNCF TGV in December), and despite that, the trains are full,&#34; he explained.</p><p>&#34;We should be able to have the same thing on Paris-Berlin.&#34;</p><p>The daily TGV linking Frankfurt to Marseille via Strasbourg and Lyon has been a success, Mr Krakovitch said.</p><h2>Day and night trains between Paris and Berlin</h2><p>The Paris-Berlin daytime high-speed train will be in addition to a night train connection between the two capitals. It will be operated by Austrian railroads ÖBB in cooperation with SNCF and Deutsche Bahn and will also start in late 2023.</p><p>&#34;It will be at the same time, the night train and the day train. We will have the choice according to taste,&#34; Jean-Pierre Farandou said.</p><p>&#34;We are making Europe somewhere, the Europe of everyday life,&#34; he added. &#34;We are making peace in Europe with the railway.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I am convinced that we need more railroads in Europe and a strong Europe needs a strong interconnection on the rails,&#34;  his colleague from Deutsche Bahn, Richard Lutz echoed.</p><p>The development of railways is &#34;essential to achieve the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/07/03/holidays-by-train-could-cut-carbon-emissions-in-a-post-lockdown-world"><strong>climate objectives</strong></a>,&#34; he stressed.</p><p>SNCF and Deutsche Bahn have been running <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/12/15/europe-s-high-speed-rail-network-is-about-to-get-bigger-faster-and-cheaper-under-new-eu-pl"><strong>high-speed trains</strong></a>, TGV and ICE, between France and Germany since the opening of the first section of the Paris-Strasbourg high-speed line in June 2007.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, the two companies have transported 25 million people on the Paris-Frankfurt, Paris-Stuttgart-Munich and Frankfurt-Marseille routes, with the train now beating the plane on the Paris-Frankfurt route.</p></div></div>
