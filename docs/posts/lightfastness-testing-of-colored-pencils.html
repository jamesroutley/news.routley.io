<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/">sketches</a> and <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/software/">simulator</a> gave me some idea of how I wanted this to go together.
But it took a while to build. “Measure twice, cut once,” right?</p>
<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3>
<p>I knew I wanted this to be a round clock, with the LED matrix in the center.
Given a 1-meter LED strip around the circumference, I wanted the diameter to be about<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
$$ 1 \text{ meter} \div \pi \approx 1 \text{ foot} $$<p>I also knew a few constraints on the height:
12mm for the matrix, about 2cm for the NeoPixel strip,
and… that <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/electronics/#hat-stackup">4cm stackup</a> for the electronics.</p>
<p>That would be a pretty thick clock body.
I decided that the electronics stackup could protrude from the rear,
along with some standoffs to level it out.</p>
<h3 id="3d-printing">3d printing?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.newcastlede.gov/1389/Route-9-Library-Innovation-Center" rel="external" target="_blank">My local library</a>
has a nice makerspace, including 3d printers.
I hadn’t had much of an excuse to use it, and I thought this might be a good project!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://tinkercad.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> for some sketches.
I quickly realized the size I was targeting would be too big for the print bed,
so I started looking for ways to build it as distinct parts:</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I ran some prototypes before printing any of these at full-size.</p>
<p>For the electronics bay, I made a Pi mount that worked fine,
thanks to detailed dimensional drawings from the Raspberry Pi folks
and some good advice from <a href="http://msgtn.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Michael</a>
on sizing the nut cages.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
A 1/8 section of the frame was <em>fine</em>, but unattractive.
The interlock <em>kinda</em> worked, but I gave up on fine-tuning it.</p>
<p>But after running a few prints, I realized I didn’t want to 3d print the frame.
For one thing, I was looking at <em>a lot</em> of print time, 12h or more, and I didn’t want to tie up the library’s printers for that long.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Mostly I was dissatisfied with the <em>aesthetics</em> of the printed item.
Part of the goal was for this clock to be in my line-of-sight during most of the day–
I wanted it to look nice!</p>
<h3 id="the-old-ways">The old ways</h3>
<p>If you want A Thing in a particular shape, the traditional way is to cut it out of wood.</p>
<p>I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Solid-Wood-Digital-Clock/" rel="external" target="_blank">this wood-block digital clock</a>.
Ideally, when the clock was powered down, it would look like “just” a wooden circle on the wall.</p>
<p>That project formed prior art for “an LED can shine through thin-enough wood”.
I was also ready to compromise and drill small holes, possibly overlaid with veneer,
if I couldn’t make the face thin enough.</p>
<p>All of this woodworking was beyond my equipment or expertise, though.</p>
<h2 id="woodworking">Woodworking</h2>
<p>Luckily, I had recently had coffee with <a href="https://ntietz.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Maddie</a>,
who has a well-equipped woodshop, the skills to use it safely, and an interest in fun projects.
I e-mailed her and explained the project, and she agreed to help!</p>
<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
<p>Maddie started by taking plunge router and
and routing out a matrix-sized area in a piece of pinewood scrap.
We tried a couple different depth-stops, based on what we thought we needed to shine through,
and how thin we were willing to risk cutting the board.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/protoboard-cutout-rear.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/protoboard-cutout-rear.webp" alt="A pinewood board with a roughly rectangular area partially routed out, i.e. thinned. Within that area, an L-shaped area is routed out slightly more deeply, at a different depth for each arm of the L."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>First prototype. Note the more-deeply-cut L.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="prototype-results">Prototype results</h3>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/electronics/#test-program">test program</a> to check the quality of the shine-through.
When running this program, the matrix iterated through white, red, green, and blue.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I set up the test board in my house, roughly where I expected the clock to live,
and gave it a look.</p>

<p>The red light made it through the board pretty clearly.
The green light was severly attenuated, and the blue light was all but invisible.</p>
<p>The depth of the cut had a significant impact:
the brightest region of the images above matches the places that were cut more deeply.
Ultimately, this is good news – we can improve the shine-through by applying elbow grease (sanding).</p>
<p>The wood’s grain also has a significant effect: the darker parts of the grain absorb the light more fully.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was the light-tunnel effect of the grain.
Pixels on the same row begin to blend together, but only in one direction!
This gives a retro, CRT-like effect – I didn’t hate it!</p>
<p>I was somewhat dissatisfied with the level of contrast.
When the board was in direct sunlight, text was hard to make out.</p>
<h3 id="matrix-cuts">Matrix cuts</h3>
<p>Still, we thought these results promising enough to try with the real board.
After all, we realized, we could always sand it down a little more! <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>We started by finding the board’s center (see caption).
Then we drew some axes to align with the grain, and worked out approximately where we needed to cut to fit the matrix.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/projectboard-markings.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/projectboard-markings.webp" alt="A round piece of pine wood with several markings on it, including lines meeting at the center, and a rectangle around the center (the matrix position)."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>Draw a chord. Find the center of the chord (1/2 its length). Draw a line perpendicular to the chord, passing through the chord’s center; this line is a diameter. Repeat to create another diameter. The diameters meet at the circle’s center.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We marked off slightly more than the area we thought we’d need so we could center the LED matrix visually.
Maddie taught me a best-practice: cross-hatch over the area to cut, to make it obvious what needs to happen.</p>
<p>One challenge: the 1&#34; depth of the board was approximately the depth of the bit.
This made routing in a single pass difficult,
so Maddie made multiple passes for each cut to keep the force on the bit even and low.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/projectboard-wip-cut.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/projectboard-wip-cut.webp" alt="The project board, partially routed out. Most of a rectangle is routed out to a consistent depth. Along one long edge, the top surface of the board is marked with dark pencil marks, in an area that completes the rectangle. Next to the marked portion but within the cutout region is a long step, which is routed to about half of the total depth."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>Partway through a pass.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also had to contend with balance.
The smaller dimension of the area to cut was <em>just</em> larger than the base of the plunge router.
This meant on the last few passes, the router was only supported one one side:
a slip could mean cutting right through the board!</p>
<p>Luckily, Maddie has steady hands: we wound up with no holes that weren’t already there.
(We did reveal one hole that was already there, but that’s okay.)
Our overall results were pretty good.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-plastic-its-fantastic">Back to plastic, it’s fantastic</h2>
<p>Even after going down the woodworking path,
I still thought it would be nice to use 3d printing for the electronics mounts.
I was still working out some aspects of the electronics –
whether or not I could <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/electronics/#hat-stackup">un-stack the HAT</a>,
whether or not to <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/electronics#level-shift">use a level shifter</a> –
and I thought it would be easier to make a replacable part than to commit to a particular layout.</p>
<h3 id="electronics-mount-yes">Electronics mount: yes</h3>
<p>My “unstacked” design had several mounts, “glued” together.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/tinkercad-full-electro-mount.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/tinkercad-full-electro-mount.webp" alt="A Tinkercad render of the unstacked design.

      <p>The (final) stacked design, without the level shifter.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I split out the quadrants to iterate on them more quickly.
Sizing the level-shifter clips was a finnicky business; it was much better to iterate on a 15-minute print
of just that component.</p>
<p>I made a couple mistakes, like not using supports for the nut cages.
Eventually, I settled on skipping the level shifter and keeping the high stack.</p>

<h3 id="display-mount-no">Display mount: no</h3>
<p>I also tried making a display mount: something that would push the LED matrix against the bottom of the carveout,
but also allow me to adjust the position. I came up with this design:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/tinkercad-display-mount.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/tinkercad-display-mount.webp" alt="Prototype of the display mount. At the lowest height, a rectangle outlines the size of the matrix, with six screw-holes for attachment. At the left and right edges of the rectangle are two brackets, with raised portions extending further off the edge. The left bracket has two short horizontal slots, and the right bracket has one long vertical slot."/></a>
</figure>
<p>The outer “fins” were to sit on the non-routed area. The vertical and horizontal channels would be part of a screw + washer
assembly, so I could adjust the position of the matrix, then tighten it down.</p>
<p>However, this design had a significant problem: I didn’t have a dimensional drawing for this LED matrix.
I tried to work around this by exporting my design as an SVG, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tinkercad/comments/iuqe04/comment/m00qa4a/" rel="external" target="_blank">changing the line thickness</a>,
and <em>2d</em> printing the result.
This felt like it got me closer… but still not close enough that my test (3d) print fit properly.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/2d-print.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/2d-print.webp" alt="Prototype of the display mount.

</figure>
<p>I decided not to waste more time on test prints.
Maddie had suggested using a point driver to hold the matrix in place; I decided that would be fine.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-owl">The rest of the owl</h2>
<h3 id="material-cuts">Material cuts</h3>
<p>With an electronics layout in hand, we were ready to do the rest of the cuts.</p>
<p>We used the electronics bay to measure out the dimensions, and Maddie routed that out–
though not as deeply as the display.
She also cut out a channel for the Neopixels, at about half-depth of the board.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/electronics-bay.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/electronics-bay.webp" alt="The electronics stack and the matrix near their final positions.

    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To handle the height of the electronics stackup,
Maddie drilled three holes in the rear, two towards the top and one at the bottom.
We promptly filled these with lengths of dowel, creating standoffs that were slightly taller than the electronics stackup.
The upper two standoffs also also gave me a place to attach picture wire for the final installation.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/standoff.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/standoff.webp" alt="A short wooden peg protrudes from the rear of the clock, in the space between the NeoPixel strip and the electronics area.

      <p>It’s a standoff!</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Finally, Maddie pulled out a point driver to attach the matrix in place.
We set the points tight enough that the matrix wouldn’t move, even when the clock is vertical;
however, they’re flexible enough to let us reposition it by hand as needed.</p>
<h3 id="electronics-attachment">Electronics attachment</h3>
<p>I went back to <a href="https://www.newcastlede.gov/1389/Route-9-Library-Innovation-Center" rel="external" target="_blank">the library</a> to work on final assembly.</p>
<p>I used Velcro<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> to hold the electronics mount in place: one piece on the wood, one piece on the back of the electronics mount. It’s fine. Not fancy, but fine.</p>
<p>I initially tried a wood glue to hold the Neopixel strip in place, but it didn’t form a strong bond to the (plastic) sheath.</p>
<p>The makerspace manager <!-- Jessi --> suggested holding the Neopixel strip mechanically rather than with an adhesive,
using a staple/clip shape.
I took her up on this, again using it as an excuse to learn:
on <a href="https://hannahilea.com/blog/cuttle-obsession/" rel="external" target="_blank">the recommendation of another friend</a>,
I designed the staples in <a href="https://cuttle.xyz" rel="external" target="_blank">Cuttle</a> and laser-cut them out of birch plywood.</p>
<p>I ran the numbers for the dimensions: if I wanted to drill a 1/4&#34; hole, and I had a 5mm sheet of plywood, the pins should be</p>
$$ w = \sqrt{(1/4\text{in})^2 - (5\text{mm})^2 } $$<p>about 3.9 wide.
I rounded up to 4mm, didn’t account for <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kerf" rel="external" target="_blank">kerf</a>, and used a smaller drill bit when making the mounting holes…
so it wound up being a tighter press-fit than expected.
Still, it worked well enough for the Neopixel strip that I used some of the spare staples to wrangle the other cables.</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-work">Ongoing work</h3>
<p>I did some additional patching on the <a href="https://github.com/cceckman/aclock" rel="external" target="_blank">software</a>: displaying the humidity, and using only the red channel
for the matrix. I also sanded down the face some more, trying to let a little more light through.</p>
<p>I’ll probably continue both of those tasks.
Maddie and other have had lots of ideas for things to display, and there’s always another half-millimeter of material that can be removed.
But at this point, I’ call this project “done enough”!</p>
<h2 id="final-for-now">Final, for now</h2>
<p>I moved twice between when I got the parts for this project and when I started on it in earnest.
As I’m wrapping up this post, I’m preparing to move again;
I’m not hanging it in the place where I did most of the work!</p>
<p>But if all goes according to plan, here’s the clock in its for-the-indefinite-future home:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/final.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/physical-design/final.webp" alt="The clock, on the wall, with two curtains just peeking into view on either side.

The wall next to the clock&#39;s edge mostly illuminated in white, with blue tails; the blue/white border indicates sunrise just after 6AM, and the white/blue border indicates sunset around 9PM."/></a>
