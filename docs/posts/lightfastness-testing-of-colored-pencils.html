                            <p>I love the yuba verde sandwich from <a href="https://www.superiorityburger.com/">superiority burger</a>. It’s the closest vegetarian approximation of deli meat I’ve had and also references a Philly Italian Pork Sandwich which is delicious and filled with broccoli rabe. I adapted this from my memory and also the intro paragraph to the <a href="https://bittmanproject.com/recipe/yuba-sandwich/">Bittman Project’s knock-off</a>, but I haven’t read that full recipe because it’s paywalled. My version adds cheese instead of a bean spread as well as mayo, so it’s def not vegan, but arguably more delicious. I’ve also used kale instead of broccoli rabe which is easier to eat in a sandwich, though I did miss its bitterness.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<p>For the vinaigrette / yuba marinade</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.5 cups olive oil</li>
  <li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
  <li>1/2 lemon juiced</li>
  <li>1 tbsp capers</li>
  <li>1/6-1/4 of a preserved lemon</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>2-3 tsp dijon mustard</li>
  <li>1 cup packed parsley</li>
  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>For the broccoli rabe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 bunch brocolli rabe</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>For the kale (if using instead of brocolli rabe):</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 bunch kale</li>
  <li>1-2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1/2 lemon</li>
  <li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>For the yuba:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hodofoods.com/product-details/organic-yuba-sheets">1 pack of yuba (5 oz)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For assembling the sandwich:</p>

<ul>
  <li>kewpie mayo</li>
  <li><a href="https://shop.cento.com/products/cento-diced-hot-cherry-pepper-hoagie-spread-12-fl-oz">cento hoagie spread</a></li>
  <li>1.5 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese.</li>
  <li>2 heros</li>
  <li>other optional goodies (sliced tomatoes, pickled carrots, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p><strong>Make the vinaigrette and marinade the yuba</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combine vinaigrette ingredients in a blender and pulse until its creamy and a nice light green color. Add salt and pepper, blend, and taste until it’s right.</li>
  <li>Pour a bit of vinaigrette in the bottom of a medium-size tupperware container. Separate the sheets of yuba and layer one sheet at a time pouring vinaigrette between each sheet like you were assembling a lasagna. Reserve the leftover vinaigrette.</li>
  <li>Let the yuba marinade in the fridge for at least an hour.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Make the broccoli rabe:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-heat the oven to 400-425</li>
  <li>toss the broccoli rabe with olive oil and salt and pepper</li>
  <li>bake for ~ 20 minutes. you might want to take the leaves out sooner or else they’ll burn.</li>
  <li>before assembling the sandwiches you might want to roughly chop the brocolli rabe so it’s easier to eat.</li>
  <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: you can save some time by baking the brocolli rabe with the yuba</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Make the kale (if using instead of broccoli rabe):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>cut out the kale stalks</li>
  <li>roll the kale up and cut it into thin strips</li>
  <li>dice the garlic and set aside</li>
  <li>heat the oil (on high) in a pan until it’s smoking</li>
  <li>add the kale and stir for about a minute until it changes color</li>
  <li>add the garlic and stir for 15-20 seconds</li>
  <li>squeeze the lemon juice over the kale and stir to incorporate</li>
  <li>turn off the heat and add salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>remove from the pan and set aside</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Make the yuba</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-heat the oven to 400-425</li>
  <li>lightly grease a baking sheet (you might need two) and lay the yuba out so no sheets are overlapping</li>
  <li>bake for ~10 minutes until the yuba starts to bubble up off the pan and turn light brown</li>
  <li>finish under a broiler on high until the yuba has some brown spots, but don’t let it burn! this step helps give the yuba the taste and texture of smoked meat</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toast the bread and melt the cheese</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lightly brush olive oil on each half of the heros</li>
  <li>cover the top half in grated cheese</li>
  <li>place in the oven for 3-4 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can save a bit of time by doing this while the yuba is browning under the broiler, but just put the bread on a lower rack.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assemble the sandwich</strong></p>

<p>This is only my suggestion. Assembling a sandwich is a personal journey:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the bottom half of the hero, lather mayo and hoagie spread.</li>
  <li>Stack up the yuba on top.</li>
  <li>Place the kale/broccoli rabe on top of the melted cheese</li>
  <li>Optionally add other goodies on top of the yuba (sliced tomatoes, spicy pickled cucumbers, whatever you like!)</li>
  <li>drizzle some of the vinaigrette marinade on top of the yuba and kale/broccoli rabe.</li>
  <li>put the two halves together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eat!</p>
