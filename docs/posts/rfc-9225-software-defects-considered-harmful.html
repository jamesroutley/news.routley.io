        This document discourages the practice of introducing software defects in general and in network protocol implementations specifically. 
        Software defects are one of the largest cost drivers for the networking industry.

 Software defects (informally known as &#34;bugs&#34;) have been the cause and effect of innumerable system degradations and failures over the years.
        Bugs are errors, flaws, or faults in a computer program that cause the program to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.<a href="#section-1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-2">
          (Please note: unexpected results caused by bugs are not a valid substitute for high-quality random number generators, though high-quality random number generators are generally not considered to be bugs.)<a href="#section-1-2">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3-1">
        In June 1996, the European Space Agency <span>[<a href="#ARIANE">ARIANE</a>]</span> launched an unmanned rocket -- costing several billion dollars in development -- only to see it go <span>[<a href="#KABOOM">KABOOM</a>]</span> 40 seconds after takeoff.
        A software exception had occurred during the execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value.
 The floating point number that was converted had a value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer.
 The vehicle probably would not have disintegrated if the defect had not been written into the software.<a href="#section-3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-2">
 As an example of the detrimental effects of bugs in physically hard to reach systems: the <span>[<a href="#NASA">NASA</a>]</span> Deep Impact spacecraft <span>[<a href="#DEEPIMPACT">DEEPIMPACT</a>]</span> was rendered inoperable due to a fault in the fault-protection software, which in turn triggered endless computer reboots.
 Mission control was unable to recover the system from this error condition because no engineers were available on-site.
 The commute was deemed infeasible due to a lack of reasonably priced commercial transport options in that region of the solar system.<a href="#section-3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-3">
        In 1983, the Soviet Union&#39;s Early Warning Satellite System <span>[<a href="#Serpukhov">Serpukhov</a>]</span> announced it had detected a possible missile launch originating in the US; fortunately, a human operator recognized this as a likely system failure.
        Indeed, a retrospective analysis suggested the software had misclassified reflections from cloud cover as missile launch blooms.
        With this bug, the software held the potential to trigger a cascading sequence of events that could&#39;ve led to the start of a planetary-scale war.
        Seemingly innocuous software defects can have outsized impact, and sometimes it pays off to simply do nothing and wait.<a href="#section-3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-4">
        The US Department of Commerce&#39;s National Institute of Standards and Technology <span>[<a href="#NIST">NIST</a>]</span> commissioned a study to develop a deeper understanding of the prevalence of software defects and their cost to society.
        The study estimated about 0.6 percent of the gross domestic product is squandered due to programming bugs.
        Each person works approximately one hour a week to compensate for this debt -- an hour that could&#39;ve been spent in leisure -- in addition to any time spent on the direct consequences of buggy software.<a href="#section-3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-5">
        The universal deployment of IP networks on <span><a href="#RFC1149">Avian Carriers</a> [<a href="#RFC1149">RFC1149</a>]</span> is facing a multi-decade delay.
        After operators discovered that birds are not real (now <span>[<a href="#confirmed">confirmed</a>]</span> by the US Government), work began to first understand the many <span>[<a href="#quirks">quirks</a>]</span> of the drones&#39; firmware before proceeding with wider-scale deployment.
        No clear timelines exist at this point in time.<a href="#section-3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-6">
        For more examples, consult the RISKS Digest <span>[<a href="#RISKS">RISKS</a>]</span>: it documents a multitude of examples of defects in technological infrastructure and their risk to society.
        Unsupervised study of the Digest archive may induce a sense of panic.<a href="#section-3-6">¶</a></p>

        With the production of fewer bugs, there will necessarily be fewer security impacts.
        To improve the collective security posture, a thorough review of ALL existing software to find any remaining bugs is <span>RECOMMENDED</span>.<a href="#section-5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-2">
        As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through all software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug free once a certain number of bugs have been found.<a href="#section-5-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-3">
        Some philosophers argue in defense of an obviously wrong contrary view that bugs introduce a certain amount of unpredictable variance in behaviour, which in turn could serve to increase security.
        Such heretics might even go one step further and celebrate the existence of bugs, shielding issues from public scrutiny.
        However, it <span>[<a href="#ostensibly">ostensibly</a>]</span> is in society&#39;s best interest to fully disclose any and all bugs as soon as they are discovered.<a href="#section-5-3">¶</a></p>

         The existence of this very document of course begs the question: what are software defects, truly?
         Do bugs happen for a purpose?
         Is what we perceive as the concept of bugs an indication for a wider issue in the natural world?
