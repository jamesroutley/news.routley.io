    <h1>Scientists have finally found the potential “cure” for baldness</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>A single chemical could be responsible for whether people go bald or not, a new study has found.</p><p>In the UK, approximately two thirds of men will face male pattern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/baldness">baldness</a>. The study says the discovery of the chemical could “not only treat baldness, but ultimately speed wound healing”.</p><p>Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that a sole chemical is responsible for hair follicles dividing and dying.</p><p>In the study published in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/07/25/chemical-controlling-life-and-death-hair-follicles"><em>Biophysical Journal</em></a>, study co-author Qixuan Wang said: “In science fiction when characters heal quickly from injuries, the idea is that stem cells allowed it.</p><p>“In real life, our new research gets us closer to understanding stem cell behavior, so that we can control it and promote wound healing.”</p><p>The team looked at hair follicles as these are the only human organ that regenerates regularly and automatically, and discovered that a type of protein called TGF-beta controls how the stem cells in hair follicles divide and why some can die off.</p><p>Wang explained: “TGF-beta has two opposite roles. It helps activate some hair follicle cells to produce new life, and later, it helps orchestrate apoptosis, the process of cell death.</p><p>“Even when a hair follicle kills itself, it never kills its stem cell reservoir. When the surviving stem cells receive the signal to regenerate, they divide, make new cell and develop into a new follicle.”</p><p>However, the scientists found that when a hair follicle dies, the stem cell reservoir still remains.</p><p>“When the surviving stem cells receive the signal to regenerate, they divide, make new cells and develop into a new follicle,” Wang said</p><interaction data-token="5bbe30dfc3ecd7c158342081"></interaction><p>The study authors added that it may be possible to stimulate hair growth by activating follicle stem cells, but more research on the subject needs to be done.</p></div></div>
