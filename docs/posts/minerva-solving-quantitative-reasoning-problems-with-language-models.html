<div><p>Note to self, day two of RC.</p>
<h2 id="do-you"><span>🧠</span> Do you <span>🧠</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>learn Elm so you can write your own todo-list application so you can get your life back on track?</li>
<li>learn C++ so you can write your own synthesizer because you want to make electronic music?</li>
<li>design your own programming language to create dynamic webpages because you want to write your own blog?</li>
<li>ultimately feel regret because you end up learning a lot, but never finish the thing you set out to actually do?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embrace-the-yolo"><span>🚨</span> Embrace the YOLO <span>🚨</span></h2>
<p><em>Close your eyes, pinch your nose, brace yourself!</em></p>
<p>Write the todo-list application in Javascript instead.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-yolo"><span>🌶</span> Embrace the YOLO <span>🌶</span></h2>
<p><em>Embrace mediocrity, expect failure, reject consequences!</em></p>
<p>Buy a squeaky toy and record weird noises with your phone. Add an echo effect, upload it to Youtube, and call yourself &#34;DJ Snoopy The Third&#34;.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-yolo"><span>🍕</span> Embrace the YOLO <span>🍕</span></h2>
<p><em>Do the easy thing, do it badly, do it again, just as badly!</em></p>
<p>Write HTML with notepad.exe, and who  needs Javascript when you have the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag?</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-yolo"><span>🥁</span> Embrace the YOLO <span>🥁</span></h2>
<p>Challenge others to do the thing you care about. Competition is prime motivation for getting things done. Noone wants to look weak.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-yolo"><span>🥊</span> Embrace the YOLO <span>🥊</span></h2>
<p>Do things with friends. Chances are they secretly want to embrace the YOLO too. Companionship catalyzes the YOLO.</p>
<h2 id="you-will"><span>🎁</span> You will <span>🎁</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>create memories that will last forever.</li>
<li>regret many things in the moment, but cherish them later on.</li>
<li>forget about your failures, but remember your wins.</li>
<li>treasure the friends you made along the way.</li>
</ul>
