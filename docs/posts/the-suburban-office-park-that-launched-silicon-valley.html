<!--more--><p>In the town of Palo Alto, California, tucked away between El Camino Real and Junipero Serra Boulevard, you’ll find the most influential office park in the world.</p>
<p>Glassy buildings rise from manicured green lawns. Towering evergreen trees conceal asphalt parking lots. Somewhere, there’s a volleyball court.</p>
<p>Although the landscape resembles the same focus-grouped blandness you’d find at any of the thousands of office parks spanning America’s suburbs, the logos in front of the buildings stand out: Tesla, Google, HP, Rivian. Facebook was here in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>The personalities who’ve worked at this office park are just as prominent. A turtleneck-wearing man who invented the iPhone rented space in the 1980s after Apple ousted him. A turtleneck-wearing woman ran her miracle blood-testing company here before she was outed as a fraud.</p>
<p>Welcome to Stanford Research Park. Designed in the early 1950s as one of America’s first suburban office parks, the ~700-acre development is home to 150 companies.</p>
<p>But Stanford Research Park isn’t merely the <em>setting</em> for the cutting-edge tech companies and innovators that hold sway over America’s economy. By some measures, it catalyzed the entire scene.</p>
<p>If not for this suburban office park, Silicon Valley might not exist.</p>
<h4>From apricots to microwave tubes</h4>
<p>In the late 1940s, as students poured in after World War II, Stanford University faced a classic American dilemma: It owned a bevy of land but was going broke.</p>
<p>About 60 years earlier, railroad tycoon <strong>Leland Stanford</strong> had founded the university on his stock farm in Palo Alto, a sparsely populated town in a region where apricot and peach trees outnumbered houses. Roughly one-third of the world’s prune supply <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sanjosevalleyorchards/posts/8257547491039488/"><span>came from the orchards</span></a> of Santa Clara County, which encompassed Palo Alto.</p>

<p><em>Santa Clara County orchards from the 1930s. (Postcard via </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sanjosevalleyorchards/posts/8257547491039488/?_rdr"><em><span>Facebook/Bob Emerson</span></em></a><em>)</em></p>
<p>When Stanford died in 1893, he bequeathed<strong> </strong>8k acres of land to the school, under the condition that the property could never be sold.</p>
<p>The vacant land, which was largely unsuitable for agriculture, became an albatross over the next few decades. Stanford’s endowment <a href="https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/v/1/agendas-minutes-reports/agendas-minutes/historic-resources-board/2017/id8184-srp-framework-doc-presentation.pdf"><span>sank in real dollars</span></a> from <strong>$18m</strong> in 1910 to <strong>$13m</strong> in 1950.</p>
<p>“The university,” recalled <strong>Alf Brandin</strong> in a Stanford oral history interview, “had a lot of problems.”</p>
<p>A former Stanford football star who became the school’s business manager, Brandin was invited to a party celebrating the one-year anniversary of Varian Associates in 1949.</p>
<p>Brothers <strong>Russell and Sigurd Varian</strong>, former Stanford students, had started the company in San Carlos, California, after developing klystron technology, a microwave tube that could be used for radar and televisions. At the party, Russell Varian told Brandin he wanted to move the company’s R&amp;D division closer to associates at Stanford.</p>
<p>“I thought,” Brandin said, “‘They’re leasing [in San Carlos]. Why don’t we try to take the hint and do something with some of our land?’”</p>
<p>Varian Associates signed a lease to build a $1m company headquarters on 9.5 acres of land to the southeast of campus in October 1951 and moved in two years later. Eastman Kodak signed a lease in 1952 to build a photo processing plant.</p>
<p>Spurred on by Varian Associates, Brandin started discussing an “industrial park” development totaling 138 acres. When he toured suburban Denver with a Stanford alum, he was struck by how a subdivision’s lack of fences accentuated rolling hills, lawns, and trees.</p>
<p>To him, it felt like a park, and he thought they should do the same with the budding industrial development at Stanford.</p>

<p><em>The Hustle</em></p>
<p>The idea for a suburban office park was novel at the time.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Bell Labs had opened a sprawling suburban campus in 1942, where scientists would invent the transistor, but that was a corporate headquarters rather than a site for multiple companies.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A suburban office park in Mountain Brook, Alabama, <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=83252"><span>is often cited</span></a> as the first in the US. But it was approved in 1955, after Varian Associates had moved onto Stanford land.</li>
</ul>
<p>The demand for these developments was apparent. America’s relentless march to the suburbs had begun, and corporations found downtowns crowded and grimy.</p>
<p>They wanted <a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/stuck-in-1950s-suburbia/"><span>to separate management</span></a> from their union laborers and to ply white collar workers with ample parking, verdant landscaping, and country club amenities, like tennis courts and walking trails — the modern predecessors of the ping-pong table.</p>
<p>These companies believed in a “purported magic of gazing at greenness,” wrote University of California, Berkeley landscape architecture professor <strong>Louise Mozingo</strong> in “Campus, Estate, and Park: Lawn Culture Comes to the Corporation. This magic was “credited with generating productivity, competitiveness, and public approbation.”</p>
<p>The question for Stanford was what type of companies the park should attract.   </p>
<h4>Steering tech companies to the park</h4>
<p>Brandin signed a variety of firms to leases after Varian Associates and Eastman Kodak. Soon, however, <strong>Frederick Terman</strong> pitched Brandin on the importance of tech companies, which were expanding <a href="http://www.couperus.org/Scrapbooks/Ginzton/Steeples.htm"><span>because of plentiful government funding</span></a>.</p>
<p>Terman was a Stanford engineering professor who became dean of Stanford’s engineering school in 1944. He’d taught the Varians, as well as students Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.</p>
<p>Rather than take jobs at existing technology companies when they graduated — many of which were located on the East Coast — he encouraged them and other graduates to start their own businesses. He <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/944702810/?match=1&amp;terms=%22silicon%20valley%22%20and%20%22stanford%20research%20park%22"><span>even provided</span></a> Hewlett and Packard with $500 of seed money.</p>

<p><em>Frederick Terman. (Wikimedia Commons)</em></p>
<p>As Varian Associates and Hewlett-Packard prospered, Terman recognized that the university and the tech firms could benefit from proximity, building off each other’s ideas and sharing resources and funding.</p>
<p>The center of the relationship could be the industrial park, which the school would eventually name Stanford Research Park.</p>
<p>“Alf Brandin saw the point very quickly and very soon thereafter, if you weren’t a high-technology company, you had a hell of a time coaxing him to give you a lease,” Terman <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/oral-history/catalog/sg324fk4242"><span>said in a Stanford oral history interview</span></a>.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and General Electric moved into Stanford Research Park. Terman also <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/679510376/?match=1&amp;terms=%22shockley%22%20and%20%22stanford%20research%20park%22"><span>convinced</span></a> Bell Labs’ <strong>William Shockley</strong>, who co-invented the transistor, to move to the Park (after his company was originally headquartered in Mountain View).</p>
<p>Many of these early companies signed 99-year prepaid leases that benefitted them and Stanford:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Stanford received an infusion of cash, getting as close as it legally could to selling the property, and reaped the benefits from land improvements made by the companies.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Companies like Varian Associates, which <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/OTL/documents/JSstanfordpark.pdf"><span>paid</span></a> <strong>$41k</strong> upfront for a 99-year lease of 10 acres ($516k today), were grandfathered into below market-rate deals as the office park grew, often paying a fraction of what newer lessees paid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terman also started an Honors Cooperative Program, granting enrollment to employees at the Research Park, so long as their companies fronted 2x the listed tuition price.</p>
<p>The program led to cross-pollination between the university, the companies, and their workers, who shared knowledge with their employers or started new companies in the region. Shockley alone <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/OTL/documents/JSstanfordpark.pdf"><span>was credited</span></a> with helping spawn 50 semiconductor firms.</p>
<p>By 1970, people began calling the area Silicon Valley, a name popularized by journalist and engineer Don Hoefler. And by 1980, the population of Santa Clara County had swelled to ~1.3m, up from ~290k in 1950.</p>

<p><em>The Hustle</em></p>
<p>Stanford Research Park was at the center of the growth. Out of the <strong>192k</strong> tech workers in Silicon Valley in the early ‘80s, roughly <strong>one of every eight</strong> worked at the park, from college graduates just starting out to luminaries like Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>“Why is Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley?” the Associated Press <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/944702810/?match=1&amp;terms=%22silicon%20valley%22%20and%20%22stanford%20research%20park%22"><span>wrote in 1984</span></a>. “Because, to a remarkable degree, of one man, Dr. Frederick Terman, and one university, Stanford.”</p>
<h4>The lasting influence of Stanford Research Park</h4>
<p>Around the country, as companies have returned to cities or promoted hybrid work schedules, many suburban office parks have gone the way of the drive-in movie theater and the mall.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Post-pandemic, vacancy rates at suburban office spaces <a href="https://www.cbre.com/insights/briefs/suburban-office-markets-recovering-faster-than-downtowns#:~:text=The%20current%20suburban%20vacancy%20rate%20is%2016.9%%2C,**Milwaukee**%20Vacancy%20down%20by%201.8%20percentage%20points"><span>ticked up</span></a> from ~13%-17%, and many office parks in areas like the New Jersey suburbs are being transitioned into retail and housing.  </li>
<li aria-level="1">In 2023, Bell Labs <a href="https://njmonthly.com/articles/news/the-end-of-new-jerseys-suburban-office-park/"><span>announced</span></a> it was leaving its historic corporate office park for a new campus in an urban setting, symbolizing the uncertain future of suburban office parks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stanford Research Park, however, has defied the doomsday trends.

<p>These parks have been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rise-of-innovation-districts/"><span>credited</span></a> with fostering so-called “strong ties” that lead to people and firms working together.</p>

<p>If anything its influence has perhaps been too significant.</p>
<p>Like many suburban office parks, Stanford Research Park hewed to a setting that emphasized exclusion, parking, and low-density buildings. It helped set the pattern for housing and office developments that followed.</p>
<p>Today, Palo Alto’s ratio of jobs to housing, a benchmark for measuring a healthy supply of homes, is more than 3x the US average and far higher than other cities in the area.</p>
<p><span>“The reason Palo Alto has the worst jobs-housing imbalance of any community around here is largely because of the Stanford Research Park,” former Mountain View mayor </span><strong><span>Lenny Siegel </span></strong><a href="https://revealnews.org/article/the-stanford-empire/"><span>told the news site </span><span><em><span>Reveal</span></em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Regardless, its status as a pioneering suburban office park — for better and worse — is clear.</p>
<p>As Varian Associates <a href="https://www.cpii.com/docs/files/varian%20associates%20-%20an%20early%20history.pdf">explained</a> in a company history, Stanford Research Park was “the most successful complex of its kind in the world.”</p></span></p>
