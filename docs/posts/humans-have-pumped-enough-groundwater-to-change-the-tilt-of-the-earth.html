<p>By pumping groundwater, humans have shifted the distribution of the water on Earth enough to alter the planet’s tilt, a new study finds.</p>
<p>Previous research <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044571">estimated</a> that, between 1993 to 2010, humans pumped more than 2 trillion tons of groundwater. That water flowed to cities and farms before emptying out to sea, raising global sea levels by around a quarter of an inch, the study suggested.</p>
<p>New research finds evidence of this shift in the changing position of the Earth’s rotational pole — the point around which the planet spins. Comparing a computer model of the rotational pole with observed changes in its position, scientists found that the pole’s recent drift could not be fully explained without the effect of groundwater pumping. </p>
<p>From 1993 to 2010, they determined, humans redistributed enough water to move the rotational pole roughly 31 inches. The <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103509">findings</a> were published in the journal <em>Geophysical Research Letters.</em></p>
<p>“I’m very glad to find the unexplained cause of the rotation pole drift,” Ki-Weon Seo, a geophysicist at Seoul National University and lead author of the study, said in a <a href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/weve-pumped-so-much-groundwater-that-weve-nudged-the-earths-spin">statement</a>. “On the other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I’m concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is another source of sea-level rise.”</p>
