However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/lutnick-says-trump-considering-some-mexico-canada-tariff-relief?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter">might “work something out” with Canada and Mexico</a>, adding that he could announce a potential compromise on Wednesday.</p></div></div></div>
