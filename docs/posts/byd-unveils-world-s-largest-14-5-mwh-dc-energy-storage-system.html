<p>BYD has unveiled a new DC energy storage system with the world’s largest single-unit capacity of 14.5 MWh, raising the bar in the rapidly evolving utility-scale storage market. The system, named “HaoHan,” was officially launched on September 18 at the International Digital Energy Expo in Shenzhen.</p>



<p>The company said HaoHan’s minimum unit capacity of 14. 5MWh is more than double the industry norm of 6–7 MWh. When configured within a standard 20-foot container, the system delivers 10 MWh and achieves a volumetric energy density of 233 kWh per cubic meter, a 51% increase on the industry average. For a 1 GWh storage plant, HaoHan would cut the number of required units by more than half, reduce land use by one-third, and trim cell count by 76%, according to the manufacturer.</p>



<p>At the heart of HaoHan is BYD’s self-developed 2,710 Ah Blade Battery cell, which the company claims is the largest energy storage cell in the world. This next-generation cell delivers three times the capacity of conventional storage batteries, boasts a cycle life of over 10,000 cycles, and reduces the total lifecycle cost per kilowatt-hour to below CNY 0.1 ($0.014) – a milestone that could reshape the economics of large-scale storage.</p>



<p>The system achieves a 52% volumetric cell-to-system (VCTS) efficiency, maximizing energy density through integrated cell-to-system design in an approcah which reduces redunat component. Designed for harsh environments from deserts to coastal regions, BYD says HaoHan lowers system failure rates and maintenance costs by 70%. Combined with its in-house power conversion system and energy management software, the unit can provide millisecond-level response and grid-forming capabilities at gigawatt scale.</p>



<p>BYD says HaoHan can cut project-level levelized costs (LCOS) by 21.7%. For a typical 1 GWh installation, total costs related to equipment procurement, transportation, and installation are expected to drop by around 30%. Target applications include grid balancing, renewable energy integration at solar and wind hubs, and backup power for commercial and residential users.</p>



<p>HaoHan also incorporates a blockchain-based carbon tracking system to monitor the product’s lifecycle footprint. BYD claims the system’s carbon impact is 18% lower than the industry average, a feature designed to support compliance with EU carbon border tariffs and other evolving environmental regulations.</p>



<p>The launch of HaoHan comes amid a growing wave of next-generation energy storage systems entering the market. Earlier this year, CATL introduced its <a href="https://www.ess-news.com/2025/05/07/catl-at-smarter-e-we-are-entering-the-era-of-9-mwh-systems/">9 MWh TENER Stack</a>, <a href="https://www.ess-news.com/2025/09/09/tesla-unveils-new-generation-of-utility-scale-batteries-megapack-3-and-megablock/">Tesla rolled out its 20 MWh Megablock – </a>a pre-engineered, medium-voltage AC utility-scale solution that combines four Megapack 3 units with an integrated megavolt transformer and switchgear, and Sungrow launched the <a href="https://www.ess-news.com/2025/06/10/sungrow-introduces-powertitan-3-0-bess-based-on-684-ah-cell-fully-liquid-cooled-silicon-carbide-pcs/">6.9 MWh PowerTitan 3.0</a>, optimised for hot climates. </p>



<p>BYD plans to deploy the HaoHan system across multiple gigawatt-scale projects by the end of 2025, including a landmark 12.5 GWh installation in Saudi Arabia. The company is also accelerating its global expansion, targeting key markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, BYD’s technology roadmap includes the integration of liquid cooling, predictive maintenance, and hybrid solar-hydrogen-storage systems. These innovations are aimed at pushing overall system efficiency beyond 95% by 2026, further cementing the company’s position in the next generation of utility-scale energy storage solutions.</p>

<p>In addition, BYD has launched its new GC Flux grid-forming inverter solution, which covers the 2.5–10 MW capacity range.</p>



<p>According to BYD, the inverter boasts a performance level approximately 38% higher than common industry standards and a maximum power density of 1,474 kW/㎡, which is around 130% above typical values in today’s market. The system provides an overload capacity of up to 3x for 10 seconds and reaches a peak efficiency of 99.35%.</p>



<p>Beyond raw performance, the GC Flux PCS features advanced grid-forming capabilities, making it ideal for modern grid applications. It supports active inertia response up to 25 seconds, wide-band damping across 1–1500 Hz, and ultra-fast voltage and frequency regulation in under 100 milliseconds. These functions are critical for ensuring system stability, especially in hybrid or renewable-heavy networks that require seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded modes.</p>



<p>Complementing the GC Flux PCS and BYD’s high-density HaoHan BESS, the company also introduced its new energy management system: GC Master EMS. Described as the “system brain”, the platform is tailored for intelligent scheduling and control of ultra-large-scale storage projects.</p>



<p>The manufacturer said that GC Master EMS supports integration of up to 10 million data points, roughly 25% above common industry benchmarks. In addition, it offers single-station capacity management of up to 15 GWh, a figure that represents a 400% increase in computing power compared to conventional EMS platforms. </p>
