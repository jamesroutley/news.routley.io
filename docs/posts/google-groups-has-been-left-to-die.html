        <p>An unusual topic for this blog, but worth boosting to a larger audience: Google Groups is dying.
Its epitaph is not yet inscribed on the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a> website, but the end is easily seen from here (although it should also be noted its death was called as early as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9y9qg/google_groups_is_dead_killed_by_spam/">13 years ago</a>).
The deficiencies in Google Groups search, supposedly Google’s forte, have long been noted.
Lately though basic features have just stopped working.</p>
<p>Why care?
Google Groups is, for whatever reason, the de-facto standard community website in the formal methods community.
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tlaplus">TLA⁺</a> uses it, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/prismmodelchecker">PRISM</a> uses it, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/smt-lib">SMT-LIB</a> uses it, and a number of other tools I could find at least have presences on the platform.
These communities take time to build: their value resides in the number of people who think of them first whenever they want to ask a question or just talk about these tools.
Many websites link to these groups or to specific answers.</p>
<p>What’s broken?
Beyond search’s perpetual brokenness, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tlaplus/c/JGkgE2ul8Qk">Monospace fonts have just stopped rendering</a>.
This makes code samples significantly more difficult to read.
The read/unread indicator is janky, marking threads you’ve visited and even your own posts &amp; replies as unread by you.
Then (precipitating this post) messages or replies submitted to the group have started intermittently just self-deleting (<a href="https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/796">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/tlaplus/CommunityModules/issues/88">2</a>).
Not in a graceful way, either: the post will successfully be submitted, but then all that will show up is a deleted message.
Hope you didn’t spend twenty minutes typing a thorough, detailed response!
My attempt to submit a link to this very post also deleted itself.</p>
<p>It’s clear we ran afoul of the old lesson: don’t build communities for long-lasting FOSS projects on proprietary infrastructure you don’t control.
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/12/28/Dont-use-Discord-for-FOSS.html">We should not use Discord</a>.
So what should we use?
I think modern online FOSS communities require four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A group chatroom for low-stakes pseudo-realtime discussion</li>
<li>A mailing list or forum for announcements &amp; effortful discussions requiring multi-paragraph posts &amp; responses; this should have an optional email interface</li>
<li>A Q&amp;A website similar to StackOverflow where the correct answer can be marked and elevated instead of staying buried in a long discussion</li>
<li>Easy search function for all of the above, without having to create an account</li>
</ol>
<p>The Alloy formal specification language is ahead of the game here: they’ve set up <a href="https://alloytools.discourse.group/">their community site</a> on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, a FOSS project ticking all of those feature boxes.
<a href="https://coq.discourse.group/">Coq</a> has also moved to Discourse.
However, this doesn’t have to be a one-stop shop!
One can imagine a Matrix, Mattermost or Zulip chat room in addition to an actual old-school mailing list or FluxBB forum.
The latter don’t have specific Q&amp;A functionality, but FluxBB at least seems to work for <a href="https://spinroot.com/fluxbb/">the SPIN model checker</a> (and - not formal methods but very successful - <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>).
<a href="https://coq.zulipchat.com/">Coq</a>, <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean</a>, and <a href="https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/">Isabelle</a> use Zulip.
TLA⁺ had <a href="http://talk.tlapl.us/">a Mattermost instance</a> at one point but that seems to have died.
It’s also tempting to use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> since all these projects are developed on GitHub anyway, but I think this tendency should be resisted.
GitHub is wonderful now but fundamentally proprietary, same as Google Groups, and FOSS software forges like <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut</a> are making great progress.
Moving development to FOSS software forges might happen within the next decade and it will be easier if the non-development community isn’t also scattered in the process.</p>
<p>This experience has been instructive for me.
Once you start thinking on timescales of 5-10 years, communities built on proprietary software just don’t pass muster.
Certainly self-hosted FOSS communities can die, but these are functions of community activity itself rather than the service they’re hosted on.</p>
