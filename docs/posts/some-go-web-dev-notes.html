    <h1>Some Go web dev notes</h1>
    
    

<p>I spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks working on a website in Go
that may or may not ever see the light of day, but I learned a couple of things
along the way I wanted to write down. Here they are:</p>

<h3 id="go-1-22-now-has-better-routing">go 1.22 now has better routing</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt motivated to learn any of the Go routing libraries
(gorilla/mux, chi, etc), so I&rsquo;ve been doing all my routing by hand, like this.</p>

<pre><code>	// DELETE /records:
	case r.Method == &quot;DELETE&quot; &amp;&amp; n == 1 &amp;&amp; p[0] == &quot;records&quot;:
		if !requireLogin(username, r.URL.Path, r, w) {
			return
		}
		deleteAllRecords(ctx, username, rs, w, r)
	// POST /records/&lt;ID&gt;
	case r.Method == &quot;POST&quot; &amp;&amp; n == 2 &amp;&amp; p[0] == &quot;records&quot; &amp;&amp; len(p[1]) &gt; 0:
		if !requireLogin(username, r.URL.Path, r, w) {
			return
		}
		updateRecord(ctx, username, p[1], rs, w, r)

</code></pre>

<p>But apparently <a href="https://go.dev/blog/routing-enhancements">as of Go 1.22</a>, Go
now has better support for routing in the standard library, so that code can be
rewritten something like this:</p>

<pre><code>	mux.HandleFunc(&quot;DELETE /records/&quot;, app.deleteAllRecords)
	mux.HandleFunc(&quot;POST /records/{record_id}&quot;, app.updateRecord)
</code></pre>

<p>Though it would also need a login middleware, so maybe something more like
this, with a <code>requireLogin</code> middleware.</p>

<pre><code>	mux.Handle(&quot;DELETE /records/&quot;, requireLogin(http.HandlerFunc(app.deleteAllRecords)))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-gotcha-with-the-built-in-router-redirects-with-trailing-slashes">a gotcha with the built-in router: redirects with trailing slashes</h3>

<p>One annoying gotcha I ran into was: if I make a route for <code>/records/</code>, then a
request for <code>/records</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#hdr-Trailing_slash_redirection-ServeMux">will be redirected</a> to <code>/records/</code>.</p>

<p>I ran into an issue with this where sending a POST request to <code>/records</code>
redirected to a GET request for <code>/records/</code>, which broke the POST request
because it removed the request body. Thankfully <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/go-servemux-slash-2021-11-04/">Xe Iaso wrote a blog post about the exact same issue</a> which made it
easier to debug.</p>

<p>I think the solution to this is just to use API endpoints like <code>POST /records</code>
instead of <code>POST /records/</code>, which seems like a more normal design anyway.</p>

<h3 id="sqlc-automatically-generates-code-for-my-db-queries">sqlc automatically generates code for my db queries</h3>

<p>I got a little bit tired of writing so much boilerplate for my SQL queries, but
I didn&rsquo;t really feel like learning an ORM, because I know what SQL queries I
want to write, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like learning the ORM&rsquo;s conventions for
translating things into SQL queries.</p>

<p>But then I found <a href="https://sqlc.dev/">sqlc</a>, which will compile a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>
-- name: GetVariant :one
SELECT *
FROM variants
WHERE id = ?;

</code></pre>

<p>into Go code like this:</p>

<pre><code>const getVariant = `-- name: GetVariant :one
SELECT id, created_at, updated_at, disabled, product_name, variant_name
FROM variants
WHERE id = ?
`

func (q *Queries) GetVariant(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Variant, error) {
	row := q.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, getVariant, id)
	var i Variant
	err := row.Scan(
		&amp;i.ID,
		&amp;i.CreatedAt,
		&amp;i.UpdatedAt,
		&amp;i.Disabled,
		&amp;i.ProductName,
		&amp;i.VariantName,
	)
	return i, err
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I like about this is that if I&rsquo;m ever unsure about what Go code to write
for a given SQL query, I can just write the query I want, read the generated
function and it&rsquo;ll tell me exactly what to do to call it. It feels much easier
to me than trying to dig through the ORM&rsquo;s documentation to figure out how to
construct the SQL query I want.</p>

<p>Reading <a href="https://brandur.org/fragments/sqlc-2024">Brandur&rsquo;s sqlc notes from 2024</a> also gave me some confidence
that this is a workable path for my tiny programs. That post gives a really
helpful example of how to conditionally update fields in a table using CASE
statements (for example if you have a table with 20 columns and you only want
to update 3 of them).</p>

<h3 id="sqlite-tips">sqlite tips</h3>

<p>Someone on Mastodon linked me to this post called <a href="https://kerkour.com/sqlite-for-servers">Optimizing sqlite for servers</a>. My projects are small and I&rsquo;m
not so concerned about performance, but my main takeaways were:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a dedicated object for <strong>writing</strong> to the database, and run
<code>db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)</code> on it. I learned the hard way that if I don&rsquo;t do this
then I&rsquo;ll get <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> errors from two threads trying to write to the db
at the same time.</li>
<li>if I want to make reads faster, I could have 2 separate db objects, one for writing and one for reading</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a more tips in that post that seem useful (like &ldquo;COUNT queries are
slow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use STRICT tables&rdquo;), but I haven&rsquo;t done those yet.</p>

<p>Also sometimes if I have two tables where I know I&rsquo;ll never need to do a <code>JOIN</code>
beteween them, I&rsquo;ll just put them in separate databases so that I can connect
to them independently.</p>

<h3 id="go-1-19-introduced-a-way-to-set-a-gc-memory-limit">Go 1.19 introduced a way to set a GC memory limit</h3>

<p>I run all of my Go projects in VMs with relatively little memory, like 256MB or
512MB. I ran into an issue where my application kept getting OOM killed and it
was confusing &ndash; did I have a memory leak? What?</p>

<p>After some Googling, I realized that maybe I didn&rsquo;t have a memory leak, maybe I
just needed to reconfigure the garbage collector! It turns out that by default (according to <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide">A Guide to the Go Garbage Collector</a>), Go&rsquo;s garbage collector will
let the application allocate memory up to <strong>2x</strong> the current heap size.</p>

<p><a href="https://messwithdns.net">Mess With DNS</a>&rsquo;s base heap size is around 170MB and
the amount of memory free on the VM is around 160MB right now, so if its memory
doubled, it&rsquo;ll get OOM killed.</p>

<p>In Go 1.19, they added a way to tell Go &ldquo;hey, if the application starts using
this much memory, run a GC&rdquo;. So I set the GC memory limit to 250MB and it seems
to have resulted in the application getting OOM killed less often:</p>

<pre><code>export GOMEMLIMIT=250MiB
</code></pre>

<h3 id="some-reasons-i-like-making-websites-in-go">some reasons I like making websites in Go</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making tiny websites (like the <a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com/">nginx playground</a>) in Go on and off for the last 4 years or so and it&rsquo;s really been working for me. I think I like it because:</p>

<ul>
<li>there&rsquo;s just 1 static binary, all I need to do to deploy it is copy the binary</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s a built-in webserver that&rsquo;s okay to use in production, so I don&rsquo;t need to configure WSGI or whatever to get it to work</li>
<li>Go&rsquo;s toolchain is very easy to install, I can just do <code>apt-get install golang-go</code> or whatever and then a <code>go build</code> will build my project</li>
<li>it feels like there&rsquo;s very little to remember to start sending HTTP responses
&ndash; basically all there is are functions like <code>Serve(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</code> which read the request and send a response. If I need to
remember some detail of how exactly that&rsquo;s accomplished, I just have to read
the function!</li>
<li>also <code>net/http</code> is in the standard library, so you can start making websites
without installing any libraries at all. I really appreciate this one.</li>
<li>Go is a pretty systems-y language, so if I need to run an <code>ioctl</code> or
something that&rsquo;s easy to do</li>
</ul>

<p>In general everything about it feels like it makes projects easy to work on for
5 days, abandon for 2 years, and then get back into writing code without a lot
of problems.</p>

<p>For contrast, I&rsquo;ve tried to learn Rails a couple of times and I really <em>want</em>
to love Rails &ndash; I&rsquo;ve made a couple of toy websites in Rails and it&rsquo;s always
felt like a really magical experience. But ultimately when I come back to those
projects I can&rsquo;t remember how anything works and I just end up giving up. It
feels easier to me to come back to my Go projects that are full of a lot of
repetitive boilerplate, because at least I can read the code and figure out how
it works.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-cool-to-see-the-new-features-go-has-been-adding">it&rsquo;s cool to see the new features Go has been adding</h3>

<p>Both of the Go features I mentioned in this post (<code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> and the routing)
are new in the last couple of years and I didn&rsquo;t notice when they came out. It
makes me think I should pay closer attention to the release notes for new Go
versions.</p>
