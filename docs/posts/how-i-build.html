    <h1>How I Build</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>My idea of a vacation might be weird to some. Sure, I like sunshine, I like beaches – but more than all that, I like making stuff with computers.</p>

<p>So I spent my last trip to the west coast scratching my own itches, writing the little dream features and requests that have been floating around in my head for months.</p>

<p>I didn’t want the stress of shipping anything while on vacation, so after I got back I released one of those features per day. I called it “The Week of Sensory Experiments” because of this cool art,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2021/sensory-experiences.png"/></p>

<p>That week included <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1470416583713599493">card resizing</a>, an updated <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1470793814499598344">image picker</a>, space <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1471157556076756999">embeds</a>, improved <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1471487579094671361">card overlaps</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1471854615436185609">multi-connect</a>,</p>

<p>People seemed to really like the busy week, I should do this more often…</p>



<p>My biggest source of ideas is people’s problems or requests on the <a href="http://club.kinopio.club">forums</a>, on <a href="https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8">discord</a>, or IRL. These take the form of either:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>“I need X”</code>, which is straight-forward and just a matter of priority</li>
  <li><code>”I want to do Y”</code>, which doesn’t make sense initially, but finding out the <em>why</em> behind the request leads to something new</li>
  <li><code>”I wish I could do Z”</code>, sometimes I wish I could do Z too, but I need to swirl the idea around in the back of my brain for a couple months before I figure out how to build it in a way that’s performant and works with the Kinopio interface</li>
</ol>



<p>Equally important are my own dreams – Kinopio is nowhere near complete in my eyes. Maybe it won’t ever be.</p>

<p>So I continually ask myself:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>”How can spaces be more expressive?”</code>, more personal, and more fun to use. My goal is for the tool to feel like an extension of your mind</li>
  <li><code>”How can the tool be more usable?”</code>, the more reasons people have to use Kinopio, the more reasons they have to share and invite others to their spaces</li>
</ol>

<p>I benefit from these in my own spaces. Especially in <a href="https://kinopio.club/-life-tasks-Y1X79OS5gRjU5x7buJfhB">Life Tasks</a>, where I figure out what I’m doing next, and jot down errands and random ideas and observations,</p>

<p>In 2014, <a href="http://pketh.org/dual-wielding.html">I wrote</a> about my belief that design and engineering are best when tigthly woven together. That’s truer now than ever.</p>

<p>If I’m feeling confident, I’ll jump right into my text editor and write something like this to create a new controls,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>button</span><span>-</span><span>wrap</span>
  <span>button</span><span>(@</span><span>click</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>toggleIsVisible</span><span>&#34;</span><span>)</span>
    <span>span</span> <span>Say</span> <span>Hello</span>
  <span>dialog</span><span>.</span><span>narrow</span><span>(:</span><span>open</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>isVisible</span><span>&#34;</span><span>)</span>
    <span>p</span> <span>yolo</span> <span>friends</span> <span>🛶</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here, more functionality is added and the code is tweaked until the feature looks and feels right to me. Whether it’s something simple like this, or prototyping a new interaction like multi-connect, there’s no substitute for designing with real code.</p>

<p>In rare cases when I have ideas or plans that I’m less confident about, it’s time to break out the paper, pens, and markers,</p>

<p>Because the Kinopio interface elements and aesthetic are full-grown, I almost never use traditional design software anymore.</p>



<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2021/palms.jpeg"/></p>

<p>I keep the review and release process simple – commits are linted, PRs are code-reviewed, branch merges auto-deploy to production.</p>

<p>While coding, I create a list of interactions to manually QA test afterwards. If the change is risky or risqué, I’ll release sneak-peek videos for feedback, and ask beta testers to try it out in a staging environment beforehand.</p>



<p>Everything I know about marketing I learned by osmosis in previous jobs. Most software marketing messages are variations on a theme,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We exist! We can help! We’re really popular! Trust us!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a new feature is shipped, I post and <a href="https://twitter.com/kinopioclub">tweet</a> about it. With practice, weaving marketing into design and development is starting to feel like a natural part of the cycle.</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of articles with silver bullets like how to double your audience with one cool trick™. But once you strip away the artifice and wipe off the sludge, marketing is just communication – and the best communication informs, inspires, and entertains.</p>

<p>In the case of Kinopio, I hope to convey,</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>Function</code>, how Kinopio helps you make sense of information in a more engaging way</li>
  <li><code>Beauty</code>, create expressive and interesting spaces that you’ll want to share</li>
  <li><code>Aspiration</code>, using Kinopio helps you turn your problems into solutions, and your ideas into actions</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a long road to travel. Like the Oregon Trail, but instead of losing people to dysentery, new friends are jumping on the caravan everyday.</p>
