<p>I think the most common misconception about SQLite which drives people away from that database is that it&#39;s a <em>single connection database</em>. This is not only confusing (what kind of connection is meant here?), but it&#39;s wrong in many aspects.</p>
<h2 id="read-operations">Read Operations</h2><p>SQLite supports and works perfectly well with multiple concurrent reads. That&#39;s it.</p>
<h2 id="write-operations">Write Operations</h2><p>The SQLite DB engine uses a write lock at the DB level, so only one &#34;connection&#34; can write at a time. Usually, this is not a problem because you can begin an <code>IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION</code> where SQLite will be able to queue this query to retry acquiring the write lock later.</p>
