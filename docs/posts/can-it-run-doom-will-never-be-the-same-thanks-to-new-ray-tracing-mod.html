<p>Since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/quake-ii-gets-free-real-time-raytracing-updates-june-6/"><em>Quake II RTX</em></a> in 2019, fans have kept their eyes peeled for similar ray- and path-tracing updates for other classic &#39;90s shooters. It&#39;s fertile upgrade territory, since modern machines push vanilla versions of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em> to over 1,000 fps by default—that&#39;s wiggle room for computationally expensive lighting techniques—but those games&#39;s official handlers haven&#39;t really moved the ray-tracing needle.</p>
<p>Instead, Friday&#39;s good news comes from the <em>Doom</em> community: The first three episodes of <em>Doom 1</em> (1993) can now be played with top-to-bottom ray tracing enabled. Yes, I know, I see the date at the top of this article, but I swear: I installed and tested <em>Doom</em> within <a href="https://github.com/sultim-t/prboom-plus-rt/releases">the new PRBoom+RT engine</a>, and the results have not only looked quite good but felt surprisingly performative.</p>

<p>That is helped in large part by native support within the new engine for both Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/linux-gamers-to-get-nvidia-dlss-on-some-proton-games/">DLSS</a> and AMD <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/amd-announces-fsr-upscaling-2-0-promises-big-hardware-agnostic-gains/">FSR</a>. While you wouldn&#39;t need either to run vanilla <em>Doom</em>, both of these upscaling systems help in a ray tracing update because they also shrink the base resolution of so many realistically rendered light bounces. The upscaling toggle makes a big performance difference: On my default testing rig (RTX 3080 Ti, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X overclocked), the &#34;DLSS quality&#34; toggle at 2160p resolution increases ray-tracing performance nearly 100 percent compared to a raw 2160p signal, from 33 fps to 61 fps in E1M1. You can scrape even more frames by playing around with lower-resolution DLSS and FSR settings.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Interestingly, DLSS by default hinges on games having temporal anti-aliasing built in, which means this new, patched version of PRBoom+ may have received a TAA pass just to make <em>Doom</em>&#39;s RT mode work on systems with less than the highest-end specs. (This is the kind of overkill, fan-built touch we love at Ars Technica.)</p>

                      Should you feel like things are too dim, press F to turn a head-mounted flashlight on. (No need to give up either of your weapon-holding hands for this one.)                    </p>

<p>At its best, PRBoom+RT makes the original game look and feel like <em>Doom 3</em>, as previously dim hallways are reborn with the dramatic sense that darkness can loom around any corner. Like <em>Doom 3</em>, this mod includes a &#34;press F for flashlight&#34; keyboard option at any time, and I found that I needed that help in a few moments so far in my testing. Otherwise, in great news, mod creator Sultim Tsyrendashiev has mostly balanced the revamped moody lighting with playability in mind so that pitch-black hallways are the exception, not the rule.</p>
