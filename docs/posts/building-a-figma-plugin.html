    <h1>Building a Figma Plugin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I first used Figma Design I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive the design software was. I was also thrilled by Figjam for how much fun it was to collaborative people visually. It reminded me of drawing with friends as a kid. I’ve used both programs for a wild range of projects over the years for all sorts of things, including:</p>

<p>So I can attest to the power of the base features of Figma. The cool thing is, it doesn’t stop there. Figma can be manipulated using code, and it can be extended with plugins and widgets.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethhwalker/">Seth Walker<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> told me that he was building a Figma plugin, I was excited because I wondered how far Figma could be pushed - what kind of experimentation would the Figma developer experience support? This article is ultimately about a plugin I created to be used within Figjam. But it’s also about how extensible software that can be changed by the user is better than static software, that can only be changed by the original developers.</p>
<p>I would like to start by talking about plugins.</p>

<p>Both Figma programs are sophisticated but powerful. Their cuteness hides their extensibility. Here’s a video of me exploring a couple out of the 3000 plugins available:</p>

There&#39;s something about plugins that change software. I read an article the other day about [Dynamic Documents as Personal Software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/)that described how software is often rigid, designed to do a single purpose. This article goes into depth about a particle type of software called Potluck designed as a response to this rigidity. That program isn&#39;t really relevant here, and has some pretty major shortcomings as a response to the issues being observed with traditional note-taking software. That said, the writers seemed to have captured a truth:
<blockquote>
<p>“How might we reorient computing so that people can deeply tailor software to meet their unique needs?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Inkandswitch.com</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote highlights to me an inherent absurdity in parts of the modern software development process. In my opinion, the tenets of the human centered design process - empathize, brainstorm, prototype, test - are the beating heart of successful design. But peoples needs are different, changing change, and not always understood even by the people themselves. That’s why I believe that even the observant, empirical approach of human centered design <em>still</em> isn’t adequate to create the best solutions.</p>
<p>Queue extensibility in software. If you are making a text editor, start by making a platform that meets the basic needs of most people. Then, introduce a mechanism that allows it to be tweaked <em>by the user</em> to allow the program to be retrofitted the rest of the distance.</p>
<p>Maybe the original version of extensibility is the “settings” panel, where parts of the basic configuration of a program can be tweaked according to options:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/27570222bf653818b6a73b1d80774da1.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>But the configurations available in an app’s settings are rarely foundational to the functionality of the app itself. A text editor still edits text, a video editor still edits video in much the same way.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/db0a6e199d1174cbcd8af9d44ca4d7b6.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Users of the <code>configuration panel</code> are beholden to a discrete set of options afforded to them by a developer. In any case, that’s why I tend to think of applications with a plugin ecosystem as having a fundamentally different ethos than those without. I tend to trust their approach more.</p>

<p>I love all of these comments. To me, these are clearly created after observing actually developers interacting with the documentation and attempting to make things.</p>
<p>You can easily generate this code and get started by following <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/">the quickstart guide<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, which essentially tells you to right click in Design or FigJam and select <code>Plugins &gt; Development &gt; New Plugin</code>.</p>
<p>Figma recommends you build in typescript, just because you interact with many Figma types. Make sure you build your typescript into javascript, and then run your plugin by selecting it in the <code>development</code> menu we just used. If it was the last one run, you can also use the hotkey <code>option + command + p</code> (on mac) to run it again without having to navigate through the menu.</p>
<p>Here is the full code for a plugin I built that allow you to navigate a tiny box around and “drop” square colors different places!</p>

<p>I based the colors off of this photo of my brother carrying my board back for me after I almost drowned during a surfing trip.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/5aac1fe4768630e18f0a8cd03de5abbf.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The idea is that you have this <em>box</em>.
The box can be moved with the WASD keys.
It can also be cycled through a few different colors using the 1234567 keys.
UHJK keys can be used to place a new box of the current color to the top, left, bottom or right of it, but most usefully,</p>
<p>N will place a new box of the current color at the same location as the current box.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of me playing around with it on top of the photo the colors are based on:</p>

<p>And here’s a little dude I made:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/9c1d1e8d1414533f7fa5b742de1f7f8c.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>This is the process of making said lil’ dude:</p>


<ul>
<li>When the box zooms out of the screen, focus the view on the box. I know this is very doable because the example plugin Figma provides does this</li>
<li>Make sure the <em>moving</em> box that is used like a sort of cursor has a higher z-index than the boxes it makes, so it never gets <em>lost</em> underneath those boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figma Design and Figjam are design programs. However, they extend enough functionality in plugins to…be a game engine. Because Figma is build on Rust and Web Assembly, this may be a computationally more performant way to build games than with straight-up JavaScript in the browser.</p>
<p>This is user-driven software; something with a sensible range of flexible and intuitive tools right out of the box that cover a variety of the most common uses cases. In the case of FigJam, that might mean brainstorming with sticky notes. For Figma Design, it means making UIs.</p>
<p>But what’s cool here is that Figma doesn’t necessarily decide on exactly what the user is going to use their product for. They step back a bit, and they try their hardest to understand their user and her needs, but acknowledge that the user will <em>always</em> be able to discover those needs than the PMs, the Designers, and especially the engineers. So they allow users to be all of those things if they so desire.</p>
<p>I think a lot of beauty comes from this situation. It’s amazing to see what people create. In VS Code, Obsidian, Figma, the plugin ecosystem is really what makes the experience vibrant and flexible enough that it seems like these products will stick around for a long time.</p>
<p>It <em>also</em> allows the base principles of the software go farther than they would otherwise if the program had to be the same for everyone.</p>
<p>Obsidian is a fantastic example because it has a really motivated and generous community of tinkerers constantly extending it’s functionality. I think that note apps <em>famously</em> fail to be “one-size fits all”. Even for Obsidian, this is not true.</p>
<p>An app like Evernote that tries to fix this problem by doing everything ends up being bloated, intimidating, overwhelming; cluttered. Photoshop is a similar example. Blender may fall victim to this, except somehow it is so well designed that it somehow manages to still do many things excellently. This may be because it is open sourced, allowing it to respond to the needs of users better than any proprietary software - just a theory.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, hopping back to the notes example, Apple Notes, Google Keep, and SimpleNote all do a few things incredibly well. Yet each one misses something important.</p>
<p>Google keep staight-up doesn’t allow for some obvious rich text like indentation, or headers of any kind. Apply Notes really allows for <em>too</em> many types of headers in my opinion. Simplenote is a nice step in between, but oddly doesn’t have bold, or italics, which is I suppose a symptom of trying their best to keep features sparse. It’s a noble attempt, but invariably will leave many users or use cases in the dust because it’s simply not flexible enough to cater to everyone.</p>
<p>And so as a software developer you get to thinking hey, I can make things. I’ll just make my own perfect app.</p>
<p>But what you find when you try to create your own blogging framework, or note taking app, or game engine, or javascript framework, is that you find you are mostly just solving really difficult problems that have already been solved by someone else and never quite getting to the part where you get to make the perfect software and actually appreciate it. Because you aren’t.</p>
<p>And that’s where extensible, flexible, dynamic software comes in again and saves the day. They say hey, here’s a great starting place. And they make it exactly what they need.</p></article></div>
