    <h1>Building a Figma Plugin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/29178ba0abbb6d8abab489ff1d8603f0.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>This article is about my experience building a Figma plugin. Making the plugin was surprisingly easy and rich with creative potential. This article is also an opportunity for me to share my thoughts on the importance of extensible software, and what it means for software to be <code>dynamic</code> and <code>user defined</code>. Although I find extensibility - it’s importance, and how to achieve it - a fascinating subject, I discovered that I need to do a lot more research before I can effectively describe my <em>own</em> experiences with this dimension of software.</p>
<p>But I do know that Figma fits into this experience. When I first used Figma (Design), I was surprised at how intuitive it was to learn.  Later, when opening up Figma’s whiteboarding program, FigJam, I was amazed at how <em>fun</em> it was. I would urge my colleagues to hop into a whiteboard with me, and I would look forward to presenting my cloud architecture suggestions.</p>
<p>As someone who has been drawing my whole life, I felt at home on a blank expanse of canvas in a way I never had in digital “document”. On a more social level, it was also really interesting to see people interact in 3D space, and watch my colleagues play around with shapes in real time. It was the closest I’ve gotten to playing videogames at work. By playing the exception, it has  also served as a sort of reminder of how much computers often isolate us.</p>

<p>There was a time in college when I carried a small, thin notebook everywhere. I would doodle in it to pass the time, and I would use to create my todos for the the day, referencing it frequently when I was waiting in line, or had a few spare moments. Sometimes referencing todos turned into a more reflective process, where I would write out details for an art project, or things I wanted to tell a friend.</p>
<p>What I found was that people would stop and ask me what I was doing <em>all the time</em>. In line for food, on benches, in public transit. It was constant. People seemed to be both interested enough <em>and</em> unconcerned enough about crossing any sort of assumed privacy boundary that they would start up conversations all the time.</p>
<p>And I loved it. It was very refreshing. Especially because I would often enjoy sharing these short snippets of my life, my day, and my psyche. I rarely wrote anything too personal in those notebook - more tasks and ideas.</p>
<p>It was so obvious to contrast this to writing notes in a phone that I quickly realized that this <em>never</em> happened when using a phone to do the exact same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve used FigJam in particular for a wide range of personal projects, including:</p>

<p>So I can attest to the power of the base features of Figma as a way to fluidly explore ideas. Like many modern applications, Figma can be extended with plugins. In order to be available from within the app, each plugin most go through a review process. But they can still be developed locally without that being necessary.</p>
<p>My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethhwalker/">Seth Walker<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> told me that he was building a Figma plugin, I was interested what that process would be like. I have built a very simple <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-linker/fladjmflhfeobmajeaokkemcgonajjkp">Chrome Extension<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>before, as well as an Obsidian Plugin, and in both cases I felt that the development experience taught me a lot about the internal workings of the parent software. In a very real way, plugins allow users to participate in the building process of software. Because I appreciate Figma software, I was curious how it worked.</p>

<p>I want to provide a quick primer to Figma plugins if you haven’t seen them. Here’s a video of me exploring a couple out of the 3000 plugins available:</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think that many of the plugins that exist in Figma are too niche, or marketing ploys or experiments, or are too silly to really be useful. I’m not sure why this is. But despite this, the potential availability of the perfect plugin is reassuring, and tends to make me trust Figma more because it means the creators are invested in extensibility.</p>
<p>I read an article the other day about <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/">Dynamic Documents as Personal Software<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>that described how software is often rigid, designed to do a single purpose. I feel the writers captured a very important truth when they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How might we reorient computing so that people can deeply tailor software to meet their unique needs?”</p>
<p>Inkandswitch.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors of this article contrast the idea and rigidity of a note-taking app as an example of the <code>app</code> in general with the flexibility of a paper note.</p>
<p>One humble but ubiquitous vision of what flexibility in software looks like is the <code>settings</code> panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/27570222bf653818b6a73b1d80774da1.png" alt="image"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Settings panel in Obsidian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the configurations available in an app’s settings are rarely foundational to the functionality of the app itself.
<img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/db0a6e199d1174cbcd8af9d44ca4d7b6.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Users of the <code>settings</code> panel are beholden to a discrete and limited set of options exposed to them by a developer. That’s why I tend to think of applications with a plugin ecosystem as having a fundamentally different ethos than those without. I trust their approach more.</p>
<p>This is far from a complete reflection on the dichotomy between <code>dynamic</code>and <code>static</code> programs, because this vocabulary is new to me. I think the distinction is exciting, and provides language for experiences I’ve had using different tools that inspired me as a developer (whether it was by way of frustration, or delight).</p>
<p>Figma has provided some of the tools that made me subtly rethink what was possible in software, which is why I’m thinking about these things.</p>

<p>Here is the sample code Figma provided Seth and I with when we got started:</p>

<p>Figma recommends you build in typescript, just because you interact with many Figma types. Make sure you build your typescript into javascript, and then run your plugin by selecting it in the <code>development</code> menu we just used. If it was the last one run, you can also use the hotkey <code>option + command + p</code> (on mac) to run it again without having to navigate through the menu.</p>
<p>Here is the full code for a plugin I built that allow you to navigate a tiny box around and “drop” square colors different places!</p>

<p>I based the colors off of this photo of my brother carrying my board back for me after I almost drowned during a surfing trip.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/5aac1fe4768630e18f0a8cd03de5abbf.jpeg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The idea is that you have this <em>box</em>.
The box can be moved with the WASD keys.
It can also be cycled through a few different colors using the 1234567 keys.
UHJK keys can be used to place a new box of the current color to the top, left, bottom or right of it, but most usefully,</p>
<p>N will place a new box of the current color at the same location as the current box.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of me playing around with it on top of the photo the colors are based on:</p>

<p>And here’s a little dude I made:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/9c1d1e8d1414533f7fa5b742de1f7f8c.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>This is the process of making said lil’ dude:</p>

<p>I made some other things too:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/ebfe04622e61d7e8b511f45e8c48495b.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>It turns out that one awesome thing about making pixel art in Figma is that because the result is a set of squares, those squares can be copied, deleted, rotated and manipulated post-creation in all the same ways objects can <em>normally</em> be manipulated in Figma. They be exported as a PNG simply by using the <code>command + shift + c</code> hotkey.</p>

<p>Or as JPGs using the menu or <code>command + shift + e</code> export hotkey.</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/63e5d86ffb63290f6965f47fa64b0623.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t currently have a paid Figma plan, and so I cannot publish my plugin. That said, I made the repo public - if you clone it, you should be able to select an existing plugin on your disk like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://thornberry-obsidian-general.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/attachments/a4017934fce8957d623812bd049cf52a.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>I would love to hear any feedback you have on using it!</p>

<ul>
<li>When the box zooms out of the screen, focus the view on the box. I know this is very doable because the example plugin Figma provides does this
<ul>
<li>I found this problem actually a bit tricky to define, and that using the mouse to readjust the view might be a better solution than manually readjusting the view. HOWEVER, I did comment out a line that used a list of the entire history of the plugin to readjust the view, which actually work pretty well, depending on what you are doing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~~Make sure the <em>moving</em> box that is used like a sort of cursor has a higher z-index than the boxes it makes, so it never gets <em>lost</em> underneath those boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am reaching for a way to categorize the flexibility of different programs, and I’m struggling to quantify this is a satisfying way. Turns out it’s difficult to categorize things this way, but here’s an attempt to show how software with plugin / extension ecosystems stacks against other things.</p>
