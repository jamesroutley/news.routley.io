    <h1>Ask HN: Do you look angry while you work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So people have always told me I look angry when I&#39;m focusing, and I figured &#34;Yeah I look like every other engineer when they&#39;re focusing&#34;.</p><p>Today a friend walked by a cafe where I was working. He saw me, sent a pic and asked me if everything was OK. I looked <i>furious</i>, which I don&#39;t understand, because I was being super productive and am a reasonably happy person.</p><p>Who else looks like they&#39;re going to war, when they&#39;re writing code?</p></div></div></div>
