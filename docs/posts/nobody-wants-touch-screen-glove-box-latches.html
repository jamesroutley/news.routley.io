<p>Now that a narcissistic billionaire bought Twitter and will likely
make it Nazi-friendly (or <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/elon-musk-twitter-nightmare-scenarios/671906/">otherwise ruin
it</a>), 
many people are <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">checking out Mastodon</a>, an
open-source social network that can’t be controlled by any one
organization. <a href="https://social.coop/@graue/">Here’s my account</a>.</p>

<p>At first Mastodon looks like a straight-up clone. It meets Twitter’s
280-character Tweets with 500-character Toots. On Twitter you can
Like, or Retweet to your followers; on Mastodon you can Favorite, or
Boost to your followers. So far, so familiar.</p>

<p>But after some time on the network (I joined when the Musk purchase
was first discussed in April), I’ve noticed subtle, welcome
differences in how conversations play out. And some of the
improvements come not from cool new Mastodon-specific features, but
from Twitter features that are deliberately missing. The first of
these happy omissions is right on the home timeline. Compare, Mastodon
versus Twitter:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://scott.mn/images/masto_vs_twitter.jpg" alt="At left, the Mastodon timeline shows no metrics except for 0, 1, or 1+ replies. At right, the Twitter timeline shows a count of replies, likes, and retweets on every tweet."/>
  
</figure>

<p>Notice the difference? In Mastodon’s home timeline, at left, <strong>posts
don’t have metrics</strong> next to them. If you want to see how many boosts
and faves a post got, you can, but you have to click through to that
post.<sup id="fnref:favecount" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:favecount">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This simple change makes you judge a post first by its content,
rather than the score attached to it. A tweet with few likes is
suspect; one with tons of likes and retweets seems
authoritative, or at least clever. And if you get more replies than
likes, you’ve been “ratioed,” a Twitter concept that suggests you
should feel embarrassed for making a stupid, unpopular post.
While it can be
satisfying to “ratio” a jerk, a bigot, or an out of touch pundit or
politician, it also drives more attention to their content. And
mobilizing lots of accounts into a pile-on is no guarantee
of moral right: Sometimes the bullies ratio <em>you</em>. On Mastodon, this
whole dynamic doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>Conversations, too, hide favorite counts, until you click on each
individual post in turn. This leads to more thoughtful engagement
rather than the temptation to go through a conversation Liking every
post by the person who’s on “your side” to make it appear they won the
argument.</p>

<p>On that note, the second happy omission I’ve noticed is
<strong>notifications when someone Likes a reply</strong> to you:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://scott.mn/images/twitter_liked_mentioned.jpg" alt="Notifications from Twitter: So-and-so liked 4 Tweets you were mentioned in. So-and-so liked 5 Tweets you were mentioned in. (The names and content are redacted.)"/>
  
</figure>

<p>If you’ve gotten in an intense argument on Twitter, you might
dread this “So-and-so liked 10 Tweets you’re mentioned in”
notification. It tends to mean someone went through and gave kudos to
every person arguing with and insulting you. It’s stressful to be
pinged over and over with this—which is exactly why we’re all
tempted to do this to people we think crossed a line. In doing so, we,
again, <em>increase</em> the reach of content we dislike.</p>

<p>The third Twitter feature Mastodon is better for not having is <strong>quote
tweets</strong>. As Mastodon’s lead developer Eugen Rochko <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726">explained
it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve made a deliberate choice against a quoting feature because it
inevitably adds toxicity to people’s behaviours. You are tempted to
quote when you should be replying, and so you speak at your audience
instead of with the person you are talking to. It becomes
performative. Even when doing it for “good” like ridiculing awful
comments, you are giving awful comments more eyeballs that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if you’re skeptical of this one, so was I. Not every quote tweet
is a dunk! Some are adding context in a friendly way. I thought Eugen
was throwing out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

<p>It took time to unlearn my habits and realize it was, in fact, a
blessing that Mastodon’s design was steering me towards talking to
people rather than pointing at them. When you quote, you branch the
conversation to talk <em>about</em> someone, and it’s not always clear if
the original poster is welcome to participate in the new branch.
You’re more likely to exchange ideas and learn something by replying.</p>

<p>As an alternative, you can boost your <em>reply</em> to someone. Or, of
course, you can copy a toot’s URL and link to it, or screenshot it.
But this adds enough friction to avoid becoming the default
interaction mode. As Elilla, the author of a <a href="https://wordsmith.social/elilla/a-futuristic-mastodon-introduction-for-2021">helpful Mastodon
introduction</a>,
puts it, “In twitter most of my feed was quote-retweets snarkily
dissing on things I hate, thereby exposing me to them; in masto most
of my feed is people giving one another emotional support.”</p>

<p>The fourth Twitter feature I’m glad Mastodon doesn’t have is
<strong>full-text search</strong>. You can search by <em>hashtag</em>. And on some
servers, you can do a full-text search of toots that you wrote,
boosted, or favorited.<sup id="fnref:ftsearch" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ftsearch">2</a></sup> But you can’t do a full-text search
of the entire Mastodon network.</p>

<p>Why is this good? Because <em>other people</em> can’t do full-text searches
of the Mastodon network, find your posts, and harass you. The infamous
practice of name-searching—finding tweets about you even if the
person didn’t tag you, and then confronting those people—goes away.
You don’t have to write “El*n” to hide from the Elon Musk fanboys.
(When you <em>do</em> want people to find your topical posts, use
#hashtags.)</p>

<p>Like not supporting quote toots, this is not a technical limitation;
it’s a <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/">deliberate, thoughtful
decision</a> by
the Mastodon project.</p>



<p>Back in April, when the news first broke of Elon buying it, I took a
one-week break from Twitter, only using Mastodon.  My main concern was
a social network that couldn’t be bought. Thanks to its decentralized
design, no one person or organization will ever control the fediverse,
the umbrella term for Mastodon’s social network. And that was all I
thought I wanted: a decentralized Twitter clone.</p>

<p>By the end of that week, my perspective had changed. I had <a href="https://octodon.social/@danderson/109252602711385149">unlearned
patterns of communication Twitter taught
me</a>. Returning
to Twitter, I was shocked by the rudeness and hostility.
Since then, I’ve tried to lower the temperature of disagreements and
remind myself like counts don’t prove who is right or wrong.  I’ve
tried to use Twitter more collaboratively. But Twitter’s affordances
work against that.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence that an open-source,
community-controlled version of social media fosters healthier
discourse. The lack of profit motive enables thoughtful design.
Mastodon isn’t under pressure to post high user engagement numbers to
justify investment.</p>

<p>Look back at the four missing features I named:
metrics in
timelines,
notifications of likes of your replies,
quote tweets,
and full-text
search without the opt-in mechanism of hashtags.
Every one of those features would juice engagement numbers in the
short term. Hostile interactions make us want to defend ourselves and
hit back. Conflict is good from the perspective of a
growth-centered platform, even as it leaves us all drained and
exhausted.</p>

<p>If Mastodon were only a Twitter clone Elon Musk couldn’t buy, that
would be worth a lot. It’s also free of ads and tracking—that’s a
bonus. But it turns out to be more profound than even that. David
Graeber wrote that “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it
is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”

way to make our world differently.</p>
