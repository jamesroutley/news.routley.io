Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been.&#34;</p><p>&#34;With unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning - it is an innocent man,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side... but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge.&#34;</p><p>Moments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: &#34;He&#39;ll be inside for at least three weeks or a month.&#34;</p><p>Sarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Santé prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/154f/live/50ac87a0-ae7b-11f0-86fd-8d837d20b15a.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="EPA Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife wave at crowds and photographers on the street before he goes to prison"/><span>EPA</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, greet people on the day he is due to enter prison</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>Small cell with TV, and one hour&#39;s daily exercise</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sarkozy&#39;s cell in the prison&#39;s isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in another wing for &#34;vulnerable people&#34;, where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.</p><p>He will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly €14 (£12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.</p><p>The former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact. </p><p>But he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing&#39;s segregated courtyard.</p><p>&#34;Conditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard,&#34; La Santé ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. &#34;You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and there&#39;s a type of social isolation which makes life difficult&#34;.</p><p>At the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the Élysée Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday &#34;it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context&#34;.</p><p>Macron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role &#34;to comment on or criticise judicial decisions&#34;, but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of &#34;a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment&#34;.</p><p>In a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozy&#39;s safety and the proper functioning of the jail.</p><p>&#34;I cannot be insensitive to a man&#39;s distress,&#34; he added.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy leaves his house with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy on the day of his incarceration at the Sante prison to begin his five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy over attempts to raise campaign funds from Libya, in Paris, France, October 21, 2025."/><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Nicolas Sarkozy has maintained his innocence and has lodged an appeal</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ever since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.</p><p>Late next month, France&#39;s highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozy&#39;s appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.</p><p>Ahead of his arrival at La Santé prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: &#34;I&#39;m not afraid of prison.
