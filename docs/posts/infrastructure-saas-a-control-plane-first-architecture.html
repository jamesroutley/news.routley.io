    <h1>Infrastructure SaaS â€“ a control plane first architecture</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few months back, we saw a tweet about how every Infrastructure SaaS company needs to separate the control plane from the data plane to build a successful product. Reading this got us excited since we were working on a platform that would make this really easy. <a href="https://thenile.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>We would love to talk to you if you are already familiar with these patterns and are building an Infrastructure SaaS product</strong></a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Twitter-Snapshot" src="https://docs.thenile.dev/assets/images/twitter-snapshot-299aaa6e849e3a73e4143dcb92c4deb2.png" width="1368" height="832"/></p><p>We spent the last six years at Confluent, helping transform it into a world-class Infrastructure SaaS company. We shared the same sentiment as this tweet - building Infrastructure SaaS products can be much simpler if we have a platform that helps develop a reliable control plane. Companies could save significant costs and time, and they could leverage their engineers to focus more on their core products. We thought it would be helpful to explain the end-to-end architecture of an Infrastructure SaaS product, the role of the data plane and control plane, and the problems that make this challenging. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWwIE7lwBS8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h2>What is Infrastructure SaaS?</h2><p>Infrastructure SaaS refers to any infrastructure or platform product provided as a service. It includes data infrastructure, data analytics, machine learning/AI, security, developer productivity, and observability products. Sai Senthilkumar from Redpoint <a href="https://cloudinfrastructure.substack.com/p/the-next-wave-of-cloud-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> an excellent article on this topic and how these Infrastructure SaaS companies are among the fastest-growing companies.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Infra-SaaS" src="https://docs.thenile.dev/assets/images/cloud-infra-b6319ee563c1fc97087aa8983c1fe806.png" width="2560" height="1440"/></p><p>Infrastructure SaaS companies invest in platform teams to build their SaaS platform. The platform teams are responsible for developing the building blocks needed to build a control plane. The investment in the platform teams continues to grow significantly as the product succeeds and is typically 25-50% of the engineering organization. Based on our experience building large-scale Infrastructure SaaS and talking to other companies, it has become apparent that platform investment is the highest cost to the engineering organization in these companies. </p><h2>Data plane vs. Control plane - when do we need this?</h2><p>Control planes are typically responsible for providing the SaaS capabilities, metadata management, and controlling the life cycle across all the data planes. The separation between the control and data planes is common when building an infrastructure SaaS product. There are a few reasons for this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Infra-Relevant" src="https://docs.thenile.dev/assets/images/controlplane-relevant-transparent-4454a341b1fd264c9b566f512fffb0cd.png" width="1454" height="657"/></p><h4>Productize an open-source infrastructure as a SaaS product</h4><p>Most open-source infrastructure projects start with only the data plane. The project authors realize that the next step is to productize the open-source infrastructure as a SaaS product. An independent control plane is ideal for achieving the SaaS experience and ensuring that the core open-source data plane is separate. The control plane will help manage multiple data planes across regions and cloud providers.</p><h4>Building any proprietary Infra SaaS product</h4><p>The open-source argument is pretty strong. However, <b>the need for a control plane is not just limited to open-source infrastructure</b>. It becomes a core need for any infrastructure SaaS product, either close or open source. Almost all Infrastructure SaaS need a central management layer that enables tenant management, user management, cluster management, and orchestration of all the data planes. The control plane provides a single pane of glass experience for the end-users, coordinating with all the data planes and responsible for the overall life cycle management.</p><h4>Data locality with customer location</h4><p>With infrastructure SaaS, <b>there is a general need to keep the data plane close to the customer location</b> for a few reasons.</p></div></div>
