    <h1>Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth: Ingrid Robeyns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description"><p>â€˜The best case I&#39;ve read for putting an upper limit on the accumulation of wealthâ€™ Richard WilkinsonNo-one deserves to be a millionaire.</p><p>Not even you. We all notice when the poor get poorer: when there are more rough sleepers and food bank queues start to grow.</p><p>But if the rich become richer, there is nothing much to see in public and, for most of us, daily life doesn&#39;t change. Or at least, not immediately.   In this astonishing, eye-opening intervention, world-leading philosopher and economist Ingrid Robeyns exposes the true extent of our wealth problem, which has spent the past fifty years silently spiralling out of control.</p><p>In moral, political, economic, social, environmental and psychological terms, she shows, extreme wealth is not only unjustifiable but harmful to us all - the rich included.   In place of our current system, Robeyns offers a breathtakingly clear alternative: limitarianism.</p><p>The answer to so many of the problems posed by neoliberal capitalism - and the opportunity for a vastly better world - lies in placing a hard limit on the wealth that any one person can accumulate. Because nobody deserves to be a millionaire. Not even you.</p></div></div>
