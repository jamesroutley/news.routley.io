    <p><img src="https://www.stevegattuso.me/static/wiki-images/1c5b5b9876a91f473a42ffb00a6bd031.jpg"/></p><p><em><a href="https://tahimik.com/journal/being-an-english-major-at-the-end-of-the-english-major">Being an English major at the end of the English major</a></em> from tahimik’s blog caught my eye the other day. Specifically this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s an interesting time for someone to choose to study English right now. And not just because of AI. The New Yorker article, “<a href="https://archive.is/rLFcL">The End of the English Major</a>” has been circling around for two years now, just before AI really blew up. In the article, they say that enrollment for humanities degrees, like English, has been falling the past few years. The article points to several different reasons why.</p>

  <p>One student interviewed in the article had an answer that resonated the most with me. “I always view humanities as a passion project. You have to be affluent in order to be able to take that on.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was in undergrad I noticed (and admittedly participated in) the denigration of humanities majors. Engineers perceived them as impractical given the job prospects. The common opinion was that the humanities were occupied by the kids who could afford tuition and, regardless of the degree, still leverage their parents’ connections to land a cozy job after graduating.</p>

<p>During my senior year of undergrad I needed to pick up some extra credits and, having already fulfilled my required computer science courses, ended up picking up a couple of humanities classes on a whim. The first was an eastern religion class: <em>From Confucius to Zen</em>, and the second was an ethics class: <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250126011028/https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/courses/299/">The Social Implications of Computing</a>.</em></p>

<p>It wasn’t until these classes that my eyes opened to how utterly wrong my view of humanities was. I realized that they challenged an entirely different part of my brain. A part that my engineering, math, and even social science classes seemed to leave untouched. I was forced to think within a world that consisted of many shades of gray rather than the simplistic “right or wrong” which dominated much of my other coursework.</p>

<p>I’m incredibly grateful for the perspective shift these classes gave me, and it made me think that all engineering graduates should have to take some form of humanities<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, or <em>at least</em> an ethics class.</p>

<p>Yet this shift in perspective ended up isolating me from many of my colleagues in the tech industry. I’ve found myself at odds with many in my professional communities who work for companies operating within worlds like cryptocurrencies or surveillance capitalism. It’s hard for me to hold my tongue when I hear people acting as if these are ethically acceptable things to work on, particularly in this moment in time.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat vindicated by a recent article from Ross Douthat in the NY Times, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/extinction-technology-culture.html">An Age of Extinction Is Coming. Here is How to Survive</a></em>. It’s a clickbait title, but its contents has substance. The article revolves around a central claim that modern technology’s pressures on society are creating a cultural “bottleneck” where much of what we take for granted is being squeezed out of existence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this environment, survival will depend on intentionality and intensity. Any aspect of human culture that people assume gets transmitted automatically, without too much conscious deliberation, is what online slang calls NGMI — not going to make it.</p>

  <p>Languages will disappear, churches will perish, political ideas will evanesce, art forms will vanish, the capacity to read and write and figure mathematically will wither, and the reproduction of the species will fail — except among people who are deliberate and self-conscious and a little bit fanatical about ensuring that the things they love are carried forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is where we come back to tahimik. The English major in a time of its apparent demise. It’s of course a privilege to have the time and resources to expend on a second round of undergrad in English, but I will side with her that this time and these resources are well spent. Not just for the joy of her own intellectual pursuit, but also for the preservation of a study that merits longevity. Especially in an era of social media sucking most of the population’s attention away from long-form literature.</p>

<p>Back to Douthat’s piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But how much survives will depend on our own deliberate choices — the choice to date and love and marry and procreate, the choice to fight for particular nations and traditions and art forms and worldviews, the choice to limit our exposure to the virtual, not necessarily refusing new technology but trying every day, in every setting, to make ourselves its master.</p>

  <p>Some of these choices will be especially difficult for liberals, since they will often smack of chauvinism and fanaticism and reaction. […] Important art forms will survive only because of a frank elitism, an insistence on distinction, a contempt for mediocrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It feels strange to be nodding my head towards a quote that reeks of “I told you so, snowflakes!” Yet here I am, clearly seeing that we’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Where pretension feels like an increasingly valuable tool in preserving things that I think are worth keeping around for the next generation.</p>

<p>I’ll admit it’s also a little vindicating to feel that there might actually be value in my stubbornness of believing crypto is a scam, or that everyone should drop Instagram and TikTok and Twitter/X, or that reading a novel is a better use of time than online shopping.</p>

<p>I don’t know how to best balance on the tightrope between preservation via elitism and condescension versus empathy and persuasion. The latter certainly sounds like the healthier option, but the former sometimes feels like the only one powerful enough to fight back. It’s the tension behind writing <em><a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2024/11/07/resisting-social-media.html">A healthier way to get friends away from social media</a></em>. It’s the tension that I regularly feel in my day-to-day life as I ride the subway watching children and adults alike glued to their TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook feeds.</p>

<p>Resolving this dilemma merits thought. Yet perhaps not too much, as the culture and values we take for granted are under dire threat <em>right now</em>. This is the time to identify what we believe to be under threat and do whatever it takes to act as protective vessels. Whether that is reminding your English-major classmates that their AI slop is recognizable or poking a friend to drop their phone and exist in real life.</p>
