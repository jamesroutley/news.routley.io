The architect of Russia&#39;s failing war in Ukraine appeared to have left the announcement to his generals.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was Mr Putin who announced Russia&#39;s annexation of Kherson, and three other occupied regions, at the end of September.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;In these circumstances, the most sensible option is to organise the defence along a barrier line along the river Dnipro,&#34; Gen Surovikin told the meeting.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it was &#34;encouraging&#34; to see Ukraine making advances. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The gains the Ukrainian armed forces are making belong to the brave, courageous Ukrainian soldiers, but of course the support they receive from the United Kingdom, from Nato allies and partners is also essential,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Vladimir Putin celebrated his annexation of occupied regions but his forces were already on the back foot in Kherson</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Russian troops swept across southern Ukraine from annexed Crimea at the start of the war, seizing Kherson city in early March. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They also launched attacks in the south, east and north of the country, including surrounding the capital, Kyiv. In recent months, however, Ukraine&#39;s forces have made significant advances, particularly in the east.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This counter-offensive escalated in September, when Ukraine drove back Russian forces, retaking the cities of Izyum and Kupiansk, both key supply hubs for Moscow&#39;s forces. Since then, Russia has mainly focused its military operations in smaller pockets of Ukraine&#39;s south, east and north-east.   </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But its decision to pull back across the Dnipro river was treated with caution by Ukrainian officials. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Actions speak louder than words,&#34; said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight... [Ukraine] is liberating territories based on intelligence data, not staged TV statements.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Pro-Kremlin war bloggers were less cautious, with one known as War Gonzo condemning the retreat as a &#34;black page in the history of the Russian army&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There is no way for Moscow to depict this withdrawal as anything other than a humiliating setback - its biggest loss since Ukraine recaptured large areas around the city of Kharkiv in the early autumn. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And it further undermines Russia&#39;s announcement that it was illegally annexing Ukrainian provinces, including Kherson, which it said would remain Russian territory &#34;forever&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But, as Mr Podolyak warned, there are several reasons for Ukraine to be cautious. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The first is that retreating Russian forces will most likely have left behind mines and booby traps for the advancing Ukrainians. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The second is that Russia, having withdrawn its troops to the east bank - and having &#34;evacuated&#34;, sometimes by force, large numbers of civilians - will now be tempted to bombard Kherson at will. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Finally, the pattern emerging in this war is that every time Russia suffers a major military setback it responds by further punishing the civilian population.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Expect more missile and drone strikes to make winter for Ukrainians as miserable as possible.</p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Watch: Ros Atkins asks Jeremy Bowen about reporting from Ukraine&#39;s frontline</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Seen as one of the main cheerleaders of the occupation of Kherson, he had warned only six days ago that it was &#34;most likely&#34; that Russian forces would have to cross to the eastern bank.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Although the Ukrainian advance had slowed in recent weeks, Russia&#39;s supply lines across the Dnipro had become increasingly difficult after the few bridges across were destroyed by Ukrainian missiles.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Before the withdrawal, Russia moved thousands of civilians out of the city by boat, in what Ukraine condemned as a forced deportation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gen Surovikin - previously a notorious commander of Russia&#39;s recent operations in Syria - was appointed to take over the running of Russia&#39;s invasion a month ago.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
