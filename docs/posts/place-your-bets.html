            <p>The thing I find most suspicious/fishy/smelly about the current hype
surrounding Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and other AI applications is that
it is almost exactly six months since the bottom  dropped out of the
cryptocurrency scam bubble.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a coincidence.</p>

<p>To me it looks very much as if the usual hucksters and grifters are now
chasing the sweet VC/private equity money that has been flushed out of
the cryptocurrency market. AI is the new hotness, all of a sudden, not
because it works but because it delivers panicky investors on a platter.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thinking about investing in AI startups now? My advice is to
avoid them like the plague (unless you are <em>absolutely certain</em> that you
understand both the technology and the market for the proposed
applications): it&#39;s too late, and you&#39;ll wake up one morning only to
discover you&#39;ve had your pockets picked.</p>

<p>Much of what passes for &#34;journalism&#34; these days is just stenographers
feverishly copying the press-releases they&#39;re spoon-fed. Real journalism
is a niche sector, and unless you subscribe to the exhorbitantly priced
newsletters of the high-end analysts who are paid to work full-time
studying the sector, what you&#39;re seeing on the news websites and in the
newspapers is the product of PR firms paid to push AI. And you really
need to ask <em>who</em> is paying them.</p>

<p>The AI sector will tick along for a while, generating positive
headlines, but there&#39;s going to be a crash, sooner rather than later.
The Bing/ChatGPT fiasco is just a harbinger of the way deep learning
models are going to be discredited in the public eye, as people
gradually realize that most of what you get out of a garbage model is
more plausibly remixed garbage, and that producing a <em>non-</em>garbage
training model requires careful human curation of the sort of giant heap
of data that is incredibly labour intensive to prepare. I give it about
1-3 years until the crash. (Although I tend towards optimism: the
cryptocurrency bubble took a bit over a decade to implode, but back in
2011 I prediced its demise within, yeah, 1-3 years.)</p>

<p>As for what you should look to invest in?</p>

<p>I&#39;m <em>sure</em> it&#39;s just a coincidence that training neural networks and
mining cryptocurrencies are both applications that benefit from very
large arrays of GPUs. As in, hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs
soaking up entire nations&#39; worth of electricity. (If I recall correctly,
the latest ChatGPT model was trained on a supercomputing cluster that
turns nearly $2M of electricity a year into waste heat: and it took a
couple of months of 100% usage.) And of course, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and
the usual suspects have never imagined paying a PR firm to talk up
markets for their latest products.</p>

<p>If I was a VC I&#39;d be hiring complexity theory nerds to figure out what
areas of research are promising once you have Yottaflops of numerical
processing power available, then I&#39;d be placing bets on the GPU
manufacturers going there. Then I&#39;d start seeding the field and hiring
PR firms to push the narrative.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not a VC, so this is just spitballing.</p>
