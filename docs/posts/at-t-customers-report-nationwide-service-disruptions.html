    <h1>AT&amp;T customers report nationwide service disruptions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>AT&amp;T’s cellular network began experiencing major service problems for customers across the United States early on Thursday morning. Wireless customers took to the <a href="https://forums.att.com/conversations/other-phones-devices/is-there-an-att-service-outage-i-am-unaware-of/65d7150a97bbc44b4a25e76c?source=ESsWCfCTA0000000L&amp;wtExtndSource=cfm_Announcement_OutageThread">carrier’s forums</a>, Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/s/DyBVWIRyIK">1</a>) (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/s/wBSasH8R9A">2</a>) (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/s/s7hqDAmQ5J">3</a>), and elsewhere to report that they’d lost all voice and mobile data service — with some of those impacted unable to reach 911 emergency services. </p><p>Amid the confusion, some news outlets falsely reported similar outages at other carriers. But Verizon and T-Mobile both said their networks were operating normally and that most customer complaints pertained to trying to reach friends and family on AT&amp;T, who <em>were</em> affected by the ordeal.</p><p>“We are aware of an outage currently impacting our mobility users and are working to resolve it ASAP,” AT&amp;T wrote in a banner notification on its support forum. The company is encouraging customers to use Wi-Fi calling where possible while it works to restore full service. </p><p>AT&amp;T’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ATTHelp">other support channels</a> on social media were bizarrely quiet about the Thursday outage, with no direct acknowledgment even after it had already lasted several hours for many people as of the time this story was published. FirstNet, the AT&amp;T-powered communications network used by some first responders and health providers, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1ax3ic4/comment/krlcahi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">also appears to be affected by the disruptions</a>, but it’s unclear to what degree.</p><p>Such far-reaching disruptions are relatively rare among the major US carriers — T-Mobile <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23598880/tmobile-outage-down-no-service-iphone-sos">experienced something similar</a> last year — but they can prove extremely frustrating when they do occur. Outages that prevent consumers from reaching 911 also tend to draw the scrutiny of the FCC. In some regions, local emergency services have already emailed nearby residents warning of the AT&amp;T situation and advising them how they can otherwise reach help if needed. </p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to AT&amp;T for more details. </p><p><em><strong>Update February 22nd, 9:28AM ET:</strong> The story has been updated to reflect that other major US networks are unaffected and with AT&amp;T’s recommendation to use Wi-Fi calling during the downtime.</em></p></div></div></div>
