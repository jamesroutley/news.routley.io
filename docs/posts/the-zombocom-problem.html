There are about two hundred thousand active music CDs at any given time.</p><p>But in the book space there are more than three million different books worldwide active and printed at any given time across all languages. More than one and a half million in English alone.</p><p>So when you have that many items you can literally build a store online that couldn&#39;t exist any other way.</p></blockquote><p>Books were the edge-of-the-wedge for Amazon. They were a great product, because they were shelf stable, easy to ship, easy to handle, and could compete on catalog size.</p><p>Books also offered an easy gradient into adjacent categories like music. First Amazon was the book store, then the books and music store, then the books and music and… Bezos landed, then expanded into adjacent market after adjacent market, until Amazon grew from the something store to the everything store.</p><p>The Zombocom problem explains why spreadsheets succeeded, where many other end-user-programming platforms failed.</p><blockquote><p><span>The whole world runs on Excel. Name a data-intensive critical industry: deep-sea oil drilling? Power grid management? International finance? All powered by Excel at critical junctures.</span><em></em></p></blockquote><p>Spreadsheets are used by everyone for everything, but first they had to be used by someone for something specific.

If you hear this, run away. Platforms come from products, not the other way around.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>People don’t buy platforms. They buy one product at a time that somehow differentiates itself from every other product in their life. And then they move onto the next one. And the next one.

It holds two seemingly irreconcilable insights in tension and transcends either lesser alternative:</p><ul><li><p>A single-purpose product knows its customer, but tends to paint itself into a corner without systems-level insight. Instead of landing and expanding, it ends up going deeper and deeper into its vertical.</p></li><li><p>A systemic platform has massive growth potential, but tends to flop without a first best customer. It’s sometimes possible to overcome this with a massive push distribution channel, but the truth is, if you build it, they won’t always come. </p></li></ul><p>Starting from that systems-level insight and working back to the first best customer requires two different skillsets, two different ways of seeing.</p><ul><li><p>From the outside, it may look like you’re diving deep into a vertical and building a single-purpose product. Systems thinkers don’t like that. They want to generalize the system.</p></li><li><p>From the inside, it may feel like you’re spending a lot of time on theory. Product thinkers don’t like that. They want to think about the customer.</p></li></ul><p>But holding both of these contradictory perspectives in your head at once is a superpower. Doing the hard work of systems-thinking up front allows you to uncover exponential opportunities.
