Jaxa described it as an &#34;unprecedented pinpoint landing&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The landing technology could allow future exploration of hilly Moon poles seen as a potential source of fuel, water and oxygen, the agency said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Slim mission came after earlier attempts by Japan failed, including one by the start-up iSpace, which saw its lunar lander crash when its onboard computer became confused about its altitude above the Moon.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Jaxa could not immediately say until when Slim will operate on the Moon. It has previously said the lander was not designed to survive a lunar night. A lunar night, which is when the surface of the Moon is not exposed to the Sun, lasts about 14 days.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Statistically, it has proven very hard to land on the Moon. Only about half of all attempts have succeeded.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prior to Japan, India was the most recent nation to join the elite club of countries that have achieved this. Its Chandrayaan-3&#39;s rover touched down near the lunar south pole in August 2023 - an area on the Moon&#39;s surface that no human had reached before.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier this month, a US spacecraft launched by a private operator ended its lunar mission in flames over the Pacific. In August last year, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66562629">Russia&#39;s first lunar spacecraft in decades crashed</a> into the Moon after spinning out of control.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>JAXA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>It&#39;s unclear how long Slim can work but lunar night will return to Shioli in the next few days</p></figcaption></figure></div></article></main></div></div>
