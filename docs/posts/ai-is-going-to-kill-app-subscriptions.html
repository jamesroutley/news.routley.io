    <h1>AI is going to kill app subscriptions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The math is simple: if it costs almost nothing to build an app, it costs almost nothing to clone an app. And if cloning is free, subscription pricing dies.</p>
<p>We&#39;re already seeing this play out in the numbers. Apple&#39;s App Store got 557K new submissions in 2025, up 24% from 2024 (source: Appfigures). That&#39;s not because people suddenly got more creative. It&#39;s because building an app went from a $50K project to a weekend with Claude.</p>
<h2>What happens to pricing</h2>
<p>For apps that run locally—no servers, no cloud costs—subscriptions make no sense anymore. The only real cost is development, and that&#39;s becoming negligible. If someone charges $10/month for a local PDF editor, someone else will build a clone for $5 one-time. Then someone will make it free.</p>
<p>Apps that need servers (sync, AI features, storage) will still have subscriptions, but the price will drop to barely above cost. Same logic applies: easy to copy means no pricing power.</p>
<h2>Apple isn&#39;t fighting this</h2>
<p>I thought Apple to tighten App Store review to slow down the flood of apps. Instead they put Claude in Xcode. They&#39;re not just okay with AI-generated apps—they&#39;re actively supporting it.</p>
<p>The revenue numbers back this up. App Store grew 11% in 2025, Google Play 5%. There&#39;s still tons of unmet demand, especially for niche use cases that were never worth building before. Lower development costs mean these niches finally get served.</p>
<h2>Developer perspective</h2>
<p>This sucks for developers trying to make a living from apps. The competitive pressure is going to be brutal. But for users? It&#39;s great. People have been complaining about app subscription costs for years. There&#39;s that old complaint: &#34;Why do I have to keep paying for software after I already paid $1000 for my iPhone?&#34;</p>
<p>That might actually become reality now.</p></article></div>
