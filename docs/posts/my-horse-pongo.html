<p><b>Update:</b> Please check out and join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/canon-cat">&#34;Canon Cat&#34; Google
Group</a> -- that&#39;s where the Canon Cat activists meet these days.</p>

<p>The Canon Cat is a word processing appliance which was sold by Canon in 1987. It was designed by Information Appliance, Inc.
</p><p>The Cat has a remarkably different user interface. It was a true information appliance which allows you to just type. It packs a surprising amount of power in a small set of tools and commands.
</p><p>This site collects some information on the Canon Cat. We hope to give people a feeling of how the Cat works. Every user interface enthusiast should know about the Cat and have a feel of the differently great world of the Cat.
</p><p>If you have additional material that we could add here, please send e-mail to  <a href="mailto:haa@canoncat.org">haa@canoncat.org
</a> and we&#39;ll put it up here. You can also add your comments using the commentary feature on each page.</p><h2>Latest Updates</h2>
