    <h1>Make a game with Hoot for the Lisp Game Jam</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/2024_05_15-2024_spring_lisp_game_jam.jpg" alt="Spring Lisp Game Jam"/></p><p>Twice per year I co-host the Lisp Game Jam: a 10-day game jam where
participants create small games in their favorite Lisp dialect.
Unlike classic game jams like Ludum Dare, which have an intensive 2-3
day long duration, the Lisp Game Jam is much more casual and spans two
whole weekends to give busy people (most of us!) more of a chance to
complete a game.  There are no prizes, though there is a judging
period where we play each other&#39;s games and give feedback.  Really,
the joy of getting creative with Lisp is its own reward.  Game jams
are the perfect excuse to prototype a gameplay idea and get some
practice managing the scope of a project to meet a due date.</p><p>The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2024">Spring edition of the Lisp Game
Jam</a> starts <strong>this
Friday, May 17th</strong> and is on track to be the biggest one yet with over
100 registered participants so far!  Will you be among them?  On
behalf of the Spritely Institute, I would like to encourage you to
join this spring&#39;s jam and try out <a href="https://spritely.institute/hoot">Hoot</a>, our <em>Scheme to
WebAssembly</em> compiler!</p><p>We&#39;re so excited for you to join that we&#39;ve put together a <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-game-jam-template">game jam
template
repository</a>
that has everything you need to make a 2D game using Hoot and HTML5
canvas.  It even features a <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-game-jam-template/-/blob/main/game.scm?ref_type=heads">mini-Breakout
clone</a>
as an example of how to put all the pieces together into a playable
game!</p><p>I can&#39;t overstate how web browser support is a <em>huge</em> benefit in a
game jam.  An HTML5 build embedded directly on the itch.io page for
your game makes it relatively <em>frictionless</em> for players to try it
out.  HTML5 games consistently get more players and ratings on average
than native games.</p><p>It is <em>much</em> harder to ship native releases that will work reliably on
many different computers.  I&#39;ve spent many hours debugging such issues
in the past.  Native releases also typically need one build per
supported operating system.  That&#39;s a lot of time and energy that
could be spent building the actual game instead!  When it comes to
game jams, people play entries for minutes, not hours.  If your game
is hard to launch then they will move on to another one that is easier
to try.  I know I&#39;m on the development team, but ease of distribution
is probably the biggest motivating factor for making my jam games with
Hoot.</p><p>Last year, during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2023">Autumn
jam</a>, I used a much
more primitive version of Hoot to make a space shooter called
<a href="https://davexunit.itch.io/strigoform">Strigoform</a>, and David Wilson
(of <a href="https://systemcrafters.net">System Crafters</a> fame) made a
Solitaire clone called
<a href="https://fluxharmonic.itch.io/cybersol">Cybersol</a>.  You can read more
about our experiences using Hoot in last year&#39;s jam
<a href="https://spritely.institute/news/having-a-hoot-at-the-lisp-game-jam-a-tale-of-two-daves.html">here</a>,
but trust me when I say that since then, it&#39;s become <em>a lot</em> easier to
get started!</p><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/2023_12_07-2023_autumn_game_jam-Strigoform.gif" alt="Strigoform gameplay animation"/></p><p>We love making small games here at Spritely not only because they make
for eye-catching demos, but also for their tendency to stress
language/library implementations, routinely exposing bugs and
performance issues.  Game jams are a great opportunity to &#34;eat your
own dog food&#34; and put a technology stack to the test under time and
resource constraints in a low stakes, fun way.  Spritely staff, myself
included, will be participating in the jam, but what I&#39;m <em>really</em>
looking forward to is seeing what the community creates and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/-/issues">taking
note</a> of all the ways
that Hoot can be improved moving forward!</p><p>For help with Hoot or the game template during the jam, you can post
questions in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2024/topic/3713915/guile-hoot-game-template-repository">this itch.io forum
thread</a>.</p><p>To talk about all things Spritely, during the jam and beyond, join our
<a href="https://community.spritely.institute/">community forum</a> or the
<code>#spritely</code> channel on the Libera.Chat IRC network.</p><p>For some advice on making games, I recommend reading <a href="http://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html">&#34;How to Make
Good Small
Games&#34;</a>
by Far Away Times.  I think I will re-read it before the jam starts.</p><p>And finally, for our dedicated and intrepid game jam readers, tessa,
our developer advocate, has created a mobile wallpaper to help you
celebrate the jam all day every day, wherever you may be:</p><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/2024_05_15-2024_spring_lisp_game_jam-spritely_mobile_wallpaper.jpg" alt="Painting of Spritely characters hanging out and playing"/></p><p>Happy hooting, jammers! ðŸ¦‰</p></div></div>
