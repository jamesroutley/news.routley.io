            In addition to supporting thousands of developers using Unreal Engine all around the world, <em>Live++</em> is used by more than 70 companies on their proprietary engines and frameworks.

                    Live++ is &#34;Edit and Continue that actually works&#34;. Programmers at Asobo Studio have been using it throughout development of Asobo Studio&#39;s C++-based products (millions of lines of code). It has become a standard part of our workflow, increasing developer productivity (and happiness ðŸ˜Š).
                  </p>
                  
                </div>

                    I came to rely on Live++ in an almost unhealthy way. There&#39;s no C++ code I am working on where it can&#39;t be profitably used. It&#39;s integrated in minutes and gets me reliably around seconds or even minutes long program re-starts. Live++ also became my investigation sandbox in which I can explore and refactor my running code. I hunt down bugs by querying and testing my code interactively and old-school debugging methods get a modern spin - debug prints and runtime variable modification on steroids.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Seeing Live++ in action seems like magic, and it very well might be. Aside from our Unreal projects we used it on a game with a custom engine and a very long iteration cycle. Over the five years of development, Live++ likely saved us months by avoiding the dreaded &#34;change line - compile - load - test - repeat&#34; cycle and letting us experiment and implement the game logic while the game was running. Between integration taking just a few minutes, and the free trial being available, there really isn&#39;t an excuse to not give it a try!

                    Live++ is the single biggest improvement in productivity for C++ codebases. Fast feedback loops are a superpower.

                    Live++ has enabled engineers across Frostbite, and the game teams using it, to iterate and debug so much faster. No longer needing to restart the game/editor to apply changes is fantastic, but being able to deoptimize the current file has been a godsend for productivity. Can&#39;t recommend it enough!

                    Live++ has been a game changer for me. The ability to make changes to code while the application is running supercharges iteration times and makes tweaking and tuning behaviours so much easier. It&#39;s also come in handy a number of times when debugging an issue. Being able to add extra logging/instrumentation without having to restart the application is incredibly useful.

                </div>

              <li>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Live++ is crazy simple to integrate and has transformed my workflow. Returning to a codebase without live editing feels like stepping into the distant past. Iterating faster lets me stay focused, save time, save money, and honestly just be happier every day while working.

                    I love that I can disable optimizations on individual files <em>while I am debugging</em> without needing to restart and compile the program.

                    Live++ massively reduced my iteration times. No more quit-compile-restart cycle. And the cherry on top: Writing IMGUI code with Live++ is just amazingly interactive. 10/10, would hot-reload again ;)
