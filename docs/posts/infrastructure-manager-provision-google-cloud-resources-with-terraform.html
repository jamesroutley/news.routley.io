    <h1>Infrastructure Manager: Provision Google Cloud Resources with Terraform</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>We are excited to unveil <a href="https://cloud.google.com/infrastructure-manager/docs/overview">Infrastructure Manager</a>, which provides the capabilities of <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> as a Google Cloud managed service. With Infrastructure Manager, you can manage your Google Cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, built on the robust foundation of Terraform. This brings the best of both worlds, offering a managed and streamlined experience for deploying, configuring, and managing your cloud resources using declarative configuration. Infrastructure Manager is generally available. </p><h3>Streamlining Google Cloud infrastructure with Terraform</h3><p>Infrastructure Manager leverages the Terraform infrastructure provisioning tool to provide an intuitive and robust way to manage Google Cloud infrastructure that’s fully integrated within the Google Cloud ecosystem. Now, you can harness the full potential of Google Cloud using <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax" target="_blank">Terraform&#39;s declarative syntax</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/blueprints/terraform-blueprints">reusable modules</a>, validation (<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate" target="_blank">syntax</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation">policy</a>), and infrastructure management capabilities, to reliably provision and scale your Google Cloud infrastructure.</p><h3>Key features and benefits</h3><ol><li><p><b>Infrastructure management</b>: Infrastructure Manager lets you manage your Google Cloud infrastructure using Terraform and <a href="https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/cloud-infrastructure/" target="_blank">IaC approach</a> without needing to set up build pipelines. This allows you to deploy, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share. Infrastructure Manager can help you to automate and standardize your deployment workflows, enabling consistency, efficiency, and scalability across your infrastructure deployments.</p></li><li><p><b>Resource Lifecycle Management</b>: Infrastructure Manager simplifies the management of your cloud deployments thanks to Terraform&#39;s state management capabilities. You can easily track and manage the lifecycle of your resources, update configurations, and apply changes in a controlled and auditable manner. With Terraform&#39;s Plan and Apply workflow, Infrastructure Manager helps ensure predictability and minimizes the risk of unintended infrastructure changes.</p></li><li><p><b>Streamlined Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b>: Easily provision and manage Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, Kubernetes clusters, and more — all using Google Cloud’s library of pre-packaged and recommended <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/blueprints/terraform-blueprints">Terraform modules</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs" target="_blank">Terraform Providers</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions#section-3">Jump Start Solutions</a>. Let Infrastructure Manager take care of automation and managing dependencies.</p></li><li><p><b>Integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem</b>: Infrastructure Manager integrates with other Google Cloud products and services, further enhancing your infrastructure management experience. Whether it&#39;s Cloud Logging for monitoring and troubleshooting or Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control, Infrastructure Manager leverages Google Cloud&#39;s ecosystem to provide a comprehensive and cohesive solution.</p></li></ol><h3>Infrastructure management at scale</h3><p>Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager, built on Terraform, simplifies the way you manage your Google Cloud infrastructure. By combining the power of Infrastructure as Code with the flexibility and scalability of Terraform, Infrastructure Manager offers a managed, scalable, and efficient solution for provisioning, configuring, and managing your Google Cloud resources.</p><p>Start using Infrastructure Manager to manage your Google Cloud resources.
