    <h1>Novo Nordisk launches Wegovy weight-loss pill in US, triggering price war</h1>

Apart from being more affordable, the new version is expected to have wider appeal by being needle free and easier for the patient to fit into their routine.</p><p>The 4mg dose will also be available for $149 a month until 15 April, then $199, while the highest doses cost $299 a month. Patients with insurance pay from $25 a month.</p><p>Matt Weston, a pharmaceutical analyst at UBS, said the price was lower than expected. US list prices for weight-loss jabs are about $1,000 a month or more, although Novo Nordisk started selling its Wegovy injection at $349 a month to cash payers in November.</p><p>Novo Nordisk’s share price rose by more than 4% on Monday on news of the launch, but is still down by 44% over the past year amid fierce competition from US rival Eli Lilly’s jabs Mounjaro and Zepbound.</p><p>The Danish company, once the most valuable in Europe, hopes the pill will help it claw back market share after it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/07/wegovy-maker-novo-nordisk-cuts-profit-forecast" data-link-name="in body link">issued several profit warnings</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/10/ozempic-maker-novo-nordisk-to-cut-9000-jobs-amid-increased-competition" data-link-name="in body link">cut thousands of jobs</a> and appointed new management last year.</p><p>Both Novo and Eli Lilly have reduced prices of their jabs for people buying them for cash, rather than using health insurance.</p><p>The Wegovy pill has only been approved in the US so far. The starting dose is now available at more than 70,000 US pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as some telehealth providers including Ro, LifeMD and Weight Watchers. The higher doses will become available later this week.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&#34;index&#34;:12,&#34;listId&#34;:4139,&#34;identityName&#34;:&#34;business-today&#34;,&#34;description&#34;:&#34;Get set for the working day – we&#39;ll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Business Today&#34;,&#34;frequency&#34;:&#34;Every weekday&#34;,&#34;successDescription&#34;:&#34;We&#39;ll send you Business Today every weekday&#34;,&#34;theme&#34;:&#34;news&#34;,&#34;idApiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://idapi.theguardian.com&#34;,&#34;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&#34;:true}"><div data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Cash-paying patients will also be able to buy the starting dose of the pill for $149 a month on Donald Trump’s direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx.</p><p>Eli Lilly is <a href="https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron" data-link-name="in body link">working on its own anti-obesity pill</a> and, if approved, had planned to cap higher doses at $399 a month for cash-paying patients.</p><p>“We know there are people who are interested in addressing their weight but have been waiting on the sidelines for a medicine that was right for them,” said Ed Cinca, the senior vice-president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk.</p><p>“For many of them, that wait is over as we can now offer the powerful efficacy of Wegovy in a once-daily pill that demonstrated about 17% weight loss, if all patients stayed on treatment.”</p><p>The UK’s medicines regulator is reviewing the company’s application for its Wegovy pill and is expected to make a decision on whether to approve it before the end of the year.</p></div></div></div>
