I figured that I could solve this quandary by producing a system that, when followed exactly, would cause me to eventually lead the best life I could. So I got to it.</p><p>For some reason I called the system “LIFE”. The acronym didn’t stand for anything. Here’s the first version:</p><blockquote><p>Complete the following activities without fail.</p><p><strong>Daily:</strong><span> Write in your journal about how your day went and any thoughts you have about how to live your life better.</span></p><p><strong>Weekly:</strong><span> Review last week’s journal entries, then update </span><em>this reflection program</em><span> in order to improve this program’s ability to achieve its goal: to help you lead a good life.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>That was the whole program. A minimal </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop" rel="">strange loop</a><span> that seeks to improve itself with time. It wasn’t much, but I figured it was enough to pull itself up by its bootstraps. If I could follow this system, in time it would grow to become an ideal guide for me.</span></p><p>So I got started, and 8 years later the LIFE system is still going. It and I have evolved a ton, and I hope to write about that coevolution soon.</p><p><em>Daniel Sosebee, March 2024</em></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div><div><div id="discussion"><div><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><div><div data-test-id="comment-input"><form><div><div title="User"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_32,h_32,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 32w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_64,h_64,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 64w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_96,h_96,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 96w" sizes="32px"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_32,h_32,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png" sizes="32px" alt="User&#39;s avatar" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_32,h_32,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 32w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_64,h_64,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 64w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_96,h_96,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 96w" width="32" height="32" draggable="false"/></picture></div></div></form></div></div></div></div></div></div>
