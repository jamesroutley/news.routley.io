																	<h4>Detect animal poses in Vision</h4>
																	<p><span>8:00 a.m.</span></p><p>Go beyond detecting cats and dogs in images. We&#39;ll show you how to use Vision to detect the individual joints and poses of these animals as well — all in real time — and share how you can enable exciting features like animal tracking for a camera app, creative embellishment on an animal photo, and more. We&#39;ll also explore other important enhancements to Vision and share best practices.

To learn even more about what’s new in the Vision framework, watch &#34;Explore 3D body pose and person segmentation in Vision” and &#34;Lift subjects from images in your app.” And to learn more about building live camera-tracking experiences, check out &#34;Integrate with motorized iPhone stands using DockKit&#34;

																	<h4>Customize on-device speech recognition</h4>
																	<p><span>8:00 a.m.</span></p><p>Find out how you can improve on-device speech recognition in your app by customizing the underlying model with additional vocabulary. We&#39;ll share how speech recognition works on device and show you how to boost specific words and phrases for more predictable transcription. Learn how you can provide specific pronunciations for words and use template support to quickly generate a full set of custom phrases — all at runtime.

For more on the Speech framework, check out “Advances in Speech Recognition” from WWDC19.</p>
