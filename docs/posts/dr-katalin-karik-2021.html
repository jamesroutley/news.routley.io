Karikó—with her collaborator, immunologist Drew Weissman, M.D., Ph.D.—believed in its potential to treat stubborn and fatal conditions like strokes and even cancer, hoping that mRNA could be used to program cells to produce their own cures. The two were evangelizers, but their work attracted few converts. Those who knew about it tended to be dismissive: fanciful, nice concept, dead end.</p><figure></figure><p>That morning at the lab, Karikó’s old boss had come to see her off. She did not tell him what a terrible mistake he was making in letting her leave. She didn’t gloat about her future at BioNTech, a pharmaceuticals firm that millions now associate with lifesaving vaccines but was then a relative upstart in the field. Instead the woman who had bounced from department to department, with no tenure prospects and never earning over $60,000 a year, said with total confidence: “In the future, this lab will be a museum. Don’t touch it.”</p><p>Back in 2013 pandemics were the subjects of big-budget blockbusters like <em>Contagion</em> and books about the great influenza of 1918. Few people expected to experience one, and even fewer knew the name of the scientist whose marginalized research would go on to serve as the foundation for some of the most effective vaccines ever made.</p><p>Karikó has never craved fame, nor did she spend decades toiling at the bench for prizes (although she and Weissman have received the Lasker Award, the Horwitz Prize, the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research, and the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in just the past few months). But fine, she has started to take a little pleasure in certain aspects of worldwide renown. First there’s the dream turned real—for her, scientific progress is measured in actual impact. With millions inoculated and the path out of the pandemic charted on the foundation of her research, she has lived to see the purpose in her work. And second, there’s the small, modest delight she takes in the fact that a few weeks before our interview, she ran into the man who’d led her out of her beloved lab at Penn eight years earlier. He told her he was preparing to give a lecture about her.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure></figure><p>“You will talk about me?” she asked him. What about?</p><p>The focus, he said, would be on how he’d missed it—one of the greatest scientific and humanitarian achievements in their lifetimes, and he’d let the woman responsible for it walk out the door.</p><figure></figure><p>Katalin Karikó was born in 1955 in a small town called Kisújszállás. Her father was a butcher; her mother was a bookkeeper. Her childhood was miles in both actual and emotional distance from the immaculate research institutions in which she would later work. But her teachers were good—and interested in her. One helped her class write a letter to Hans Selye, the famed Hungarian Canadian endocrinologist who published some of the first research into stress and its effect on human bodies. Much to Kati’s surprise, Selye wrote back, his letter collapsing the distance between them like a tear in the space-time continuum. She can still remember that feeling of chosenness, as if something bigger was possible for her. It’s one of the reasons Karikó tries to respond to letters that are sent to her, despite her growing responsibilities. She shrugs off the notion that this makes her benevolent or more generous than others in her position. The true explanation is simpler: “I also once received a letter in a small town.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Press her, but be prepared to give in; Karikó will not bow to even the subtlest attempt to steer conversation toward her axis-shifting accomplishments. She answers letters because someone answered hers. She kept going when others might have given up because she loves her work, not because she expected a reward. When her research was put to use in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, she protests that it was her CEO who had the true vision—not her! When she tells me about watching a roomful of health-care workers clap in gratitude after getting the jab, she doesn’t relive their praise or gratitude. She points out their sacrifice—how millions of doctors and nurses worked in hospitals, knowing the risk.</p><p>So don’t expect her to make too much of the barriers she has had to overcome as a woman in science. Granted, her gender made her anomalous. So did the fact that she’s an immigrant. So did her resolution to stick with what she believed to be the power of mRNA when others would have moved on. Ever the stalwart, she talks around the structural obstacles that forced her into unlauded, unsupported work. What’s the point? We’re here now, aren’t we?</p><figure></figure><p>But Karikó does have a proud egalitarian streak, noting that state-run child care allowed her to keep working even as a new mother before she moved to the United States. She believes that if the numbers of women or minorities in science are low, it’s because we don’t know how to nurture the kind of natural instincts that make people good researchers. In villages and towns, countless children and adolescents “can see the beauty of nature and living things,” as she puts it. There are scores of girls who are interested in “how their bodies work, blood pressure, disease.” Each one of them is a budding scientist, but so few of them end up pursuing their natural curiosities. It’s a problem, one Karikó believes is serious. It’s also not something she herself experienced. She learned about mRNA. She was fascinated. It never occurred to her not to pursue it.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>When her daughter, Susan, was still a toddler, Karikó’s funding ran out for the first time. She was working at a Hungarian institution, and so she reached out to researchers across Europe, hoping for a job. No one had a spot in their lab for her. In 1985 she was offered a job at Temple University in Philadelphia—if she could get there. Because the communist government had barred citizens from converting Hungarian cash into other currencies and taking it with them to emigrate, Karikó and her husband, Bela Francia, sold their car and traded the cash for 900 British pounds on the black market. To get past travel checkpoints, the couple sewed the cash into one of Susan’s stuffed animals.</p><p>But when Karikó and Francia arrived in the United States, the couple found out the funding for the position was still in flux. If it didn’t come through, Karikó risked deportation. She was determined to remain in America, so she settled for the job she could get—a researcher post that was just under 150 miles from her new home. She spent the full workweek there, often sleeping in her office, not wanting to rent another place.</p><figure><p><span><p>Dr. Karikó&#39;s binder in which she first recorded her mRNA research.</p>
</span></p></figure><p>“Sometimes she’s come back to me and said, ‘I wish I had been to more of your basketball games,’” Susan remembers. “I remind her, ‘You did everything that you could in that moment, and it meant a lot to me.’” Whatever Karikó did or didn’t do, her absence doesn’t seem to have hampered her daughter’s athletic career. Susan Francia is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in rowing. The sport has given her the perfect metaphor to relate to her mother’s determination: “In rowing, we’re also going backward. We don’t know where the finish line is, but we trust that it’s there and that we’re going to hit those goals.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>And for Karikó, it did often feel like going backward. In experiment after experiment in the 1980s and 1990s, scientists who shared her interest in mRNA encountered the same problem. The cells in their culture dishes—where the first experiments are conducted before the process is replicated in animals and then in humans—died off. The cells didn’t recognize the mRNA that researchers like Karikó were injecting. The material sparked an immune reaction, with inflammation as a persistent and unwelcome side effect.</p><p>Karikó believed there had to be a fix. In 1989 she started working with cardiologist Elliot Barnathan, M.D., at Penn; her title was research assistant professor. It wasn’t a tenure-track job, which meant she needed outside funding to continue her work. With Barnathan, she was determined to devise a solution that would rescue her cells. The two notched a critical success in a joint experiment, but Barnathan soon quit to join a biotech firm, stranding Karikó. She applied for grants. None was approved. A neurosurgeon who’d worked with her appealed to the head of his department: Take her in; give her a chance. She came up with more experiments. None worked. Then that neurosurgeon said he was leaving Penn too.</p><p>Another scientist might have felt orphaned. Karikó could have pitied herself. But she takes far too much pride in her work. With a placid smile, she recounts how someone once introduced her to a group: “Oh, Kati works for me,” he told them. “I said, ‘Oh, Frank. I don’t work for <em>you</em>. Do you think when I come in on Saturday and Sunday, I’m coming <em>for you</em>?” The weekends she spent, the late nights she worked—she did that for her research.</p><figure></figure><p>Karikó knows her peers. Scientists build an experiment and expect a certain result. When the process doesn’t net out as planned, it’s a disappointment. It’s a waste of time and resources. Or at least, that’s how other people think about it. “It <em>seems</em> that the experiment didn’t work,” she tells me. Incorrect! The experiment was in fact a success. It succeeded in showing the scientist how inaccurate her assumptions were.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The “failures” that piled up behind her, all those grants she didn’t get and the positions that evaporated? Each one refined her, sharpened her. She carried on, with a little more intel. Sometimes experiments do proceed as planned, she explains, as if describing a promised land. “But even when it is not going there, it is just as exciting. It is unexpected. What could be causing this result? Could it be this? Could it be that?” Karikó clasps her hands together: “You get a result which cannot be explained. You keep reading!”</p><p>So she kept reading.</p><p>After the neurosurgeon departed, Karikó was once more without a lab or a perch for her research. In the kind of meet-cute that Nora Ephron could have scripted, she bumped into her eventual collaborator at the photocopier. The two introduced themselves, and Karikó identified herself as an mRNA scientist—never mind the fact that her adventures in mRNA had not even come close to leading her to real-world success. Weissman told her he was interested in developing a vaccine for HIV. Karikó said she could make one. She just needed to run a few more experiments.</p><figure><p><span><p>Dr. Karikó delivers a speech after receiving the Princesa de Asturias Award for Scientific and Technical Research.</p>

There was no interest out there for mRNA. But we thought our results were interesting, and we kept working on them.”</p><p>In the Nora Ephron version of scientific breakthrough, this is the part that would be sped up. Upbeat soundtrack, late nights at the lab. Then: Eureka!</p><p>But a slick 90 seconds in movie time doesn’t unfold with the same tempo in an actual lab. The two had found Karikó’s fix. It just took them almost a decade. Weissman landed at Penn in 1997 and Karikó met him soon after. Their paper on how mRNA—manipulated to evade that destructive immune response in humans—might be used to deliver new “instructions” to diseased or otherwise compromised cells wasn’t accepted into a peer-reviewed journal until 2005. There would be room for further improvements. Karikó, Weissman, and other researchers later realized that mRNA coated in lipid nanoparticles would be even more effective. But with that first paper, a new vista started to come into view. It showed the first glimpse of a world in which mRNA could treat not just one disease but, as Weissman told a Canadian magazine, “hundreds, if not thousands, of different diseases.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure></figure><p>Confetti, right? A ticker-tape parade! Prizes! This should have been their moment. Karikó and Weissman—the toast of the biochemical and medical fields! Except the research was published and almost no one paid attention. No fanfare. Stop me if this sounds familiar: No funding.</p><p>Over time the paper found its audience. In building a new venture that planned to use mRNA to develop cancer vaccines, husband-wife scientists Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci and their new firm, a still-small start-up called BioNTech, licensed the work Karikó and Weissman had patented. In 2008, Derrick Rossi, Ph.D., then an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, came across the paper while looking for a solution to cell die-off in his lab. Elaborating on Karikó and Weissman’s research, he published his own research in 2010. With funding raised on the back of that paper, he cofounded an new upstart in the biotech world; he called it Moderna. (Rossi left Moderna in 2014 but remains a booster of Karikó and Weissman’s work. He believes the two should have won the Nobel Prize for their discoveries.)</p><p>In 2013, Şahin recruited Karikó to join BioNTech. She left her lab at Penn and has been there since. After Chinese scientists posted the genetic sequence of the brand-new virus that had been decimating Wuhan in the beginning of 2020, Karikó’s bosses went to work; BioNTech designed its mRNA vaccine in hours. It took Moderna less than a weekend. That’s how science moves—slow, slow, then fast.</p><p>Karikó spends her time with tremendous care now. Too much of it is taken up with emailing; Susan keeps telling her mother that she doesn’t need to respond to all of the people who write to express their individual vaccine hesitancies. But Karikó feels responsible. “The distance between what the average person is knowing about the vaccine and what the science is? The gap is huge,” Karikó says. “Scientists have to learn: You are also a translator.” In each note she includes a link to the latest literature so people can comb through the data on their own.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Because of course while the pandemic stretches on, the papers have continued. Karikó does her best to keep up on how the vaccines are faring—relative to strains that even we civilians have heard of, like delta, as well as other, newer permutations. She finds a kind of refuge in reading the research; it has been her superpower from the start. When she first arrived at Penn, the sheer number of other scientists intimidated her. She hadn’t had as much training; she hadn’t attended institutions as elite or exclusive. She read until she felt that she had something to teach each one of them. Imagine their surprise: “Even on their field, I knew something that they didn’t know.”</p><p>Although Karikó travels often to BioNTech’s German headquarters, she still lives in the house that her husband helped build near Philadelphia. It’s decorated with Susan’s oars and photos of her in competition, wearing Team USA uniforms. In Karikó’s office, evidence of her husband’s woodworking skills peek out from underneath her piles of papers and the occasional flattened Goobers wrapper (her favorite treat). On one side of her desk, a cabinet holds the recent influx of awards as well as the massive, worn binders in which she first recorded her mRNA research. She informs me during our interview that this is time she would otherwise spend reading. The vaccine-related papers drop at a relentless clip. With a smile, she estimates: “We are talking here, and I think I will miss out on 11.”</p><p>But it isn’t just the pandemic that she’s keeping tabs on. For Karikó and Weissman, mRNA’s impact was never supposed to be limited to vaccines. Weissman informs me that he and Karikó “moved on a long time ago.” Weissman is still a professor at Penn; he has about 20 other vaccines he’s interested in. He’s also working on gene therapies for sickle cell anemia and other diseases.</p><p>When I ask him what’s most important to understand about the research, he turns the conversation back to Karikó. “She’s hit more hurdles than probably anybody in any career ever,” he says. “And she persevered, and she continued.”</p><p>Each morning, at home or in Europe, Karikó wakes up and goes for a run. She’s entered several half marathons. She trained for a marathon once. In the winter she’ll sometimes use her daughter’s rowing machine. The exercise is meditative, even when it’s hard. She compares it to her research—that itch to go further and harder and to push herself. “It is just the same what we are doing,” she says. “We want to see. Do we have a limit?”</p><p><strong>Photographed by Lia Clay Miller; styled by Kat Thomas; hair by Daniel Lutz; makeup by Abby Berni; on-set production by JB Creative Productions.</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
