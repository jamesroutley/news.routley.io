    <h1>Cable companies ask 5th Circuit to block FTC&#39;s click-to-cancel rule</h1>

<p>The FTC declined to comment on the lawsuits today. The agency&#39;s rule is not enforced yet, as it is scheduled to take full effect 180 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<h2>Cable firms donâ€™t want canceling to be easy</h2>
<p>The NCTA cable lobby group, which represents companies like Comcast and Charter, have complained about the rule&#39;s impact on their ability to talk customers out of canceling. NCTA CEO Michael Powell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/cable-firms-to-ftc-we-shouldnt-have-to-let-users-cancel-service-with-a-click/">claimed during a January 2024 hearing</a> that &#34;a consumer may easily misunderstand the consequences of canceling and it may be imperative that they learn about better options&#34; and that the rule&#39;s disclosure and consent requirements raise &#34;First Amendment issues.&#34;</p>
<p>The Interactive Advertising Bureau argued at the same hearing that the rule would &#34;restrict innovation without any corresponding benefit&#34; and &#34;constrain companies from being able to adapt their offerings to the needs of their customers.&#34;</p>
<p>The FTC held firm, adopting its proposed rule without major changes. In addition to the click-to-cancel provision, the FTC set out other requirements for &#34;negative option&#34; features in which a consumer&#39;s silence or failure to take action to reject or cancel an agreement is interpreted by the seller as acceptance of an offer.</p>
<p>The FTC said its rule &#34;prohibits misrepresentations of any material fact made while marketing using negative option features; requires sellers to provide important information prior to obtaining consumers&#39; billing information and charging consumers; [and] requires sellers to obtain consumers&#39; unambiguously affirmative consent to the negative option feature prior to charging them.&#34;</p>
<p>The FTC will have to defend its authority to issue the rule in court. The agency decision cites authority under Section 18 of the FTC Act to make &#34;rules that define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive&#34; and &#34;prescribe requirements for the purpose of preventing these unfair or deceptive acts and practices.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,&#34; FTC Chair Lina Khan said. &#34;The FTC&#39;s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.&#34;</p>
