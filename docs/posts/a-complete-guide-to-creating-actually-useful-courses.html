Let’s go.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What makes a great course</h2><p>This is what I asked myself when I was writing this guide, I wanted to write the best resource on the internet on online course creation, and give it all for free.</p><p>‍</p><p>To do so, I worked with someone who has a decade of experience in course creation:</p></div><div><p>Last year, we helped more than 500 course creators launch their first course, and helped many others build more profitable course businesses.</p><p>And we realized that the course creators who were generating the most revenue do a few simple things right:</p><ul role="list"><li>They have a clear <strong>positioning</strong></li><li>They are <strong>engaging</strong> and completing their lessons is <strong>fun</strong></li><li>They give students a sense of <strong>community</strong></li><li>They focus on <strong>action</strong> rather than on vague “knowledge”</li><li>They bring <strong>results</strong> to their students through deliberate practice</li><li>They have <strong>high converting</strong> sales pages and emails campaigns</li></ul><p>Obviously, there are already a bunch of resources online on “how to make an online course”, but they basically boil down to “make some videos and upload them”.</p><p>Maybe that was enough 5 years ago, but it&#39;s not the case anymore.</p><p>That&#39;s why we created this guide. (This, and also to promote SchoolMaker - but more on that later: I promise you that 100% of the info is free and we don’t have a paid course to sell you).</p><p>‍</p><h2>What you will learn</h2><p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to create online courses that:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Stand out from your competitors</strong>Most courses are information dumps, but you can create courses that actually help your students go from point A to point B and guarantee them tangible progress.</li><li><strong>Are community-based</strong></li><li><strong>Establish your expertise in your field</strong>By crafting a course that provides insights and value to people in your field, which can lead to more opportunities.</li></ol><p>If you’re creating your first course, you’ll learn how to do an awesome job on your first try.</p><p>Or if you already have some courses, I’ll show you how to take them to the next level.</p><p>‍</p><p>And let’s be clear about one thing: you don’t need to have all the answers to create a great course.</p><p>As long as you know what you’re trying to get out of this guide and focus on what’s in front of you (like reading the first chapter), you will be able to create a course that can change both your life and your students’.</p></div></div>
