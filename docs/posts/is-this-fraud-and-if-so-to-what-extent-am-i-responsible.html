    <h1>Is this fraud? And if so, to what extent am I responsible?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Have I done anything fraudulent so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  You created a document which contains false, misleading, or inaccurate information, and distributed it to others.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you were explicitly told to do this, if you provided separate information explaining the deception, or if the person you gave it to understood the deception.  At the point that you created and distributed it you expressed a lie to another person.  The creation AND distribution are the key points - if it never left your procession then there&#39;s no problem.  If you didn&#39;t create it then there&#39;s no problem.  Adding your signature to something someone else created is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I take this zoom meeting, and toe the company line , am I committing fraud which I could be personally liable for? (Again, not looking for legal advice, just opinion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use the words &#34;fraud&#34; and &#34;liable&#34; then you are explicitly asking for legal advice.  Consult an attorney. In some areas lying to some government employees could be considered criminal.</p>
<p>If we ignore legal culpability, civil or criminal liability, and just ask, &#34;Is taking the call and maintaining the deception fraudulent?&#34; then the answer is clearly yes.  You are not an actor, paid to play a part in a work of fiction.  You are an expert in your field paid to represent objective facts and professional opinions about a product you financially benefit from.</p>
<p>Carrying on the deception is defrauding those you convey the lie to.</p>
<p>Further, your director is setting you up to take full blame and responsibility.  If the customer buys the product, and never finds out about the fraud, then the director wins a sale and they continue to take risks for financial gain - lying will sometimes net you a sale where it otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p>
<p>If their risk doesn&#39;t pay off and the customer discovers the deception then they merely need to state &#34;My expert told me it was pen-tested, provided this document in answer to the customer&#39;s questions, and then took a call with the customer telling them the same thing.  All the communication I sent was misunderstood - I was never asking them to lie, I understood from their conversations with me that it was pen-tested and I was merely helping them understand how to fill out the form given what they told me in person.&#34;</p>
<p>Keep a paper trail.  Make sure to include others in the company in your communications - always cc one other person in all emails with this director.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don&#39;t want to be a part of this to the directors? And is such an issue worth resigning over?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Send to all directors:</p>
<p>&#34;I incorrectly filled out that document and will contact the customer to retract it.  If you&#39;d prefer to resolve this with the customer please cc the email to me as well so I can clearly document the resolution of the error. I&#39;m happy to meet with the customer at any point to explain the error and the current status of the software including the lack of pen-testing. I&#39;m also happy to discuss possible timelines for pen-testing. I regret the error, and will endeavor in the future to avoid similar errors.&#34;</p>
<p>The company will always seek to protect itself, so making threats of any kind will cause you more problems.  Resigning is a reasonable course of action if the culture of the company allows for such deception in general.  If they&#39;re lying to gain customers then the chances that they&#39;ll lie to you are pretty high.  If this individual appears to be an outlier, and if, during this process of revision and reconciliation, you find others are unhappy with the deception, then it might be worth staying with the company.</p>
<p>If resigning, get a new job first, and hand in your minimum (or two weeks) notice only after you&#39;ve secured another position.  Again, if they&#39;re lying to clients, then you don&#39;t want to give them opportunities to hurt you or your job prospects.</p>
