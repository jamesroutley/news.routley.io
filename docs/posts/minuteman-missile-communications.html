    <h1>Minuteman missile communications</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>A programming note: I am looking at making some changes to how I host things
like Computers Are Bad and <a href="https://wikimap.wiki">wikimap</a> that are going to
involve a lot more recurring expense. For that and other reasons, I want to see
if y&#39;all would be willing to throw some money my way. If everyone reading this
gave $3 a month, we could probably buy Jimbo Wales a nice lunch or something.</p>
<p>I do not intend to paywall anything that I post here. Instead, I&#39;m going to
take some of the things that tend to be very long Mastodon threads (how this
article originally started!) and send them out to supporters, probably about
once a month. They&#39;ll be things that I wouldn&#39;t post here, usually because
they&#39;re too short or don&#39;t quite have a hook to make a while article
interesting.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jbcrawford">consider supporting me on ko-fi</a>---or don&#39;t,
it&#39;s your decision, and I respect that. I&#39;ll probably work a plug into each
article but I promise not to be annoying about it. I&#39;m also going to be making
some new YouTube videos and I&#39;ll probably make those available to supporters
first, so that&#39;s something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Speaking of annoying, this is kind of a long and dry one. I started looking
into something called HICS after visiting a historic site, posted about it a
bit on Mastodon, realized that there just wasn&#39;t a lot of good historic
information about it in general. And I felt like if I was going to talk about
communications in Minuteman missile fields, I also had to cover how they would
get their war orders.</p>
<p>Look on the  bright side: it&#39;s got pictures!</p>

<h2>Minuteman Missiles</h2>
<p>Since the early days of the Cold War, the United States has maintained a
nuclear triad: independent capabilities to deliver nuclear weapons from land,
sea, and air. The sea and air components are straightforward, consisting of
submarines carrying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and
long-range strategic bombers. The land leg is more often forgotten: the
intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.</p>
<p>The US ICBM arsenal currently consists of 400 Minuteman III missiles emplaced
throughout the midwest: the Air Force&#39;s 90th Missile Wing, 150 missiles,
Wyoming Nebraska, and Colorado; the 91st Missile Wing, 150 missiles, in North
Dakota; and the 341st Missile Wing, 100 missiles, in Montana. Historically,
there were as many as 1,000 active Minuteman missiles, to say nothing of
retired missile programs like Titan and Atlas. At least three Minuteman missile
facilities are now historic sites open to the public, a somewhat incongruous
experience considering their broad similarity to the facilities still in active
use. Many others are abandoned, typically in various states of permanent
destruction to satisfy treaty obligations. Fifty Minuteman IIIs of the 341st
are currently held in an inactive &#34;reserve&#34; state, out of service but ready for
future emplacement, a notable situation given the strict limits Cold War
treaties place on stockpiled ICBMs.</p>
<p>Minuteman employed a significantly different launch configuration from earlier
ICBM programs. Large facilities were difficult to protect from a first strike;
distance was the only effective protection from increasingly accurate Soviet
weapons. Scattered single facilities were difficult and costly to staff.
Minuteman selected a compromise point: clusters of ten independent Launch
Facilities (LFs), spaced miles apart and called a &#34;flight,&#34; are remotely
monitored and operated from a single Missile Alert Facility (MAF). Groups of
four to five missile flights constitute a squadron, and about four squadrons
compose a wing, which is supported by an Air Force Base.</p>
<p>In each Missile Alert Facility, a Missile Combat Crew Commander (MCCC) and
Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander (DMCCC) lock themselves into an
underground capsule called a Launch Control Center (LCC) for each 24 hour
watch. Originally designed by Boeing, the LCC resembles the interior of an
aircraft more than a building, fitting its crew of Air Force officers. The
LCC is an isolated, self-contained system with all of the equipment needed to
monitor, configure, and launch the missiles. A surface building above contains
a security control center and quarters for the security force, responsible not
only for the MAF but also for the ten LFs under its supervision. Still, the
surface building is both powerless over and largely unneeded by the LCC beneath
it. In the event of nuclear war, it was assumed, surface structures in these
sparsely populated but strategically critical parts of the country would be
wiped cleanly away from the earth. Only the hardened infrastructure would
remain: the LCCs, the LFs, and communications infrastructure.</p>
<p><img alt="Missile Alert Facility" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/quebec.jpg"/></p>
<p>Minuteman missile combat crews had more duties than just to wait. They
performed remote tests on the missiles, launch, and control equipment; they
monitored alarm systems that reported malfunctions and remotely supervised the
work of maintenance crews; and they monitored the security systems that
protected the unmanned LFs, authorizing access and dispatching security forces
on the surface to any unknown intrusion. Still, their primary responsibility,
the one for which we all know them, is the disposition of Emergency War Orders
(EWO).</p>
<p>In fine Air Force tradition, actions that may very well presage the end of the
world a we know it are presented in the form of a checklist. EWOs are
authenticated against codes and secrets. Two keys, just like in the movies, are
inserted. The missiles are enabled by remote command. Targeting information is
transmitted to the missiles. The keys are turned, the launch code sent, and the
rest is automated, under the control of the missiles themselves. The missile
crew are miles away, so the Real Thing, the Shit Hitting the Fan, must feel
pretty anticlimactic. The only apocalyptic horsemen they&#39;ll see are a series of
indicator lights on the MCCC&#39;s console: LCH CMD. LCH IN PROC. MISSILE AWAY.</p>
<p>The realities of ICBM operation are fascinating and incline one towards drama.
Somehow the work of submarine and bomber crews seems more ordinary; they are at
least &#34;out there,&#34; in or near enemy territory. Missile crews are sealed in a
very small room buried below a small building in a corner cut out of a farm
field near, but not too near, to a highway for logistical convenience. They are
entirely dependent on electronic communications, not only to receive their
orders, but even to use their weapons. They have the original email job: since
1962, they have served primarily to send and receive messages, mostly by text.</p>
<p>With the rather purple introduction complete, I am going to talk about this
communications technology. But first, just a little more preface.</p>
<p>Most of the reduction of the Minuteman force has been a direct response to
treaties, which imposed progressively lower caps on the nuclear stockpile.
Some reductions were more of a historical accident. In the 1980s, political
considerations lead to a decision to &#34;temporarily&#34; deploy the Peacekeeper
missile, with 10 MIRV (multiple independent reentry vehicle) warheads, to a set
of fifty silos of the 90th Missile Wing&#39;s 400th Missile Squadron, in Wyoming.
The Peacekeeper, fielded late in the Cold War, was a profoundly controversial
program. The fifty Peacekeepers retrofitted into Minuteman silos would be the
only ever installed, and their temporary homes became permanent. Most of the
missile&#39;s warheads were removed for compliance with Start II treaty, which
Russia never ratified and the United States withdrew from. Still, for
cost-savings reasons, the odd-duck Peacekeeper program was terminated. The last
Peacekeeper missiles were retired in 2005.</p>
<p>I got it into my head to write a detailed description of the missile field
communications system because of my visit to QUEBEC-01, one of the five MAFs
associated with these Peacekeeper missiles, and now a Wyoming State Historical
Site. For that reason, I will most closely describe the communications system
as installed in the 90th Missile Wing, the remainder of which is still active
today. Minuteman missile fields were built over a period of years by different
contractors and have since been through multiple modernization programs. Each
change has introduced inconsistencies. While I will point out some of the more
interesting variations between Minuteman installations, this is best taken as a
description of the &#34;average&#34; Minuteman squadron, one that is typical of the
others but does not exactly exist.</p>
<p>Although I am not exactly aiming for academic rigor, this information is based
mostly on documents available through the Defense Technical Information Center,
which include both original documentation from the Minuteman program and more
recent documents related to modernization programs, proposed changes, and the
retirement of many Minuteman facilities. I have supplemented those documents
with recollections by former Air Force personnel when available, and as always,
I welcome any corrections or additional information. One of the pleasures of
writing about military history is the tendency of veterans to reach out to me
with corrections and stories; I apologize that I am not always good about
getting back to people, particularly phone calls.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III, a fairly direct evolution of the original Minuteman
design, is still in active service. Many detailed materials about the
Minuteman program are probably currently classified, most of the others are
formerly classified and thus have not consistently made their way to archives.
Certain basic questions remain frustratingly unanswered. That&#39;s just how it
goes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also going to try really hard not to be too annoying with the acronyms, but
it&#39;s not easy.</p>
<h2>Personnel</h2>
<p>While there were originally three-person crews, Minuteman LCCs have had two
crew members for many decades, the MCCC and DMCCC. The MCCC is superior to the
DMCCC, but the nature of missile operations and such a small crew mean that
their roles are somewhat more complex than commander and deputy. Missile crews
operate according to the &#34;two-person concept,&#34; a general prohibition on any
person working alone. This rule is intended to improve safety, reduce mistakes,
and most importantly, mitigate the risk of an unauthorized launch. There are
additional safeguards against unauthorized launch in the Minuteman system which
will be discussed later. Both the MCCC and the DMCCC are required to initiate a
launch.</p>
<p>The MCCC sits at a console that is focused around monitoring and control of the
launch facilities. They have ready access to procedures and documentation. The
DMCCC sits at a separate console that is focused on communications. Their chair
slides on rails, allowing them to access the equipment racks and teleprinters
to the sides of the DMCCC position. The DMCCC is primarily responsible for
communications, so we are most interested in the equipment under their control.</p>
<p>Missile Alert Facilities were designed with a goal of self-containment for
survivability. Most communications equipment is within the LCC itself, readily
available to the DMCCC so that they can at least diagnose problems, if not make
a repair. To this end, DMCCCs receive significant training on technical details
of the communications and computer systems.</p>
<p>Should a problem occur outside of the LCC, the MCC would request assistance
from the Air Force Base. Several Air Force ratings had expertise in
communications equipment, ranging from communications technicians that would
investigate problems within the LF to cable splicers that would repair damage
in the outside plant.</p>
<p>The Minuteman program is somewhat unusual in the extensive construction of
long-distance communications equipment by the Air Force.  AT&amp;T&#39;s role in the
missile fields was surprisingly limited; most communications followed routes
fully under the control of the Air Force.</p>
<h2>External Communications</h2>
<p>We can generally divide Minuteman communications systems into two categories:
external and internal. External communications systems are primarily used by
the Missile Combat Crew (MCC) to receive orders, including Emergency War Orders
authorizing the use of nuclear weapons. Internal communications systems are
used within the missile field, primarily to allow the MCC to communicate with
the launch facilities under their control. Some details blur the lines: for
example, there are communications systems which allow the MCC to contact their
Air Force Base, where support facilities and maintenance crews are found. I
will consider these internal systems, but you could argue for the opposite.</p>
<p>The external communications systems available to Minuteman crews have varied
over time. Perhaps the most exotic was the Survivable Low Frequency
Communications System (SLFCS), based on the LF equipment used by the Navy for
communications with submarines. Missile facilities are not underwater, but
nuclear detonations cause significant disruption to the atmosphere that greatly
interferes with radio propagation in the HF range. LF communications are
expected to be less affected in a nuclear combat environment. SLFCS
specifically operated between 14kHz and 60kHz. Some, but not all, Minuteman
MAFs were equipped with a magnetic loop antenna, about 6&#39; in diameter,  buried
shallowly underground.</p>
<p>All MAFs were equipped with HF antennas, although they were decommissioned in
the 1980s. The HF antennas are described as hardened, but it is not feasible to
truly harden an HF antenna. They must be fairly large, and HF does not
penetrate the ground well, making it impractical to bury them. Instead,
hardened HF antennas are perhaps better described as &#34;hidden&#34; HF antennas.  The
typical design is a monopole that stores in a long, narrow silo underground,
awaiting post-attack deployment. MAFs had two separate hardened HF antennas,
one for transmit, and one for receive.</p>
<p>The receive antenna was the most critical, as it would be needed to receive war
orders over the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS). HFGCS is
one of the primary ways that an Emergency War Order would be distributed to Air
Force units including both missiles and bombers. The hardened HF receive
antenna assembly actually included six 160&#39; monopoles: one was extended for
normal use, but in the event of nuclear attack, the five others were stored
telescoped in a silo about 30&#39; deep and could be deployed by a small explosive
charge. There were, in the parlance apparently used by the Air Force, five
&#34;reloads.&#34;</p>
<p>The HF transmit antenna, being less important in an attack scenario, had only
one replacement. A &#34;soft&#34; HF transmit antenna of conventional design was in normal
use but backed up by a single 120&#39; hardened antenna stored in a separate silo.
A 50&#39; radius buried ground plane surrounded the hardened antenna.</p>
<p>Near the MAF surface building, a small, white metal cone protrudes from the
ground. The cone consists of a huge cast steel blast deflector with a
depression in the center, which is covered by a fiberglass cone. The cone
houses a compact UHF antenna. This antenna, a 1970s upgrade, can receive war
orders via several satellite systems or directly from an aircraft such as the
E-6. The E-6 airborne command post can serve in various roles, including as a
&#34;Looking Glass&#34; airborne command post (taking control of nuclear forces in the
event of a loss of ground-based command posts) or a &#34;TACAMO&#34; Take Charge and
Move Out relay, transmitting a war order from elsewhere to forces in the field.
UHF communications are essentially line of sight, especially with the use of a
partially in-ground hardened antenna.</p>
<p><img alt="Hardened UHF antenna" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/uhf.jpg"/></p>
<p>In a scenario with extensive loss of communications infrastructure,
particularly with ASAT warfare disabling military communications satellites, an
E-6 or another similarly equipped aircraft could fly over Minuteman missile
fields and deliver an emergency war order directly to each LCC.</p>
<p>Complimenting this capability, in-service Minuteman launch facilities have
themselves been equipped with a similar UHF antenna. Looking Glass and TACAMO
aircraft actually have Air Force missileers on board who serve as an Airborne
Launch Control Center (ALCC). In the event of a loss of most of the LCCs in a
missile field, an ALCC can issue launch instructions directly to each LF
without any need for the regular missile crews or internal communications
infrastructure.</p>
<p>During the early &#39;90s, a super high frequency (SHF) small satellite terminal
was installed at each active MAF. It is housed in a small, white radome at the
top of a pole near the surface building. SHF is widely used by modern military
satellite systems, such as the Air Force&#39;s Wideband Global SATCOM.</p>
<p><img alt="Satellite terminal" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/sat.jpg"/></p>
<p>Each of these antennas is connected by buried conduits to radio equipment in
the LCC&#39;s radio racks. At the DMCCC&#39;s position, the telephone console allows
the DMCCC to talk or listen on each radio by selecting it with a pushbutton.
Over time, the radios were also attached to more modern digital systems.
Depending on the year, teleprinters or computer displays would receive text
messages via the UHF and SHF radio systems.</p>
<p>The external radio systems were actually all backup or secondary. The primary
means of nuclear C2 within the Strategic Air Command and, later, Global Strike
Command, has long been a digital computer network. While Minuteman
installations began with just a teleprinter to receive orders via leased
telephone line, the late &#39;60s saw the introduction of the Strategic Automated
Command and Control System (SACCS), which was itself replaced by the Strategic
Air Command Digital Network (SACDIN). A small (for the era) computer in a rack
to the right of the DMCCC&#39;s station allowed two-way messaging with SAC
headquarters over leased telephone lines. Reportedly, these and other Bell
System telephone lines to LCCs were carried by buried telephone cable to small
hardened exchange buildings serving each missile field. I have not yet
researched this topic closely.</p>
<p>In Peacekeeper LCCs as well as Minuteman LCCs from the &#39;70s to the &#39;90s, the
specific computer used for this purpose was called the Command Data Buffer
(CDB). The CDB was connected to both SACCS/SACDIN and the internal
communications network, in order to accurately relay targeting information to
the missiles. This will be discussed later in the context of rapid retargeting.
In the 1990s, the REACT system was installed for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>Quebec-01 LCC was equipped with a teleprinter with a selector between SACDIN
and AFSAT (UHF satellite) receivers. I&#39;m not sure why the teleprinter was
retained after the CDB upgrade, very possibly just for redundancy.</p>
<p><img alt="SACDIN Teleprinter" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/teleprinter.jpg"/></p>
<p>Somewhere between external and internal, each LCC had access to two dial
telephone lines. These connected directly to the PSTN. Some circumstantial
evidence leads me to think these dial lines were shared with the surface
building, which probably explains the need for two.  The dial lines were mostly
used to contact support crews at the Air Force Base for routine maintenance
issues.</p>
<h2>HICS Digital Communications</h2>
<p><img alt="HICS cable splice" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/cable.jpg"/></p>
<p>I was most interested in the internal communications systems, which have
garnered less historical documentation than the external links. In most cases,
there is only really one: the Hardened Intersite Cable System, HICS.</p>
<p>HICS consists of multipair pressurized telephone cables trenched between
Minuteman facilities. HICS carries digital traffic for C2, and many Air Force
documents use the term &#34;HICS&#34; exclusively to mean the digital channel, but the
same cables carried multiple voice pairs. Let&#39;s consider the digital capability
first, though.</p>
<p>HICS, as originally installed, operated at 1.3Kbps. Details on the actual
encoding are hard to come by, but given the time period I assume it was
generally similar to the AFSK schemes used by other early telephone data links.
The punch line, of course, is that the 1.3Kbps stuck---based on some Air Force
journal articles on options for upgrades, it seems that contemporary Minuteman
III fields still communicate over HICS at 1.3Kbps. Remember that when we get to
retargeting.</p>
<p>The topology of the digital HICS network is rather interesting. It was designed
for redundancy and reliability, but prior to most of our modern understanding
of computer networking. There&#39;s a mix of a few different ideas.</p>
<p>One of the things I&#39;m not completely confident of is the size of the collision
domain within HICS, or how much of the cable network was a common bus. From
reading between the lines of some different reports and considering the overall
design, I&#39;m fairly confident that the entire digital HICS network was a single
shared bus within each flight, and I think it is likely that it was a shared
bus within each squadron. This bus would be tens of miles long with multiple
branches, a challenging electrical situation that perhaps explains why the Air
Force has repeatedly found it to be infeasible to make HICS faster.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS cable map" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://minutemanmissile.com">minutemanmissile.com</a> for this image
of the Warren AFB/90th Missile Wing HICS map, which is far more legible
than the photo I had taken.</p>
<p>Each of the LCCs, denoted in the map by open rectangles, is connected to four
&#34;loops&#34; of HICS cable. The legs of adjacent loops to the LCC are shared,
though, so it&#39;s perhaps easier to describe this way: each LCC is surrounded by
a ring of HICS cable, to which it is connected by four legs spread roughly 90
degrees apart. This design gives a fair amount of redundancy, a break anywhere
in the ring or even breaks of more than one of the LCC&#39;s legs would still leave
a working path.</p>
<p>This latter scenario was probably one of the designer&#39;s greatest concerns, as
the LCCs would be obvious targets for inbound nuclear attacks. The cable layout
provides four-times redundancy on the cables to the LCC, but no redundancy at
all on the cables to individual LFs. That tells you a lot about their threat
modeling. Facilities were spaced far enough apart that a precision strike on an
LF would probably disable only that single LF; a precision strike on an LCC,
though, could potentially disable ten LFs at once. As the accuracy and power of
nuclear warheads improved, it seemed more likely that a first strike would
succeed in disabling at least some LCCs. A lot of the complexity of HICS is
intended to account for that possibility.</p>
<p>Each of the LFs is connected to the ring via a single leg. In some cases,
multiple LFs are along the same leg. These are often the same long runs that
connect the rings of two different LCCs together. In general, each LCC ring is
connected to two of its neighbors, although sometimes it will instead have two
redundant connections to a single neighbor. Based on the map and situation on
the ground, these inter-flight connections don&#39;t seem to have required any
active equipment, only a splice case. That supports the theory that an entire
squadron was a shared bus, although it&#39;s possible that a separate pair to the
&#34;foreign&#34; LCC ring would home-run to the LCC to allow separately sending
messages to either. The network doesn&#39;t seem to have that kind of selective
routing capability, though, so I find it unlikely.</p>
<p>Digital messages do seem to have been packetized, and were distributed through
the network on a &#34;flood fill&#34; basis. That is, every active node on the digital
network repeated every message it received. You might wonder about flow control
and the avoidance of cycles; only a very primitive method was used. Each node,
after transmitting a message, would &#34;lock out&#34; the cable it was transmitted on
for a long enough period for the node on the other end to finish repeating the
message.</p>
<p>This explanation is a little more difficult to understand, though, when applied
to the actual layout of the HICS system. What exactly constitutes a node? You
will note that the map distinctly shows intersquadron connections, with both
thicker lines and open circles where they connect to an LCC ring. My theory is
that these intersquadron connections where the only places where active
repeating of messages was required. Whether or not repeating messages between
squadrons was selective is unclear. Did a message from an LCC to one of its
nearby LFs get repeated across squadrons to the opposite end of the field?  If
repeating had originally been completely non-selective, I suspect that was
changed as part of the work done to facilitate retargeting.</p>
<p>We can infer certain things about the HICS network from the equipment in
Quebec-01.  For example, HICS must have had a fair number of active repeaters.
along a path.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS diagnostic panel" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics_equip.jpg"/></p>
<p>Inside of the LCC, we find something like a tiny long-distance telephone test
desk. A rack includes pressurization alarms for five cables (we know of four
legs to the LCC ring, is the fifth perhaps a cable to the local telephone
exchange?), and a fault isolation panel. When a cable seemed to have been lost,
the DMCCC could use this panel to locate the problem along the cable. This
probably relied on a loopback test feature of the repeaters, but I&#39;m not sure
exactly the operating principle. Further down in the rack is what appears to
be a cable power supply.</p>
<p>Repeaters were definitely installed inside the LCCs, but the number of
selections on this test panel makes me suspect that there were also in-line
repeaters on the cable, perhaps taking power from that power supply. This is
entirely speculative, but A repeaters may have been located along the LCC ring
and B repeaters on legs, making the two-knob selector arrangement useful to
test a specific repeater on a specific leg.</p>
<p><img alt="HICS termination point" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/hics_term.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the equipment side of the LCC, where the generator and chiller are located,
we also find the terminations of the HICS cables. Note the mostly empty rack
that would have held repeater equipment, and the air dryer and flow gauges
for cable pressurization.</p>
<p>Finally, I should talk a bit about the exception to all of this: the 321st
Missile Wing, in North Dakota, was built later than the 90th and 91st and by a
different contractor. Sylvania, not Boeing, won the bid to build the LCCs and
LFs. Much of the equipment is the same, but Sylvania did inject a few of their
own ideas, and one of them was radio redundancy for HICS. The 321st apparently
had a simplified HICS topology; I&#39;m not sure of the details but I would guess
that they may not have provided the four redundant cables to each LCC.</p>
<p>To make up for it, each LCC and LF in the 321st is equipped with a large,
buried antenna, a grid-like arrangement of crossing dipoles that took up an
area similar to the sewage lagoons outside of the fence. These antennas made up
a medium-frequency, ground-wave communications network that could be used as an
alternative to HICS. The 321sts redundant radio system, apparently called
&#34;Deuce&#34; at the time, could be viewed as a precursor to the later nationwide
GWEN radio C2 network. It seems to have carried the same digital messages as
HICS, and the DMCCC had selectors to choose whether messages would be sent by
cable or radio.</p>
<h2>HICS Voice Communications</h2>
<p>Now, let&#39;s take a close look at the DMCCC&#39;s communications console, which tells
us a lot about the voice capabilities.</p>
<p><img alt="DMCCC communications console" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/telephone.jpg"/></p>
<p>They get a lot of buttons! There appear to be two separate busses, I&#39;m not
completely sure of the significance of that layout. I know from an airman&#39;s
anecdote that the DMCCCs could conference together LF phones and the dial
telephone lines, and sometimes did so that maintenance crews stuck at an LF
overnight could make apologies to their families. This makes me think that it
is not a matter of &#34;one selection per bus,&#34; but rather probably indicates that
lines can only be joined within a bus. The logic behind that design is not
clear to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#39;s see if we know enough to explain all of these buttons. Some are
easy: for the speaker and handset, there are selectors each of the radios.
The &#34;LF Lines&#34; correspond to each of the ten LFs, numbered 2-11 since the LCC
is numbered as site 1. We see the two dial lines, regular telephone lines
provided at each site, and they are even labeled with their phone numbers. The
five-digit notation dates this hand-written addition to the 2L-5N era, which
probably persisted unusually late in rural Wyoming.</p>
<p>The rest of the buttons correspond to specific pairs that would emerge in
different places in the HICS network. The &#34;SCC&#34; button likely allows
communications with the security command center in the surface building, just
up the elevator from the LCC. The &#34;LCC&#34; button I am less sure of; perhaps it
was a party line of other LCCs in the squadron?  The &#34;LCC Ring&#34; selections must
correspond to the four HICS cable rings extending from the LCC, but I&#39;m not
sure which devices would be found on those pairs. They may be &#34;order wires,&#34;
available in the splice boxes and as jacks at sites and normally used only by
maintenance crews working on cables outside of the LFs.</p>
<p>The EWO buttons are interesting. EWO is, of course, Emergency War Order, but in
the context of Minuteman was also the term used for party lines connecting the
Air Force Base to the LCCs. These could be used, of course, as a redundant way
to deliver EWOs, as well as for general communications across the missile
field. There are two for redundancy: one was routed via AT&amp;T infrastructure,
following a cable from the LCC to a telephone exchange. The other was routed
via HICS. I am not sure why only one merits a &#34;RNG&#34; button, that could apply
ringing voltage to get the attention of other stations.</p>
<p>I am assuming, by the magic of speculation, that the &#34;OPR&#34; button on the left
of each bus probably selected which bus the headset was connected to. There is
also a dial, for use with the dial lines.</p>
<p>These voice connections within the field were of critical importance because of
Minuteman&#39;s strict security posture. The unattended LFs were equipped with
intrusion alarms for physical security, initially a bistatic radar system more
similar to that used at Titan, and later a DSP-based monostatic radar system
called the IMPSS. Any personnel or, reportedly, large rabbits approaching an LF
would cause an alarm, and security forces were dispatched to investigate unless
the intruder used a HICS voice circuit to authenticate themselves to the LCC.
The process of &#34;penetrating&#34; a secure LF could take a missile crew thirty
minutes or more, and involved multiple calls to the LCC as different alarms
were triggered.</p>
<h2>HICS Outside Plant</h2>
<p>Old aerial images and historical documents from the Air Force give us some
insight into the construction of HICS. HICS cables were installed in open
trenches and then covered, rather than placed directly with a vibratory plow as
would become common later. Splices were done in large holes with scotch-lok
connectors and cast iron splice casings. Over time, many of the splice casings
had to be replaced due to premature corrosion, and different materials were
tried before settling on brass. A cathodic protection system was installed
as a permanent solution to the problem.</p>
<p>I have done my best to trace some of the HICS cables along their routes. The
holes used for splicing are sometimes visible as scars, but it does not appear
that any manholes were installed; instead splices were made near RoW markers
and will have to be excavated for repairs. The lack of manholes suggests that
there may not be active equipment along the cable routes, I&#39;m not really sure.</p>
<p>The RoW markers used by the Air Force are substantially similar to the style
used by AT&amp;T at the time. They are round wooden posts, about 6&#39; tall, with
metal bands around the top. Unlike AT&amp;T, the Air Force used white bands, and it
seems that there are always two. Shorter markers are used in some places, I
suspect where there are splice cases not near road crossings. Where the cables
cross roads, the Air Force usually installed gates with sturdy metal posts in
the roadside fences. Sometimes these gates are the easiest evidence to find in
aerial photos.</p>
<p>One of my biggest questions is about the inter-squadron relays. The map depicts
them as nodes, but they aren&#39;t located at LFs or other facilities. I wondered
if there might be active equipment, but I found one of the locations where in
inter-squadron cable takes off from an LCC ring and there is no indication of
even a manhole. In case you might be interested, <a href="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/90th-mw.kmz">here is a KML</a>
with the cable tracks I have worked out so far.</p>
<h2>Cross-Flight Communications</h2>
<p>HICS served primarily to allow an LCC to communicate within the ten missiles
in its flight. However, the entire squadron and then the entire missile wing
were interconnected, and Minuteman took advantage of this capability for
several purposes.</p>
<p>First, a specific LCC in each squadron was designated as the Squadron Command
Post (SCP). The SCP was capable of sending launch orders to any missile within
the squadron, and of countermanding launch orders issued by any of the
squadron&#39;s LCCs. This provided a measure of protection against a destroyed or
compromised LCC.</p>
<p>Over time, the security of Minuteman missiles was further enhanced by the
addition of a &#34;vote to launch&#34; system. Minuteman missiles can only be launched
if launch orders are sent by at least two LCCs, requiring a total of four
individuals.</p>
<p>In some Minuteman fields (and all current fields), a Wing command post serves
in a role similar to the SCP but across the entire wing. It provides one
central point where the entire wing&#39;s missile inventory can be monitored and,
if necessary, controlled.</p>
<h2>Alarms</h2>
<p>Besides missile C2 and voice communications, one of the main functions of the
HICS was the reporting of alarms within unattended LFs to the LCC. Some alarms,
particularly related to the missile itself, would be sent by the missile
guidance computer over the HICS digital network. These alarms would be printed
by the teleprinter below the DMCCC&#39;s desk, along with confirmations of commands
received and other routine traffic.</p>
<p>There was also a second, dedicated alarm system called the Voice Reporting
Status Assembly or VRSA. VRSA seems to have relied on its own pairs in the HICS
cables, and resembled the simple alarm reporting telephones coming into use by
AT&amp;T. The DMCCC could select an LF and press a button to send a tone, which
triggered a device at the LF to &#34;read back&#34; any status alarms via voice
recordings. At the time this almost certainly involved some interesting
magnetic tape equipment, but I haven&#39;t found much information on the LF end of
the VRSA. Toggle switches on the VRSA console allowed the DMCCC to reset the
alarm device in the LF, clearing any recorded alarms that weren&#39;t active.</p>
<p>The VRSA was an upgrade over the original Minuteman installations, which used a
very similar panel to send a safe/arm tone to the LFs as part of the launch
process. Since part of standard testing practice was for DMCCCs to flip the
toggle switch for an LF to remove the &#34;safe&#34; tone and arm the site, it was a
fairly obvious evolution to have the site report any faults in response to a
tone. Reportedly, the VRSA panels were the original safe/arm panels with
modifications.</p>
<h2>Retargeting</h2>
<p>When Minuteman was originally installed, each missile&#39;s targeting data was
loaded from tape using equipment in the LF. To retarget a missile, a
maintenance crew had to travel to the site, access it, run the new target tape
through equipment in the LF that sent the data to the guidance computer, and
complete a recalibration of the inertial reference platform in the missile.
This was something like a 12-hour process overall, and retargeting a squadron
would take weeks.</p>
<p>Fixed targets were practical when the &#34;enemy&#34; was self-evidently the Soviet
Union and any attack would be all-out. Over the 70-year lifespan of the
Minuteman program, though, the geopolitical and military environment has
changed. There are now other nuclear adversaries, and their military assets are
increasingly mobile. The biggest challenge to Minuteman&#39;s targeting was the
Soviet Union&#39;s development of road-mobile ICBMs like the RT-21.  To eliminate
the USSR&#39;s nuclear capability, we would have to fire on these mobile systems
wherever they were located. Aerial and satellite surveillance could be
surprisingly effective in keeping track of these large, slow-moving TELs, but
the Minuteman missiles could not be retargeted to keep up with that
intelligence.</p>
<p>In response, a series of enhancements were made (often as part of the Minuteman
II program) to introduce &#34;rapid retargeting.&#34; Rapid retargeting allowed the
missiles to be retargeted from within the LCC. During the 1970s, a computer
system called the Command Data Buffer (CDB) was installed in each LCC. The CDB
could receive targeting parameters from SAC and then transmit them to the LFs.
It was theoretically possible to retarget missiles shortly before launch. In
practice, the &#34;shortly&#34; wasn&#39;t very achievable</p>
<p><img alt="DMCCC station with CDB" src="https://computer.rip/f/minuteman/dmccc.jpg"/></p>
<p>The HICS network was capable of 1.3Kbps, and because of the &#34;flood&#34; design of
the network, that was essentially 1.3Kbps of total capacity across a single
collision domain. In other words, only 1.3Kbps of total traffic could be
handled, with far less available from point to point when the network is under
heavy use. Further, enhancements to the Minuteman system added cryptographic
authentication of messages over HICS and, later, encryption of the messages
themselves. The added overhead of the cryptographic system further reduced
network capacity.</p>
<p>Retargeting a squadron of Minuteman missiles via the CDB took over 20 hours.
Retargeting a single missile could take 30 minutes.</p>
<p>CDB represented a major step forward in Minuteman C2, particularly with its
real-time messaging capability. Retargeting was still a severely limited
capability, though. </p>
<p>During the 1990s, active Minuteman sites were upgraded to the Rapid Execution
and Combat Targeting System, or REACT. More than just an upgrade for
retargeting, REACT brought a completely new control system that significantly
changed the layout of LCCs. Instead of sitting at opposite ends of the tube,
REACT put the MCCC and DMCCC directly alongside each other and centralized
almost all control functionality onto computer displays.</p>
<p>It also further refined retargeting: retargeting an entire squadron now takes
only ten hours. More radically, though, a single missile can be retargeted in
only a couple of minutes, making it feasible to retarget a missile just before
firing in a limited attack scenario.</p>
<h2>The future of HICS</h2>
<p>While both over budget and behind schedule, the Sentinel program is expected to
replace the Minuteman missiles. Sentinel will likely be an in-place upgrade,
installing new missiles and control systems in the existing Minuteman silos.
It has been clear for decades now that HICS isn&#39;t capable of meeting modern
expectations, so Sentinel will include a complete replacement.</p>
<p>Various options including DSL over HICS cables and radio were considered, but
the current plan is to trench new fiber-optic cables across the launch fields.
They&#39;re less interesting, but fiber optic cables have both capacity and
reliability advantages over telephone cables, and could easily remain in
service for the life of the Sentinel program.</p>
