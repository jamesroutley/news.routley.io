    <h1>Self-published Ansible book – 87k copies, 300k revenue, 41 revisions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I just published the 41st revision of my self-published book <a href="https://www.ansiblefordevops.com">Ansible for DevOps</a>, which has sold 87,234 copies as of this writing across LeanPub, Amazon (Kindle and paperback), and iBooks.</p>

<p>There are multiples of that number of eBooks downloaded, as I&#39;ve never DMCA&#39;ed the sites that re-host the book illegally. I just... provide new and better versions. People who download the illegal copies know they can come to me for the best reading experience. Plus, I provide free updates forever for anyone who&#39;s purchased or gotten the book free on LeanPub.</p>

<p>My self-published book earned $300,000+ in revenue over the past 9 years, and still earns enough every month to pay my health insurance bill (sans deductible)—which has soared to beyond $2,000/month! (Living with a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/crohns-disease-takes-its-toll-back-2023">pre-existing condition</a> in the USA is... bad.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had multiple offers to license the book through traditional publishers, but every one was a raw deal for me as an author. I earn between 30-80% of each book sale (depending on the channel), and the publishers&#39; deals paled in comparison—at best 5-10% royalties, and that&#39;s <em>after</em> the revenue surpasses the advance royalty payment. Unless you&#39;re the next Steven King, <strong>traditional book publishing is not a route to sustainable writing income</strong>.</p>

<p>I am transparent in reporting my work, as I rely on the support of sponsors on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy">GitHub</a> to sustain my work and open source development.</p>

<p>In fact, I finally completed the open-sourcing of my book&#39;s manuscript (all the code examples were free and open source from the start)—the book is now licensed as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, meaning if Red Hat likes, they could take my book, and republish it in its entirety, and even sell that downstream copy, and I am okay with that. They are free to do that, as long as they abide by the license and share it with the same license.</p>

<p>Here are some metrics which I hope you may find useful—especially if you are considering writing your own book.</p>

<h2>Amazon and KDP dominate</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-ansible-for-devops-sales-per-channel.png" width="700" height="431" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-2ddb999b-b542-4673-ad23-e95647ab7991" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;2ddb999b-b542-4673-ad23-e95647ab7991&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Ansible for DevOps - Sales per channel"/></p>

<p>I started publishing my book on LeanPub, because I like the philosophy as publishing as you write. Readers can get value from the book even before it&#39;s complete, and putting your work out there early gives validation about what parts of the work are more valued than others.</p>

<p>Kind of the &#39;move fast and break things&#39; philosophy, applied to a creative endeavor.</p>

<p>But once I published the first complete edition of the book to Amazon&#39;s bookstore, sales exploded—and have not let up. The book went into the top of the Linux-related Amazon rankings a few times in its lifetime, and despite Amazon&#39;s practices, it seems the majority of book readers find there way to that store.</p>

<p>I published on iBooks just to see what that could get, and... surprisingly there are still 10-20 people every month on that tiny platform who buy the book!</p>

<p>LeanPub is where I&#39;ve given away the book for free numerous times—that&#39;s why you see those off-the-charts spikes—but it has also been a reliable source of sales over the years.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/ansible-for-devops-leanpub-bestseller-3.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-4be661e4-2727-482c-b565-19a74fd9651a" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;4be661e4-2727-482c-b565-19a74fd9651a&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Ansible for DevOps - Bestsellers All Time number 3"/></p>

<p>I never thought Ansible for DevOps would be so popular (it&#39;s now the <a href="https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=book&amp;sort=bestsellers_lifetime">#3 bestseller all-time</a> on LeanPub). In fact, I originally set a goal to have 100 readers by the time I completed writing the book.</p>

<h2>Revenue: Significant, not life-changing</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-ansible-for-devops-royalties-per-month-full.png" width="700" height="432" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-850049f6-b739-4dae-8240-a99f0af022d7" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;850049f6-b739-4dae-8240-a99f0af022d7&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Ansible for DevOps - Royalties per month (total)"/></p>

<p>Total revenue on the book surpassed $300,000 this year. Averaged over 10 years, that is $30,000/year, which is not insignificant.</p>

<p>My salary as a software developer was multiples of that, however, so if I calculate my hourly earnings as a salaried employee versus the book income, I would barely be able to afford health insurance for my family of six—much less the $14,000 deductible we pay on top of that! Unless you are a serial author, or write multiple bestsellers, it is incredibly hard to write for a living, even without a family.</p>

<p>In addition, my writing is only useful inasmuch as it instructs. The chief complaint against some of the other introductory Ansible books is &#34;this is about on par with the documentation, but it doesn&#39;t solve my problem.&#34;</p>

<p>I worked my examples backwards from real-world scenarios encountered in my day job. And it shows, because much of the code in the book utilizes the same open source libraries and Ansible content I wrote to assist multiple Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p>In that way, the book has been a positive feedback loop, especially considering I have been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/actions">testing all the book&#39;s examples in CI against every Ansible version</a> for a <em>decade</em> now.</p>

<p>The book is certainly good for self-marketing, though besides a short stint consulting for Red Hat, I don&#39;t think the book has led directly to any individual business contract. I think the <em>writing process itself</em> benefitted my career more than the published work.</p>

<p>I wrote the book mainly because (a) writing a book was a bucket-list item for me, and (b) I already had a lot of in-depth blog posts to kick-start the first three chapters. I was not planning on writing almost 500 pages (my initial target was 100), but I became a lot more involved in the writing than I originally intended.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/youtube-channel-growth-2020-2023.jpg" width="700" height="151" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b53568e4-2765-4457-a544-6e396b50608b" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;b53568e4-2765-4457-a544-6e396b50608b&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="YouTube channel growth 2020-2023"/></p>

<p>As I write 2,000 word scripts for my weekly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling">YouTube videos</a>, the ability to both get words on paper (well, on a screen), and hone those words down to a fine point, has helped my YouTube channel grow to the point of sustaining my family.</p>

<h2>Book Progress</h2>

<p>And speaking of word counts:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-ansible-for-devops-word-count-over-time.png" width="700" height="432" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d30ed418-bd35-44f4-808a-cc1702b35979" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;d30ed418-bd35-44f4-808a-cc1702b35979&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Ansible for DevOps - Word Count Over Time"/></p>

<p>I wrote the following script to calculate how many words were in all .txt files in my book&#39;s manuscript over time (note that there are a few txt files full of metadata that inflates this number, but only a little):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# Count all lines in .txt files in a repository for each commit.
for commit in `git rev-list --all`; do
    commit_date=$(git log -n 1 --pretty=%ad --date=iso-strict $commit)
    # On GNU tar, add `--wildcards --no-anchored` options
    wordcount=$(git archive $commit | tar -x -O &#39;*.txt&#39; | wc -w | xargs)
    echo &#34;$commit_date,$wordcount&#34;
done
</code></pre>

<p>I have found it useful to reflect back on the progress this book has made over the years, and I&#39;m proud to finally have had time to make the manuscript public. I intended on doing it much earlier, but until <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/gplv2-red-hat-and-you">recent events</a>, I didn&#39;t have sufficient motivation to devote a few hours into the process.</p></div></div>
