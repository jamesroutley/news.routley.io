  <h2>Powerful Tools for 3D Lighting</h2>
  <p>LX Studio is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation — a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.</p>

  <h4>Spotlight</h4>
  <h2>Tree of Ténéré</h2>
  <p>LX Studio was the animation and interaction framework used for the <a href="https://www.treeoftenere.com/">Tree of Ténéré</a>, a large-scale artwork conceived by Zachary Smith which debuted at Burning Man 2017. The piece featured over 100,000 distinct addressable LEDs spread across a canopy of leaves. <a href="http://mcslee.com">Mark C. Slee</a>, creator of LX Studio, was a co-lead artist on the project responsible for animation software and content.</p>

  <h2>Robust and Versatile</h2>
  <p>The LX engine has been deployed in a variety of contexts — from interiors to night clubs to large-scale installations. Flexible design means the system can adapt to a wide range of artworks. Interoperability with a wide variety of common standards and protocols (MIDI, OSC, ArtNet, OPC, E1.31, KiNET, DDP) makes LX a versatile tool suitable for use with many lighting fixtures and control systems.</p>

  <p>Source code is provided for the <a href="https://github.com/heronarts/LX">LX core library</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX">P3LX UI library</a>. The core engine is standalone Java, easily run headless on platforms like <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a>. The UI layer runs in the open source <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> environment, making it easy to integrate with other creative coding libraries. Though the LX libraries are not strictly open source due to commercial use restrictions, collaboration and contribution are welcome.</p>
