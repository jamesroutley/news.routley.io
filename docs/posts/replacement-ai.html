The Only Honest AI Company
</p> <h2>
Human flourishing is bad business.
</h2> <p>
At Replacement.AI, we believe that building AI tools to fix the
          world&#39;s most pressing challenges is an unprofitable waste of time.
</p> <p>
It might win you a Nobel Prize, but it&#39;s not a sustainable business
          model. If you cure cancer, who will buy our robo-oncologists?
</p> <p>
The problem we
<span>actually</span> want to fix is <span>humans themselves</span>. Humans cry, smell, make mistakes and demand &#34;time off&#34;. They tell
          you things you don&#39;t want to hear. Worst of all, they&#39;re expensive.

Like Our Friends at OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI and Meta,
</p> <h2>
We&#39;re building superhuman AI to replace you.
</h2> <p>
We&#39;re just honest about it.
</p> <p>
Now, experts don&#39;t actually know how to control superhuman AI (yet),
          or how to prevent stop people using it to do terrible things. So we&#39;re
          not sure what the future holds if we can&#39;t work that out in time. It
          could mean vagrancy in the automation nation. Or it could mean
          starvation in a Nuclear Winter wonderland.
</p> <p>
But if we don&#39;t build it first another company will, and we have
          shareholders to consider.
</p> <p>
Like other AI companies, we know safety is good PR - so long as it
          doesn&#39;t involve slowing down! So we&#39;ve come up with a performative
          plan to keep your family safe.

Get out of the way, grunts
</p> <h2>
Welcome to the </h2> <p>
At Replacement.AI, we&#39;re not going to bullshit you about superhuman
            AI &#34;empowering workers&#34;. We&#39;re explicitly building machines that are
            going to be better than you at every task. What economic value could
            you possibly have?
</p> </div> <div> <p>
Remember, you aren&#39;t the customers we care about. That&#39;s your boss.

Nonsense. It&#39;s because employers (and their investors)
            see our true potential - to make sure they never have to pay you another
            dime.
</p> <p>
So rather than feed your delusions, we have helpfully suggested some
            post-human economy occupations for you to reskill for:

At 25, Dan realized why no one wanted to hang out with him or
              invite him to parties: people are stupid. So he built an AI
              company with the mission of creating a future where no one gets to
              have real friends or parties.

Dan enjoys practicing expressions in the mirror, taxidermying
