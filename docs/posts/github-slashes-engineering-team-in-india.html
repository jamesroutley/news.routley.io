				<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub, the popular developer platform, has laid off virtually its entire engineering team in India in an unusual move as the Microsoft-owned firm cuts its expenses amid the weakening global market conditions.</p>
<p>The developer firm has eliminated over 100 jobs in the South Asian market, a person familiar with the matter said. GitHub informed the employees about the job cut on Tuesday. Gergely Orosz, a former software engineer who runs a popular newsletter Pragmatic Engineer, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1640585325192912898">first reported</a> about the job cuts.</p>
<p>A GitHub spokesperson told TechCrunch that the layoff is part of the streamlining effort the firm had disclosed in February. GitHub said earlier that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/09/github-lays-off-10-and-goes-fully-remote/">cut roughly 10% of its workforce</a> by the quarter ending in March.</p>
<p>“As part of the reorganization plan shared in February, workforce reductions were made today as part of difficult but necessary decisions and realignments to both protect the health of our business in the short term and grant us the capacity to invest in our long-term strategy moving forward,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>India is one of the largest developer markets and a key engineering hub for many large companies.</p>
