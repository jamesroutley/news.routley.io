    <h1>iDOS 3 Rejected by Apple</h1>

            iDOS 3 waiting for review (rejected)    </p>
        <article>
  <p>Earlier quite a few iDOS users and supporters reached out to me to let me know about the recent AppStore policy change (Thanks, EU).
    In light of this, I decided to resubmit iDOS.    

    However, it looks like Apple has blacklisted iDOS 2, preventing me from even requesting
    a review under that title, and I had to submit under a brand new title &#34;iDOS 3&#34;.


  </p>
  
  <p>    Here&#39;s where things got interesting.
    Initially they rejected the submission because it was same as iDOS 2, but after I explained to them that I can not continue under iDOS2,
then they rejected again as &#34;Design spam&#34; on the basis that there has been many submissions lately with the exact same design.
    </p>
      <p>I don&#39;t actually care much about the copycats, but just can&#39;t understand why it&#39;s difficult for Apple to check my account history and tell which is the original. It&#39;s a little bit insulting that I had to tell the story to them time and time again and yet the issue is unresolved after 1 week.
      </p>
        <p>For the people that are waiting, I am hopeful that we will sort it out eventually. And if everything indeed goes well, there will be updates coming to justify this version bump.
        </p>

	<p> <em>Update 2024-05-08</em>: &#34;Your app is in review but is requiring additional time.&#34; Makes me wonder if the reviewer is trying to play a game through.
	</p><p id="nope"> <em>Update 2024-06-15</em>: Got a call from Apple after 2 months. They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It&#39;s still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of &#34;we know it when we see it&#34;.
