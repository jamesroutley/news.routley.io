<p>Sometimes a small advance in technology makes an enormous difference in everything. The Chestnut Tools Universal Sharpener – just $18.50 from Lee Valley Tools – will absolutely change the way you sharpen tools.</p>
<p>It looks like a folding pocketknife, but instead of a blade the sharpener has a piece of sub-micron carbide about 1⁄8″ wide and 7⁄8″ long. The carbide has sharp corners, unlike a carbide burnisher. And it’s the combination of the incredibly fine carbide and its shape that makes it a game-changer when sharpening.</p>
<p>For starters, it makes short work of marking knives, pocket knives, scissors and a variety of tools that are difficult to sharpen. The carbide works like a scraper. You tilt the tool slightly, rub it with gentle pressure on the steel and it shaves steel away as if it were wood.</p>
<p>Full instructions are included with the tool, which show you how to create a burr with the tool and remove it from the back with a slightly different stroke. It’s like a miniature grinder and can even straighten out a dubbed-over bevel on an incannel gouge (tricky stuff, indeed).</p>
<p>I love it for sharpening card scrapers and use it instead of a file. Clamp the sharpener upright in your vise and you’ll create a perfect square edge on your scraper. Of all the steps in sharpening a scraper, getting a square edge with sharp corners is the most difficult. Stone the scraper a bit and you are ready to turn a burr with your regular burnisher (the corners of the Universal Sharpener are too sharp to turn a burr).</p>
<p>All I can say is this: Get one. You’ll thank me. <strong>PWM</strong></p>
