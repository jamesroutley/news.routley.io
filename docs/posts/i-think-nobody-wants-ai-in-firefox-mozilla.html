    <h1>I think nobody wants AI in Firefox, Mozilla</h1>

		<p>Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.”</p>
<p>Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/">official announcement</a> on Thursday (13<sup>th</sup>), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/ai/">waitlist</a> to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.</p>
<figure id="attachment_60904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60904"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/manualdousuario.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/window-ai-firefox.png?resize=320%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="Illustration showing Firefox’s three modes/windows: normal, “Window AI” and private window." width="320" height="271"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-60904">Image: Mozilla.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/building-ai-the-firefox-way-shaping-what-s-next-together/td-p/109922">want it dead and buried</a>. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.</p>
<p>What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just <a href="https://manualdousuario.net/en/web-browsers-ai-assistants/">another AI‑enabled web browser</a>, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.</p>
<p>Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.</p>
<p>We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.</p>
<p>Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those unhappy have another option: use an AI‑free Firefox fork such as <a href="https://librewolf.net">LibreWolf</a>, <a href="https://www.waterfox.net">Waterfox</a>, or <a href="https://zen-browser.app">Zen Browser</a>.</p>
