<p>2024 Jun 3</p>
<p>Last month I <a href="https://biodigitaljazz.net/blog/pcrowdoodle.html">embarked on a journey</a> to get comfortable with keyboard-based
computer navigation. In other words, when using my computer I don’t want to
move my right hand from my keyboard to my mouse hundreds or thousands of times
per day just to do basic navigation tasks like changing tabs, scrolling the
screen, etc.</p>
<section id="background">

<p>I personally am learning keyboard-based navigation for “power user” reasons:
I’ve heard that keyboard-only navigation is faster. But more importantly,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard/">keyboard compatibility</a>
is a P0 website accessibility feature.</p>

<section id="how-it-works">
<h2>How it works<a href="#how-it-works" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>On day 1 of this journey I realized how important the <code><span>Tab</span></code> key is for
website navigation. <code><span>Tab</span></code> lets you jump between focusable elements
such as links and buttons. If you’re viewing this page from a computer with
a keyboard you can try it now:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Press <code><span>Tab</span></code> on this page. You should see a <code><span>Skip</span> <span>to</span> <span>main</span> <span>content</span></code>
link pop up. This is the thing that most docs sites are missing. More on
this in a moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <code><span>Tab</span></code> again. The focus moves to the <code><span>Home</span></code> link. The link
gets a colored border around it; that’s how you know it’s focused.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep pressing <code><span>Tab</span></code> and notice how the focus moves from link to link.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(To actually navigate to a focused link you press <code><span>Enter</span></code>.)</p>

<section id="the-problem">
<h2>The problem<a href="#the-problem" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>On day 2 of my journey I realized that a lot of docs sites suck at
<code><span>Tab</span></code>-based navigation, including the one I work on, <code><span>pigweed.dev</span></code>. They don’t
give you a <code><span>Skip</span> <span>to</span> <span>main</span> <span>content</span></code> link, like the one you just saw. You have
to tab through the header, site nav, and searchbox before focus lands on the main
content. In practice, the link/button/etc. that you actually want to interact with
is probably in the main content. Big docs sites often have hundreds of links in the
site nav, which means you have to tab hundreds of times before the main content
is in focus! ༼ ༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ༽</p>

<p>Here are examples of professional sites that implement this feature. These sites
probably “have their shit together” when it comes to accessibility:</p>

<p>This issue doesn’t seem hard-to-fix. Here’s the change I just put in for

<p>(a11y/webdev people: let me know if I implemented incorrectly/suboptimally.)</p>
