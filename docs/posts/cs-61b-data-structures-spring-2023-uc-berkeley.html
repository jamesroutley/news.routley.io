<h2 id="extenuating-circumstances-reminders">Extenuating Circumstances Reminders</h2>
<p>If you have extenuating circumstances, we encourage you to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/4kSvCq2iQB7wde4q8">form</a> as soon as possible. You could also find the Extenuating Circumstances form at the top of the Extension tab on beacon. That way, we could work towards a reasonable schedule for catching up. In the event that you reach out weeks after the deadline, you may risk getting your request rejected entirely.</p>

<h2 id="homework-3">Homework 3</h2>
<p>Homework 3 is due on <strong>Monday, March 13th at 11:59pm</strong>. <em>It covers much of the content that is in scope for midterm 2.</em></p>

<p><strong>Please do not resubmit the assignment after the deadline unless you have an extension beyond the 13th. Doing so will cause your submission to be overridden, and staff has no way of seeing submission histories for this assignment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note that for homework 3, since we will release solutions before the midterm, you will not be allowed to apply for an extension on the assignment.</strong> With that being said, you will have immediate feedback (once you submit, you will see an explanation if your answer is correct), and unlimited submissions until the deadline. We will approve extensions much more sparingly and under extremely limited circumstances (either email cs61b@berkeley.edu or fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/wXWbjGeJBEP3Sg3Y6">extenuating circumstances form</a>. For students with DSP accommodations, we can only guarantee an extended deadline until March 14th.</p>

<p>We have been getting a lot of questions regarding how instant feedback works for the hw3 gradescope! If you do not see any feedback for a given question, that means your answer is wrong. Give the question another try, and when you get it correct, you‚Äôll see the green checkmark with the correct box.</p>

<h2 id="project-2b-and-partnerships">Project 2B and Partnerships</h2>
<p>Project 2B: NGordnet (Wordnet) has been released! For details about the project, please see <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2756432">the release post</a>.

<h2 id="summary-of-important-dates">Summary of Important Dates</h2>

<h2 id="homework-2-percolation">Homework 2: Percolation</h2>
<p>Homework 2: Percolation, has been released and is due <strong>Wednesday (3/1) at 11:59pm</strong>. Take a look <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2641865">here</a> for more information! Also, tomorrow morning we will be releasing two videos that contain hints/tips for how to complete the homework. We‚Äôll blast out an announcement on Ed tomorrow with more details; keep an eye out!</p>

<h2 id="homework-2-party">Homework 2 Party</h2>
<p>We will also be hosting a homework party this week on <strong>Wednesday (3/1) from 3-5PM</strong> at Wozniak Lounge for Percolation. This party will be for homework-related OH help. Come by if you find yourself needing some help on the homework!</p>

<h2 id="project-2a-released">Project 2A Released</h2>
<p>Project 2A has been released! See the <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2678120">Project 2A Release post</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="post-lab-walkthrough-lab-06">Post Lab Walkthrough: Lab 06</h2>
<p>This week‚Äôs Post Lab Walkthrough will be turned into a lab06 demo for those who had extensions and could not participate last week. This will be held on <strong>Thursday (3/2) in Soda 273 from 7-8pm</strong>. If you submitted the lab06 extension form, please try your best to make it.</p>

<h2 id="update-to-misconduct-policy">Update to Misconduct Policy</h2>
<p>To clarify <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#collaboration-and-academic-misconduct">our misconduct policy</a>, we‚Äôve removed the bullet point under ‚ÄúPermitted with Extreme Caution‚Äù that previously stated: <em>‚ÄúLooking at someone else‚Äôs project code to understand a particular idea or part of a project. This is strongly discouraged due to the danger of plagiarism, but not absolutely forbidden. We are very serious about the ‚ÄúBy You Alone‚Äù rule!‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Important note: our threshold for what constitutes overcollaboration has not changed; rather, the above rule has led to more students crossing the threshold than we‚Äôre comfortable with, so the new policy leaves no room for interpretation.</p>

<p>As a refresher on our misconduct policy, your code should ultimately be written by you and you should not possess or view solution code before making your final submission. If you are unsure whether some action constitutes misconduct, feel free to reach out to staff on Ed or the <a href="mailto:cs61b@berkeley.edu">cs61b@berkeley.edu</a> email!</p>

<h2 id="velocity-limiting-extensions">Velocity Limiting Extensions</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve received a few questions about this so we want to address it - being velocity limited is a valid reason for an extension request within 5 days (i.e. we will accept extension requests within 5 days of the original deadline if you ran out of tokens). However, if you are velocity limited, we will not grant additional time or tokens past the 5 day mark.</p>

<h2 id="student-support-meetings">Student Support Meetings</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for advice on general success in the course or more information on course resources, we‚Äôd like to plug our student support meetings! You can book a 20-minute appointment with us <a href="https://forms.gle/oR1SiiWncbqPBCwKA">here</a>. These meetings are not designed for debugging/assignment related help, but we can help you figure out the right resources and ways to utilize them within the meetings.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-survey-reminder">Weekly Survey Reminder</h2>
<p>As a reminder, the weekly survey has been released and is due <strong>Monday, 2/27 at 11:59 PM</strong>. You can access the survey <a href="https://forms.gle/rNaz3FFqsfKmFSum8">here</a> as well as on the website hyperlinked in blue under ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="outstanding-interactions-and-incident-reports">Outstanding Interactions and Incident Reports</h2>
<p>If you had a memorable or great experience getting help from any staff member, AI, or another student and want to give them a shoutout, fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/2ESjE79vbvEdrpAR8">Outstanding Interactions form</a>! (We‚Äôve been sending these to whomever they mention and it gives all of us energy :D)</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have had a negative interaction in the course, fill out the anonymous <a href="https://forms.gle/g3tGgSch6o8kQ9fj7">Incident Report Form</a>.</p>

<p>Hi 61Bings! Hope everyone‚Äôs enjoying their long weekend - here‚Äôs a couple of announcements for this week:</p>

<h2 id="another-reminder-on-respectful-communication">Another Reminder on Respectful Communication</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it‚Äôs come to our attention that there have been some incidents of microaggression and other negative interactions between students in the class, specifically against underrepresented minorities and women. We‚Äôd like to take a moment to recognize the importance of respecting personal and professional boundaries (this includes your peers as well as staff members), especially given the diversity of backgrounds that are present in our 61B community. Please be aware of the specific language you‚Äôre using with your peers - even unintentional words can still cause harm. Thanks to those of you who submitted an incident report to bring this to our attention (a link is at the bottom of this week‚Äôs announcements).</p>

<h2 id="monday-oh-and-discussion-sections-canceled-this-week">Monday OH and Discussion Sections Canceled this Week</h2>
<p>Due to President‚Äôs day, 61B will not have office hours or discussion sections this Monday (2/20). These changes are reflected on the course website‚Äôs calendar.</p>

<h2 id="new-lateness-policy-in-effect">New Lateness Policy in Effect</h2>
<p>You‚Äôve made it! As noted in the course syllabus, ‚ÄúAfter week 5, the course content builds on itself in a less time-critical manner, so starting in week 6, the thresholds for ‚Äúshort‚Äù and ‚Äúlong‚Äù extensions will be increased to 72 for short extensions and 96 hours for long extensions.‚Äù This will take effect starting with homework 2, lab 6, and <strong>project 2a (this means that proj1c can only be extended 24 hours for a short extension and up to 72 hours for a long extension)</strong>. As a reminder, certain assignments as laid out on the course website may not be extended.</p>

<h2 id="midterm-1-regrades-close-monday">Midterm 1 Regrades Close Monday</h2>
<p>Midterm 1 grades were released last week and regrade requests will close <strong>Monday (2/20) at 11:59PM</strong>! Details on regrade requests can be found in the <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2587635">grade release post</a>.</p>

<p>Lab 6: Project 1 Peer Review + Mandatory Attendance
Lab 6 (Project 1 Peer Review) is <strong>MANDATORY</strong> this week and is due Friday 2/24. You may go to <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/#disccal">any lab</a>. If you cannot make it to any lab, please fill out the exemption form linked on the spec.</p>

<p>Do note that you may NOT make any further 1B submissions to the autograder after attending a lab this week. If you have not made your final submission yet, please do so before you attend lab this week! Attempts violating this rule will be marked as academic dishonesty.</p>

<h2 id="project-1c-released--extended-deadline">Project 1C Released + Extended Deadline!</h2>

<p><a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2579519">See this post on Ed.</a></p>

<p>Heyo! Would you‚Ä¶like to CS61B my valentine? üòä</p>

<p>Jokes aside, let‚Äôs move into the announcements for this week!</p>

<h2 id="dont-discuss-midterm-1">Don‚Äôt Discuss Midterm 1</h2>
<p>Please don‚Äôt discuss the exam until we‚Äôve fully opened up EdStem. We have a couple alternate exams happening early this week. We plan on releasing exam grades early this week.</p>

<h2 id="office-hours-queue---public-tickets">Office Hours Queue - Public Tickets</h2>
<p>As you‚Äôre getting started with Project 1B/1C in OH this week, try using <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/oh/#public-tickets">public tickets</a> to ask any conceptual questions you may have! If you see a public ticket on the queue with a similar question, you can join the ticket and receive help as a group.</p>

<p>When helping public tickets, course staff won‚Äôt be allowed to look at your specific code. However, the larger the group, the longer a staff member can help you for.</p>

<h2 id="important-reminder-on-respecting-staff-boundaries">Important Reminder on Respecting Staff Boundaries</h2>
<p>As a reminder, please keep interactions with staff members professional and only via official channels.</p>

<h2 id="monday-3-4pm-discussions">Monday 3-4pm discussions</h2>
<p>Eddie‚Äôs Monday 3-4pm discussion in Soda 405 is now canceled for the remainder of the semester.</p>

<p>Yaofu‚Äôs Monday 3-4pm discussion will be in Soda 606 for this week only! To get to Soda 606, take the elevator and the room is right across the hallway. This change has been reflected on the sections calendar on the website as well.</p>

<h2 id="lab-5-advanced-git-and-debugging">Lab 5: Advanced Git and Debugging</h2>
<p>Due to the extended project 1 deadline, Labs 5 and 6 have been switched. This means that Lab 5 is now Advanced Git and Debugging and Lab 6 is now Project 1 Peer Review.</p>

<p>For this reason, Lab 5 no longer requires mandatory attendance and Lab 6 will require mandatory attendance. Lab 5 will be due this <strong>Friday (2/17) at 11:59pm</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="project-1b">Project 1B</h2>
<p>Project 1B: ArrayDeque was released last week! It is due <strong>Wednesday, February 15th at 11:59PM</strong>. Find more information in the release post <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2526096">here</a>.</p>

<p>Like Project 1A, we will be velocity limiting autograder submissions. You will only be allowed to make <strong>4 submissions within any 24-hour window</strong> to the main assignment‚Äôs autograder. In the last 2 hours before the deadline (starting at 10pm on 2/15), you will receive <strong>4 tokens every 15 minutes</strong>. Additionally, as a guiding rule, please don‚Äôt request more tokens from staff.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve also released the ‚Äú[UNGRADED] Project 1B: ArrayDeque Test Coverage‚Äù assignment without velocity-limiting so you can check your test coverage. Additionally, we recommend using the style checker plugin to check your code style before submitting!</p>

<h2 id="gitbugs">Gitbugs</h2>
<p>If you believe you need specific debugging help that involves showing us your code, there will be a category in each assignment labeled ‚ÄúGitbugs (Private)‚Äù. Please see the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed/#private-debugging-help-or-gitbugs">Ed Gitbug policies</a> for how to make an effective Gitbug. The Gitbug template must be completely and thoroughly filled out, or else we will not be approving the post!</p>

<p>In order to make a Gitbug, please ensure that you have the following settings selected. <strong>Note that you must select ‚ÄúQuestion‚Äù for the Gitbug template to show up.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/ZVhSnws7Q8LBUgfelir93q4E" alt="How to make a Gitbug on Ed"/></p>

<h2 id="style-checker-plugin">Style Checker Plugin</h2>
<p>Please check that your style checker plugin has been updated for this semester. Instructions for how to update your plugin can be found <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2537883">here</a>. To run the style check on a file, right click the file and select ‚ÄúCheck Style‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="new-textbook">New Textbook!</h2>
<p>We are transitioning from the old 61B textbook to a new comprehensive resource! This textbook will replace the old textbook, lecture guides, and checkin exercises.</p>

<p>You can find the textbook here on the homepage of the website:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/nQrIUkus0Ll7x9rySL164bun" alt="How to access the new textbook"/></p>

<h2 id="pacing-points">Pacing Points</h2>
<p>After feedback about lecture pacing points, we‚Äôve updated the policy to allow you to watch lectures within 2 days. For example, you can receive pacing points for Monday‚Äôs lecture if you watch it by Wednesday night (at 11:59pm). This will still be self reported through the weekly survey.</p>

<h2 id="no-post-lab-walkthrough">No Post-Lab Walkthrough</h2>
<p>The post-lab walkthrough has been canceled this week because there was no lab last week. See you next week!</p>

<h2 id="weekly-survey-reminder">Weekly Survey Reminder</h2>

<h2 id="project-1a-linkedlistdeque-released">Project 1A: LinkedListDeque Released</h2>

<p>Project 1A has been released! It is due <strong>Monday 2/6 at 11:59PM</strong>! Find more information in the release post <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2468105">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="homework-1">Homework 1</h2>

<p>Homework 1 was released last week. It is a Gradescope assignment and due <strong>Monday 1/30 at 11:59PM</strong>! Find more information in the release post <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2442120">here</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past week, we‚Äôve noticed some troubling sentiments being expressed by students questioning the purpose of Homework 1. As stated in the homework itself, ‚Äúthis assignment was created for an important reason - underrepresented groups continue to face discrimination actively throughout computing, including when taking CS 61B.‚Äù We‚Äôd like to express again the importance of being cognizant of these issues; our goal is to make CS61B and the Berkeley CS department a safe space for all students, and we strongly believe that this assignment will aid in that mission.</p>

<h2 id="lab-03-timing">Lab 03: Timing</h2>

<p>Lab 03 will be released Monday 1/30 and will cover timing tests and the second part of last week‚Äôs debugging assignment.</p>

<h2 id="project-1a-party">Project 1A Party</h2>

<p>Similar to the Project 0 Party last week, we will be hosting a Project 1A Party <strong>this Wednesday, 2/1 from 3-5pm in the Wozniak Lounge (Soda 430-438).</strong> The session will begin with a presentation that will include some tips about implementing 1A, and then will turn into project-related OH help from staff. Come by if you find yourself needing some help on the project!</p>

<h2 id="post-lab-walkthrough-lab-02">Post Lab Walkthrough: Lab 02</h2>

<p>This week‚Äôs post-lab walkthrough will this <strong>Thursday 2/2 (7 - 8pm) in Soda 273</strong> and cover Lab 02. Please come by if you want a deeper look at debugging or just want to review the lab content from last week!</p>

<h2 id="monday-lecture-recording">Monday Lecture Recording</h2>

<p>The lecture recording for Monday will be the recording of the live lecture and will be posted by 3 PM.</p>

<h2 id="setupintellij-issues">Setup/IntelliJ Issues</h2>

<p>If you have issues with setup or IntelliJ, we wanted to remind everyone that we have compiled common issues in <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/git/wtfs/">Git WTFs</a> and <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/intellij/wtfs/">IntelliJ WTFs</a>. We‚Äôll continue to be helping on Ed and OH, too!</p>

<h2 id="ed-etiquette-reminder">Ed Etiquette Reminder</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you might feel that the staff response to your Ed post wasn‚Äôt sufficient. When this is the case, please post a follow-up on your thread and <strong>unresolve the thread by unchecking the green ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù button.</strong> If you do not do this, the likelihood that a staff member will see your follow-up is very low. Additionally, please remember to utilize megathreads for conceptual questions - staff will redirect you there in the future.</p>

<h2 id="outstanding-interactions-and-incident-reports">Outstanding Interactions and Incident Reports</h2>

<p>If you had a memorable or great experience getting help from any staff member, AI, or another student and want to give them a shoutout, fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/2ESjE79vbvEdrpAR8">Outstanding Interactions form</a>! (We‚Äôve been sending these to whomever they mention and it gives all of us energy :D)</p>

<p>To those who celebrate, happy lunar new years fellow 61belugas üê≥ üêã ! Below are the weekly announcements :3</p>

<h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2>

<p>Discussion sections begin <strong>this week</strong>. All discussion sections can be found on the bottom of the course homepage <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/#disccal">here.</a> In discussion, TAs will review the material and help students collaborate to solve the problems on the worksheet. You can find more information in the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#discussion">syllabus</a>. There are <strong>no signups</strong>, and you can attend <strong>any discussion section</strong>. You are not required to attend a discussion section, although attending a section will count towards your <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#pacing-points">pacing points.</a></p>

<p>For the first two weeks, we ask that you be respectful of other students in the class, and do not attend multiple discussion sections in the same week. Note that the discussion schedule differs from the schedule in the University Course Catalog.</p>

<p>There is one (1) planned online discussion, scheduled for 5 - 6pm on Tuesday with Max.</p>

<p>We have three (3) different types of discussions this semester. You can find descriptions of each on the <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2392693">week 1 announcements!</a></p>

<h2 id="project-0-released--debugging-support">Project 0 Released + Debugging Support</h2>

<p>Project 0: The Awakening of Azathoth has now been released! It is due <strong>Friday, January 27th at 11:59PM.</strong> Find more information in the release post <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2423149">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some important notes about debugging support for project 0 via Ed:</p>

<p>TLDR: Come into synchronous OH for debugging support for this project - it‚Äôll be a faster process than asynchronous support.</p>

<p>You may make a private post under the category ‚ÄúProject 0 - Debugging Help‚Äù. We want to give you the best advice we can, and in order to do so, we‚Äôll need the context of your issue so we can get up to speed as fast as possible! As a result, <strong>please fill out the template entirely and thoroughly</strong> - staff may reject private posts which do not provide sufficient context. We believe synchronous OH will be a more productive way of getting help, so staff will only begin to review posts under this category after 6 hours. Please do not make multiple private posts at once - staff will focus on the most recently created private post for each student.</p>

<h2 id="lab-2-a-debugging-extravaganza">Lab 2: A Debugging Extravaganza</h2>

<p>Lab 02: Debugging will be released Monday 1/23 and due Friday 1/27! Please try to complete this assignment before Project 0 as it will teach you how to use the debugger. The debugger will significantly reduce the difficulty of bug squashing for the project.</p>

<h2 id="homework-0b-released">Homework 0B Released</h2>

<p>Homework 0B has been released! It is due <strong>Monday, January 23rd at 11:59PM.</strong> Find more information in the release post <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/2419571">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="project-0-party">Project 0 Party</h2>

<p>We will be holding a Project 0 Party this Wednesday from 3-5pm in the Wozniak Lounge. If you find yourself needing help with the project, feel free to come by! We will start the session by giving a project presentation, and then we will open up to questions/OH-style help. More details about the project party will be posted on Ed soon, so stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="post-lab-walkthrough">Post Lab Walkthrough</h2>

<p>Occasionally students complete the weekly lab assignment but still feel that there are flaws in their understanding, or that even though their code passes the tests, it is still inefficient and clunky. For this reason 61B will be hosting Post-Lab Review Sections starting this week. These will be weekly one hour sections in <strong>Soda 273 on Thursdays (7 - 8pm)</strong> where course staff will live code a solution to the <strong>previous week‚Äôs lab</strong> as well as describe their approach so that you can see how a more experienced Java programmer might approach the assignments.</p>

<p>This coming week, the section will review the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab01/#git-exercise">Git exercise</a> from Lab 01, and expand on how Git works and can be used throughout CS61B. Please come by if you want a deeper look at Git or just want to review the lab content from last week!</p>

<p>These sections will happen in <strong>Soda 273</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="tutor-review-session-friday">Tutor Review Session Friday</h2>

<p>The first tutor review session is happening <strong>this Friday 1-3pm in the Soda labs</strong> (2nd floor)!!! Tutor review sessions led by our 61brilliant tutors are meant to catch students up with what has been going on in the course with mini-lectures followed by worksheet &amp; past-exam problems. This week we‚Äôre covering Java programming, arrays, and linked lists! Since these sessions have historically had a high turnout, students will be split among the three labs downstairs and will rotate between the rooms. Expect an announcement with more info in the coming days!</p>

<h2 id="lateness-policy--pacing-points">Lateness Policy &amp; Pacing Points</h2>

<p>We finalized the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#lateness">lateness policy</a> &amp; <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#pacing-points">pacing points</a> earlier last week - please take a moment to review the policies for this semester! If you‚Äôre experiencing extenuating circumstances, this <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#extenuating-circumstances">new section</a> may also be of use.</p>

<p>Taken from the lateness policy: ‚ÄúAn important note on extensions: leading up to an assignment deadline, we usually provide increased support for that assignment (in the form of increased staffing). As a result, continuing to work on an assignment after the original deadline may lead to slower response times on Ed/longer wait times in OH, as staff will actively prioritize assignments whose deadlines have not passed.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="outstanding-interactions-and-incident-reports">Outstanding Interactions and Incident Reports</h2>

<p>If you had a memorable or great experience getting help from any staff member, AI, or another student and want to give them a shoutout, fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/2ESjE79vbvEdrpAR8">Outstanding Interactions form</a>! (We‚Äôve been sending these to whomever they mention and it gives all of us energy :D)</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have had a negative interaction in the course, fill out the anonymous <a href="https://forms.gle/g3tGgSch6o8kQ9fj7">Incident Report Form</a><a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/az.aspx">.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-cs61beginning-of-the-cs61blast-off-">The CS61Beginning of the CS61Blast-Off üöÄüöÄüöÄ</h3>

<p>üéâ üéâ üéâ Heyo CS61üÖ±Ô∏èesties &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 !!! We are so excited to have you on (61)board for the (61)best semester yet!</p>

<h4 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h4>

<p>If you are currently waitlisted in the class and intend on enrolling, please stay on the waitlist! We will likely be able to expand the course to accommodate all waitlisted students. You should complete assignments as if you‚Äôre enrolled in the class to ensure that you don‚Äôt fall behind.</p>

<h4 id="lecture-info">Lecture Info</h4>

<p>Lectures are scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1-2 PM in Li Ka Shing 245. The first lecture is this Wednesday (1/18) from 1-2PM, both virtually <a href="https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/99295928453">on zoom</a> (link updated on 1/19 for Friday‚Äôs lecture) and in-person. However, the lecture hall does not have sufficient space for all students in the class - the lecture hall can only seat ~290 students. Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScplc9hNuRFn7H4b5xeusxwm_HTgKRKnotP3UBBeLoGWACWZg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this form</a> to let us know how you plan on attending Wednesday‚Äôs lecture, so that we can plan accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="course-website">Course Website</h4>

<p>The course website is now live at https://sp23.datastructur.es/. <strong>The website is still under construction!</strong> Don‚Äôt trust details on pages that say they are under construction, or the assignment calendar past Week 2.</p>

<h4 id="ed-policies">Ed Policies</h4>

<p>We‚Äôre making these posts on Ed! Ed is a discussion forum similar to Piazza, which you may have used before. On Ed, you can ask questions that your fellow students and course staff can answer. If you haven‚Äôt used Ed before, it‚Äôs quite nice ‚Äì we‚Äôve written a <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed/ed-guide.html">guide</a> for new users that introduces you to some of the features.</p>

<p>Since Ed is a resource shared by everyone, we do have some policies that we ask that you follow. Generally, <strong>ask the kind of questions that you would like to see on the forum.</strong> We have a few specifics on how you can do that in our <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed/">Ed Policies</a> on the course website.</p>

<p>The main policies that we‚Äôd like to highlight here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Categorize your questions appropriately.</strong> The information available in Ed is most useful if it‚Äôs labeled correctly for others looking through it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Please show us that you‚Äôve tried before asking for (conceptual | debugging) help.</strong> We care a lot about you learning and finishing the assignments, but also that you learn how to help yourself and ask good questions. The <a href="https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/guides/ed/">policies</a> have some guidelines on how you can do this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don‚Äôt post your code publicly.</strong> If you believe you need specific debugging help that involves showing us your code, there will be a category in each assignment labeled ‚ÄúGitbugs (Private)‚Äù. This is where you can ask a private question with your code. Gitbugs have not been released yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="discussion">Discussion</h4>

<p>Discussion sections begin <strong>next week</strong>. In discussion, TAs will review the material and help students collaborate to solve the problems on the worksheet. You can find more information in the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html#discussion">syllabus</a>. There are <strong>no signups</strong>, and you can attend <strong>any discussion section</strong>. You are not required to attend a discussion section.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks, we ask that you be respectful of other students in the class, and do not attend multiple discussion sections in the same week. The bottom of the homepage of the course website has been updated with the discussion schedule. Note that the discussion schedule differs from the schedule in the University Course Catalog. You won‚Äôt see any on the calendar for this week, so look at next week‚Äôs calendar if you want to plan ahead.</p>

<p>There is one (1) planned online discussion, scheduled for 4-5pm on Tuesday with Max. <strong>This section will not begin on 1/17</strong>, but will begin the following week (1/24).</p>

<p>We have three (3) different types of discussions this semester:</p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>

<p>Do you want more of an emphasis on the concepts before diving into the discussion worksheet? If so, our bridge discussion may be the right place for you! Some of our amazing TAs will lead a two-hour discussion section intentionally organized for students who are not as familiar with the material that week. It‚Äôs a great way to get a little more comfortable with the topics and receive more individualized attention during section. The material and difficulty covered during the bridge discussion section will be the same as the Practice discussion section, and we‚Äôll have an extended mini-lecture to reinforce conceptual understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Practice</strong></p>

<p>This section is best for students who are caught up with lecture and are ready to tackle some medium-difficulty questions. Usually there are more questions on the worksheet than can be done in the allotted hour, so TAs can pick and choose which problems to work on during the section.</p>

<p><strong>Exam-Level</strong></p>

<p>Exam-level sections are more fast-paced sections that cover more difficult problems than practice discussions. The goal of these sections is to get comfortable with exam-level problems and problem-solving strategies. In general, there will be less focus on review/mini-lecture and more time spent on the problems. You can attend only an exam-level section, or both a practice/bridge section as well as an exam-level section, since we will cover different problems in the two section types.</p>

<h4 id="lab">Lab</h4>

<p>Lab sections begin <strong>this week</strong>. In lab, TAs will introduce the assignment, review relevant material, and answer students‚Äô questions. You can find more information in the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/about.html">syllabus</a>. There are <strong>no signups</strong>, and you can attend <strong>any lab section</strong>. You are not required to attend a lab section. The lab schedule can be found at the bottom of the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/#disccal">course website‚Äôs main page</a>.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks, we ask that you be respectful of other students in the class, and do not attend multiple lab sections in the same week. You do not have to attend the same TA‚Äôs section for lab and discussion. The bottom of the homepage of the course website has been updated with the lab schedule. Note that the lab schedule differs from the schedule in the University Course Catalog.</p>

<p>There is one (1) planned online lab, from 3-5pm on Thursdays taught by Max. This lab will begin on 1/19.</p>

<p>The Lab 1 assignment itself is due <strong>Tuesday 1/24 at 11:59 PM PT</strong>. This lab contains setup instructions that are <strong>required</strong> to complete the rest of the course. <strong>Start early! Setup can take a long time and sometimes requires TAs to help figure out weird problems.</strong> Lab 2, when released, will be due on Friday 1/27 at 11:59 PM PT, so plan accordingly.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/25759/discussion/threads/51">#51</a> for more details.</p>

<h4 id="hw-0">HW 0</h4>

<p><strong>Homework 0: A Java Crash Course</strong> will be released this coming week! The homework consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Part A</strong> - exercises using basic Java syntax and language constructs. This part will be released on Tuesday, January 17th and be due on <strong>Friday, January 20th</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Part B</strong> - exercises using the most common data structures that we‚Äôll see in CS 61B. This part will be released on Friday, January 20th and be due on <strong>Monday, January 23rd</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Separate Ed threads will be posted about these two assignments once they‚Äôre released, so keep an eye out!</p>

<h4 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h4>

<p>Office hours begin this <strong>week on Wednesday</strong>. During office hours, you can receive individual help on assignments. The office hours schedule can be found at the bottom of the <a href="https://sp23.datastructur.es/#ohcal">course website‚Äôs main page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="outstanding-interactions-and-incident-reports">Outstanding Interactions and Incident Reports</h4>

<p>If you had a memorable or great experience getting help from any staff member, AI, or another student and want to give them a shoutout, fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/2ESjE79vbvEdrpAR8">Outstanding Interactions form</a>! (We‚Äôve been sending these to whomever they mention and it gives all of us energy :D)</p>

<h4 id="pre-semester-survey">Pre-Semester Survey</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://forms.gle/gpsqBWNSo7wesZXP7">Pre-Semester Survey</a> is due <strong>Monday 1/23 at 11:59 PM PT</strong>. This survey is worth 128 points of extra credit. The first weekly survey will be released this weekend, and due Monday.</p>

<p>Surveys are worth a very small amount of credit in the course. We do not accept late survey responses, and you cannot apply for an extension on surveys.</p>
