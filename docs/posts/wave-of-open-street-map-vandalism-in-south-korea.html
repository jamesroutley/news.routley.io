    <h1>Wave of (Open Street Map) Vandalism in South Korea</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div xml:lang="en" lang="en">
       <p dir="auto">About a week ago, vandals began defacing the map in South Korea. Over the course of that week, I rolled back hundreds of changes, and with the help of the site’s moderators, I banned over 50 malicious accounts.</p>

<p dir="auto"><img src="https://img2.teletype.in/files/5d/e2/5de280bb-d771-46da-8260-2da927dc5889.png" alt="" loading="lazy"/></p>

<p dir="auto">In fact, the problem arose not even a week ago, but about a month ago. Back then, South Korean media reported that one account had allegedly leaked the locations of all the country’s military bases to the public on Openstreetmap.

<p dir="auto">Even then, this false media claim struck me as disgusting, but it didn’t cause any major problems. Almost simultaneously, another Korean media report about Openstreetmap appeared: allegedly, an error in the domestic mapping services NaverMap and KakaoMap displaying a river in North Korea was linked to Openstreetmap’s activities:

<p dir="auto">It’s hard to say whether this is a deliberate attack on OpenStreetMap or whether the Korean journalists simply lack the basic journalistic training to understand the issue. I’m leaning toward the latter, as if there was a deliberate intent, they would have acted more intelligently. But the result is what matters. This news quickly found its way into the ultra-conservative circles of the Korean right, who are obsessed with conspiracy theories, set up their accounts under the hashtag #YoonAgain, and believe that OpenStreetMap is a creation of Chinese communists and Russian Putinists. They say that yesterday, Russia bombed Ukraine with OpenStreetMap, and tomorrow, North Korea will start bombing the South. So they raided OpenStreetMap with the goal of once again saving (and embarrassing) their country.</p>

<p dir="auto">But what’s funniest about this whole situation for me is that it wasn’t even Korean military bases that were vandalized, but power plants. Apparently, some employee at one of them (or even at a ministry) was such a crazy person that he managed to convince his superiors that there was data somewhere online that needed to be urgently deleted. He didn’t send an official request, didn’t write on the forum, and refuses to engage in dialogue (I tried). He and at least a few other people simply persistently create accounts on OpenStreetMap and try to delete things that I can restore with a single click.</p>

<p dir="auto">That’s how it goes :)</p>
