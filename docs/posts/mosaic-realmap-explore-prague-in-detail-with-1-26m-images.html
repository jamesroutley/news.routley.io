<h2>My Journey in 360-Degree Imaging</h2>
<p>My journey in 360-degree imaging began back in 2005 when I launched prague360.com. It was one of the first websites to combine georeferenced 360-degree images on a map. This project eventually grew into <a href="https://www.360cities.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">360cities.net</a>, the world’s longest-running platform for high-resolution, georeferenced 360-degree photography.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to push the boundaries of gigapixel photography. In 2009, I published an 18-gigapixel image of Prague, and in 2014, a 320-gigapixel image of London, which earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records and was featured on BBC shows. These projects were not just technical challenges but also artistic endeavors, aiming to capture the beauty and complexity of urban landscapes in unprecedented detail.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd2CWaM1U0xmZqTl-bNpX6aj2MVEUR0Y_zIBcH9CVuT38B_C2NuSYLoeb6D2is_T9IsXUb3GXTI-uyrxZKGYISHmPjeVcZaxCOkwx0CieRUk8UlfzRXxXfsfC05DgwnHxmJ6MZQtPmkVprpc6ynnbvNZVyx?key=N9E4kkyVyuxeQFQSErYEZA" alt=""/></figure>

<p>In 2015, I founded Sphericam, a company focused on VR and 360-degree video cameras. Despite facing many challenges, Sphericam evolved into Mosaic in 2018, a company I am proud to lead today. The journey from Sphericam to Mosaic was fraught with obstacles, but it taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, innovation, and the importance of adapting to changing technologies and market needs.</p>
<p>In the second part of our interview with Nick Reese, we discuss the origins of my first 360° camera and the creation of the Mosaic 51. I’m excited to share the lessons we’ve learned. You can find all three parts of the interview on our <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWiJqkSp9JP3SqicPQtpqgcW1pkrHCWU4&amp;si=tzJBjDWJo4Fymcuz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YouTube channel.</a> </p>

<h2>The Mission of Mosaic</h2>
<p>At Mosaic, we build hardware and software for 360-degree imaging. Our cameras are used in over 40 countries worldwide, and we have managed to outclass our competitors in the GIS industry despite being a small team. Our latest product, the <a href="https://mosaic51.com/products/mosaic-xplor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Xplor</a>, is a backpack camera designed for creating 3D Gaussian Splats and photogrammetric models while walking, climbing, or riding a bicycle, scooter, or motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mosaic’s mission is to democratize high-quality 360-degree imaging and make it accessible for various applications, from street mapping to large-scale photogrammetry. We believe that by providing the best tools and technologies, we can enable researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to push the boundaries of what’s possible in imaging and visualization.</p>
<h2>The Prague Dataset: A Labor of Love</h2>
<p>I am particularly excited about our new Prague dataset. This isn’t just any dataset; it’s a collection of images from one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Nearly all of the city center is covered, and the images were captured on a cloudy day to avoid harsh shadows, ensuring optimal lighting conditions.</p>
<p>We used the <a href="https://www.mosaic51.com/products/mosaic-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Mosaic X camera</a>, which features 72 megapixels from a global shutter, ensuring that there is no motion blur. The images were captured at a low speed, with one image taken every meter. The precision and quality of this dataset are unmatched, with most of the data being centimeter-accurate.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="530" height="560" src="https://www.mosaic51.com/wp-content/uploads/MX_ontheCar-1-edited.png" alt=""/><figcaption><em>The Mosaic X is the perfect solution to capture data at highway speeds.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The dataset is composed of 210,469 panoramas and 1,262,814 images, totaling an astounding 15.15 terapixels (1.5153768e+13 pixels). This massive collection offers a comprehensive visual representation of Prague’s architecture, streetscapes, and urban environment in incredible detail. From the historic charm of Old Town to the vibrant energy of modern neighborhoods, this dataset captures the essence of Prague.</p>
