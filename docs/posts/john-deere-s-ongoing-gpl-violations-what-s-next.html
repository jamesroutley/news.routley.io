    <h1>John Deere&#39;s ongoing GPL violations: What&#39;s next</h1>

<p>I grew up on a farm.  My parents worked hard to grow crops and manage 
the farm business.  My parents also found additional jobs to make ends 
meet.  As farmers have done for millennia, my family used tools to farm. 
 Some of those tools were tractors.  Farmers now, as they have for 
thousands of years, rely on their ability and right to fix their tools. 
Perhaps that&#39;s bending a hand rake back into shape.  Maybe they need to 
weld a broken three-point hitch back together.  Agriculture was 
humanity&#39;s first truly revolutionary technological advancement.  Since 
its inception, each generation of farmers exercised their right to 
repair their tools.  This has allowed agriculture to grow and improve 
immeasurably.  We take for granted the benefits that this has given us, 
and the abundance of food it provides.</p>

<p>The right to repair farm tools is now in serious jeopardy, not because 
farmers haven&#39;t fought to maintain this right, and not even because 
farmers haven&#39;t chosen to use tools that guarantee their right to repair 
their tools.  In fact, most farmers are still buying tools that have a 
right to repair built into them, not by their intrinsic nature, but by 
the software that the toolmakers have chosen to include as part of the 
tools they sell to the farmers.</p>

<p>Sadly, farm equipment manufacturers, who benefit immensely from the 
readily-available software that they can provide as part of the farming 
tools (tractors, combines, etc.) they sell to farmers, are not complying 
with the right to repair licenses of the software they have chosen to 
use in these farming tools.  As a result, farmers are cut off from their 
livelihood if the farm equipment manufacturer does not wish to repair 
their farming tools when they inevitably fail, even when the farmer 
could easily perform the repairs on their own, or with the help of 
someone else they know.</p>

<p>In particular, John Deere, the largest manufacturer of farm equipment in 
North America and one of the largest worldwide, has been failing to meet 
the requirements of the software right to repair licenses they use for 
some time.  While we have worked for years with John Deere to try and 
resolve their compliance problems, they have still not complied with 
these licenses for the software that they use, which would give farmers 
the right, and technical details, to repair their own farm tools if 
Deere complied.  This is a serious issue that goes far beyond one person 
wanting to fix their printer software, or install an alternative 
firmware on a luxury device.  It has far-reaching implications for all 
farmers&#39; livelihoods, for food security throughout the world, and for 
how we as a society choose to reward those who make our lives better, or 
stand in the way of empowering everyone to improve the world.</p>

<p>As we have been doing privately for multiple years, we now publicly call 
on John Deere to immediately resolve all of its outstanding GPL 
violations, across all lines of its farm equipment, by providing 
complete source code, including &#34;the scripts used to control compilation 
and installation of the executable&#34; that the GPL and other copyleft 
licenses require, to the farmers and others who are entitled to it, by 
the licenses that Deere chose to use.  What Deere has provided to SFC as 
of today falls far short of the requirements of the GPL, with respect to 
both this quoted text, and many other parts of the license.  And that 
speaks only of the products for which Deere has started to engage with 
us about - for many of almost a dozen requests we&#39;ve made (each for a 
different product) Deere has yet to provide anything to us at all.  In 
addition to failing to respond at all to others who have requested 
source code, Deere&#39;s inability to provide complete corresponding source 
to us for all requested products more than 2 years after our first 
request is beyond unacceptable, which is why we are making this public 
statement today - to more strongly encourage Deere to do the right thing 
and comply with the licenses they use, and to let others know about 
these serious problems so they have a more complete picture of Deere&#39;s 
attempts to stifle farmers&#39; right to repair their farm equipment.</p>

<p>We stand with all the other organizations that are taking John Deere to 
task for its various violations of other agreements and laws, including 
antitrust, and we hope these organizations succeed in bringing fairness 
to farmers.  We each help in our own ways, which is the true strength of 
the right to repair movement.</p>

<p>If you are a farmer concerned by Deere&#39;s practices, or personally 
affected by them, please reach out to us at 
<a href="mailto:compliance@sfconservancy.org">compliance@sfconservancy.org</a>.  By working together, we can give farmers 
back their rights, allowing them to repair their own farm tools again, 
by themselves or using their friend or shop of choice, improving their 
lives and the lives of everyone on earth who depends on them every day.</p>
