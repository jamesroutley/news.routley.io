    <h1>Why I&#39;m Moving my Blog from F# to C#</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I&#39;ve just finished the latest refactor of my blog - porting it from F# to C#.</p>
<p>In this post I want to share a bit about the move and why I chose to do it.</p>
<h2 id="whats-changed">What&#39;s changed</h2>
<p>Not much, hopefully!</p>
<p>I started with a close 1:1 port from F# to C#. They&#39;re both general purpose languages and have tools to accomplish basically anything the other one could.</p>
<p>Along the way I took the time to update some styles and add a few new features like dynamic featured posts on <a href="https://hamy.xyz/">my main page</a> and <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/tags">a tags list</a>.</p>
<p>Everything else is the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post rendered in Markdown</li>
<li>Does SSR using <a href="https://github.com/SIRHAMY/CinderBlockHtml">CinderBlockHtml - my C# HTML DSL</a></li>
<li>Uses a minimal API</li>
</ul>
<p>Main difference - it&#39;s now built with C#.</p>
<p><em>To see how the F# version was created, see: <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2023-12-fsharp-giraffe-markdown-blog">Build a Simple Markdown Blog with F# / Giraffe</a></em></p>
<h2 id="why-im-moving-from-f-to-c">Why I&#39;m Moving from F# to C#</h2>
<p><a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-02_fsharp-is-fun">I love F#</a> in theory but C# makes more sense for me in practice.</p>
<p><strong>Less context switching.</strong> C#&#39;s syntax and patterns feel closer to mainstream languages. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/tags/typescript">I use TypeScript regularly</a> at work and for side projects so less context switching helps me get going faster, especially with <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-08_newborn-parent-sleep-schedule">my more limited free time as a new dad</a>.</p>
<p><strong>C# has gotten really good.</strong> Discriminated unions, records, LINQ, pattern matching, pipes - modern C# has borrowed many of F#&#39;s best features. They&#39;re not quite on F#&#39;s level but close enough to get by and a lot more escape hatches if you want them. Plus C# has the network effects to continue improving year after year.</p>
<p><strong>The ecosystem just works.</strong> C#&#39;s ecosystem keeps improving. The tooling just works, it gets frequent updates, and there&#39;s a package for everything. F# is a beautiful language but you end up writing a lot of wrappers, use libraries last updated years ago, and there&#39;s far less resources to get unstuck.</p>
<p><strong>AI is great at C#.</strong> It&#39;s okay at F#, but <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_vibe-coded-csharp-library">it&#39;s <em>great</em> at C#</a>. This gap will likely widen going forward as the models get better and suck up more training data. When I&#39;m trying to iterate quickly C# feels like the path of least resistance. This is particularly important for me as I try to push my projects forward in <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-08_newborn-parent-sleep-schedule">my limited freetime while raising a baby</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I might actually like the syntax more?</strong> F#&#39;s minimal syntax is beautiful, but minimal != simple. I still find some code hard to read - meaningful whitespace, no types on params, default currying to name a few. C# is more verbose certainly but I often find it easier to read. A lot of this is likely just familiarity but that can go a long way towards improved efficiency. Also the need for explicit top to bottom compilation is nice and theory but in practice I found it <em>so</em> annoying to need to update the fsproj manually just to add a file. Little things but they add up.</p>
<p><em>IMO <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a great compromise on the features of a type-safe functional language and syntax of a more mainstream language. If it was more stable and supported that might&#39;ve been my next language.</em></p>
<p><strong>It meshes with what I want to build.</strong> C# is a great general-purpose language, just as F# is. But it has better tooling for things like web apps, games, and new libraries. I&#39;ve got a lot of things I want to build and increasingly limited time so I think it&#39;s going to get out of my way and help me build more.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>F# is a great language. But I&#39;ve realized you can do a lot of similar things in many languages. I&#39;m bringing some of those patterns with me - <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_csharp-records">immutable records</a>, DUs, <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_typescript-result-types">Results</a>, and function composition. The language changed, but the principles remain.</p>
<p>Technology is about tradeoffs and the best one isn&#39;t always the best one on paper / in theory but the one that you actually use to accomplish your goals.</p>
<p><em>Similar to the saying &#34;the best camera is the one you actually use&#34;.</em></p>
<p>Right now, C# is that tool.</p>
