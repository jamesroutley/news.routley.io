    <h1>A large collection of fraudulent web stores</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It started simply enough...</p>
  </div><div>
    
<p>Our local small-town ski shop posted on their socials the other day, &#34;We have recently found a fraudulent duplicate online web store. Please be sure you are using our correct web address. If you purchased something from the fraudulent site please contact your credit card company immediately.&#34;</p>
<p>I was curious, so called them the next day. At least one of their customers had attempted to make a purchase though the site, with no goods being delivered. They didn&#39;t know what to do about the situation, so I offered to take a look and got the fake site URL, which was the same as their legitimate site but had a hyphen between two words.</p>
<p>According to whois, the domain registrar was Name.com and the technical contact was in China. DNS services and webfront were Cloudflare. The fake store was using a copy of the real store&#39;s logo, had the same product listings (some with unrealistic discounts applied), and even some of the same <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags. The fake store&#39;s SEO was pretty good, and a lot of their pages were Google indexed.</p>
<p>I drafted up a DMCA takedown notice, sent it off to Name.com via their <a href="https://www.name.com/abuse">abuse report form</a>, and within 12 hours they&#39;d put the domain into &#34;client hold&#34; status, essentially disabling the domain. Within 24 hours, cached DNS records were mostly timed out and the fraudulent site was no longer accessible. I also put in a removal request with Google, and the content aged out of their indexes pretty quickly.</p>
<p><img alt="DMCA Takedown" src="https://chair6.net/images/1-dmca-notice.png"/></p>
<p>It only really took about 30 minutes work (and, perhaps, 20 years of accrued knowledge of how the internet works and how abuse is reported / handled).</p>
<p>Done? (meta: how does your average retailer who doesn&#39;t have a friendly security person reading their socials deal with this situation?)</p>

<p>Talking with a co-worker, he security-nerd-sniped me by being curious about what the site content was like &amp; if there were any unique characteristics that could be used to track down other instances. Looking at some of the page content that I&#39;d saved, I noticed that one component in particular was misspelled, likely in a unique way.</p>
<p><img alt="Probably-Unique Typo" src="https://chair6.net/images/2-typo.png"/></p>
<p>A Google search for <code>stripe-card-woocommrece</code> found two <a href="https://urlscan.io">urlscan.io</a> entries for similar-looking sites. Using urlscan.io (specifically, <a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#filename%3A%22%2Fwp-content%2Fplugins%2Fstripe-card-woocommrece%2Fjs%2Fapp.js%22">https://urlscan.io/search/#filename%3A%22%2Fwp-content%2Fplugins%2Fstripe-card-woocommrece%2Fjs%2Fapp.js%22</a>&#39;s associated <a href="https://urlscan.io/docs/api/#search">API query</a>), I was able to pull out a list of 320 unique sites that has this same misspelled component in them.</p>
<p><img alt="Example One" src="https://chair6.net/images/3-example1.png"/></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t checked them all, but I&#39;ve checked a reasonably-sized sample. It&#39;s a combination of generic and copycat sites, all laid out in the same fashion, and all reflecting the patterns identified in the first case. It&#39;s generally a domain name registered at Name.com (sometimes different for non-.com domains), whois record with a China-based technical contact, with DNS &amp; webfront at Cloudfront, backed by <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>/<a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and that typo&#39;d <code>stripe-card-woocommrece</code> in their index.html.</p>
<p>The copycat sites had copied logos and product listings. There was a very similar page layout &amp; footer across all the sites. Some have been translated into different languages.</p>
<p><img alt="Example Two" src="https://chair6.net/images/3-example2.png"/></p>
<p>The search also took me to <a href="https://themesinfo.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-stripe-card-woocommrece-plugin-eyjh">https://themesinfo.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-stripe-card-woocommrece-plugin-eyjh</a>. This is a purpose-built Wordpress crawler that catalogs plugins across Wordpress instances, and tells me that stripe-card-woocommrece WordPress plugin is used on 235 websites.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t be bothered figuring out how to scrape the full list of domains out of this site, but from a manual check there seemed to be some unique items on both lists (<a href="https://www.adidasoriginalsus.com/">https://www.adidasoriginalsus.com/</a> was a particularly good one from this list).</p>
<p><img alt="Example Three" src="https://chair6.net/images/3-example3.png"/></p>
<p>Neither GitHub nor GitLab have that <code>stripe-card-woocommrece</code> string indexed, so looks like we&#39;re not going to get lucky and find a public repository with this code in it.</p>
<p>Done?</p>

<p>Another co-worker was curious (stop being curious and causing more work for me, co-workers!) about if and / or how these payments were being processed.</p>
<p>The shopping cart / checkout screens and payment forms on these sites feel reasonably well done and don&#39;t have any crazy red flags. They generally offer Mastercard, Visa, and Paypal payment methods.</p>
<p>Looking at one of the fake storefronts, <a href="https://www.3m-us.com">https://www.3m-us.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing a Visa payment with a test card # (good ol&#39; 4242 4242 4242 4242) redirects to <code>ing.mpayts.com/gateway/authention/show3dstest/lan/en-us/ref/N1667359025690114</code> prompting for re-entry of a verification code rendered on the same page (oops, no padlock.. I guess they aren&#39;t &#34;protected by 256-bit SSL technology&#34; after all), which then redirects back to the storefront via <code>https://www.loreencatalog.site/payment/return.php?code=mpayts&amp;ordersn=66221102111704325</code>. (I suspect they may not be processing payments, but are perhaps collecting credit card details on the backend?)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Verification Code" src="https://chair6.net/images/4-verification-code.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing Paypal does result in a redirect to <code>https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr</code> and what looks like a legit login form, via <code>www.antasas.com/check_purchase/shop_payment_handle.php</code>. The Paypal page has a &#39;Cancel and return to Todd Le&#39; link at the bottom, pointing back to <code>https://www.antasas.com/check_purchase/pay_info_for_cancel.php</code> which then redirected through <code>xilapay.net</code> to <code>psyupay.com</code> (similar-but-different fake storefront).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Paypal POST" src="https://chair6.net/images/5-paypal.png"/></p>
<p>Looking at a second fake store front, <a href="https://www.converseofficial.com/">https://www.converseofficial.com/</a>, we see the same deal. A Visa payment with test card redirects through <code>ing.mpayts.com</code> then <code>www.loreencatalog.site</code> before landing back at the fake storefront. Paypal behavior is the same, with the same &#39;Todd Le&#39; cancellation link (perhaps there&#39;s a shared Paypal merchant account under the hood here?).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure but somehow helping out the local small-town ski shop has lead to this. Perhaps all these sites are legit but.. I don&#39;t think so. Is this level of probably-fraud just situation-normal for the internet these days?</p>
<p>Ehh, who knows! Find some way to flag copycats with the individual brands in question? Report en masse to Name.com, Cloudflare, and Paypal abuse/fraud teams? Go straight to <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/">the FTC</a>?</p>
<p>Or just hit publish and move on with life.</p>
<p>Done?</p>

<p>(...or partial list, according to <a href="https://urlscan.io">https://urlscan.io</a>.)</p>
<p>Some of the sites on this list seem to have been taken down already - perhaps some brands are better at monitoring their domain name space than others?</p>
<p>The uniformity-but-not of these sites is really quite impressive. I&#39;m morbidly curious what their deployment pipeline / management tooling looks like. </p>
