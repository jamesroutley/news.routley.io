<p>How things have (and have not changed). I&#39;m still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I&#39;m still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I&#39;ve also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I&#39;m running Lubuntu as my distribution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else&#39;s server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I&#39;m so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>
