    <h1>EU Parliament Decides That Your Private Messages Must Not Be Scanned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Chat control - one of the worst EU plans that is also being described as a surveillance monster - must be stopped. And the
EU Parliament has just decided to do so! In a historic agreement on the EU Commission&#39;s Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR) the European
Parliament wants to remove chat control requirements and safeguard secure encryption. The decision came after extensive backlash
against the original proposal from technology and security experts, to international scientists and to citizens across Europe.
This is a great win for our right to privacy and for upholding our democratic values in Europe, but the fight continues!
</p><div><div><p>Today the EU Parliament decided on an <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CSAR_LIBE-Verhandlungsmandat.pdf">alternative version of chat control</a> - one that fortunately
does not deserve this name anymore: After huge opposition against the surveillance methods included in the CSA Regulation
(see &#39;Opposition against chat control&#39; below), the EU Parliament has decided to uphold every citizen&#39;s right to privacy
and underlined the importance of upholding our democratic values. We in Europe must not follow autocratic regimes like
China and Russia by monitoring all our citizens.</p>
<p>Patrick Breyer, Member of the EU Parliament and part of the CSAR negotiations says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Under the impression of massive protests against the looming indiscriminate chat control mass scanning of private messages, we managed to
win a broad majority for a different, new approach to protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. As a pirate and digital
freedom fighter, I am proud of this breakthrough. The winners of this agreement are on the one hand our children, who will be protected much
more effectively and in a court-proof manner, and on the other hand all citizens, whose digital privacy of correspondence and communication security will be guaranteed.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;<strong>Even if this compromise, which is supported from the progressive to the conservative camp, is not perfect on all points, it is a historic
success that removing chat control and rescuing secure encryption is the common aim of the entire Parliament.</strong> We are doing the exact opposite of
most EU governments who want to destroy digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption. Governments must finally accept that this highly
dangerous bill can only be fundamentally changed or not be passed at all. The fight against authoritarian chat control must be pursued with all determination!&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-did-the-eu-parliament-decide">What did the EU Parliament decide?</h3>
<p>Breyer <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/historic-agreement-on-child-sexual-abuse-proposal-csar-european-parliament-wants-to-remove-chat-control-and-safeguard-secure-encryption/">writes</a>
on his website that internet services and apps must be &#34;secure by design and default&#34;. The EU Parliament has agreed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and remove the plans for blanket chat control, which violate fundamental
rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet
companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a
judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A huge win for our privacy rights is also that the EU Parliament has decided to
&#34;clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning&#34;.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to the original chat control proposal, the version of the EU Parliament wants that a new EU Child Protection Centre
proactively searches publicly accessible parts of the internet for child sexual abuse material with automatic crawling, which can also
take place in darknet and would be much more efficient than private surveillance measures by providers. Found abuse material
must be reported and taken down by the provider.</p>
<h3 id="fight-is-not-over">Fight is not over</h3>
<p>While the EU Parliament&#39;s decision is a huge win, the fight is not over. It is expected that the EU Commission will continue to push for general
surveillance chat control measures. Now is the time for each and everyone of us to join this fight!</p>

<h2 id="opposition-against-chat-control">Opposition against chat control</h2>
<p>Chat control has been in discussion for along time already, and the criticism of this draft bill is huge. Significant is
not only that technology and security experts agree that <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/eu-client-side-scanning">client-side scanning</a> is not possible without risking
everyone&#39;s security. Also scientists, the general public, even the EU&#39;s Research Service oppose the EU
Commission&#39;s chat control proposal.</p>
<h3 id="scientists-letter-to-eu-parliament">Scientists letter to EU Parliament</h3>
<p>300 scientists from all around the world have sent an open letter to the EU Parliament to call on policymakers
to <strong>stop chat control</strong>, the EU’s proposed Child Sexual Abuse Regulation. They say while it is the responsibility of politicians to protect children from sexual abuse,
&#34;it is our professional recommendation as scientists that such a proposal be not taken forward&#34; because the
scanning techniques the EU is proposing to use are deeply flawed and would endanger the security of everyone using the internet.</p>
<p>The scientists make the EU proposal look like wishful thinking: &#34;Given the horrific nature of child sexual abuse, it is understandable,
and indeed tempting, to hope that there is a technological intervention that can eradicate it. Yet,
looking at the issue holistically, we cannot escape the conclusion that the current proposal is not such an intervention.&#34;</p>
<p>There is no magic key that allows the police to scan all chat messages, emails, and more for harmful content while not
risking the security and privacy of everyone. This is technically not possible.</p>
<p>The scientists argue that chat control is too much of a threat to everyone and therefore must be stopped:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;First and foremost, we acknowledge that child sexual abuse and exploitation is a very serious crime which can cause
lifelong harm to survivors. It is the responsibility of government authorities, with the support of companies and communities,
to undertake effective interventions which prevent this crime and react to it quickly when it does happen.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The European Commission has proposed a law with the stated aim of stopping the spread of child sexual abuse material
online and of grooming of children online. To do so, the law allows authorities to compel providers of any apps or other
online services to scan the messages, pictures, emails, voice mails and other activities of their users. In the case of end-to-end
encrypted apps, the claim is that this scanning can be done on users’ devices – so-called ‘Client-Side Scanning’ (CSS).&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#34;Passing this legislation undermines the thoughtful and incisive work that European researchers have provided in cybersecurity
and privacy, including contributions to the development of global encryption standards. Such undermining will weaken the environment
for security and privacy work in Europe, lowering our ability to build a secure digital society.&#34;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The proposed regulation would also set a global precedent for filtering the Internet, controlling who can access it, and taking
away some of the few tools available for people to protect their right to a private life in the digital space. This will have a
chilling effect on society and is likely to negatively affect democracies across the globe.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;We therefore strongly warn against pursuing these or similar measures as their success is not possible given current
and foreseeable technology, while their potential for harm is substantial.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="eus-research-service-opposes-chat-control">EU&#39;s Research Service opposes chat control</h3>
<p>In April, the European Parliament&#39;s Research Service (EPRS) presented a new study on the legality of the proposed Child Sexual Abuse
Regulation, also called Chat Control.</p>
<p>The EU Commission&#39;s plans to fight images of abused children on the Internet are not very effective and violate the fundamental rights of Internet users,
according to this analysis on chat control. While the number of reported cases is likely to go up significantly, the accuracy of the hits is likely to also
decrease significantly, increasing the burden on investigative authorities.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-draft-eu-law">Consequences of draft EU law</h3>
<p>The legal experts of the EU Parliament&#39;s Scientific Service conclude that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;when weighing the fundamental rights affected by the measures of the CSA proposal, it can be established that the <strong>CSA
proposal would violate Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to users.</strong>&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report also says if chat control becomes a law &#34;that this violation of the
prohibition of <strong>general data retention</strong> and the prohibition of <strong>general surveillance obligations</strong> cannot be justified.&#34;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;A detection order on the content of interpersonal data either on the device or the server will <strong>compromise the essence of
the right to privacy</strong> under Article 7 CFR in the form of confidentiality of telecommunications. It constitutes a form of
access on a generalised basis, pursuant to Schrems, where it involves an <strong>analysis of all communications</strong> going through the server.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experts made clear that an &#34;increase in the number of reported contents does not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in investigations and prosecutions leading to better protection of children.
As long as the capacity of law enforcement agencies is limited to its current size, an increase in reports will make effective prosecution of depictions of abuse more difficult.&#34;</p>
<p>In addition, the study on chat control finds: &#34;It is undisputed that children need to be protected from becoming victims of child abuse and depictions of abuse online... but they also need to be able
to enjoy the protection of fundamental rights as a basis for their development and transition into adulthood.&#34;</p>
<p>Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer, long-time opponent of mass scanning of private communications, comments:</p>
<p>&#34;The EU Parliament&#39;s Scientific Service now confirms in crystal clear words what I and numerous human rights activists, law enforcement
officials, legal experts, abuse victims and child protection organisations have been warning about for a long time: the proposed general,
indiscriminate <strong><a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/eu-client-side-scanning">scanning of our private conversations and photos</a></strong> destroys the digital privacy of correspondence and violates our fundamental
rights. A flood of mostly false suspicious activity reports would make effective investigations more difficult, criminalise children en masse
and fail to bring the abusers and producers of such material to justice. According to this expertise, searching private communications for
potential child sexual exploitation material, known or unknown, is legally feasible only if the search provisions are targeted and limited
to persons presumably involved in such criminal activity.&#34;</p>
<p><strong>&#34;What we really need instead of untargeted chat control and identification obligations for age verification is obliging law enforcement
agencies to have known exploitation material removed from the internet, as well as Europe-wide standards for effective prevention measures,
victim support and counselling, and for effective criminal investigations.&#34;</strong></p>
<p>This is also the view of many other experts, such as Mullvad, Edri and others.</p>
<h2 id="stop-chat-control">Stop chat control</h2>
<h3 id="mullvad-really-nails-it-with-their-campaign">Mullvad really nails it with their campaign!</h3>
<p><strong>Chat control is one of the worst EU plans to date and must be stopped. Mullvad VPN has recently launched a great campaign to fight for democracy.</strong></p>
<p>Mullvad&#39;s campaign, launched on March 3rd, calls on EU policy makers to stop chat control and rethink their stance in regards to the EU
Commission&#39;s proposal for detecting and prosecuting the sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) via the internet.
The EU proposal includes far-reaching surveillance measures such as client-side scanning, which would force online services
to scan every chat message and every email that anybody in the European Union ever sends for child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p><strong>This legislation would de facto deprive EU citizens of any privacy on the Internet, it would even undermine encryption
and thus weaken the security of all Internet users.</strong></p>
<p>For that reason, the <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/eu-csam-scanning">EU plans to scan for CSAM is heavily criticized</a>
by cryptography experts, human rights organizations as well as internet activists across Europe.</p>
<p>Most recently, Germany has made its opposition to <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/eu-client-side-scanning">client-side scanning public</a>.
With resistance in Germany, Ireland, Austria and the Netherlands to the EU proposal,
a blocking minority is within reach.</p>
<h3 id="perfect-timing">Perfect timing</h3>
<p>Mullvad adds to the pressure with their new campaign, which was launched during the Swedish EU Presidency, which started on 1st of January 2023. The timing, thus,
couldn&#39;t be better.</p>
<p>Mullvad says on their campaign page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now is the time for debate and actions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A democratic society is built upon discussions, before law proposals become reality. We started the conversation on the streets of Sweden, during the country’s EU presidency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with the digital campaign, they posted large billboards across Sweden to draw attention to the ongoing legal
debate on EU level.</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The EU Commission wants to monitor all the citizens of the European union. The law proposal is called <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chatcontrol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#chatcontrol</a> – and now is the time to stop it. We took the debate to the streets of Sweden, during the country’s EU-presidency.

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">Eu proposal</a> on chat control wants to force
online services to AI scan every message and every email for possible child grooming and child sexual abuse material (known and unknown).
Suspicious messages flagged by the AI will be reported to law enforcement and investigated.</p>
<p>Machine searching for potential child grooming and sexual abuse material is an artificial intelligence (AI) supported procedure.
The AI is not flawless and will flag a high number of harmless, private images, which will then be investigated by the police.
Experts expect that 10-20% of images reported will be false positives.</p>
<p>This is a huge intrusion into the privacy of millions of innocent citizens.</p>
<p><strong>The European Date Protection Supervisor Wiewiórowski <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/eu-watchdog-online-child-abuse-draft-law-creates-illusion-of-legality/">calls it</a>
an &#39;illusion of legality&#39;: This type of indiscriminate scanning of private communications &#34;will always be illegal under the Charter of
Fundamental Rights (and probably under several national constitutional laws as well).&#34;</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-risks-of-chat-control">The risks of chat control</h3>
<p>To many the risks of chat control are negligible. After all, as law-abiding citizens what is there to fear?</p>
<p>But the truth is the opposite: The risks of a surveillance tool like chat control are unlimited.</p>

<p>This is also nicely illustrated by the <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/encryption-backdoor-fails">best of backdoor fails in history</a>. The truth is: Secret services
