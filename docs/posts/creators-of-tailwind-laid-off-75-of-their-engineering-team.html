    <h1>Creators of Tailwind laid off 75% of their engineering team</h1>

          <p dir="auto">Here&#39;s a friendly tip for the Tailwind team that you should already know, but I will repeat anyways:</p>
<p dir="auto">If your goal is monetizing your software, then making your software as easy to use for people&#39;s workflows, is paramount.</p>
<p dir="auto">The more people that find which your software fits into their workflow seamlessly, and solves pain in their daily interactions, the more people you have as potential monetization candidates.</p>
<p dir="auto">By scrapping features under the guise of &#39;monetization&#39; you are sending the opposite of the message you likely intend.</p>
<p dir="auto">You are telling your customers that getting money from them, is more important than providing a service to help them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Tell me, would you enjoy doing business with a company who had a stance like that?</p>
<p dir="auto">This feature is so that people can build MORE things with Tailwind in a FASTER and more EFFICIENT capacity.</p>
<p dir="auto">From a business management perspective, if you remove the stigmatic &#39;AI&#39; and &#39;LLM&#39; from the conversation, and you simply are evaluating a feature XYZ which allows your customers to work in a more automated and efficient capacity with your software, with minimal engineering effort (all it takes is a simple build-time script)...</p>
<p dir="auto">Why would you not want that for your customers?</p>
