    <h1>Feed readers which don&#39;t take &#34;no&#34; for an answer</h1>
    
    
<p>
I don&#39;t think people really appreciate what kind of mayhem some of their 
software gets up to.  I got a bit of feedback the other night from 
someone who&#39;s been confounded by the site becoming unreachable.  Based 
on running traceroutes, this person thinks that maybe it&#39;s carrier A or 
carrier B, or maybe even my own colocation host.
</p>
<p>
I would have responded to this person directly, but they didn&#39;t leave 
any contact info, so all I can do is write a post and hope it reaches 
them and others in the same situation.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not any of the carriers and it&#39;s not Hurricane Electric.  It&#39;s my 
end, and it&#39;s not an accident.  Hosts that get auto-filtered are 
usually running some kind of feed reader that flies in the face of best 
practices, and then annoys the web server, receives 429s, and then 
ignores those and keeps on going.
</p>
<p>
The web server does its own thing.  I&#39;m not even in the loop.  I can be 
asleep and otherwise entirely offline and it&#39;ll just chug along without 
me.
</p>
<p>
A typical timeline goes like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>00:04:51 GET /w/atom.xml, unconditional. <br/>

Fulfilled with 200, 502 KB.<br/>
</li>
<li>00:24:51 GET /w/atom.xml, unconditional.<br/>
Rejected with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429">429</a>.
<br/>

Advised (via Retry-After header) to come back in one day since they are 
unwilling or unable to do conditional requests.<br/>
</li>
<li>00:44:51 GET /w/atom.xml, unconditional.  <br/>

Same 429 + Retry-After.<br/>
</li>
<li>01:04:51 GET /w/atom.xml, unconditional.  <br/>

Just like last time.<br/>
</li>
<li>01:24:51 GET /w/atom.xml, unconditional.  <br/>

Same thing, again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Somewhere around here, the web server decided that it wasn&#39;t being 
listened to, and so it decided it was going to stop listening, too.
</p>
<p>
Some time after this, it will &#34;forgive&#34; and then things will work again, 
but of course, if there&#39;s still a bad feed reader running out there, it 
will eventually start this process all over again.
</p>
<p>
A 20 minute retry rate with unconditional requests is wasteful.  That&#39;s 
three requests per hour, so 72 requests per day.  That&#39;d be about 36 MB 
of traffic that&#39;s completely useless because it would be the same feed 
contents over and over and over.
</p>
<p>
Multiply that by a bunch of people because it&#39;s a popular feed, and that 
should explain why I&#39;ve been tilting at this windmill for a while now.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re running a feed reader and want to know what its behavior looks 
like, the &#34;feed reader score&#34; project thing I set up earlier this year 
is still running, and is just humming along, logging data as always.
</p>
<p>
You just point your reader at a special personalized URL, and you will 
receive a feed with zero nutritional content but many of your reader&#39;s 
behaviors (*) will be analyzed and made available in a report page.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s easy... and I&#39;m not even charging for it.  (Maybe I should?)
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
(*) I say _many_ of the behaviors since a bunch of these things have 
proven that my approach of just handing people a bunch of uniquely-keyed
paths on the same host is not nearly enough.  Some of these feed readers 
just go and make up their own paths and that&#39;s garbage, but it also 
means my dumb little CGI program at /one/particular/path doesn&#39;t see it.  
It also means that when they drill / or /favicon.ico or whatever, it 
doesn&#39;t see it.  I can&#39;t possibly predict all of their clownery, and 
need a much bigger hammer.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s clearly a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System</a>
waiting to be written here.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the requirements become known after you start doing the thing.
