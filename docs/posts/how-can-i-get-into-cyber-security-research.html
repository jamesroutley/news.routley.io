    <h1>Ask HN: How can I get into cyber security research?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Quick background: I am a tech lead in a SRE team. I am not sure this is what I want for the rest of my life.</p><p>I love the sec field. In the last few years I&#39;ve played lots of CTFs, pwned several boxes on Hack the Box, studied and reproduced CVEs, etc. I have the technical knowledge.</p><p>I don&#39;t think that I want to do pentests or bug bounty. I&#39;m more into research. I like to be the one ahead discovering new stuff. But, how do I get there? Who hires someone like that? What do you need to get the role? How is this job for real? So many questions.</p></div></div></div>
