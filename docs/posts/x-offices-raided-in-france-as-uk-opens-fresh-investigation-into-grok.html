but &#34;not surprised,&#34; and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor&#39;s office of an &#34;abusive act.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid &#34;endangers free speech.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X&#39;s algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk&#39;s controversial AI chatbot, Grok.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out &#34;a political vendetta against Americans.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;To be clear: they are lying,&#34; added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Following Tuesday&#39;s raid, French prosecutors say they are now<b id=""> </b>investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people&#39;s image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Meanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o">barrage of criticism</a> in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The company <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">eventually intervened</a> to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as &#34;a matter of urgency&#34;.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>However, shortly afterwards the ICO said <a target="_blank" href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2026/02/ico-announces-investigation-into-grok/">it was launching its own probe</a>, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people&#39;s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,&#34; said William Malcolm, the ICO&#39;s executive director for regulatory risk &amp; innovation.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X&#39;s office in Paris.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being &#34;the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom&#34;. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;Don&#39;t be mistaken: this is not a free country,&#34;
