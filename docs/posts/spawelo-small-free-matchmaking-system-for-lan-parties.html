<p>Hey! I&#39;m Spawek, and this is the story of a project I built with my friends to make our LAN parties better.</p>
<h2 id="lan-party">LAN Party</h2>
<p>For the past 16 years, we’ve been organizing at least one LAN party every year with a group of friends. These parties typically last 4-5 days, with around 12 people joining at peak times. It’s not just about gaming - we also enjoy partying, intense discussions (we’re all big nerds), board games, card games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147020/star-realms">Star Realms</a>, and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a>. Some people arive later, some leave earlier. Some go to take care of their kids for a while. The LAN party is a place of fun and chill.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/lan_party.jpg" alt="LAN party"/></p>
<p>It&#39;s a LAN party so, we play computer games a lot! Dota 2 is our main game, but we also play classics like Counter-Strike, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Warcraft 3, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blobby_Volley">Blooby Volley</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Selecting teams - especially Dota 2 ones -  was always hard for us. We decided to automate the team selection process. It led to a very interesting ideas and a neat solution. But to get there, you will need a bit of a context.</p>
<h2 id="dota-2">Dota 2</h2>
<p>A single Dota 2 match lasts about 40 minutes and is usually played 5v5 (though 6v6 is possible). Unbalanced matches, like 4v5, tend to be one-sided. For us it&#39;s just more fun when everyone plays - so often games are unbalanced.</p>
<p>Better players use their skill advantage to level faster and earn more gold (a.k.a. snowball), which makes even small differences between players very noticible.</p>
<p>In our group, around half of us play Dota regularly, while others have only ever played during our LAN parties, so skill differences are huge. There are also some other factors:
<img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/dota_skill.png" alt="dota skill"/></p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-normally-pick-teams">How do we normally pick teams</h2>
<p>To choose teams, we typically have two leaders (usually the best or least experienced players) who pick teammates in alternating turns, much like picking football teams in school.</p>
<p>There’s a twist: the first leader picks one player, the second picks two, then the first leader picks two, and so on, with a single-player choice as each leader’s final pick. This balances the advantage of picking first.</p>
<p>Example with 11 people:</p>
<pre><code><p>Leaders:
- Spawek (me - leader 1)
- Bixkog (my brother - leader 2)

1st pick - team 1 - 1st pick = 1 player:
- Muhah

2nd pick - team 2 -  regular pick = 2 players:
- Alpinus
- Dragon

3rd pick - team 1:
- Vifon
- Goovie

4th pick - team 2:
- Status
- Bania

5th pick - team 1 - last pick = 1 player:
- Hypys

6th pick - team 2 - last pick = 1 player:
- J
</p></code></pre>

<p>As the differences between players are big, this process tends to pick similar or even the same teams each time, which is just boring for us. It doesn&#39;t work well when the number of players is uneven.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-manual-team-selection">Problems with manual team selection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Takes time and becomes annoying</li>
<li>Often results in similar teams</li>
<li>No one wants to be a leader</li>
<li>Imbalanced teams, especially with uneven player numbers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solving-it-with-code">Solving it with code!</h2>
<p>During the last LAN party, we got frustrated with the process and coded something quickly to automate it.</p>
<h3 id="1st-step-gather-data">1st step: gather data</h3>
<p>We found some historical data and put it to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXb16jtO79ApaZCTcdrc-nOScUIglHOH">Colab</a> (all data and code is there if you want to play yourself).</p>
<pre><code><p>data = [
    {
        <span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;Dragon&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Spawek&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Status&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Vifon&#34;</span>],
        <span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;Bixkog&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Alpinus&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Hypys&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;J&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Goovie&#34;</span>]
    },
    {
        <span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;Bixkog&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Alpinus&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Vifon&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;J&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Goovie&#34;</span>],
        <span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;Dragon&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Hypys&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Spawek&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Status&#34;</span>]
    },
    {

        <span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;Bixkog&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Dragon&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Goovie&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Alpinus&#34;</span>]
    },

</p></code></pre>
<h3 id="elo-rating">Elo rating</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating</a> is often used in games. Players starts at 1000 Elo points, earning or losing points with each game.</p>
<p>The probability of P1 (player 1) winning with P2 is defined as:</p>
<p>$$ P(P1, P2) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{P2-P1}{400}}} $$</p>
<p>So only the Elo difference between players (D) is relevant:</p>
<p>$$ D = P1 - P2 $$</p>
<p>$$ P(D) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{-D}{400}}} $$</p>
<p>The chance of winning is 50% if you have the same Elo as your opponent, 64% if you have 100 Elo more, and 76% if you have 200 Elo more:
<img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/elo.png" alt="elo"/></p>
<h4 id="elo-for-unbalanced-teams">Elo for unbalanced teams</h4>
<p>To get the Elo of each team, let&#39;s simply sum the Elo of all team members:</p>
<p>$$ Elo(team) = \sum_{}^{team}Elo(player) $$</p>
<p>It&#39;s obviously problematic for unbalanced teams, but let&#39;s start simple.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s create the first solution by giving players 20 Elo for winning a match, and taking 20 Elo for losing a match:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> defaultdict

elo = defaultdict(<span>lambda</span>: <span>1000.0</span>)
<span>for</span> game <span>in</span> data:
  <span>for</span> winner <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>]:
    elo[winner] += <span>20.0</span>
  <span>for</span> loser <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>]:
    elo[loser] -= <span>20.0</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>We get some results:</p>
<pre><code><p>Spawek: 1260
Bixkog: 1140
Dragon: 1100
Bania: 1020
Muhah: 1020
Vifon: 1000
Hypys: 980
Alpinus: 960
Status: 900
Goovie: 900
J: 860
</p></code></pre>
<p>With this, we could generate balanced teams by finding combinations with the smallest Elo difference:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>from</span> itertools <span>import</span> combinations

requested_players = [<span>&#34;Hypys&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Spawek&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Bixkog&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Muhah&#34;</span>,  <span>&#34;J&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Vifon&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Bania&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;Goovie&#34;</span>]

best_diff = float(<span>&#39;inf&#39;</span>)
best_team = <span>None</span>
expected_elo = sum([elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> requested_players]) / <span>2</span>

<span>for</span> team1 <span>in</span> combinations(requested_players, len(requested_players) // <span>2</span>):
    team1 = list(team1)
    team1_elo = sum([elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> team1])
    diff = abs(team1_elo - expected_elo)

    <span>if</span> diff &lt; best_diff:
        best_diff = diff
        team2 = [player <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> requested_players <span>if</span> player <span>not</span> <span>in</span> team1]
        team2_elo = sum([elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> team2])
        best_teams = (team1, team2, team1_elo, team2_elo)

print(<span>f&#34;team 1: <span>{best_teams[<span>0</span>]}</span>, total Elo: <span>{round(best_teams[<span>2</span>])}</span>&#34;</span>)
print(<span>f&#34;team 2: <span>{best_teams[<span>1</span>]}</span>, total Elo: <span>{round(best_teams[<span>3</span>])}</span>&#34;</span>)
</p></code></pre>
<p>Results:</p>
<pre><code><p>team 1: [&#39;Hypys&#39;, &#39;Spawek&#39;, &#39;J&#39;, &#39;Vifon&#39;], total Elo: 4100
team 2: [&#39;Bixkog&#39;, &#39;Muhah&#39;, &#39;Bania&#39;, &#39;Goovie&#39;], total Elo: 4080
</p></code></pre>
<p>Woohoo! We&#39;ve got the first solution!</p>
<h2 id="improvement-1-multiple-passes-through-the-data">Improvement 1: multiple passes through the data</h2>
<p>We only have 35 historical games, so passing through them only once to compute Elo seems like a waste.</p>
<p>In the Elo system, you will get more than 20 points when you win against a player having a higher Elo, same way you will lose less than 20 points if you lose against a player having a higher Elo. For a winner:</p>
<p>$$ update = 40 * (1 - P(win)) $$</p>
<p>The losing player loses exactly the same amount of Elo, that winner gets. E.g.</p>
<pre><code><p>Spawek (Elo: 1260) wins vs Goovie (Elo: 900):
Spawek += 4.47 Elo
Goovie -= 4.47 Elo

Status (Elo: 900) wins vs Dragon (Elo: 1100):
Status += 30.38 Elo
Dragon -= 30.38 Elo
</p></code></pre>
<p>In <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXb16jtO79ApaZCTcdrc-nOScUIglHOH">colab</a>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span><span>def</span> <span>win_probability</span><span>(A, B)</span>:</span>
  elo_diff = A - B
  <span>return</span> <span>1.0</span> / (<span>1.0</span> + pow(<span>10.0</span>, (-elo_diff / <span>400.0</span>)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>elo_update</span><span>(winner, loser)</span>:</span>
  prob = win_probability(winner, loser)
  <span>return</span> <span>40.0</span> * (<span>1</span> - win_probability(winner, loser))
</p></code></pre>
<p>As we are using team Elo instead of individual players, let&#39;s split the update between all players in the team evenly. Let&#39;s go through the data multiple times and see how the results change:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> defaultdict

elo = defaultdict(<span>lambda</span>: <span>1000.0</span>)
<span>for</span> iteration <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, <span>401</span>):
  <span>for</span> game <span>in</span> data:
    winner_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>])
    loser_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>])
    update = elo_update(winner_elo, loser_elo)
    <span>for</span> winner <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>]:
      elo[winner] += update / len(game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>])
    <span>for</span> loser <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>]:
      elo[loser] -= update / len(game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>])
</p></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/elo_iterations.png" alt="elo iterations"/></p>
<p>We coded this during the LAN party and it was a really awesome feeling to see that the computations converge! We used that algorithm for the rest of the party, adding new data after each game.</p>
<p>The solution was quite good, but we&#39;ve seen it creating clearly unbalanced matches from time to time. In such cases, we just added the match with the assumed winner to the data as a &#34;fake game&#34; and generated new teams.</p>
<p>I knew that for the next LAN party, we could do better than that.</p>
<h2 id="improvement-2-make-it-more-like-an-ml-model">Improvement 2: make it more like an ML model</h2>
<p>Key ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Elo as a model to predict team victory chances</li>
<li>Store model information in each player’s Elo</li>
<li>Train it like an ML model</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s stick to the Elo system we are using. The model will compute Elo for each player. We will compare <code>SUM(Elo)</code> of teams to compute the probability of winning.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s define a simple L2 loss function. Our model will try to minimize loss over all games:
$$ loss = (\text{real_chance}  - \text{predicted_chance})^2 $$</p>
<pre><code><p><span><span>def</span> <span>loss</span><span>(data, elo)</span>:</span>
  loss = <span>0.0</span>
  <span>for</span> game <span>in</span> data:
    winner_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>])
    loser_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>])
    computed_probability = win_probability(winner_elo, loser_elo)
    real_probability = <span>1.0</span>
    loss += (real_probability - computed_probability)**<span>2.0</span>
  <span>return</span> loss
</p></code></pre>
<p>So to compute total loss we have to go over all games and:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the elo of all players in the winning team and subtract the Elo of all players in the losing team</li>
<li>Compute winning probability</li>
<li>Compute <a href="https://outcomeschool.com/blog/l1-and-l2-loss-functions">L2 loss</a></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/elo_diagram.png" alt="elo diagram"/></p>
<p>We defined the model defined. Now we need to train it somehow.</p>
<h3 id="backpropagation-chain-rule">Backpropagation: chain rule</h3>
<p>In each step <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a> will help us move the Elo of each player to minimize the loss. It basically computes (through derivatives) how changing the Elo of each player will impact the loss.</p>
<p>First, we need to do a forward pass (computations we did on the last diagram) to compute loss, then we will move backward. We don&#39;t really need the loss itself, but we need it&#39;s derivative:
$$ loss = (real - predicted) ^ 2 $$
$$ loss&#39; = 2 * (real - predicted) $$</p>
<p>Then we multiply the result of that step by the derivative of the next step - win probability:
$$ P(D) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{-D}{400}}} $$
I used <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%281%2F%281%2B10%5E%28-x%2F400%29%29%29%27">Wolfram Alpha</a> to compute derivative:</p>
<p>$$ P(D)&#39; = \frac{log(10)}{400*(1 + 10^{D/400})} - \frac{log(10)}{400*(1 + 10^{D/400})^2}$$</p>
<p>In the last step, we just add/subtract the Elo of each player depending on their team:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> defaultdict
<span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>backpropagation</span><span>(data, elo)</span>:</span>
  derivative = defaultdict(<span>lambda</span>: <span>0.0</span>)

  <span>for</span> game <span>in</span> data:
    winner_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>])
    loser_elo = sum(elo[player] <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>])
    elo_diff = winner_elo - loser_elo

    computed_probability = win_probability(winner_elo, loser_elo)
    real_probability = <span>1.0</span>
    final_derivative = <span>2.0</span> * (real_probability - computed_probability)

    win_probability_derivative = final_derivative * (
        -math.log(<span>10</span>) / (<span>400.0</span> * (<span>1.0</span> + <span>10.0</span>**(elo_diff / <span>400.0</span>))**<span>2</span>)
        + math.log(<span>10.0</span>) / (<span>400.0</span> * (<span>1.0</span> + <span>10.0</span>**(elo_diff / <span>400.0</span>))))

    <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;winner&#34;</span>]:
      derivative[player] += win_probability_derivative
    <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> game[<span>&#34;loser&#34;</span>]:
      derivative[player] -= win_probability_derivative

  <span>return</span> derivative
</p></code></pre>
<p>We can directly use the <code>backpropagation</code> function to optimize our model:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> defaultdict

LEARNING_RATE = <span>10</span>_000<span>.0</span>
ITERATIONS = <span>10001</span>

elo = defaultdict(<span>lambda</span>: <span>1000.0</span>)
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, ITERATIONS):
  derivative = backpropagation(data, elo)
  <span>for</span> player <span>in</span> derivative:
    elo[player] += derivative[player] * LEARNING_RATE
</p></code></pre>
<p>The model managed to minimize the loss:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/ml_loss.png" alt="ML loss"/></p>
<p>But the resulting Elo doesn&#39;t converge:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.spawek.com/static/SpawELO/ml_elo.png" alt="ML elo"/></p>
<p>A quick peek at the data shows the reason: the model loss is very small and the model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>. It basically learned all the games by heart and does not generalize.</p>

</p></code></pre>
<p>We have to solve this problem. The reason for which we create that model is to be able to construct good teams, not encode the history!</p>
<h2 id="improvement-3-making-historic-results-probabilistic">Improvement 3: making historic results probabilistic</h2>
<p>To fight overfitting we could go with typical ML solutions: we could add L1/L2 regularization or add some noise to the input data.</p>
<p>But I have another idea! We should remember that the historical games were mostly good - quite even Dota 2 games. Playing many games with same teams would probably lead to one team winning more often, but definitely not winning 100% of games.</p>
<p>I fetched more data from the history to asses which games were &#34;even&#34; and, which were &#34;clearly one-sided&#34;.</p>
<p>I set &#34;even&#34; games to have a win probability of 75%, and &#34;clearly one-sided&#34; games to have a win probability of 95%:</p>

<p>Using that in the code instead of 100% probability will make it way harder for the model to learn all the games by heart: the Elo difference needed for 75% win probability is ~200, the Elo difference needed for 100% probability is in the range [~500, infinity].</p>
<p>After updating the <code>loss</code> and <code>backpropagation</code> functions to use <code>real_probability = game[&#34;win_probability&#34;]</code> instead of <code>real_probability = 1</code> everything looks great.</p>
<p>Loss goes down quickly:</p>

<p>Players&#39; Elo converge and are on reasonable levels:</p>

<p>The new system is ready to predict victory chances, even with uneven team sizes. Here’s our first lineup for the LAN party starting in two weeks:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>team 1 (Elo: 2660)</th>
<th>team 2 (Elo: 2655)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Spawek</td>
<td>Hypys</td>
