    <h1>Hack Club has been handling children&#39;s data for 4 years without a privacy policy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 node="[object Object]">how i got here</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">november 2024. i got an email from github education with the subject line &#34;Set sail with Hack Club High Seas 🚢&#34; and something about it just caught my eye. probably the ship emoji, if i&#39;m honest. but i thought &#34;wow, this looks fucking amazing, i ought to take part.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and i did. got properly hooked, actually. made a few projects - they weren&#39;t particularly good, but i had FUN doing them. and that&#39;s kind of the whole point, isn&#39;t it? there were issues, sure - high seas being slow as hell sometimes, peer voting being a bit dodgy, the inevitable flood of AI generated projects - but most of the other projects were full of heart. you could tell people were actually building things they cared about.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that&#39;s what got me invested in hack club. not the free stuff (though that&#39;s nice), but the feeling that there was actually a community of teenagers building things and helping each other out. it felt different from everywhere else online.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">which is why what i found later was so disappointing.</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act one: what they got right (the top slice)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">look, i need to start with this: hack club&#39;s mission is genuinely brilliant. empowering teenagers to build, ship, and create things they care about? that&#39;s important work. most schools treat you like you&#39;re just there to absorb information and regurgitate it on tests. hack club says &#34;no, you can make stuff that actually matters, right now.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the community, when it&#39;s working properly, is something special. you know how stack overflow is? ask a question, get downvoted, someone tells you &#34;this has been asked before&#34; without linking to where. discord servers are full of people being passive-aggressive. but hack club built something different - a space where teenagers actually help each other. where you can ask &#34;how does this work?&#34; and get a proper explanation instead of being made to feel stupid.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person put it perfectly: &#34;if i post in this slack - i get a person who is kind enough to explain it to me in detail and a community to support me on. hack club tolerates <em>none</em> of what i described before, which is the social-norm everywhere else.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the programmes are stupidly cool too. YSWS (you ship, we ship) where teens build projects and hack club sends them hardware, grants or prizes. hackathons where hundreds of students get together to make things. summer of making, arcade, high seas - programmes that reward teenagers for following their interests. hack club bank letting student organisers access fiscal sponsorship and financial tools. neighbourhood offering housing in san francisco for coding projects. this is what makes students <em>actually</em> want to build things, not just show up.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the transparency thing? groundbreaking. most nonprofits are black boxes - you have no idea where money goes, who makes decisions, how things work. hack club open-sourced their code, their finances (you can see HCB transactions), their processes. teenagers could see exactly how things worked and contribute. there was this whole &#34;leeks&#34; culture where you&#39;d get excited about upcoming programmes because you could see them being built. that <strong>is</strong> genuinely special.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the opportunities for teenagers to take real responsibility are rare. most places put teens on &#34;youth advisory boards&#34; where you get to feel involved without actually doing anything. at hack club, teenagers are running production systems, organising events, building the infrastructure. that trust in young people&#39;s capabilities is outstanding - when it works properly.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the real impact</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">and look, this isn&#39;t just abstract &#34;empowerment&#34; nonsense. people are actually doing amazing things.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person shared their story: stumbled upon hack club through a github email, was able to ship their first app ever. college admissions didn&#39;t go as planned, so they took a gap year. during that year, thanks to what they&#39;d built through hack club, they landed a full-stack software engineering internship at a reputable company and got a freelance gig doing app development. they said &#34;none of them pay well but for my experience and age it is awesome to be able to do things this cool... and i would certainly say Hack Club played a huge role in it.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone else listed all the things they tried for the first time because of hack club: &#34;I created my first pcb, advanced hardware, VR application, my own programming language, CLI application, a reinforced ML agent, ARM assembly, my mouse, 3D website, mcp, slack discord telegram Bot, a desktop application... All these were my first time!! And the learning from these has much more value in my life then the prizes I got.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another person talked about making a game called voidborne during summer of making. started as &#34;just another project&#34; to get shells (the currency), but &#34;it quickly evolved into smth else. it made me realize not everything i do is for prizes... i genuinely stopped caring about SoM and prizes, and just worked for the sake of making the game i had envisioned, something i could genuinely be proud of. seeing everyone so happy upon shipping it and seeing everyone i knew across slack playing it was the best experience i ever had in hackclub.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that&#39;s the magic when it works. teenagers trying things they thought weren&#39;t possible. building things they&#39;re genuinely proud of. getting opportunities that lead to real jobs and real skills. &#34;i joined for the prizes,&#34; someone said, &#34;and stayed for the community.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">as zach (the founder) put it: &#34;Ultimately the thing we are trying to do here is create a space where people build real projects they&#39;re proud of (and through that, hardcore technical skills), lifelong friendships, and experiences of incredible adventures like traveling across the world to go to a hackathon.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and when that&#39;s happening? it&#39;s genuinely beautiful.</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act two: where it all went wrong (the filling)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">but here&#39;s where the shit sandwich gets its name.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the data protection failures</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so in july 2025, i discovered that neighbourhood was exposing thousands of users&#39; full legal names through an unprotected API endpoint. literally anyone with a slack ID could access this data. no authentication, no nothing. just a URL parameter and boom, there&#39;s your real name.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i sent formal breach notifications to security@hackclub.com and gdpr@hackclub.com on july 9th. radio silence. nothing. not even an automated &#34;we&#39;ve received your email&#34; response.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i tried talking to HQ staff informally, the responses were... well, shocking doesn&#39;t quite cover it. the first intern told me that since hack club is US-based, they&#39;re &#34;not held to GDPR,&#34; that if fined &#34;nothing compels us to pay it,&#34; and that EU people &#34;void your EU protections&#34; by coming to the US.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i pointed out that not having a privacy policy is itself a violation, they admitted they got this legal advice from chatgpt. yes. chatgpt. for legal advice about handling thousands of minors&#39; personal data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">thinking &#34;okay, this is just one person who doesn&#39;t know better,&#34; i was pretty surprised when another intern came at me with the same attitude - &#34;you know that eu can&#39;t do a shit with hackclub&#34; because there&#39;s no physical presence in europe. when i pointed out payment processors and hosting make them liable, they switched tactics to &#34;it&#39;ll never be enforced anyway&#34; because &#34;no one will&#34; take them to court. then called me &#34;annoying&#34; for pushing the issue.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here&#39;s where it gets properly ridiculous. i raised this with chris, who&#39;s a full-time staff member (not a teenager), and he insisted that exposing physical addresses and sensitive info was &#34;just a vuln&#34; not a breach. said he&#39;s &#34;never heard the term &#39;data breach&#39; used that way&#34; and... also relied on chatgpt instead of actual legal advice.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the exact same pattern. teenage intern using chatgpt for legal advice? concerning. full-time adult staff member doing the same thing? that&#39;s not a mistake, that&#39;s institutional practice.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the pattern continues</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">and here&#39;s the thing - this wasn&#39;t a one-off. it keeps happening.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>neighbourhood:</strong> exposed full legal names, emails, and home addresses. one community member noted that &#34;many were filed [reports], however, right after one was patched, the organisers would push vulnerable code all again, exposing AGAIN the PII leaks. also, no one was warned that their data was exposed.&#34; so they&#39;d fix it, then immediately break it again. rinse and repeat.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>juice:</strong> leaked participants&#39; names, phone numbers, emails, and flight receipts for over 7 months. two passport numbers were sitting there in airtable, publicly accessible. the endpoint had zero authentication - just pass an email in a URL and get everything. when i reported it, HQ initially claimed &#34;flight receipts were not exposed&#34; and the &#34;most damning information is just phone numbers and names.&#34; then people started providing evidence - actual screenshots of flight receipts, passport numbers visible - and they had to walk it back. classic deny first, admit only when caught.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>high seas:</strong> exposed location data through unprotected endpoints. same story, different programme.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>thomas&#39;s log files:</strong> in september 2025, thomas committed and pushed log files to git containing emails, full names, physical addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers of 3 minors. the response? private the repo, ask github to clear it from forks, job done. thomas said: &#34;I have since started using git add <!-- -->&lt;fileName&gt;<!-- --> instead of git add .&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">mate. that&#39;s not learning from a mistake. that&#39;s basic git hygiene you should&#39;ve been following from day one. this is like saying &#34;i learned not to leave my car unlocked after someone nicked it three times.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person who was affected put it perfectly: &#34;I believe, that if someone leaks data once it could be forgiven, but if it happens multiple times, one should rethink the way that data is handled.&#34;</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">what about notifications?</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">filed a formal DSAR (data subject access request) on july 18th. three months later: nothing. no email, no data, complete silence. the gdpr@hackclub.com contact got taken down after people complained publicly about it. data deletion requests? same thing - ignored. another user noted: &#34;same for data/gdpr removal requests.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when zach (the founder) finally showed up in meta on july 10th, he said &#34;Improving our policies around data is something that we started about 2 weeks ago and will probably have updates by end of September on.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">spoiler alert: end of september came and went. no updates.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the surveillance infrastructure (orpheus engine)</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so one day, someone in the community was poking around hack club&#39;s public repositories and found something called orpheus-engine. turns out hack club&#39;s been running this dagster pipeline every ~6 hours that:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>profiles YSWS submission authors across social platforms using bright data and openai</li>
<li>sends full names and countries to third-party APIs (genderize, openai) to guess people&#39;s gender</li>
<li>uses OSINT techniques to search for where projects get mentioned across reddit, hacker news, etc.</li>
<li>geocodes addresses and archives project pages/repos</li>
<li>collects git commit emails</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">was any of this disclosed beforehand? no. opt-in? no. privacy policy explaining it? also no. the community only found out because someone stumbled across it in the public repos.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when people asked about it, staff justified it as &#34;necessary for sponsor analytics&#34; - basically they need to show sponsors demographics and &#34;impact&#34; metrics. which, fair enough, sponsors want data. but maybe tell people you&#39;re profiling them across social media first?</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the vibecoding problem: when &#34;just ship it&#34; meets critical infrastructure</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s a fundamental problem that underlies a lot of this: the culture of &#34;vibecoding&#34; critical systems.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone in meta put it perfectly: &#34;Honestly right now it feels like there&#39;s too much emphasis on the &#39;just ship it&#39; mentality, especially for infrastructure that&#39;s handling sensitive data or forms the backbone of official events... when you&#39;re building systems that manage <em>real user data</em>, participant logistics, and authentication flows, the bar has to be higher. These aren&#39;t just random personal side projects, they are the core parts of <em>real</em> experiences that affect <em>real</em> people.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they went on: &#34;From what I&#39;ve seen, there&#39;s a worrying lack of professional oversight or experienced review when it comes to security and infrastructure. Things are being &#39;vibecoded&#39; quickly spun up without clear planning, code quality control, or long term maintainability.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">what&#39;s vibecoding? itai explained it: &#34;vibecoding... is to push AI code without looking over it and/or constraining and testing it. unfortunately, when critical infrastructure such as DNS is vibecoded, a LOT of shit will break!&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and break it did. neighbourhood. juice. highseas. thomas&#39;s public log files. these weren&#39;t isolated incidents - they were the inevitable result of prioritising speed over security when handling people&#39;s personal data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">felix and others kept saying &#34;please no more vibe coding&#34; and calling for an actual DPO (data protection officer). but the culture remained: ship fast, deal with consequences later. except when you&#39;re dealing with teenagers&#39; passport numbers and addresses, &#34;later&#34; is too fucking late.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the &#34;hacker spirit&#34; of rapid iteration is great for side projects. it&#39;s dangerous for production systems holding sensitive data. and hack club never seemed to learn the difference.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">minors making critical legal decisions</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">14-16 year old interns are handling:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>gdpr compliance decisions</li>
<li>security breach responses</li>
<li>legal interpretation of data protection requirements</li>
<li>bounty assessments for bug hunters</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">these aren&#39;t &#34;learning experiences&#34; - they&#39;re critical legal and compliance roles that require qualified professionals.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the $25 payout incident</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">so when i reported the neighbourhood vulnerability (the one exposing thousands of users&#39; full legal names), rowan handled it. rowan&#39;s a teenage intern. the payout? $25. they&#39;d reduced it from the &#34;base amount&#34; of $50 because:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>i reported it via email to security@hackclub.com instead of using their form</li>
<li>i apparently &#34;did not approach the situation with care&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">rowan claimed they were &#34;already working on a fix&#34; because someone else reported it in july, and that he &#34;follows up weekly on those reports.&#34; which would be fine, except i had screenshots. actual DMs between rowan and thomas where thomas said he &#34;never wanted to fix it&#34; and that &#34;sadly nothing&#34; could be done about the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i pointed this out and shared the screenshots, rowan&#39;s response was: &#34;i got to go to bed soon.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and look - i don&#39;t blame rowan for this. he&#39;s a teenager who was put in charge of security bounty decisions, legal compliance interpretations, and managing bug hunters. of course he&#39;s going to bed soon - he&#39;s probably got school the next day. the problem isn&#39;t that rowan made mistakes, it&#39;s that he was put in a position where those mistakes affected thousands of people&#39;s data security.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the bounty programme&#39;s problems</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">as one community member pointed out: &#34;Currently the Security Program&#39;s payout rules aren&#39;t logical - it goes against the founding principals of this program... what we should do is being generous about the payouts - doing so can instill confidence in people&#39;s heart, buy people&#39;s trust in Hackclub.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another asked: &#34;if you found a security vulnerability within hackclub, severe or major, given how they have currently handled reports so far, would YOU report it and go through the same process and payouts that previous people have experienced?&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the answer from most people was a resounding no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone else noted the irony: &#34;also kinda funny given the two people running the security program have gotten several thousands in bug bounties themselves.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the juice vulnerability? i was told my payout would be docked entirely because i shared the vulnerable endpoint in a private group chat (of which less than 10 people saw) after reporting it through proper channels. apparently &#34;responsible disclosure&#34; means &#34;don&#39;t tell anyone ever, even in private&#34; - which is a great way to discourage people from reporting issues.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">exploitative labour practices</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">the &#34;regional manager fellowship&#34; pitched as a &#34;near full-time&#34; role for 6 months offers a $350 baseline stipend (works out to roughly $2.69/hour if actually full-time). when challenged about minimum wage, staff responded:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>&#34;it&#39;s a contractor role&#34; (to sidestep employment law)</li>
<li>&#34;worst case - no regional managers in europe&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;most people would be happy doing it for free&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;a @hackclub.com email is an amazing perk&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers are positioned as &#34;independent contractors&#34; to avoid employment protections, holiday pay, and wage floors. this isn&#39;t &#34;scrappy nonprofit&#34; energy - it&#39;s child exploitation dressed up as opportunity.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the enshittification process</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club has followed the classic pattern:</p>
<ol node="[object Object]">
<li>build community goodwill with genuine mission and values</li>
<li>grow large enough that individual users become expendable</li>
<li>prioritise institutional interests over user protection</li>
<li>dismiss criticism as &#34;toxic&#34; or &#34;unconstructive&#34;</li>
<li>rely on defensive PR instead of actual accountability</li>
</ol>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the community notices</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">the community&#39;s noticed, and they&#39;re not exactly keeping quiet about it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person put it like this: &#34;i joined hackclub a year ago and it was enjoyable, i had fun building new shit and enjoyed the free stuff because it made me feel my projects were worth spending time on. the community was engaging and helpful. now however? the yswses seem more unpolished... hackclub has become less about creating for the sake of it and more about making sloppy work for free stuff.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another: &#34;Hack Club was once a community. A community that <em>helped</em> each other... A community that built amazing things <em>together</em>. But sometime, this year or last, things had changed quite... drastically... If HC was a community then, I&#39;d say it&#39;s now a micro-society. A society, where you do X to exchange for Y, <em>quantity</em> (time/hours) over <em>quality</em> (personality and originality).&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">&#34;i really dont like how hc is right now... when i joined around a yr ago it was more technical and it had people actually trying to learn and grow instead of posting random videos of brain rot and meowing every few minutes.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">&#34;meta derailed from it&#39;s original purpose... it&#39;s more about venting about problems in hackclub now rather than taking on direct community issues.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">technical conversations have dried up. programmes feel rushed and low-quality - 15+ YSWS in one summer, many being one-day events or minor add-ons. growth metrics (hours spent, submission counts) have replaced actual impact. the open-source culture&#39;s eroded.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">chris (HQ staff) even acknowledged there&#39;s always been drama: &#34;A year ago &lt;#meta&gt; and hack club broadly had <em>every bit</em> as much toxicity and drama as it has today! Like, literally just scroll back to a year ago and read the <em>dozens and dozens</em> of dumpster fire threads about HQ democracy, about how arcade was the worst thing we had ever done...&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here&#39;s the thing - yeah, there&#39;s always been drama. but acknowledging &#34;it&#39;s always been messy&#34; doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that the specific problems now are about data protection, legal compliance, and exploitation of minors. those aren&#39;t just &#34;community vibes,&#34; those are institutional failures with actual real-world consequences.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the semantic games</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">when confronted about failures, hack club staff engage in:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>arguing about the definition of &#34;data breach&#34; vs &#34;vulnerability&#34;</li>
<li>claiming US location exempts them from GDPR despite processing EU data</li>
<li>using &#34;fellowship&#34; language to avoid labour law</li>
<li>dismissing formal emails as &#34;back channels&#34;</li>
<li>treating 72-hour breach notification requirements as suggestions</li>
</ul>
<h3 node="[object Object]">email compliance failures</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club has repeatedly:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>automatically opted users into marketing emails when signing up for programmes</li>
<li>re-subscribed users who previously unsubscribed</li>
<li>used physical addresses collected for identity verification for mail forwarding without consent</li>
<li>operated for months without a privacy policy explaining any of this</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">this violates CAN-SPAM act, PECR, and basic consent requirements.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the response to criticism</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">when community members raised concerns:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>they were told to &#34;just make a PR&#34;</li>
<li>their concerns were dismissed as not understanding how nonprofits work</li>
<li>they were accused of being &#34;toxic&#34; or having a &#34;vendetta&#34;</li>
<li>threads were locked</li>
<li>staff played victim about being &#34;attacked&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one particularly revealing response from max (HQ staff) blamed the community for making things worse:</p>
<p node="[object Object]">&#34;what it spiraled into because the fake stuff went out sooner then the truth:
• someone DDoS&#39;ed HC
• supply chain attacks– people contacting our server providers and almost shut down all HC infra
• people finding personal contact info of HC adjacent people (ie. donors) and harassing them
• spam/doxing attempts out side of official HC channels&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">so instead of acknowledging the root cause - actual data breaches and mishandling - the focus shifted to blaming &#34;fake stuff&#34; and community reactions. classic deflection.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the real-world consequences</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">one affected user shared: &#34;I don&#39;t know who you are, but I feel extremely sorry for you and I think at the very least Hack Club should provide some kind of data protection service for free for some time to people who suffer from their data breaches, and Hack Club should also invest more in preventing them from happening.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another community member noted: &#34;HC should be getting outside parties to do a security test against basically everything ngl, get things verified as safe to process data. there should also be requirements imo for how sites are built, data managed, git repo setup and commits, etc.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the most telling comment came from someone who experienced it firsthand: &#34;this kinda fortifies my whole issue as well. we should not be letting kids handle this data without proper training. and so far, its very clear that they&#39;ve had none. or they just simply don&#39;t care and want to get something rushed out as fast as possible.&#34;</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the &#34;small team with limited resources&#34; myth</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s a fun one you&#39;ll see constantly when questions come up about security, proper processes, or fair compensation: hack club loves to position itself as a &#34;small team&#34; with limited resources.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">max (HQ staff) put it this way: &#34;Hack Club is not a high paying job. People work here and run programs because Hack Club changed their lives and they want to run life-changing programs for the next generation of Hack Clubbers. The work is a labor of love.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">sounds noble, right? a scrappy nonprofit doing its best with limited resources? when someone asked about expanding HCB to pakistan, ian responded: &#34;We don&#39;t think this is fair, but there is literally <em>nothing</em> we can do to change it without incurring millions of dollars in expenses.&#34; another staff member chimed in: &#34;HC is not really big.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">except here&#39;s the thing: you can check their finances yourself at hcb.hackclub.com/hq - they&#39;re transparent about it, remember? when someone thought HQ &#34;only had like 2.5m&#34;, another community member corrected them and pointed to the actual balance. as of discussions in 2025, people were citing &#34;$4 million dollars in bank&#34; or more.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">let me be clear: they have <strong>millions in the bank</strong>. not thousands. millions. and yes, zach mentioned it would cost &#34;$1m in development and legal costs to set up HCB for Europe and at least $500k/year in ongoing legal and compliance costs&#34; - which is a lot. but when you&#39;re sitting on multiple millions and claiming you can&#39;t afford to pay security researchers proper bounties or regional managers minimum wage, the maths doesn&#39;t add up.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">what they claim they can&#39;t afford</h4>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>hiring qualified legal counsel (instead of consulting chatgpt), (since saying this, they have finally hired a lawyer)</li>
<li>paying bug hunters proper bounties ($25 for hundreds of exposed names)</li>
<li>paying regional managers minimum wage ($350 for 6 months near full-time work)</li>
<li>implementing proper data protection infrastructure</li>
<li>hiring a data protection officer</li>
<li>properly training staff handling PII</li>
<li>fulfilling DSAR requests in a timely manner</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">but somehow they can afford:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>$200k+ openai bills (as mentioned in community discussions about orpheus engine costs)</li>
<li>paying for genderize API to infer gender from names</li>
<li>paying for bright data proxy networks to scrape social media</li>
<li>sending letters and physical prizes to thousands of participants</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">when challenged about the exploitative regional manager pay, someone pointed out: &#34;assuming 20 RM&#39;s are hired and each makes idk, $1750 on average, you get a total expenditure of: $35,000. yeah the budget is suffering so hard because of this /s&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">$35,000 to pay teenagers fairly. they have millions. do the maths.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the justification persists. as one community member noted: &#34;Hack Club has tons of people willing to jump in and help, often for free. They are not starving for hands.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">see, it&#39;s not that they <em>can&#39;t</em> afford it. it&#39;s that they don&#39;t have to, because teenagers will work for &#34;exposure&#34; and the promise that it&#39;s a &#34;labor of love.&#34;</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the visibility problem</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">part of how they maintain the &#34;small team&#34; image is by being deliberately vague about who actually works for hack club. when someone asked &#34;Is there a way to identify HC employees and YSWS organizers in the slack?&#34; the responses were telling:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>&#34;you can find (most of) the hc employees at hackclub.com/team/&#34; (note: <em>most</em> of them)</li>
<li>&#34;some say on their profiles&#34; (but not all)</li>
<li>&#34;But i dont know why Slack doesnt show roles like Discord, since there is a staff role&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one person noted: &#34;I would appreciate if everybody who worked for HC would put it on their profiles.&#34; but many don&#39;t. this creates plausible deniability - when a teenage intern gives bad legal advice or mishandles a security report, it&#39;s easy to claim &#34;oh they&#39;re just a community member&#34; even though they&#39;re literally running official programmes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when questioned about who counts as &#34;HQ staff,&#34; someone said &#34;i&#39;d define staff as anyone who gets a paycheck.&#34; but even that&#39;s murky because of all the &#34;volunteers&#34; and &#34;fellows&#34; and contractors who aren&#39;t technically &#34;staff&#34; but are making critical decisions about other people&#39;s data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the opacity serves a purpose: it lets them leverage unpaid or underpaid labour while maintaining the &#34;scrappy small nonprofit&#34; image, even when they&#39;re sitting on millions and running programmes that affect tens of thousands of teenagers.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">interlude: the cost of &#34;learning experiences&#34;</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s the uncomfortable truth that nobody at HQ wants to address: when you position critical security and legal compliance roles as &#34;learning experiences&#34; for teenagers, the people who pay the price aren&#39;t the teenagers learning - it&#39;s the thousands of minors whose data gets exposed.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">thomas admitted he learned to use <code node="[object Object]">git add &lt;fileName&gt;</code> instead of <code node="[object Object]">git add .</code> after leaking 3 minors&#39; PII. that&#39;s great that he learned something. but those 3 people&#39;s data - full names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers - was publicly accessible on github. you can&#39;t un-leak that.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">rowan learned about weekly follow-ups and proper communication after cutting payouts and lying about fix timelines. fantastic personal growth. but thousands of users&#39; legal names were exposed for months while he &#34;learned.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the teenage interns learned that chatgpt isn&#39;t a substitute for legal counsel after giving wildly incorrect GDPR advice. wonderful lesson. but EU residents&#39; data protection rights were violated in the meantime.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the cost isn&#39;t just on the community - it&#39;s on the interns, volunteers and staff too. as zach himself admitted: &#34;One of the first trainings I had to give some of the interns and new gap years this summer was how not to be emotionally devastated by #meta because there were some posts about them. It sucks that I had to have that conversation before I even had a chance to show some of them how to get a website deployed on Hack Club infra.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">he went on: &#34;Staff members lie awake at 11:30 pm on their phones doomscrolling #meta because they care and want to improve. But they are just getting bullied by anonymous people who speak with absolute authority, sometimes make threats, and generally have a bullying and belligerent attitude.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">so let&#39;s be clear: you put teenagers in critical legal and security roles without proper training. they fuck up (predictably). the community criticises the fuck-ups (reasonably). then you blame the community for &#34;bullying&#34; the teenagers you put in those positions.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the solution isn&#39;t training interns to cope with criticism. the solution is not putting people in roles that handle thousands of people&#39;s sensitive data in the first place.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">this isn&#39;t hypothetical harm. these are real people - many of them minors - whose personal information was mishandled, exposed, and inadequately protected because hack club decided that &#34;empowering teenagers&#34; meant putting them in roles they weren&#39;t qualified for without proper oversight.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and when challenged on this, the response isn&#39;t &#34;you&#39;re right, we need qualified adults handling this&#34; - it&#39;s &#34;you&#39;re being toxic and unconstructive.&#34;</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act three: what it means (the bottom slice)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s the thing: i still believe in what hack club could be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">empowering teenagers to build amazing things is important work. the world needs more spaces where young people are trusted, supported, and given real opportunities. the core idea - that teenagers can and should make meaningful things - is right.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the community still has incredible people in it. teenagers helping each other learn, shipping ambitious projects, supporting one another through challenges. the &#34;radical acts of kindness&#34; that built hack club haven&#39;t disappeared entirely.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the organisation has lost its way. it has prioritised growth over sustainability, metrics over meaning, institutional protection over user safety. it&#39;s become what it once stood against: another tech organisation that talks about transparency while operating in secrecy, that preaches empowerment while exploiting labour, that claims to care about teenagers while systematically failing to protect their data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the path forward exists:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>remove minors from legal compliance and data protection roles</li>
<li>implement actual data protection processes with qualified professionals</li>
<li>stop playing semantic games to avoid legal obligations</li>
<li>provide proper training and oversight for anyone handling user data</li>
<li>establish clear escalation paths for security issues</li>
<li>publish and follow actual privacy policies</li>
<li>treat security researchers as partners, not annoyances</li>
<li>acknowledge institutional failures instead of playing victim</li>
<li>pay teenagers fairly for real work</li>
<li>return to genuine transparency, not PR-managed disclosure</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">the infrastructure for greatness is still there. the mission is still valid. the community still has the potential to be something special. but it requires leadership to choose accountability over image management, protection over growth, and people over metrics.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club can still be the organisation it claims to be. but it has to want to be better more than it wants to look good. and based on the pattern of responses over the past months, that shift hasn&#39;t happened yet.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the story isn&#39;t over. but the next chapter will determine whether hack club becomes a cautionary tale about organisational enshittification, or a redemption story about an organisation that listened, learned, and became what it always claimed to be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">right now, it could go either way.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">epilogue: what i&#39;ve learned from all this</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">i&#39;ve spent months on this. formal emails, meta posts, private conversations, evidence gathering, arguing with staff, getting called toxic, watching payouts get cut, seeing data requests ignored. honestly? it&#39;s been exhausting.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here&#39;s what really gets me: i genuinely wanted hack club to succeed. still do, if i&#39;m honest. the mission is too important to let it fail because of institutional arrogance and mismanagement.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i first found the neighbourhood vulnerability, i thought &#34;okay, this is a problem, i&#39;ll report it properly, they&#39;ll fix it, everyone learns something.&#34; naive, sure. but i genuinely believed in the whole &#34;we&#39;re all learning together&#34; thing.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the response wasn&#39;t what i expected:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>chatgpt legal advice from multiple staff members</li>
<li>$25 for thousands of exposed names</li>
<li>&#34;you&#39;re annoying&#34; for following up</li>
<li>&#34;it&#39;ll never be enforced anyway&#34;</li>
<li>three months of ignored DSAR requests</li>
<li>the gdpr contact email being taken down after complaints</li>
<li>being accused of not using &#34;proper channels&#34; when i literally used security@hackclub.com</li>
<li>watching the same developer cause the third or fourth breach with the same &#34;oops learned my lesson&#34; response</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">but here&#39;s the thing - even after all this, i&#39;ve seen what hack club can be at its best.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one community member put it perfectly: &#34;Some of you (including me) don&#39;t seem to realise how lucky we are to have something like Hack Club. Hack Club, a community where we all share the same interest and mindset. Hack Club, a community where I feel empowered and respected. Hack Club, a community where I&#39;m rewarded for, what, following my own interests?!&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they&#39;re absolutely right. when hack club works, it&#39;s genuinely magical. teenagers building things they never thought possible. communities forming around shared interests. people getting opportunities that change their lives.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but that same person also said: &#34;HQ, I can&#39;t speak for others, but all I&#39;m asking for is a bit of transparency. You can&#39;t ask us to be constructive when you don&#39;t tell us what you&#39;ve tried, what you&#39;ve stuck with, and why it works.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and that&#39;s the core issue, isn&#39;t it? transparency without accountability isn&#39;t transparency - it&#39;s just PR. open-sourcing your finances is great, but if you&#39;re also ignoring GDPR requests and paying teenagers $2.69/hour, the transparency just makes the problems more visible.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the difference between what hack club is and what it could be isn&#39;t some impossible gap. it&#39;s just a choice. a choice to prioritise the mission over ego. to admit mistakes instead of denying them. to protect teenagers instead of exploiting them.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i hope they make the right choice. because when i think about that person who got their first internship, or the one who built voidborne and felt proud for the first time, or the community member who said they feel &#34;empowered and respected&#34; - that&#39;s what hack club should be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that&#39;s worth fighting for. even when it&#39;s exhausting.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the question nobody wants to ask</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s the uncomfortable question: is hack club actually good for teenagers?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">empowering teens to build things? absolutely yes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">giving teens real responsibility and trust? mostly yes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but putting teens in legal compliance roles they&#39;re not qualified for? no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">exposing thousands of teens&#39; PII through repeatedly preventable security failures? definitely not.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">paying teens less than minimum wage by calling it a &#34;fellowship&#34;? also no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">creating a culture where raising concerns gets you labeled &#34;toxic&#34;? really, really not.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the cost-benefit analysis is starting to look pretty grim. how many data breaches is &#34;learning&#34; worth? how much exploitation is acceptable in the name of &#34;opportunity&#34;?</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">so what now?</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here&#39;s the thing: the infrastructure for something genuinely incredible is still there.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers are still building amazing things. people are still landing internships because of what they learned at hack club. someone&#39;s still shipping their first VR app, their first PCB, their first game they&#39;re actually proud of. the community - when it&#39;s allowed to be a community and not a grinding machine - is still special.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">all the pieces are there:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>an engaged community of thousands of teens who genuinely want to build things</li>
<li>programmes that, when properly managed, create real opportunities</li>
<li>financial resources (millions, remember?) to fix the problems</li>
<li>a mission that people genuinely believe in</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">what&#39;s missing is:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>actual data protection oversight (hire a DPO, not chatGPT)</li>
<li>proper security review before shipping (professional oversight for sensitive systems)</li>
<li>fair compensation (pay minimum wage at least)</li>
<li>accountability (stop letting the same people cause breach after breach)</li>
<li>transparency that includes admitting mistakes (not just denying everything)</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">none of this is impossible. it&#39;s not even particularly expensive compared to what they&#39;re already spending. it just requires admitting there&#39;s a problem and choosing to fix it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the mission - empowering teenagers to build amazing things - is genuinely important. that&#39;s why this all matters. that&#39;s why people like me spent months trying to get them to listen. not to tear hack club down, but because we wanted it to be better.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and it still could be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers deserve better than &#34;vibecoded&#34; infrastructure exposing their data. they deserve better than $2.69/hour &#34;fellowships.&#34; they deserve better than being called toxic for raising legitimate concerns.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they deserve a hack club that actually lives up to its mission.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the question is: will hack club choose to become that? or will it continue doubling down, denying breaches, dismissing critics, and hoping the community forgets?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i genuinely hope they choose the first option. the potential is there. the resources are there. the community desperately wants to believe in the mission.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">all hack club needs to do is choose to be worthy of that belief.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the aftermath: what actually changed</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so after all this - the meta posts, the complaints, the evidence, the regulatory threats, the months of criticism - what actually got fixed?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">zach promised on july 10th: &#34;Improving our policies around data is something that we started about 2 weeks ago and will probably have updates by end of September on.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">end of september came and went. by october 9th, someone noted: &#34;Privacy policy is like the last thing you would make before making any web service public, but HC has lacked it for years.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">as of october, the situation looked like this:</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>what got &#34;fixed&#34;:</strong></p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>thomas learned to use <code node="[object Object]">git add &lt;fileName&gt;</code> instead of <code node="[object Object]">git add .</code> (only took leaking 3 people&#39;s PII)</li>
<li>the security bounty programme exists (with shit payouts and questionable rules, but it exists)</li>
<li>some vulnerabilities that were reported got patched (until new code pushed them again)</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>what didn&#39;t get fixed:</strong></p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>no comprehensive privacy policy for hack club&#39;s main operations</li>
<li>DSARs still being ignored months later (&#34;it&#39;s been several months&#34; as of writing this)</li>
<li>data still stored &#34;in close to a hundred different places&#34; making deletion near-impossible</li>
<li>identity vault still keeping documents indefinitely with no deletion option</li>
<li>orpheus-engine still profiling people without meaningful consent</li>
<li>minors still handling critical data and compliance decisions</li>
<li>same developers still shipping insecure code to production</li>
<li>still no qualified DPO or data protection oversight</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one community member noted: &#34;HQ would have to work on only data protection for a couple months straight to get things reasonably better.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but they didn&#39;t do that. they just... carried on. new programmes, same problems.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the one bright spot? some community members took matters into their own hands. nest (a hq-sponsored but community-run project) sat down, mapped their data, considered legitimate interests, drafted a proper privacy policy, and implemented it. they showed it CAN be done. as they put it: &#34;Privacy is a human right. To desire privacy is to be human... We&#39;re grateful that you trust us to handle your data and I think we should return the favor by respecting you.&#34;</p>
<p node="[object Object]">if a community project can do it, why can&#39;t HQ?</p>

<h2 node="[object Object]">thank-you&#39;s</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">first off, to hack club itself: thank you for existing. seriously. for all the criticism in this document, the world genuinely needs more organisations trying to empower teenagers to build things. the mission matters. the real impact on people&#39;s lives - the internships landed, the first projects shipped, the friendships formed, the opportunities created - that&#39;s real and it&#39;s valuable. this document exists because i believe in that mission enough to want it to succeed properly. i want hack club to be better because the alternative - it shutting down or becoming irrelevant - would be worse for everyone.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the community members who spoke up: thank you. to everyone who posted in meta about data protection, who questioned labour practices, who called out the vibecoding, who asked for transparency, who kept pushing even when called &#34;toxic&#34; - you did the right thing. speaking up when you see problems isn&#39;t being difficult, it&#39;s how communities stay healthy and organisations stay accountable. special thanks to those who helped gather evidence, who filed proper reports, who tried to work within the system even when it was exhausting and frustrating. you made this document possible.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the people whose data was exposed: i&#39;m sorry this happened to you. you deserved better protection than you got. you trusted hack club with your personal information and that trust was violated. that&#39;s not okay, and it&#39;s not your fault.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the interns and staff who got caught in the middle: this isn&#39;t about you personally. you were put in impossible positions by institutional failures and you did your best with what you had. being trained on &#34;how not to be emotionally devastated by meta&#34; before being taught how to deploy a website isn&#39;t your fault - it&#39;s a sign that something is deeply wrong with how the organisation operates. you deserved better support and better guidance.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the nest team who actually wrote a proper privacy policy: thank you for showing it CAN be done. &#34;privacy is a human right&#34; - you get it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and to you, the reader: thank you for making it through 8 and a half thousand words of this. whether you&#39;re a hack club participant trying to understand what happened, a parent trying to evaluate the risks, a regulator looking into complaints, another nonprofit trying to learn from these mistakes, or just someone who cares about teenagers&#39; data protection - thank you for caring enough to read this entire thing.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the story isn&#39;t over. how it ends depends on what happens next. i hope it&#39;s a redemption arc.</p></section></div>
