    <h1>The &#39;blem wit&#39; error messages: Things get terse (2008)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>When I was young I built up a collection of system error messages. Ok, look, it&#39;s not as sad as collecting stamps! It is? Really? Oh well, never mind. Anyway, my <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2007/12/19/quattro_pro_fcuk/">recent piece</a> about Borland putting rude words in Quattro Pro got me thinking it was time to revisit that collection.</p>
<p>Some of them date back to the days of the mainframe, such as:</p>
<p>&#34;Fatal error in crawl out - system halted&#34;</p>

    

<p>This I collected from a Prime.</p>

        


        

<p>Most of them were verified in one way or another; however I once collected the delightful but unverified &#34;Shut her down, Clancy, she&#39;s a-pumping mud.&#34; Whatever its original provenance, within six months, it had moved into reality - a friend saw it on the list and actually added it to a real hole in the wall system. As far as I know it&#39;s still in there. A case of art imitating life, or the other way around...or science, or whatever.</p>
<p>In those days, though, most error message were a little less creative. The reason? Memory was expensive. So some of them were terse. I mean rlly trs - to th pnt of bng compltly uslss. Take, for example, the execrable:</p>

        

<p>&#34;Cannot find DLL&#34;</p>
<p>Yes, yes, but in order to fix the problem I need to know which DLL you can&#39;t find. There are hundreds of the wretched things; at least give me a clue. What letter does it start with? That would narrow it down. And Microsoft wonders why people end up shouting at Windows.</p>
<p>But this was nothing. My personal favorite is still one from the early 90s. And it was about as trs as they get:</p>

        

<p>&#34;blem wit&#34;</p>
<p>Those simple characters proved that the god of error messages not only has a sense of humor but also an understanding of recursion.</p>
<p>There was a bug in some versions of the Novell redirector shell (NET5.COM) that was a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program that ran under DOS. The Novell TSR had, of course, a set of error messages that it could use. One was:</p>
<p>&#34;There is a problem with the Memory Control Block for the shell&#34;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the very problem that triggered the error message had the unfortunate side effect of screwing up the ability of DOS to write to the screen. So only a part of the error message was actually written to the screen. What was that error message?</p>
<p>&#34;There is a pro<b>blem wit</b>h the Memory Control Block for the shell&#34;</p>
<p>So, whenever &#34;blem wit&#34; appeared, you had two reasons to be sure that there was, indeed, a problem with writing to the screen.</p>
<p>&#34;Blem wit&#34; was such an odd string to suddenly appear on a screen, and so widespread at the time, that it was often reported as a virus. But it wasn&#39;t, it was just a trs TSR.Â®</p>
