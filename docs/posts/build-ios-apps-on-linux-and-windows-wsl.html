              <p>Hi folks! A few months ago I shared my <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-an-sdk-for-building-ios-macos-apps-on-linux-experimental/66233">Swift SDK for Darwin</a>, which allows you to build iOS Swift Packages on Linux, amongst other things. I mentioned that a lot of work still needed to be done, such as handling codesigning, packaging, and bundling.</p>
<p>I&#39;m super excited to share that we&#39;ve finally reached the point where all of these things are now possible with cross-platform, open source software. Enter, xtool!</p>

<p>xtool does a lot of things (because Xcode does a lot of things <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=14" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"/>) but the headline features are</p>

<p>This means it&#39;s finally possible to <strong>build and deploy iOS apps from Linux and Windows (WSL)</strong>. At the same time, xtool is SwiftPM-based and fully declarative, which means you can also use it to <strong>replace Xcode on macOS</strong> for building iOS software!</p>

<p>I put together some DocC Articles + a DocC Tutorial on how to get started with xtool. You can find these <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/xtool-org/xtool/documentation/xtool" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on Swift Package Index</a>.</p>

Gotchas</summary>
<p>The aim so far has been to flesh out the core functionality in a typical build-run-edit loop for an iOS application. There&#39;s some things that are infeasible outside macOS, and others that are possible but still need to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface builder:</strong> would require a lot of effort to replicate, probably not worth it since SwiftUI mostly supersedes it at this point</li>
<li><strong>Asset catalogs:</strong> require reverse engineering to implement, might be worth it. You can still add images as raw files in the absence of asset catalogs, it&#39;s just less efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary macros:</strong> The ones that are also in the Linux toolchain (e.g. <code>@Observable</code>) work just fine, but Apple-proprietary macros (such as the SwiftData ones) will need to be reverse-engineered and rebuilt from source if we want them to work. Or Apple could ship these as <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/poc-improving-macro-build-times-with-webassembly/70967">WebAssembly Macros</a> which would make them host-independent <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/folded_hands.png?v=14" title=":folded_hands:" alt=":folded_hands:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"/></li>
<li><strong>App Extensions:</strong> Right now you can only build &#34;Application&#34;-type targets. I think App Extensions should be easy to implement as an addition to the <code>xtool.yml</code> spec, but just require engineering effort.</li>
<li><strong>LLDB debugging</strong>: this used to be pretty easy before iOS 17, and xtool has all of the pieces in place to support lldb with those old versions, but Apple has recently made a number of changes to the way you invoke LLDB&#39;s <code>debugserver</code> on iOS. There are a few modern tools that support the new approach (notably <a href="https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pymobiledevice3</a>), and it&#39;s already possible to use these tools to connect to lldb, but I definitely want to integrate this into xtool down the road. This will require a good amount of work since the new RemoteXPC protocol is entirely different from the legacy mechanism, but it&#39;ll probably be necessary in the future for other functionality as well.</li>
<li><strong>App Store deployment</strong>: You can build and run on your own device with xtool, but it doesn&#39;t let you deploy builds to App Store Connect yet. Luckily 1) iTMSTransporter is cross-platform and 2) we have all the other infra in place to interact with the ASC API, so this should be achievable too, but remains to be done.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>xtool is a culmination of 8 years of work around iOS app deployment (the commit history has some nuggets!) but I&#39;m the sole developer on this project and replicating Xcode is a massive undertaking. Now that I&#39;m ready to share the project more widely, I&#39;d be very happy to accept external contributions to flesh out the feature set. And if you end up using xtool, please let me know!</p>

              <p>My understanding has always been that building iOS apps on other OSes is more of a legal/licensing challenge than a technical one. For example, quoting from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Apple Developer Program License Agreement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1 Permitted Uses and Restrictions; Program Services</p>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple hereby grants You during the Term, a limited, non-exclusive, personal, revocable, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a reasonable number of copies of the Apple Software provided to You under the Program <strong>on Apple-branded products</strong> owned or controlled by You, to be used internally by You or Your Authorized Developers for the sole purpose of developing or testing Covered Products designed to operate on the applicable Apple-branded products, except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.6 No Other Permitted Uses</p>
<p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, You agree not to rent, lease, lend, upload to or host on any website or server, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Apple Software, Apple Certificates, or any Services, in whole or in part, or to enable others to do so. You may not use the Apple Software, Apple Certificates, or any Services provided hereunder for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement, including any applicable Attachments and Schedules. <strong>You agree not to install, use or run the Apple SDKs on any non-Apple-branded computer</strong>, and not to install, use or run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS, and Provisioning Profiles on or in connection with devices other than Apple-branded products, or to enable others to do so. <strong>You may not and You agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted under this Agreement), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, decrypt, or create derivative works of the Apple Software</strong>, Apple Certificates or any Services provided by the Apple Software or otherwise provided hereunder, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by licensing terms governing use of open-sourced components or sample code included with the Apple Software).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am not a lawyer, so I can&#39;t give a very informed opinion about whether this falls within the permitted use or whether these terms are even enforceable. I am aware that the <em>copyright</em> situation with regard to reverse engineering for compatibility has changed recently (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc." rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Oracle vs Google</a>), but I&#39;m not sure to what extent that affects the terms in the license agreement.</p>
<p>At the very least, I can say that it seems risky, and certainly if you <em>do</em> deploy directly to the AppStore (as it is suggested is coming) I would not be surprised if you were found to be in violation of the agreement. Again, not a lawyer, but my understanding of the Epic Games vs Apple case is that Apple has pretty wide latitude to terminate developer accounts.</p>
<p>Can you comment on this? I assume you know better than I do. What&#39;s your understanding of the licensing issue?</p>

              <p>I&#39;ve personally been using xtool on Mac hardware, where it&#39;s still very useful in that it&#39;s a lot more lightweight and declarative than Xcode, and for that matter when dual-booting a different OS (think Asahi Linux / Bootcamp Windows.)</p>
<p>xtool itself doesn&#39;t vend any traces of the Apple SDKs / toolchains, which is why the setup process asks users to download and provide a copy of Xcode.xip themselves, and builds the iOS SDK on the spot. I&#39;m not a lawyer but one should definitely read the license agreement and determine whether their use case in compliance â€” you do have to agree to it before you download Xcode.xip.</p>
<p>And regarding distribution: since xtool works on both Linux and macOS, if someone is wary of publishing from Linux CI (say their CI provider doesnâ€™t guarantee that their Linux jobs will run on macOS hardware) they&#39;re definitely free to perform the final App Store build on macOS CI instead.</p>

<p>I briefly mentioned this in the gotchas section, but xtool canâ€™t start a debugging session itself quite yet, though itâ€™s on the roadmap. In the meantime you can use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pymobiledevice3</a> to start a debug session on your device, and then attach to it with lldbâ€™s remote functionality. I realize that it might not be super clear how to do this, so I might write some documentation on the pymobiledevice3 setup even before we&#39;re able to integrate this into xtool.</p>
