    <h1>PQConnect: Automated Post-Quantum End-to-End Tunnels</h1>

<p>PQConnect: Intro</p>
<p>PQConnect is a new easy-to-install layer of Internet security.
PQConnect lets you take action right now on your computer
to address the threat of quantum attacks,
without waiting for upgrades in the applications that you are using.</p>
<p>PQConnect automatically applies post-quantum cryptography
from end to end between computers running PQConnect.
PQConnect adds cryptographic protection to unencrypted applications,
works in concert with existing pre-quantum applications to add post-quantum protection,
and adds a second application-independent layer of defense
to any applications that have begun to incorporate application-specific post-quantum protection.</p>
<p>VPNs similarly apply to unmodified applications,
and
<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/stable-quantum-resistant-tunnels-in-the-app">some</a>
<a href="https://rosenpass.eu/">VPNs</a>
support post-quantum cryptography.
However, VPNs protect your traffic only between your computer
and the VPN proxies that you have configured your computer to contact:
VPN traffic is not encrypted end-to-end to other servers.
The
<a href="https://www.pqconnect.net/crypto.html#bpn">advantage</a> of PQConnect
is that, once you have installed PQConnect on your computer,
PQConnect <em>automatically</em> detects servers that support PQConnect,
and transparently encrypts traffic to those servers.
If you are a system administrator installing PQConnect on the server side:
configuring a server name to announce PQConnect support is easy.</p>
<h2>What to read next</h2>
<p>The installation instructions for PQConnect are split between two scenarios.</p>
<p>If you are a system administrator
(for example, running a web server),
you should follow the
<a href="https://www.pqconnect.net/sysadmin.html">installation instructions for sysadmins</a>.
This covers setting up the PQConnect server software to handle incoming PQConnect connections from clients.</p>
<p>If you are a normal user
(for example, using a web browser),
you should follow the
<a href="https://www.pqconnect.net/user.html">installation instructions for users</a>.
This covers setting up the PQConnect client software to handle outgoing PQConnect connections to servers.</p>
<p>What about the combined scenario
that your computer is a client <em>and</em> a server
(for example, your computer is running an SMTP server
and is also making outgoing SMTP connections)?
Then you should follow the
installation instructions for sysadmins.</p>
<h2><a name="chat">Chat server</a></h2>
<p>We have very recently set up <a href="https://zulip.pqconnect.net"><span>https://zulip.pqconnect.net</span></a>
using Zulip, a popular open-source web-based chat system.
