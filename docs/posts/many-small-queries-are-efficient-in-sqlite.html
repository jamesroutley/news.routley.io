Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite
</p>
</div>







<ul>
<li><p>
200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database
engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

</p></li><li><p>
But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.

</p></li><li><p>
SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like
client/server databases.  But SQLite can do many smaller queries
efficiently too.  Application developers can use whichever technique
works best for the task at hand.
     
</p></li></ul>



<p>
The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website">Appropriate Uses For SQLite</a> page says that
dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL
statements each.
This has provoked criticism from readers.  Examples:

</p><ul>
<li><p>
<i>&#34;200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page&#34;</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>&#34;For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.&#34;</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>&#34;[This is] bad design&#34;</i>
</p></li></ul>

<p>
Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server
database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.  In
a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message
round-trip from the application to the database server and back to
the application.  Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially,
can be a serious performance drag.  This is sometimes called the
&#34;N+1 Query Problem&#34; or the &#34;N+1 Select Problem&#34; and it is an anti-pattern.

</p>

<p>
SQLite is <u>not</u> client/server, however.  The SQLite database runs
in the same process address space as the application.  Queries do not
involve message round-trips, only a function call.  The latency
of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite.  Hence, using a large number
of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

</p>

<p>
The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by
the <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control system</a>.
A typical dynamic
page would be a timeline such as <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline</a>.
A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below.

</p><p>
The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options
from the &#34;config&#34; and &#34;global_config&#34; tables of the Fossil database.
Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements
to be displayed on the timeline.
This &#34;timeline&#34; query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex
relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and
complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes
to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.

</p><p>
Following the single big &#34;timeline&#34; query, 
there are additional queries for each timeline element.
Fossil is using the &#34;N+1 Query&#34; pattern rather than trying
to grab all the information in as few queries as possible.
But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.
At the bottom of
each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate
the page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than
25 milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds
were spent inside the database engine.

</p><p>
Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  
But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the
section of the code that creates the timeline query can be
completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline
entry for display.
This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code
simple and easy to maintain.  Secondly, the information
needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information,
vary according to what type of objects are to be shown.  Check-ins need one
set of queries.  Tickets need another set of queries.  Wiki pages need a
different query.  And so forth.  By implementing these queries on-demand
and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is
further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall 
code base.

</p><p>
So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can
do many smaller and simpler queries.  Both are efficient.  An application
can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the
situation at hand.

The following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular
timeline (captured on 2016-09-16):
