<ul><li>People search for the <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life" title="Meaning of life">meaning of life</a>, but this is the easy question: we are born into a world that presents us with many millennia of collected knowledge and information, and all our predecessors ask of us is that we not waste our brief life ignoring the past only to rediscover or reinvent its lessons badly.
<ul><li>&#34;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://naggum.no/erik/knowledge.html">Knowledge and Information</a>&#34;.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Just as other information should be available to those who want to learn and understand, program source code is the only means for programmers to learn the art from their predecessors. It would be unthinkable for playwrights not to allow other playwrights to read their plays, but only be present at theater performances where they would be barred even from taking notes. Likewise, any good author is well read, as every child who learns to write will read hundreds of times more than it writes. Programmers, however, are expected to invent the alphabet and learn to write long novels all on their own. Programming cannot grow and learn unless the next generation of programmers have access to the knowledge and information gathered by other programmers before them.

<ul><li>Common Lisp is a big-city language. Spit out the hayseed, pronounce &#34;shit&#34; with one syllable and &#34;shotgun&#34; with two. You&#39;re not in Kansas, anymore. C is the language of the poor farmer village where the allocation of every seed and livestock matters, where taxes are low and public service non-existent. Appreciating the value of a large language is evidently hard for many people, just like many people find themselves miserable in the big city and go to great lengths to create a small village for themselves in the city where everything is like it used to be where they came from.

However, this suits people a hell of a lot better than setting out at age 6 to become a great ballet dancer and achieving their goal 20 years later after every tendon and muscle and joint has been asked to perform just a little bit more than nature ever intended over and over and over again.

When the theory acquires a life of its own because some people like it more than the real world, all kinds of uninspiring, uninteresting things happen, so the key is <i>both</i> to listen to the problem and to study the theory. But always remember that just as much theory is bunk as there are buggy solutions. There is nothing more wrong with &#34;theory&#34; than &#34;solutions&#34; – both their quality and their applicability are orthogonal to their existence.

<ul><li>More and more, people see that solving <i>any</i> problem is a question of acquiring knowledge and having respect for the cognitive and epistemological processes involved in the human brain: use what you know, learn what you can, and if you have to guess, be <i>aware</i> that you do so you can go back and update your guesses when you (hopefully) learn more.

<ul><li>You have failed to consider the ramifications of the solutions and pose a problem that simply would not exist if you did. This taxes my patience, which is already legendary in its general absence.

<ul><li>Please note: if you think the above is offensive, it is of course a joke and you did not get it. If you do not find it offensive, it is of course not a joke, and you did not get it. This is not a joke. Get it?

<ul><li>Intellectual laziness is punishable by brain death. It is a natural law.</li></ul>
<ul><li>God grant me serenity to accept the code I cannot change, courage to change the code I can, and wisdom to know the difference.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Microsoft is not the answer. Microsoft is the question. NO is the answer.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In a fight against something, the fight has value, victory has none. In a fight for something, the fight is a loss, victory merely relief.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Act from reason, and failure makes you rethink and study harder. Act from faith, and failure makes you blame someone and push harder.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The past is not more important than the future, despite what your culture has taught you. Your future observations, conclusions, and beliefs are more important to you than those in your past ever will be. The world is changing so fast the balance between the past and the future has shifted.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If this is not what you expected, please alter your expectations.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sufficiently advanced political correctness is indistinguishable from sarcasm.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Environmentalists are much too concerned with planet Earth. Their geocentric attitude prevents them from seeing the greater picture – lots of planets are much worse off than Earth is.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Suppose we blasted all politicians into space. Would the SETI project find even one of them?</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you are concerned about netiquette, you are either concerned about your own and <i>follow</i> good netiquette, or you are concerned about others and <i>violate</i> good netiquette by bothering people with your &#34;concern&#34;, as the only netiquette you can <i>actually</i> affect is your own.</li></ul>
