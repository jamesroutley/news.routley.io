    <h1>Cheapest domain you can register for 10 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>I&#39;m concerned about the longevity of the domains I register. I want my domains to be available for as long as possible. But it seems that every year prices rise - and the discount often provided for a new domain rarely continues into subsequent years.</p><p>So I recently started renewing them for as long as possible. It turns out that most domains can be registered for a maximum of 10 years<sup id="fnref-43463-ten"><a href="#fn-43463-ten" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>.</p><p>A typical <code>.uk</code> domain will set you back the thick end of a hundred quid if you want it for a decade! Can I find something cheaper?</p><p>There are some free domain services like <a href="https://freenom.com/">freenom.com</a>. They&#39;ll give you a <code>.ml</code> domain for free. But you&#39;ll have to log in every year if you want to renew it. And, as I recently found out, they will sometimes just take away your free name and try to charge you for it.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://nic.ua/en/domains/.pp.ua"><code>.pp.ua</code> offers free domains to people in Ukraine</a>. They can only be registered for a single year at a time though.</p><p>If you want a Top Level Domain which you <em>can</em> renew for a decade, the cheapest appears to be <a href="http://www.nic.feedback/"><code>.feedback</code></a> which costs a smidge under £13 for 10 years.</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-25-at-18-13-44-My-Cart.png" alt="Screenshot showing £12.80 for 10 years." width="497" height="462"/></p><p>But, of course, there is a catch! You have to <a href="http://www.eggsample.feedback/reviews">use the <code>.feedback</code> website hosting service</a> which, frankly, looks rubbish.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem to be receiving any updates. I&#39;ve tried contacting them to see if any improvements are planned, but didn&#39;t receive a reply. You can&#39;t set your own nameservers, nor can you add MX records or anything useful like that.</p><p>The cheapest fully functional domain which you can register for a decade appears to be <a href="https://www.sav.com"><code>.cyou</code> from Sav.com</a> at about £23 (US$27.60).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-25-at-18-02-42-Your-Cart.png" alt="Screenshot showing the domain cost at sav.com." width="675" height="309"/></p><p>Up next is <a href="https://porkbun.com/checkout/search?q=asdfsdadsfadsf.stream"><code>.stream</code> from Porkbun</a> - you can buy a 10 year domain for ~£30 (US$35.60).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-25-at-18-05-31-porkbun.com-An-oddly-satisfying-experience.png" alt="Screenshot showing the price." width="937" height="335"/></p><p>So, there you have it. For between £23 - £30 you can buy a <em>useful</em> domain name which will stay registered to you for a decade. If you can find anything cheaper - please let me know in the comments.</p><p>Of course, paying for <em>hosting</em> for a decade is a different matter!</p></div></div>
