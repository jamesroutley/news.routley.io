    <div><p>At the Walthamstow Wetlands gift shop you can find a range of nature inspired items (for yourself or as gifts!) to take home with you after a day of exploring the stunning wetlands. </p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><div><p>One of our latest additions to the shop are Optical Hardware’s excellent binoculars and monoculars, helping you to get up close and personal with the diverse range of wildlife that calls this unique habitat home.</p>
<p>London Wildlife Trust spoke to Chris Baker Snr (Optical Hardware Founder) about their journey creating the business.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Both Chris and his son (Chris Jnr) started full time work after university in different fields of chemical engineering, not a field you would normally associate with optics!  During weekends and vacations, they worked on shows and exhibitions selling optics for Chris Snr’s friend from his school years, this is where the interest in optics was born.</p>
<p>Their general interest in wildlife and the use of optics was enhanced by travel adventures, Chris Snr on winter trips to North America, whale watching in Norway and observing wildlife and scenery in the UK.   Chris Jnr on his honeymoon to Borneo and later trips to South Africa on safari, his binoculars also come in handy at cricket matches too.</p>
<p>In May 2005 Optical Hardware Ltd was set up by Chris Snr and said school friend, opening a small office in their home town of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and the journey began.  Initial intentions were to be a small specialist supplier for one off, made to order astronomical telescopes and general optics for the education sector, the latter because both Chris Snr and his friend had spells teaching secondary school science.  Six months into the venture/adventure a twist of fate changed their intended direction and Optical Hardware became a business-to-business supplier of a wide range of optics and related accessories.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>In the following years Optical Hardware steadily increased its customer base of dealers, continuing to promote their products and brands at exhibitions and shows across the country.  Their presence, products and business model did not go un-noticed in the trade and other brands started offering them the opportunity to distribute their product as well as establishing their own.</p>
<p>The mantra of the company was, and still is, the supply of products for function not fashion, along with that well-known Yorkshire trait of value for money.  We want the best performance per pound invested, for every person who uses our product.</p>
<p>In 2018, Chris Snr’s friend retired from the business, this is when Chris Jnr joined the company, moving his existing business to Barnsley and in 2019 they set about restructuring, updating and improving the product portfolio.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>In January 2020 Covid 19 arrived in the UK and the world was locked down, there was a decision to be made as major suppliers had their production lines closed.  The decision was taken to modify and continue with the company re-organisation and planning for the product update programme, Optical Hardware came out of the other end, still able to operate but unfortunately, a number of their dealers hadn’t.  There were times of struggle, but in a strange way, a lot of the optics industry “benefited” from the pandemic.  People were not at work, they were at home with time on their hands, they had time to re-ignite their interest in old hobbies, bird watching, rambling, astronomy etc.  Many invested in a new pair of binoculars, spotting scope or astronomical telescope and the related accessories.  The problem at that time was that there were no factories producing products, lots of research and thinking outside of the box solved the problem, allowing Optical Hardware’s journey to continue.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Optical Hardware prides itself on listening and working together with its dealers and their customers, helping both to find the product that best fits their requirements.  Many years of speaking to the public on exhibitions and shows helps us to recommend what is right for the task at hand, very often it is not the most expensive or most powerful product on the shelf that fits the bill.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#39;re a seasoned bird watcher or simply looking to explore the great outdoors, be sure to stop by our gift shop and pick up a pair of fantastic binoculars or monocular!</p>
