<p>Well, it happened.</p>



<p>We knew it was coming.</p>



<p>A prick <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/12/twitter-api-appears-to-be-down-breaking-tweetbot-and-third-party-clients/">pulled the plug</a>. And what bothers me most about it is how Space Karen did it.</p>



<p>My mom passed away just before Christmas. Her decline was something everyone in the family saw coming and we prepared for her demise. It still hurts like hell, but she left with love and dignity. That makes all the difference when it comes to coping with loss.</p>



<p>Twitterrific is something that <a href="https://iconfactory.com/#aboutus">we’ve all</a> poured our love into for <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2007/01/introducing-twitterrific/">the past 16 years</a>. I’m not usually one to toot my own horn, but <a href="https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">we literally crafted the early experience</a> on the service. We often hear that folks joined up because of our app. Our work was definitive and <a href="https://iconfactory.com/twitterrific_touch/">groundbreaking</a>. We loved this app like I loved my mom.</p>



<p>(Note today’s date and the one on <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2007/01/introducing-twitterrific/">our announcement</a> – the fuckwads missed our 16th anniversary by a couple of days! King Shithead probably thought Friday the 13th was lol. I’d love some proof that the API went down at 04:20 in UTC +1.)</p>



<p>Like my mom, the API has been declining for awhile. Endpoints were removed, new features were unavailable to third parties, and rate limiting restricted what we could do. And like my mom, we struggled on and did the best we could, trying to stay upbeat about it all.</p>



<p>What bothers me about Twitterrific’s final day is that it was not dignified. There was no advance notice for its creators, customers just got a weird error, and no one is explaining what’s going on. We had no chance to thank customers who have been with us for over a decade. Instead, it’s just another scene in their ongoing shit show.</p>



<p>But I guess that’s what you should expect from a shitty person.</p>



<p>Personally, <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/1613956147278655488">I’m done</a>. And with a vengeance.</p>



<p>First, arrogant bastards love seeing their names on tweets and other media. I want to starve him of the things that money can’t buy: respect and attention. Do the same by simply ignoring him and his kingdom.</p>



<p>Secondly, for the past several months I’ve been thinking about where we go from here. When you see decline, you plan for a demise. It was the last thing mom taught me.</p>



<p>I’ve been <a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry">active on Mastodon</a> since the billionaire bozo took over. And it makes me think.</p>



<p>One thing I’ve noticed is that everyone is going to great lengths to make something that replaces the clients we’ve known for years. That’s an excellent goal that eases a transition in the short-term, but ignores how a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">new open standard</a> (ActivityPub) can be leveraged in new and different ways.</p>



<p>Federation exposes a lot of different data sources that you’d want to follow. Not all of these sources will be <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> instances: you may want to stay up-to-date with someone’s <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, or maybe another person’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/">Tumblr</a>, or someone else’s <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">photo feed</a>. There are many <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/miscellaneous/">apps</a> and <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers/">servers</a> for you to choose from.</p>



<p>It feels like the time is right for a truly universal timeline. That notion excites me like the first time I <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/1550493">posted XML status to an endpoint</a>.</p>



<p>One thing I remember from these early days: no one had any idea what they were doing. It was all new and things like @screen_name,  #hashtags, or RT hadn’t been invented yet. Heck, we didn’t even call them <a href="https://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/">“tweets”</a> or use a <a href="http://gedblog.com/2007/05/11/twitter-identity-transference-syndrome-twits/">bird icon</a> at first! The best ideas came from people using the service: all of the things mentioned above grew organically from a need.</p>



<p>That’s where I want to be in the future. Exploring unknown territory that empowers others and adapts to the needs of a community.</p>



<p>There’s no sense in clinging to the personal whims of a clown leading a shit show. Especially when his circus will end up being a $44 billion version of MySpace.</p>
