    <h1>Not Like Home</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Koala and Turtle looked around in awe. The forest was lush and green, and the leaves swayed gently in the wind. “It’s beautiful here”, sighed Koala, and her ears wiggled a bit.</p>
<p>Turtle smiled for a while. Then he sniffed. He sniffed again. “It doesn’t smell like home”, he said with a tiny bit of melancholy.</p>
<p>Koala frowned. But between her big ears she was thinking very hard. All of a sudden she smiled again, and moved her face very close to that of Turtle. With her paw gently resting under Turtle’s nose, she said: “and now?”</p>
<p>Turtle sniffed, and he sniffed again. He could smell Koala, and he knew every bit of that smell. “Now it smells like home.”</p>
