              <p><a href="https://mixmag.net/read/us-congress-spotify-controversial-discovery-mode-news">Spotify</a> has confirmed that it will end its service in Uruguay, after the country&#39;s Parliament approved an amendment to its copyright law that would require &#34;equitable remuneration&#34; for artists.</p><p>A spokesperson <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-to-phase-out-its-service-in-uruguay-from-january-1-2024-over-music-copyright-law-changes/" target="_blank">confirmed yesterday</a> (Monday 20) that Spotify will begin to &#34;phase out&#34; its service in the country from January 1, 2024 — will all operations ceasing by February.</p><p>The bill, which is titled &#34;Rendición de Cuentas,&#34; was first introduced by Uruguayan Society of Performers (SUDEI) earlier this year, proposing to amend Articles 284 &amp; 285 of Uruguays copyright law.</p><p>The modification, which was approved by the Uruguayan Parliament last month, is set to introduce a requirement for &#34;fair and equitable remuneration&#34; for artists in regards to their recorded material. </p><p><strong>Read this next: </strong><a href="https://mixmag.net/read/spotify-reportedly-will-start-paying-less-royalties-to-less-popular-artists-news"><strong>Spotify will reportedly start paying less royalties to less popular artists</strong></a></p><p>The bill also introduces a requirement for &#34;social networks and the Internet&#34; to be treated as &#34;formats for which, if a song is reproduced, the performer is entitled to financial remuneration.&#34;</p><p>The streaming giant <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-threatens-uruguay-exit-amid-proposed-changes-to-music-copyright-laws/" target="_blank">had first threatened to end its service</a> when the bill, titled &#34;Rendición de Cuentas,&#34; was first tabled in July — claiming that the proposed changes &#34;lack clarity&#34; and “an additional mandatory payment for music services”.</p><p><a href="https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/spotify-alerta-con-dejar-el-pais-si-no-se-corrigen-dos-articulos-de-la-rendicion-que-hacen-inviable-su-negocio" target="_blank">In a letter</a> sent to Uruguay&#39;s Minister of Education Pablo Da Silveira, a spokesperson for Spotify said: &#34;If the proposed reform became law in its current form, Spotify&#39;s business in Uruguay could become unfeasible, to the detriment of Uruguayan music and its fans,&#34; claiming that the amendment would force it to &#34;pay twice&#34; the amount of royalties. </p><p><a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-to-phase-out-its-service-in-uruguay-from-january-1-2024-over-music-copyright-law-changes/" target="_blank">In its statement confirming the end to its services</a> in Uruguay yesterday, Spotify said: “Without clarity on the changes to music copyright laws included in the 2023 Rendición de Cuentas law – confirming that any additional costs are the responsibility of rights holders – Spotify will unfortunately begin to phase out its service in Uruguay effective January 1, 2024, and fully cease service by February.&#34; </p><p><strong>Read this next: </strong><a href="https://mixmag.net/read/uk-watchdog-streaming-study-spotify-major-labels-news"><strong>UK watchdog launches study into streaming services with “excessive power”</strong></a></p><p>“Spotify already pays nearly 70% of every dollar it generates from music to the record labels and publishers that own the rights for music, and represent and pay artists and songwriters,&#34; it continues.<br/></p><p>“Any additional payments would make our business untenable. We are proud to be their largest revenue driver, having contributed more than $40B to date. And because of streaming, the music industry in Uruguay has grown 20% in 2022 alone.&#34; </p><p>Speaking to El Observador last month, SUDEI spokesperson Gabriela Pintos insisted that the organisation &#34;was not against platforms&#34; but instead wants royalties &#34;to be distributed fairly.&#34;</p><p>Pintos expanded that other countries have made moves to ensure &#34;digital reproduction&#34; of music, and that &#34;the legislation is not a demand for an increased contribution from streaming services&#34; but instead &#34;legislation that would ensure artists can negotiate a percentage that corresponds to us.&#34;</p><p><em>Megan Townsend is Mixmag&#39;s Deputy Editor, follow her on </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mmtowns" target="_blank"><em>Twitter</em></a></p>
