<p dir="auto">+1, and we are in desperate need of a CVE and security advisory to be announced asap. This could affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of services actively running on the internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">We of course appreciate the efforts from contributors, but overall this is a major security issue that needs a new version release and a security advisory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My understanding is that the procedure is to hold off on announcing the vulnerability until a patch is available. (See <a href="https://www.apache.org/security/" rel="nofollow">https://www.apache.org/security/</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For background:</p>
<p dir="auto">The team is taking it seriously. As Gary said, we are all volunteers working on this in our spare time. We are also in different time zones so communication is not instantaneous. If you think things can be improved, that&#39;s great! We need more people like you and I would encourage you to <a href="https://community.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">get involved</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">We are in the process of getting a release out with the fix. During review, some security experts found a new vulnerability in our fix (a way to bypass the fix). This has been addressed and we are now in the process of reviewing the updated 2nd release candidate.</p>
<p dir="auto">Usually (as per ASF rules) the team <a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval" rel="nofollow">should wait 72 hours</a> after creating a release candidate before publishing the release to give the community enough time to review and cast their votes. We are building consensus to shorten that window for this particular release, given its urgency.</p>
