    <h1>Launch HN: Modern Realty (YC S24) â€“ AI Real Estate Agent for Home Buyers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN! We&#39;re Raymond Xu and Raffi Isanians, the team behind Modern Realty (<a href="https://modernrealty.io">https://modernrealty.io</a>). Modern Realty is an AI-powered real estate buying experience that helps you purchase homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/VhsWSVn5blA</a></p><p>Our mission at Modern Realty is to make home buying easier, faster, and far more enjoyable. We interpret real estate data, giving you an edge on other home buyers.</p><p>Since 2024, there has been a growing need for innovative solutions in real estate, especially with tools like Zillow making it easier than ever for buyers to find the right house at the right price. However, the process still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution.</p><p>Raymond and Raffi came face-to-face with this technology&#39;s potential while working on AI at Google and handling billion-dollar asset transactions as an attorney, respectively. The AI tools we&#39;ve built guide users through every step of the home-buying process, from scheduling showings to making offers, all without the need for a traditional agent.</p><p>Before we expand further, this summer we&#39;ve built our core AI real estate agent, which can handle everything from disclosure summaries to competitive market analyses. You can see our platform in action at <a href="https://modernrealty.io">https://modernrealty.io</a>. We&#39;re particularly proud of our offer generation tool, which creates offers that are then reviewed by an attorney at no additional cost.</p><p>We&#39;re excited to be launching here on HN and would love to hear what you think! If you&#39;re in the market for a new home or just curious about the future of real estate, visit our website or schedule a call with us to get started.</p></div></div></div>
