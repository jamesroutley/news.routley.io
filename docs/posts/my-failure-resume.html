          I make new websites every month or so. Some in the past have made money, but most have failed. 
          In fact, almost everything I have tried to do has failed.
          My goal now is to have as many people play with my stuff as possible.
          Follow me if you want to watch someone build things in real time or fail gloriously.
          I am tracking all metrics live here and sharing my failings.

          <li>To get intial people to your website, post and comment on subreddits and hackernews discussions when it is relevant. <i>(Learned at 1 follower)</i> </li>
          <li>Many mods will see your website link as spammy even if the users like it. Images/Youtube are seen as more acceptable. <i>(Learned at 8 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>Donâ€™t waste time putting a payment link if nobody is even using the website. Even better, get a payment before making the site. This is less fun however. <i>(Learned at 36 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>Only the most interested fans will sign up for your email list. Social media gives people with slight interest a noncommittal way to follow you. Also social proof. <i>(Learned at 91 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>You can get large amounts of new people to see your website/Tiktok one time, but they will repeatedly check out your work on Twitter/Youtube. Convert everyone to those. <i>(Learned at 175 followers)</i></li>
          <li>A quick crutch is to build on top of the effort of others. Ideally something interesting/viral that doesn&#39;t have enough attention. Or something from 10+ years ago that everyone forgot. 
            Many top creators played games, interviewed someone, or reacted to other content when they started. As a bonus, you learn what truly creative &amp; good content looks like.  Beware of doing this too much. <i>(Learned at 333 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>The Tiktok audience typically wants to be entertained. The Twitter audience typically wants to be part of a conversation. Carefully think when you link to either one. <i>(Learned at 385 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>Find people with the type of followers you want. The more followers these people have than you, the better. Be early to comment on their posts with something relevant and interesting. Their early followers will check out your profile. <i>(Learned at 425 followers)</i> </li>
          <li>Summarize breaking news. Everyone is too lazy to read. The earlier you do it, the better. You can post your summary several different times with different angles (funny, informative, etc) to see what sticks. <i>(Learned at 520 followers)</i></li> 
          <li>Get bigger accounts to repost, like, and comment on your posts. The easy way is by positively talking about something they are working on (ideally in a unique way) or being on their side in some controversy. The better way is by writing things they find relevant and interesting. You can even link to it in their threads. <i>(Learned at 520 followers)</i></li>
          <!--<li>If a post is getting a fair amount of likes and reposts, test out paying to promote it. <i>(Learned at  followers)</i></li>
          <li>Take screenshots of your own posts with your handle visible in incognito mode and post to relevant subreddits that allow this. If people have further questions in the comments, link to your post directly. It may take several viral posts for people to decide to check you out. <i>(Learned at  followers)</i></li>-->
          <li><i>Current Hypothesis:</i> For Twitter/Tiktok post several times a day to get into the algorthim that suggests your content to others without them directly following you. This may take up to 6 weeks. Also buy Twitter Blue.</li>

      <h3>School Fails</h3>
      
        <li>The head of my University Computer Science Department, Professor Matthias Felleisen, said I am not in the top 10% of all students he has met when asked by my cofounder.</li>
        <li>Rejected from my high school&#39;s Gifted Program. Although most of my friends got in.</li>
        <li>My Speech Team coach Mr. Craddock, never let me represent the school for state 3 years in a row competing against 2 others.</li>
        <li>Tied 6 times for 1st place on Speech Team, but never received one on my own.</li>
        <li>Business Professional of America (BPA) never placed at State or went to nationals.</li>
        <li>Most notably, I never even got 3rd place at BPA State even with only 3 people competing as I got disqualified for not handing in my code to place.</li>
        <li>My Science teacher, Mr. Zimolzak told me I shouldn&#39;t take off a 3 days of school to go to State for BPA even though my friend was because I am not as smart and my grades were low.</li>
        <li>Rejected from hosting my high school&#39;s Variety Show. 3 people applied in total and the other 2 were chosen to co-host it.</li>
        <li>Rejected from my grade school Accelerated Program. Although most of my friends got in.</li>
