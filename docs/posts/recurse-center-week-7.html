    <h1>Recurse Center: Week 7</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc="">Fri Jan 10</p> <p data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""><em data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc="">harder // better // faster // stronger</em></p>  <p>🪩 And we’re back from winter break: happy new year! And welcome to my new Winter 2, 2025 batch-mates.</p>
<p>❄️ RC’s return coincided with about 6+ inches of snow here on the Maryland side of the DC suburbs - quite a lot for this area nowadays. The trade-off of suburban life versus our old Brooklyn life became crystal clear when I found myself digging out our driveway on Monday evening.</p>
<p>🚼 Three (3!!!) snow days in a row for daycare meant lots of unplanned quality time with my 10-month-old! Still getting used to this working + childcare dance. Having flexibility in our schedule is such a blessing, even if I forget that all the time and grow anxious about “productivity.” I am looking forward to next Friday’s hub visit: we are planning to make a too-quick, weekend trip up to Brooklyn around some family birthdays!</p>
<p>🎯 The mid-batch reflection workshop in December helped me set some goals for this second half of batch: (1) push through the mental barrier I’ve built up around the next iterations of this site (this will also help with <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#work-at-the-edge" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working at the edge of my abilities<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a>); (2) pair more (combines working at the edge of my abilities with interview prep); (3) <a href="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/blog">blog</a> and <a href="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/stream">stream</a> more content; (4) nature of code: redux and keeping up on creative pursuits; (5) next company hunt and practice interviews. Roughly in that order.</p>
<p>📝 Finally published my first project write-up of RC: <a href="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/blog/2025/01/rc-batchviz">batches of batch: visualizing RC interests</a>. What was meant to be a “warmup” has turned into much more time and many more words than anticipated, but getting it out there feels like finally clearing out the mental space for new projects.</p>
<p>⏰ <em>The Artist’s Way</em> morning pages have been an interesting challenge. It turns out that they are meant to be written first thing when you wake up - which is tricky as a night owl with the aforementioned 10-month-old who usually wakes around 7:15am. But I managed my first 25-minute session before he woke up on Friday morning. Now to keep my 1-day streak alive, heading into the weekend…</p>
<p>📊 Put together a small visualization that I am proud of called <a href="https://iconix.github.io/rc-daysleft/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">days left at rc<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a>. It is a modified version of <a href="https://days.rory.codes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rory Flint’s “Day by Day”<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a>, which was itself inspired by Wait But Why’s <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Your Life in Weeks”<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a> - although I like to think of my version as less morbid and less presumptuous (assuming 85 years of life?! I could get hit by a truck tomorrow). I might update the name to “days left/spent at rc.” It attempts to capture this strange relationship with time that I have right now at RC, being hyper-aware of batch’s finite nature (as discussed in my <a href="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/blog/2024/12/rc-reflection-4">last reflection</a>). I find myself revisiting the viz in a perpetually open tab, sometimes finding it unnerving, but more often finding it comforting. I plan to write up this micro-project in a slightly longer blog post.</p>
<p>🎮 Finally took a step to get over the mental block around my main batch project: this site! Started looking at game assets and sketching out what I want the home page to evolve to. I know nothing about developing a game interface like the one that I am imagining. But as Angelou said, ain’t nothin’ to it but to do it.</p>
<p>🟩 Time-blocking has made its return to my daily routine, which helps me stay on track throughout the day (even if forever behind on the actual timings). The idea of refreshing <a href="https://github.com/iconix/fortudo" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my family app for time-blocking<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a> has re-emerged, sparked by discussions of <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">home-cooked apps<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a> and <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">software<span><img src="https://ohnadj.pages.dev/assets/external-link.svg" alt="External link icon"/></span></a> this week. There’s something wonderfully cozy and empowering about building tools for yourself and your community. I just might not have the time to return to this particular well this batch!</p>    </div></div>
