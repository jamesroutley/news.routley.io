<p>This book would not have been possible without the support of my family, who are incredibly patient with me when I get absorbed with yet another side project.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to Matthew Powers, a.k.a. Mr. Powers, for inspiring me to write this book in the first place. Matthew is the author of the book &#34;Writing Beautiful Apache Spark Code&#34; which is also available on Leanpub.</p>
<p>I also need to thank the countless people who have interacted with me over the past couple of years as I worked on the DataFusion project, especially the Apache Arrow PMC, committers, and contributors.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank Chris George and Joe Buszkiewic for their support and encouragement while working at RMS, where I further developed my understanding of query engines.</p>
