    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN. I&#39;m a student and for the past few months I&#39;ve found myself sitting at my desk each evening with no motivation to do anything. I want to change this. How have you all gotten out of long tracts of lethargy? What are some strategies or approaches you&#39;ve found to be effective in dealing with this?<p>Thank you for your advice!</p></td></div></div>
