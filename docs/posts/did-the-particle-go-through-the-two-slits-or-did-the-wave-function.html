<p>What is really going on in the quantum double-slit experiment? The question raised in this post’s title seems to lie at the heart of the matter.  In this experiment, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/01/16/double-trouble-the-quantum-two-slit-experiment-1/" data-type="post" data-id="20381">which I recently reviewed here</a>, particles of some sort are aimed, one at a time, at a wall with two slits, and their arrival is recorded on a screen behind the wall. As a parade of particles proceeds, one by one, past the wall, an interference pattern somehow appears, emerging gradually like a spectre on the screen.</p>



<p>Interference is a familiar effect, commonly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqm4f55soJQ">seen in water waves</a> and sound waves.  If water waves passed through a pair of slits in a wall, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#/media/File:Doubleslit3Dspectrum.gif">interference would be observed</a> and no one would be surprised. But here we have one particle passing through the wall at a time; it’s not at all the same thing. How can we explain the interference effect in this case? </p>



<p>It’s natural to imagine that somehow either</p>



<ul>
<li>each particle acts like a wave, goes through both slits, and interferes with itself, or</li>



<li>the quantum wave function that describes each particle (or all the particles [?]) goes through both slits and interferes with itself.</li>
</ul>



<p>So… which is it? Did the particle go through both slits, or did the wave function?</p>



<p>In 1920s quantum physics, there is a very simple answer to this question.  </p>



<p>The answer is,… </p>



<p>“<strong>No.</strong>“</p>



<p>No — neither the particle nor the wave function <em>[not its wavy pattern or its peak(s) or any other part of it]</em> goes through the two slits.</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>What!? Then how can there be interference?</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>That question I will answer in a later post, probably next week or the following. But first, let’s confront the title of this post in a simpler context, so that we can see clearly why — in 1920s quantum physics — the answer to its question is “neither one”.</p>



<h2>The Double Door Experiment</h2>



<p>Key to understanding the double-slit experiment is to simplify it down to its bare essence. Having a two-dimensional problem where particles are going through slits in a wall is more complicated than necessary. Instead, let’s take a one-dimensional problem that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/03/06/can-a-quantum-particle-move-in-two-directions-at-once/" data-type="post" data-id="21049">we’ve already looked at</a>, where an object is in a superposition state of going to the left <strong>OR</strong> going to the right. We already saw that this object is <strong>not</strong> to be viewed as both going to the left AND going to the right. By setting up measurements on both sides, we saw that it can only be measured to be doing one or the other, and never both. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/03/06/can-a-quantum-particle-move-in-two-directions-at-once/" data-type="post" data-id="21049">Superposition is an <strong>OR</strong>, not an <strong>AND</strong></a>.  And a true particle can only have one position at a time.</p>



<h3>The Particle and the Doors: A First Look</h3>



<p>In this context, let’s ask the question: <em>can a particle simultaneously go through two doors on opposite sides of a room?</em> This is the same question as the two-slit question, because I can turn one into the other using tubes behind the slits, as in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>By sending a particle toward two slits, we can arrange for its wave function to be in the superposition state we want (Fig. 2)</p>

<p>and then we can ask whether we can observe it going through both doors.</p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/03/06/can-a-quantum-particle-move-in-two-directions-at-once/" data-type="post" data-id="21049">in a recent post</a> we put two balls in the same locations that we now want to place the doors, and we asked if a particle in this very same superposition state can hit both balls simultaneously. The answer was “no”.  The same argument applies here; the particle cannot be observed to pass through both doors simultaneously. It can only go through one or the other.</p>



<p>Why? A particle, which has a position and a momentum (even if unknown to us), cannot have <strong>two</strong> positions.  If it starts between the two doors, it can move through one door or the other, but it cannot do both, because then it would have two positions at once. </p>



<p>Maybe you’re not immediately convinced.  If not, stay tuned, as I’ll come back to this again later. </p>



<h3>The Wave Function and the Doors: A First Look</h3>



<p>But for now, let’s turn to the other question arising from my post’s title. Why can’t the particle’s wave function move through both doors, just like a water wave or sound wave does?</p>



<p>Actually, since wave functions don’t move (they just describe particles that do) what we really want to know is slightly different.  The initial wave function has a wavy pattern; does this wavy pattern go through both doors?</p>



<p>Certainly water waves and sound waves could go through both doors.  They are waves <strong>in physical space</strong>. So are the doors (or slits) they they can pass through. </p>



<p>But the wave function is <strong>a wave in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/quantum-basics/physical-space-and-the-space-of-possibilities-a-crucial-distinction/understanding-the-space-of-possibilities-an-example/" data-type="page" data-id="20919">the space of possibilities</a></strong>, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/quantum-basics/physical-space-and-the-space-of-possibilities-a-crucial-distinction/" data-type="page" data-id="20817">not in physical space</a>. Conversely, the doors do not exist in the space of probabilities; <strong>doors are physical objects</strong>. Therefore the wave function (and its wavy patterns) cannot pass through the doors at all! </p>



<p>The very idea is nonsensical, the sort of thing that <a href="https://arthive.com/renemagritte/works/638327~The_improvement">René Magritte</a> would have enjoyed painting.  Having the wave function (or its pattern) pass through physical doors would be akin to you entering into Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet to save the lovers from their fates, or enjoying the taste of an apple painted by Rembrandt, or walking through a giant hole in a physicist’s argument. Physical space and the space of possibilities are conceptually different; they have distinct meanings.  At best one space merely represents what is happening in the other.  And so the objects that exist in one don’t exist as objects in the other. (Even when these spaces have the same shape, which sometimes they do, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/quantum-basics/physical-space-and-the-space-of-possibilities-a-crucial-distinction/understanding-the-space-of-possibilities-an-example/" data-type="page" data-id="20919">they represent different things, as indicated in the fact that they have different axes</a>.)</p>



<p>To convince you further of these statements, let’s take a look at a simpler example. Consider a system where there is just a single door, but there are two particles. Let’s see why the wave function of these particles (and its wave pattern) <strong>can’t even pass through one door</strong>, much less two.</p>



<h3>The Wave Function of Two Particles and a Single Door</h3>



<p>We’ll put the door on the right in physical space. Superposition states aren’t needed here, so instead we’ll send <strong>both particles rightward</strong> toward the door, in simple <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/10/elementary-particles-do-not-exist-part-1/" data-type="post" data-id="20562">wave-packet states</a>. These two particles will be given the same near-definite momentum, but their poorly known positions are shifted apart, so that they are separated in physical space. In pre-quantum language, the set-up is shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>What wave function do we need to describe this? It’s simplest to put the two particles in wave packet states with near-definite momentum, somewhat separated in space but with similar motion. You might first think the wave function for such a system would roughly look like Fig. 4:</p>

<p><strong>But no!</strong> That’s a trap that’s super-easy to fall into; such a wave function describes one particle in a superposition of two locations, not two particles. </p>



<p>Instead, because the first particle has position <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong> and the second has position <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong> respectively, their wave function, a function that exists in <strong>the two dimensional <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/quantum-basics/physical-space-and-the-space-of-possibilities-a-crucial-distinction/" data-type="page" data-id="20817">space of possibilities</a></strong> with axes <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong>, takes the form <em><strong>ψ(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>)</strong></em>. If we start with <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong> near 2 and <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong> near 0, as in Fig. 3, then the wave function for these two particles looks like Fig. 5: it has a peak near <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub>=2</em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub>=0</em></strong>. (The dashed black lines are just there to guide your eyes.)  The peak indicates that <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong> near 2 and <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong> near 0 are the most probable values for the two particles’ positions.</p>

<p>Now, where’s the door that we want to try to make the wave function go through? Great question. In physical space it is located at <strong><em>x=+4</em></strong>.

<p>Think it over…</p>



<p>Unsure? Confused?</p>



<p>That’s fine; there’s no reason not to be confused the first time you think about it.  Here’s the answer.</p>



<p>Particle 1 goes through the door when <strong><em><strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong>=+4</em></strong>, which is the vertical blue dashed line in Fig. 6. Meanwhile, particle 2 goes through it when <strong><em><strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong>=+4</em></strong>, so that’s the horizontal blue dashed line.</p>

<p>Does that look like a door to you? Certainly it doesn’t look like the door in physical space. And that’s because in the space of possibilities, <strong>the dashed lines are not a door</strong>, with mass and thickiness and a material make-up.  Instead the lines represent a certain set of possibilities, namely that one of the particles is <strong>at the location of</strong> the physical door.</p>



<p>In fact, there’s a special point, the intersection at <span><em><strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong></em></span><strong><em>=x<sub>2</sub>=4</em></strong> where the lines cross, that represents the possibility that both particles are simultaneously at the location of the door. No such intersection of lines exists in physical space.  This is an intersection of two classes of possibilities, and such a thing can only exist in the space of possibilities.</p>



<p>The lines divide the space into four regions, representing four more general classes of possibilities, shown in Fig. 7. In the lower left region, both particles are to the left of the door. At far right, particle 1 is to the right of the door while particle 2 is to the left; the reverse is true in the upper left region. Finally, at upper right is the region where both particles are to the right of the door.</p>

<p>The wave function’s pattern moves in the two dimensions that are spanned by the <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>2</sub></em></strong>. axes. Both particles are moving to the right in physical space, at approximately the same speed. Consequently, the wave function, as it evolves, carries the most probable state of the system across three of the regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>initially both particles are to the left of the door </li>



<li>then particle 1 is to the right of the door while particle 2 remains to the left</li>



<li>and finally both particles are to the right of the door.</li>
</ul>



<p>In pre-quantum physics the path traversed by the two-particle system would look like Fig. 8:</p>

The blue dashed lines are those of Figs. 6-8, and the path of the peak is similar to that shown in Fig. 8.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Now, is the wave function going <strong><em>through</em></strong> the door? Again, there is no door here; there are simply lines that tell us when one particle is coincident with the door, as well as a point where both particles are coincident with the door. It’s true that the wavy pattern and the peak of the wave function (which indicates the possibilities where the system is most likely to be found are passing across the lines.  But can we say the wave function (or its wavy pattern) passes <strong><em>through</em></strong> the lines? </p>



<p>No: moving through a door involves moving in physical space, along the <strong><em>x</em></strong>-axis, through a gap in a door frame.  This is something the wave function does not — cannot — do.</p>



<h3>The Wave Function of Two Particles and Two Doors</h3>



<p>If you’re still not yet entirely convinced, consider what happens if we have two doors, one on each side. Let’s put our two particles each in a superposition state of moving leftward or moving rightward. Again we’ll set one particle off before the other, so that the first will reach the doors well before the second does.</p>



<p>Our pre-quantum view of such as system is that it now has four possibilities: particle 1 can be going right or left, and particle 2 can be going right or left, as shown in Fig. 10.  Only the upper-right option appeared in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>Notice the two intersections between the blue and green lines! What are these?! No such intersections between the doors can possibly occur in physical space. So this makes it even clearer that these lines cannot be identified with the doors. </p>



<p>What do these two intersections actually represent?  The upper left intersection combines the possibility that particle 1 is at the left door and simultaneously particle 2 is at the right door.  It’s the other way around at the lower right intersection.</p>



<p>Note <strong><em>there is no intersection, or any point at all, corresponding to particle 1 being at the left door and simultaneously being at the right door</em></strong>. Indeed, such a point would have <strong><em><strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong>=-4</em></strong> <strong>AND</strong> <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub>=+4</em></strong>, which is impossible; every point in the space of possibilities has a unique value of <strong><em>x<sub>1</sub></em></strong>.</p>



<p>How does the wave function behave over time? It behaves as shown in Fig. 13:</p>

<p>What are the four peaks, and what are they doing? They correspond to the four possibilities shown in Fig. 10. Clockwise from the rightmost peak (which appeared in Fig. 9,)</p>



<ol>
<li> particle 1 goes through the right door, followed by particle 2.</li>



<li> particle 1 goes through the right door, after which particle 2 goes through the left door.</li>



<li> particle 1 goes through the left door, followed by particle 2.</li>



<li> particle 1 goes through the left door, after which particle 2 goes through the right door.</li>
</ol>



<p>You can tell which is which by looking at which colored line is crossed first, and which is crossed second, by each peak.</p>



<p>Any one of these four things may happen. Two, or more, may not. And not one of them includes the possibility that either particle goes through both doors simultaneously.</p>



<h3>Variation on the Theme</h3>



<p>As another instructive variation, suppose we send particles 1 and 2 off at exactly the same moment. Then the wave function, shown in Fig. 13, looks very similar to Fig. 12, except that <strong>every peak goes through an intersection of the dashed lines,</strong> because the two particles arrive at the doors simultaneously. </p>

<p>Again there are four possibilities, </p>



<ol>
<li>both particles can arrive at the right door simultaneously, </li>



<li>both can arrive at the left door simultaneously,</li>



<li>particle 1 can arrive at the left door just as the particle 2 arrives at the right door</li>



<li>or vice versa. </li>
</ol>



<p>And so <strong>it certainly <em>is</em> possible for particle 1 to go through the left door and particle 2 to go through the right door simultaneously.</strong> No problem with that. </p>



<p>However, it is simply impossible — illogical, in fact — for particle 1 to go through both doors simultaneously. There’s no spot in the space of possibilities that could even represent that inconsistent scenario.</p>



<h2>Lessons for the Double Slit Experiment</h2>



<p>The lesson? Many fascinating things happen in quantum physics once we have superpositions and multiple particles and multiple doors. But two things that cannot happen (in 1920’s quantum physics) include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>No particle can go through two doors at once; it can have only one position at a time.</li>



<li>No wave function, living as it does in the space of possibilities, can pass through any door in physical space.</li>
</ul>



<p>The same applies for the two slits in the quantum double-slit experiment. One cannot make sense of that experiment without learning this lesson: <mark>from the viewpoint of 1920’s quantum physics, <strong>the interference effects do not arise from any object, whether particle or wave function or pattern in the wave function, physically moving through the physical slits in physical space.</strong></mark></p>



<p>So where do the interference effects come from?  The wave function’s pattern <strong>can</strong> travel across regions of possibility space that are <strong><em>associated</em></strong> with the slits.  We need to work out the consequences of this observation, and interpret it properly.  Stay tuned to this channel; the answer is near at hand.</p>

					<p>I’m not a physicist, but I did take a few years of physics classes in college.  I can report that the only absolute certainty is that your current teacher will tell you that all of your previous assumptions and models regarding the Two Slit Experiment are wrong.  It doesn’t matter if your last professor won the Nobel Prize.  Their explanation simply doesn’t hold water, and this new one is the correct one!  Repeat ad infinitum.</p>

					<p>Maybe so.  But am am not interpreting the double-slit experiment, unlike most people.  I am showing you explicitly how the Schroedinger equation actually works.  You will see that many previous assumptions/claims are just plain inconsistent with the Schroedinger equation.  How you interpret the Schroedinger equation is up to you, but it is important not to make claims that are in contradiction to the mathematics.</p>
<p>And yes, even Nobel Prize winners have been wrong.  That’s necessarily true, since some of them have contradicted each other — meaning that they cannot all have been right.</p>
<p>But there will be no assumptions or models or wordy explanations here.  There will simply be illustrative and well-chosen solutions to the Schroedinger equation… and the rest is up to you. </p>

					<p>I’ve been enjoying these posts very much. One thing I’m struggling with is this. What exists in real space is a quantum field. To calculate what the field does – and hence what we observe – requires construction of a wavefunction from the field distribution which only exists in configuration space. The wavefunction is therefore not “real” but a computational device that provides only statistical results. Is the statistical nature of the predicted outcomes purely a result of the quantum field distribution being indefinite as a result of Heisenberg uncertainty? Or does uncertainty come in from somewhere else?</p>

					<p>No, the logic goes a different way.  And it’s complicated and controversial. </p>
<p>First, not everyone agrees the wave function is not real.   For instance, the many-worlds interpretation asserts that it is real.  I don’t have a firm point of view on this, though I’ll have to discuss this question quite soon.</p>
<p>As for uncertainty — I would say that Heisenberg’s uncertainty is really a consequence, not a cause.  The uncertainty arises from the fact that the wave function (in 1920s quantum physics) can be written as a function of positions OR of momenta, not both; and therefore the function can only specify one or the other precisely.  And in field theory the wave function can be written as a function of field shapes OR of changes in field shapes, but not both, with a similar effect.  A limit on uncertainty follows from this fact.  In some sense I touched on this in these two posts:  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/10/elementary-particles-do-not-exist-part-1/" rel="ugc">https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/10/elementary-particles-do-not-exist-part-1/</a> and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/11/elementary-particles-do-not-exist-part-2/" rel="ugc">https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/11/elementary-particles-do-not-exist-part-2/</a> .  </p>
<p>But ultimately, I think people do not agree about the right way or best way to organize the logic.  Why do we need a probabilistic theory, governed by a wave function that is a function of only half the variables needed in pre-quantum physics? We know that this works by comparing with experiment, but there’s no principled explanation about why our world’s nature is quantum.  And so it can be hard to say what is principle, what is cause, and what is consequence.  (This can be hard to do in classical physics too; it can depend on what formulation you use — i.e., which laws are principles and which ones are derived from those principles may depend on your assumptions and starting point.)</p>
<p>So I’m afraid I don’t have a great answer for you — at least not yet.  Maybe I’ll recognize one as I put these posts together.</p>

					<p>Thank you for this explanation.  I got lost at Figure 5.  I’m confused because a wave function is described as existing in a *two-dimensional* space but Figure 5 is a 3-dimenional diagram.  Can you elaborate on the diagram more?  I apologize if I’m missing something obvious.</p>

					<p>Yes: Figure 3 shows the wave function’s absolute value squared |ψ|^2 <strong>as a function of</strong> the two coordinates x1 and x2, which are the coordinates of the space of possibilities.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the usual graph of a function that we might do in pre-college math: where a function y(x) depends on one coordinate, but is graphed using a curve in two dimensions.  Here we have a function |ψ(x1, x2)|^2 that depends on two coordinates, but we graph it using a surface in three dimensions. </p>
<p>The labels on the axes are supposedly there to help you interpret what I’m doing, but I realize that sometimes I leave out steps (especially if I covered those steps in earlier posts in this series.)  It’s quite tricky to try to keep things sufficiently self-contained in a subject that has so many layers.  I’m sure you’re not the only one who had this question, so thanks for asking it.</p>

					<p>What makes me skeptic about this “possibility” vs “physical” space distinction is the fact that everything is quantum. When you say “doors exist in the physical space” it’s almost like you’re ignoring the fact that they’re made of particles, which are nothing more than perturbations in their own fields or wave function. It’s not like doors are static, macro, physical things.</p>
<p>But I’m probably wrong so just forgive my ignorance 🙂</p>

					<p>You’re right to be keeping track of this issue carefully.  But of course I am well aware of the issue, and would not have started explaining all of these things in this way if I did not know that including the doors in the wave function — which would make the space of possibilities far too large to draw — would not change the conceptual result. In fact, in this case, it would not change the result at all.</p>
<p>If you notice, I didn’t really use the doors at all; I didn’t tell you what they were made of, how wide they are, etc.  That’s because the only thing that actually matters in this example is the overall shape of the physical space in which each particle can move.  Each door in this case is just a placeholder for a point along the x axis; it doesn’t actually interact with the object passing through it.  And that is why I can leave it out of the wave function.  [This is not actually true of the slits in the double-slit experiment, or rather, of the wall with the slits, whose atoms literally do obstruct the incoming particles; that’s part of why that experiment is more complicated than necessary, in an way that’s irrelevant to the quantum interference effect of interest.]</p>
<p>If we did include the doors, the result, given the way I’ve set up the experiment, is that the full wave function, including 2 particles on the x axis and the doors, would take a simple form of a product of three sub-wave-functions:</p>
<p>Psi_{full} = Psi_{particles}(x1,x2) Psi_door1(y1,y2,….yN)Psi_door2(z1,z2,….zN)</p>
<p>where x1 and x2 are the positions of the particles on the line, y_i is the position (in three dimensions) of particle i in one door, z_i the position of particles in the other door, and N is the total number of particles in each door.  N is something larger than 10^{29}. This product form will remain unchanged by the Schroedinger equation because the doors and the two particles on the line do not interact — meaning that the doors and the two particles are <strong>always uncorrelated</strong>.  The result is that the probability for the two particles to be in some state X AND door2 to be in some quantum state Y AND door1 to be in some quantum state Z is just the product of the possibilities, p_full = p_X p_Y p_Z.  Therefore, even though the space of possibilities now has 6N + 2 dimensions, which is spectacularly gigantic, it can be treated as three separate spaces of possibilities, two for the particles in the two doors, which have 10^29 dimensions or more and cannot be drawn — but in any case do not have any influence on the two particles on the line — and a 2-dimensional space of possibilities, which is the relevant one for the two particles, and is the one I drew.  The motion of the system through time across the full space of possibilities is given by three independent motions: (1) the part of the Schroedinger equation that acts on Psi_particles, which I kept track of, and (2) a much more complicated but completely irrelevant motion of the system of door 1; (3) a similar complicated motion for door 2.</p>
<p>So hidden behind *all* of my examples is a thought process such as this one, where I carefully justify the choices I make. </p>
<p>Now, what would happen if we really treated the wall and its openings properly?  I have already given you examples of how measurements are made — i.e., of how to include the measurement device in the wave function rather than having it sit outside it.  Here it really *should* be included, because every measurement device interacts with the object it measures.  See <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/27/what-is-a-measurement/" rel="ugc">https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/02/27/what-is-a-measurement/</a> and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/03/03/making-a-measurement-permanent/" rel="ugc">https://profmattstrassler.com/2025/03/03/making-a-measurement-permanent/</a> . </p>
<p>Of course a real measurement device has, again, 10^{many} particles, and so I cannot draw it.  But I have employed measurement devices with one or two particles in my examples in order to illustrate the conceptual points about how to string these concepts together in possibility space, so that you can understand how a full, realistic measurement device would have to work in the undepictable giant spaces of possibilities of ordinary life.  You will need to do some thinking about how to use my examples to infer the larger situation; it goes beyond what can be drawn.  At some point we can discuss more complex situations, but right now I haven’t given you the conceptual tools to do it, mainly because if I did so now, you wouldn’t be convinced that the tools always work.  </p>
<p>So let’s work through some more examples, see why possibility space is absolutely central and essential in understanding quantum interference, and then revisit your questions.</p>
<p>One of the most important parts of a physicist’s training is the art of choosing the right example.  This involves learning to be very careful about what is relevant and what is irrelevant to the question at hand, so that the relevant issues can be addressed in mathematics and concepts using the simplest possible example that captures the key issues.  Once one understands the issues fully, they can then be generalized to more difficult cases.  I am using that methodology in every one of these posts.</p>

					<p>Actually,  energy always exists in waves form either in the form of particles or energy. The waves length visible to the physical eyes appears as matter or particles and which is beyond the limit of our physical eyes creates differentiation  between matter and particles. There must be some animals in the universe who vision limit might be more than the humans. In that case,  they can visualise the universe in the form of waves not as matter or particles what we visualize.</p>

					<p>If the particles were indeed indistinguishable, then indeed LR and RL would be the same.  But that is why I colored them differently — to assure you that they are indeed distinguishable.  I didn’t tell you they were of the same type.  For example, perhaps one is an electron and the other is a positron.</p>
<p>We’ll have to look more at indistinguishable particles later, but right now the contraints that indistinguishability puts in the space of possibilities and the wave function would just be a confusing distraction.</p>

					<p>One framing I’ve heard is that the photon only “exists” at the time of detection. It doesn’t travel from A to B or anything in between. There’s just an electromagnetic field at all points in the apparatus which is constantly varying in time in some complicated way. I’m… not sure that helps 😉</p>
<p>One gripe I had as a physics undergraduate, which I think you’re touching on in these series of articles, is that we were taught physics in more-or-less chronological (or historical) order. I can’t help wondering is many misconceptions or false intuitions could have been avoided if we had just been taught QFT first, and avoided the baggage of “1920’s quantum physics” entirely.</p>

					<p>One problem is that most physics faculty don’t know QFT that well if at all.  But actually there is a way to avoid this problem.  If we simply did quantum mechanics of a long chain of balls and springs, then everything would be much clearer… both for particle physics and the physics of crystals.</p>
<p>As for “the particle doesn’t exist except at the time of detection” — I don’t think that’s correctly formulated.  First, the question is whether the *system* of interacting particles — <strong>of which we are a part!</strong> — exists between measurements.  It doesn’t make sense to focus on individual particles if they interact; after all, particles don’t have wave functions, systems do. Second, “measurement” is not a sharply defined term; when exactly is an interaction or sequence of interactions a measurement?  I think it is clear that there is no sharp divide between measurement and not-measurement. What happens if the measurement is not completed, or is inaccurate — does the system partially exist at that moment? What happens if a small explosion causes a billion billion photons to rush out into the universe, but no one measurement device is there to collect a significant number of those photons?  Did the explosion partially exist?  I really think this idea leads nowhere.</p>

					<p>Hi Matt, first of all I agree with Phil, this blog is impressively well done! Then, my try: no particle and no wave function passes through the two gates at the same time, there is only the sum of complex numbers relating to alternative paths.There is no movement, understood as a trajectory, of particles only change in the corresponding complex numbers. What we call interference is another way of visualising the above: nothing passes between the two doors at once merely particles appearing here or there without movement or trajectory.</p>

					<p>Maybe alter how it’s observed. Dig deeper and you’ll notice that it’s information that goes way beyond linear thought and into our conscious thought and soul. Right in our belly somewhere. 😇</p>

					<p>Maybe, but to my ear it sounds as though you’re not actually that interested in science, which is done with physical experiments and logical inference.</p>

					<p>Dark matter is a supersolid that fills the vacuum of space. Particles move through and displace the  supersolid dark matter causing it to wave, analogous to a boat and its bow wave. In a double-slit experiment the particle travels through a single slit and the associated wave in the dark matter passes through both.</p>

					<p>This blog is fantastic! This posting has kind of detonated what I thought I knew from popular science which is I guess a heavily simplified version of the Copenhagen interpretation. This level of thinking serves as a goad to try to go from science consumer to becoming a struggling science amateur by taking like 20 math classes and maybe a half dozen physics classes to no longer be quite this clueless!</p>

					<p>🙂 No, you shouldn’t need anything like that.  The goal here is to lower the barrier; this series of posts represents my first attempt to figure out how to do this, but probably not my last.</p>

					<p>Here is my issue with that. I will go from accepting what let’s say Sean Carroll says to what you say still without really understanding. Maybe this is wrong but Physics without math seems to be a super difficult proposition to teach. There seems to be a middle way developing with Sean Carroll and Anthony Zee of going ahead and including the math but I’m not sure that’s the answer either. If you write down a PDE I can see the terms but lacking that background, I don’t really know what you are saying.</p>
<p>That’s a problem. I think it is important to at least try to think critically about physics. So I hear a talk on QFT and the description is beautiful. Fermion fields and Higgs fields acted upon or acting through a Boson field to yield the behavior you can observe. It is a captivating picture but today, if I ask myself how do we know that, I’m not sure I can get there.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody will figure out how to convert the math of QM and maybe QFT to Algebra so most folks can have a quantitative understanding but till then the animations and pictorial representations here are a huge help. I’m a former engineer so maybe that’s a me problem of wanting to see under the hood</p>

					<p>Oh, please don’t apologize! … just have some fun exploring the website!  Use the search function; you’ll find a lot here.  I think you’ll enjoy the “Higgs Field (with math)” series, the “Celebrating the Standard Model” series and the “Standard Model More Deeply” series.</p>

					<p>“Lost in Superposition”: great title for quantum physics, hey? 🙂</p>
<p>“A particle, which has a position and a momentum (even if unknown to us), cannot have two positions.”</p>
<p>Unless, it is a composite, a “particle” comprised of millions maybe infinite quantum states can be not only in two positions but in infinite positions. Again, Prof. Strassler, I seem to be stuck in this theory that particles, excitations in fields, can be further quantized to lower confined spaces, like a lattice of micro black holes.</p>
<p>If you can assume that the fabric of spacetime is composed a lattice of tiny black holes, which theory (theories) would that violate? I don’t know what experiment to do to prove or disprove this theory and I certainly do have the math to calculate it, but it makes sense, intuitively.</p>
<p>I don’t believe the wave function collapses in the double slit experiment, it just changes with the addition of the observer. The observer is also part of the system, i.e. there is only one reference frame in the universe that all parameters or invariant.</p>

					<p>Is it possible to understand quantum theory by just saying probability is treated differently. So instead of the intuitive way of combining possibilities one uses what seems to be a little crazy “pythagorean” way of combining possibilities ?</p>
<p>So one can just think classically, including superpositions and entanglement, but by using  “pythagorean” probabilty and one gets quantum superpositions and quantum entanglement.</p>

					<p>Hello!  Thanks for the article — the idea of OR and AND reminds me of one of my professors when I was in physics grad school (Jack Cohn).  He worked in quantum foundations back when it certainly wasn’t cool and ultimately wrote a short book “Construction of Quantum Theory” dealing with this OR/AND business.  Anyway, just didn’t know if you were familiar with that work at all or if it’s just part of the language orthodoxy in the field.  Thanks again!</p>
