    <h1>Linux Runs on Raspberry Pi RP2350&#39;s Hazard3 RISC-V Cores (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Developer Jesse Taube has become the first to successfully boot a minimal Linux distribution on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2&#39;s RP2350 microcontroller — taking advantage of the chip&#39;s new open source Hazard3 RISC-V cores to run software more commonly associated with application-class processors than microcontrollers.</p><p><span>&#34;Someone is already running RISC-V NOMMU Linux on [the] RP2350,&#34; writes Raspberry Pi principal hardware engineer Luke Wren, who brought the project to our attention and the designer of the Hazard3 cores in the company&#39;s new RP2350 microcontroller, on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wren6991/status/1828472436880199805" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a><span>. &#34;[I] knew I was going to get sniped on that one.&#34;</span></p><div><div><p><span>SparkFun&#39;s Pro Micro RP2350 is now Linux-capable, after a fashion, thanks to the chip&#39;s Hazard3 RISC-V cores.

It&#39;s the latter that are the target of Taube&#39;s efforts to run Linux on the chip, building on earlier efforts to boot the kernel on microcontrollers including the RP2040 which had to </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/an-ultra-tiny-risc-v-emulator-turns-the-raspberry-pi-pico-into-a-functional-if-slow-linux-pc-17493d4d7130" rel="nofollow">emulate the RISC-V architecture</a><span> — where the RP2350 can run RISC-V code natively.</span></p><p>There are a few caveats to being able to run Linux on a RISC-V microcontroller rather than an application-class processor, though. The first is a lack of memory management unit (MMU), meaning a specific version which does not rely on the presence of an MMU is required. The second is that even after almost doubling the SRAM on the RP2350 over the RP2040, 520kB is not going to be enough — an issue handily worked around by the RP2350 now supporting up to 16MB of pseudo-static RAM (PSRAM) alongside 16MB of off-chip flash storage.</p><div><div><p><span>Taube&#39;s Buildroot configuration comes with instructions for building your own Linux for compatible RP2350 boards.
