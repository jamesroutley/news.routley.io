<p>The Redict community is pleased to announce the release of Redict 7.3.0, the
first stable version of our copyleft fork of Redis® OSS 7.2.4.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You can
download the release <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/redict/releases/tag/7.3.0">on Codeberg</a>, or download one of our official
<a href="https://redict.io/docs/install/containers/">container images</a> from registry.redict.io.</p>
<p>We have written comprehensive documentation detailing our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/redis-compat/">compatibility with
Redis® OSS 7.2.4</a>, which also provides detailed documentation for
various migration scenarios, such as for users of the official Redis®
containers on Docker Hub, downstream package maintainers, and so on.</p>
<p>We have tested Redict thoroughly with a variety of migration scenarios, but we
may have missed a detail that pertains to your use-case. If you have any issues
or questions with respect to the migration process, please <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">join our community
spaces</a> to get help.</p>
<h2 id="why-redict">
  Why Redict?
  <a href="#why-redict">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You may be wondering why Redict would be of interest to you, particularly when
compared with <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community">Valkey</a>, another Redis® fork that was announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>In technical terms, we are focusing on stability and long-term maintenance, and
on achieving excellence within our current scope. We believe that Redict is near
feature-complete and that it is more valuable to our users if we take a
conservative stance to innovation and focus on long-term reliability instead.
This is in part a choice we’ve made to distinguish ourselves from Valkey, whose
commercial interests are able to invest more resources into developing more
radical innovations, but also an acknowledgement of a cultural difference
between our projects, in that the folks behind Redict place greater emphasis on
software with a finite scope and ambitions towards long-term stability
rather than focusing on long-term growth in scope and complexity.</p>
<p>We will happily pull useful changes from software with permissive licenses, such
as Valkey, to improve Redict; such is the value of permissive software and the
key advantage of free software generally. However, we will do so at a more
conservative pace, so that our users can enjoy stability first and shiny new
features second. We are also going to focus on establishing and maintaining a
good relationship with downstream distributions, prioritizing their needs with
respect to tasks such as de-vendoring Lua and jemalloc.</p>
<p>Redict also has social and political aims which differ from other forks. In
short, we believe in an approach which is built from an independent, grassroots,
and community-focused means of building our software. We are not governed by the
consensus of a small group of commercial interests, but rather by an independent
and community-driven consensus. Importantly, we have also chosen to protect our
software from further exploitation by applying the Lesser GNU General Public
License (LGPL) to our work.</p>
<p>Our choice of license prevents the hard work of our contributors from being
incorporated into the now-proprietary Redis® software, and from any future
attempts to create proprietary distributions of Redict. However, our choice of
the LGPL balances this concern with the needs of commercial users – we
have selected this license in part to ensure that cloud providers can continue
to offer Redict to their customers without being subject to onerous compliance
regimes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Check out our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/license">About the license</a> page for more
information about the license of Redict.
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve made these choices because we believe they are essential in providing for
a future which is based on free software, and in which the rug cannot be pulled
out from under our users and contributors again. We believe it is essential to
make these choices now, at the onset of our fork, especially in response to the
crisis that the Redis® community is faced with at the hands of its
commercial stewards. If you don’t want your investment in this software to risk
another artificial crisis in the name of profit, if you want to enjoy the
protection of copyleft and a guarantee that your software will remain free, then
we encourage you to adopt Redict for your needs.</p>
<p>We have also taken this opportunity to re-evaluate our infrastructure and double
down on using free software. Rather than continuing to use the proprietary
GitHub forge, we have elected to use the non-profit, free software
<a href="https://codeberg.org">Codeberg</a> as our home, and we run our continuous
integration on <a href="https://sourcehut.org">SourceHut</a>, which is also free software.
Moreover, rather than gathering on Discord, we have chosen instead to set up our
community on <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">Matrix and IRC</a>. We believe that the Redis® license
change provides us an opportunity to focus on our values as members of the free
software community, to exercise solidarity, and to lend our strength to
re-enforce the broader free software ecosystem. As such, we felt it important to
choose free software solutions for our infrastructure needs.</p>

  Acknowledgements

</h2>
<p>I’d like to extend a personal “thanks” to everyone who was involved in bringing
this fork to life. In particular, Micke Nordin and Hugo, for their work on the
Redict containers; Lucas Dohmen, for his extensive work on the documentation and
website; and Anna, for her work forking and maintaining <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/hiredict">hiredict</a>; as well as
everyone who contributed small patches here and there, and everyone who helped
with the rapid turn-around and testing of Redict’s release candidates. Shoutout
to @janWilejan for designing our logo, and to everyone else who submitted their
artwork for consideration.</p>
<p>Thanks are also due, of course, to all of the many contributors who worked on
Redis® OSS, commercial contributors and independent contributors alike,
whose work forms the foundation of our codebase, as well as all of those who
worked on the extensive Creative Commons documentation that was adapted for
Redict. We also extend our gratitude to the community downstream of Redis®
OSS, including downstream distributions, cloud services, and countless users,
all of whom nourished its growth as free software.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
  What’s next?
  <a href="#whats-next">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We focused on a very conservative set of changes for the initial release, to
maximize backwards compatibility and ease the transition for new users. Going
forward, we do have some plans to make conservative improvements.</p>
<p>Among the planned changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernizing the build system (<a href="https://muon.build">muon</a> is the leading
candidate)</li>
<li>Forking the <em>ecosystem</em>, in particular Redis® client libraries (this is a
great way for you to help!)</li>
<li>De-vendoring dependencies such as Lua and jemalloc</li>
</ul>
<p>Lucas is also planning to invest heavily in Redict’s documentation, such that we
become the reference of choice for all participants in this ecosystem. Anna has
some changes planned for <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/hiredict">hiredict</a> as well (our fork of the official Redis®
C client library), including build system improvements and better conformance
with Unix norms.</p>
<p>We will also be happy to consider improvements from any community member – come
join us! We will welcome you as equals – independent and commercial users
alike!</p>
