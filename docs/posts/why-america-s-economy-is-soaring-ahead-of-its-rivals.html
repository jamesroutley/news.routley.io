    <h1>Why America&#39;s economy is soaring ahead of its rivals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>When investigating an exception in a FastAPI route, sometimes it&#39;s just fine to add print statements and re-run a request. But for trickier situations, a debugger can be invaluable.</p>
<p>Flask&#39;s debug mode includes a <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/debug/">full in-browser debugger</a>, allowing you to inspect variables and interactively debug issues.</p>
<p>FastAPI&#39;s <code>debug=True</code> mode looks similar, but only displays a non-interactive traceback in the browser. I find this a lot less useful, though an improvement on the non-debug &#39;Internal Server Error&#39; message.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can get an interactive debugger on exception with a tiny middleware:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> fastapi <span>import</span> FastAPI, Request
<span>from</span> starlette.middleware.base <span>import</span> BaseHTTPMiddleware
<span>import</span> traceback

app = FastAPI()

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>attach_debugger_on_exception</span>(<span>request: Request, call_next</span>):
    <span>try</span>:
        response = <span>await</span> call_next(request)
    <span>except</span> Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
        <span># `set_trace` would create a breakpoint but the stack would stop here.</span>
        <span># `post_mortem` sets the relevant context to be where the exception happened.</span>
        <span>import</span> pdb
        pdb.post_mortem()
        <span>raise</span>

    <span>return</span> response

<span>if</span> settings.DEBUG_BREAK_ON_EXCEPTION:
    <span># Add last to run first and catch exceptions in other middlewares.</span>
    app.add_middleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware, dispatch=attach_debugger_on_exception)
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming your settings are configured using environment variables, it can be run with:</p>
<pre><code><span>DEBUG_BREAK_ON_EXCEPTION</span>=<span>true</span> uvicorn app.web.main:app --reload
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when an exception occurs, the browser will hang while your terminal drops into a pdb session.
You can inspect variables, step through code, and figure out exactly what went wrong.</p>
<p>The FastAPI docs have a page on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/debugging/#run-your-code-with-your-debugger">using your IDE to debug you app</a>, but it is difficult to get the debugger to break on an api route exception since these are handled by Starlette to return an error response.</p>
<p>I personally prefer the console-based debugger anyway. It may not seem as friendly as an IDE at first, but with practice it becomes very effective and works in more scenarios.</p>
<p>As with any debugging tool, you probably want to validate your settings so that it does not inadvertently end up enabled in production.</p>
<p>Happy debugging!</p></article></div></div>
