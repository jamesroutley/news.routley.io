            <span>Abstract:</span>  Instruction-tuned LMs such as ChatGPT, FLAN, and InstructGPT are finetuned on
datasets that contain user-submitted examples, e.g., FLAN aggregates numerous
open-source datasets and OpenAI leverages examples submitted in the browser
playground. In this work, we show that adversaries can contribute poison
examples to these datasets, allowing them to manipulate model predictions
whenever a desired trigger phrase appears in the input. For example, when a
downstream user provides an input that mentions &#34;Joe Biden&#34;, a poisoned LM will
struggle to classify, summarize, edit, or translate that input. To construct
these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a
bag-of-words approximation to the LM. We evaluate our method on open-source
instruction-tuned LMs. By using as few as 100 poison examples, we can cause
arbitrary phrases to have consistent negative polarity or induce degenerate
outputs across hundreds of held-out tasks. Worryingly, we also show that larger
LMs are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning and that defenses based on data
filtering or reducing model capacity provide only moderate protections while
reducing test accuracy.
