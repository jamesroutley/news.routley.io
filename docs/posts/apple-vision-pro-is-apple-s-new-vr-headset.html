    <h1>Apple Vision Pro Is Apple&#39;s New VR Headset</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> that “seamlessly” blends the real and digital world. “It’s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,” CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year.</p><p>Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial. The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, and you can also give voice commands. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they’re resting low on your body. You can see these as well as other images in the gallery below.</p><p>The headset has a glass front and an aluminum frame, containing five sensors, 12 cameras, the display, and a computer that’s apparently cooled with a fan. The headset mask and strap are cloth-lined and modular, and Apple says they can flex to fit to a variety of face shapes and head sizes. The headband is ribbed and fits around the back of your head, and you can swap different sizes and styles of band. Zeiss has created custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses for people who wear glasses. It has an external battery that lasts up to two hours and can connect via a “supple woven cable” so it slips into a pocket. Apple promises that the display will be unprecedentedly sharp and can deliver 4K video.</p><p>The system uses an M2, but it also includes a new chip called the R1.</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"/></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"/></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>You’re also not, Apple promises, isolated from people around you. The headset will display your eyes with a system called EyeSight, and if you’re in full VR, a glowing screen will obscure them to suggest you’re not available. It also creates a digital “persona” — basically a hyperrealistic avatar — by scanning your face. The device uses passthrough video that lets you see the real world in full color, but you can project 3D objects into real space, including pulling objects out of a message thread into the real world. </p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div></div></div><p>When you’re talking to people remotely, you can use spatial audio to do things like arrange FaceTime participants as “video tiles” around the room. And you can capture and “relive” 180-degree video with a 3D camera while inside the headset. Apple is also touting TV and Arcade content on the headset, including premium content from Disney.</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"/></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive"/></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The headset has been in the works for years and has reportedly gone through several iterations as well as years of delays. It’s meant to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23667912/tim-cook-apple-ar-vr-interview-gq">CEO Tim Cook’s signature addition</a> to the Apple product lineup, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/4/23747110/apple-headset-augmented-reality-vr-industry-rumors-wwdc-2023">garnered praise</a> from industry insiders, even though it will enter a market that hasn’t taken off. Its primary competitor will likely be Meta, which has enjoyed relative success with its games-focused Quest 2 headset and gotten a more mixed reception to its general-purpose Quest Pro.</p><p><em>Developing… check out </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23490941"><em>our live blog</em></a><em> for the latest details.</em></p></div></div>
