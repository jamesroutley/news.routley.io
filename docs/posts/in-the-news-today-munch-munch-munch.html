    <h1>In the news today: *munch munch munch*</h1>
    
    
<p>
Some people who know me and know what I used to do saw the news today 
(or just tried to go online for cat pictures and failed) have been 
reaching out for reactions.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, all I have is this.  Is this in poor taste?

<p>
(This is the only picture I have of popcorn on hand short of making more 
right now, and I just had breakfast.  Bonus point: this picture was 
apparently part of the sugary snacks made available at a 2013 
hackathon.)

<p>
As for the potential customer, well, you should know how to reach me.  
Bring your checkbook.
