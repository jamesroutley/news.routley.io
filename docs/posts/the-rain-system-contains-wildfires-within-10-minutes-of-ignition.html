    <h1>The Rain System  “contains wildfires within 10 minutes of ignition”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ix="hide-popup"><div><p><a href="#" data-ix="close-popup"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f79406a7db7eac6d7c3949e/5f79406b48dec3724a248d5e_Icon-close.png" alt=""/></a></p><p>Wildfire and Climate Change</p><p>Rain acknowledges the essential role of wildfire in healthy ecosystems. However: our ecosystem is not presently healthy. The obvious, necessary solution to climate change is reducing human carbon emissions. Until that happens, wildfire is both a symptom and a cause of climate change: every year, wildfires release 8 billion tons of carbon globally. We need tools to adapt to a changing climate, and the Rain System is one in a suite of tools that includes controlled burns, innovative policies, and ongoing forest management. We believe uncontrolled wildfires destroying communities, livelihoods and lives are unnecessary to meet our climate objectives. </p></div></div></div>
