    <h1>AI Is Here to Stay</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>AI discourse tends to fall into two camps: it will change everything or it&#39;s overhyped garbage. I think both are wrong.</p>
<p>My view is more pragmatic. AI is already useful and will continue to be useful. It will take years, probably decades, to reach the potential being sold to VCs. But it has already started changing things - I use AIs like <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_vibe-coded-csharp-library">Claude</a> and ChatGPT daily to work faster with less activation energy.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-ai-bubble">What About the AI Bubble?</h2>
<p>There&#39;s probably an AI bubble. Valuations are high, money is flowing, and some of it won&#39;t pan out. But when the bubble pops, AI will still be here.</p>
<p>Why? Because people pay for it. Real users get real value. When the correction comes some companies will fail, prices might rise, but the technology and demand will remain. This isn&#39;t like hype bubbles where the underlying value was always questionable - these tools demonstrably work.</p>
<p>As long as people get value out of it and pay for it a company will rise to supply demand.</p>
<h2 id="the-pragmatic-approach">The Pragmatic Approach</h2>
<p>The argument that AI is useless or a fad is probably wrong. It will stick around in some capacity because people find it useful - it saves them time and energy day-to-day.</p>
<p>So the pragmatic approach is not to fight it but to accept it&#39;s here, see how it can be useful as a tool, and leverage the best tools for your ends. Like any technology, it&#39;s good for some things and not others. Learn what works, use what helps, and stay realistic about what it can&#39;t do yet.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>AI is here to stay - not because the hype is justified, but because the underlying technology is useful and people will pay for it.</p>
