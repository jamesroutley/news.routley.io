  <p>As a research computer, Enzian is designed for computer systems
  software research and deliberately over-engineered.  Enzian
  has a big server-class CPU closely coupled to a large FPGA, with
  ample main memory and network bandwidth on both sides.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://enzian.systems/techblog/2022/09/26/USBIdentification/">Identifying an Enzian over USB <i></i></a></h3>
    <p>As we explained in our <a href="https://enzian.systems/techblog/2022/01/14/RearPanel/">post about the Enzian rear panel</a> there are two client USB ports on Enzian:
one for the JTAG scain chain and one for the system UARTs.
The JTAG chip on the Enzian main board has a pre-configured JTAG cable ID that is unique.
The serial-to-USB converter by default does not have a unique ID though.
If you just plug one Enzian into your machine that does not matter, however we have 9 of these machines all plugged into our gateway server.</p>

    <p>How do we connect our Enzian machines to ensure that they can utilize the entire
bandwith that they are provisioned with? Using big switches!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://enzian.systems/updates/2022/06/20/OSDI-poster/">Enzian Poster Accepted at OSDI <i></i></a></h3>
    <p>Our poster on recent Enzian work has been accepted at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/">OSDI 2022</a>! 
The OSDI 2022 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/technical-sessions">poster session</a> is from
18:30-20:00 on Monday 11 July, 2022. If you’re going to be at OSDI/ATC, please stop by and we can talk about new and
exciting developments in person! We’ll update this post with a final version of the poster when it is available.</p>

  <p>We built Enzian to have a platform for our research into
  operating systems, databases, hardware acceleration, machine
  learning, networking, and high-performance computing, and because
  there was nothing comparable out there that we could get hold of
  otherwise.</p> 

  <p>Now that it works, we’d like to make Enzian systems available
  to the rest of the research community.  If you want to work with
  Enzian, or if you might be able to help us make it more widely
  available, please contact us!</p>
