    <p>In my last post, <a href="https://blog.sherwoodcallaway.com/round-two/">Round Two</a>, I wrote about my career, my passion for dev tools, and my decision to start a new company focused on observability.</p>
<p>I also wrote about my frustration with observability as it exists today. Why are the tools and workflows so bad? Why does it feel like so much <em>work</em>?</p>
<p>In today&#39;s post, I want to unpack that frustration by looking at observability in historical context. I&#39;ll examine observability through a simple three-part lens: its past, present, and future.</p>
<p>My goal is to understand and explain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why observability emerged in the first place</li>
<li>How observability evolved into the mess it is today</li>
<li>Why, despite all the progress we&#39;ve made, maintaining reliable systems is still SO hard in 2026</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s go!</p>
<p><strong>PART 1: OBSERVABILITY&#39;S PAST</strong></p>
<p>To understand observability, it helps to look at the environment that gave rise to it.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, software engineers faced a crisis: with the rise of cloud computing, containers, and microservices, apps were becoming increasingly complex - too complex for any individual to fully understand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CI/CD was becoming more common, which meant an increase in the rate at which changes were deployed to production. The result: more frequent bugs and outages.</p>
<p>Suddenly, our old reliability playbook stopped working. We couldn&#39;t predict all the edge-cases, let alone write tests for them. Failure modes increasingly emerged from the complex interaction between services. When it came to root-cause analysis, logs and basic metrics were no longer enough.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the industry found a solution.</p>
<p>It came in two parts: a tool and a philosophy.</p>
<p>The tool was distributed tracing. After a quiet start in 2010, distributed tracing grew steadily over the ensuing decade until it was essentially ubiquitous:</p>
<ul>
<li>2010: Google publishes Dapper, the first major paper on distributed tracing.</li>
<li>2012: Twitter introduces Zipkin, inspired by Dapper.</li>
<li>2015: Honeycomb, one of the first managed tracing platforms, is founded.</li>
<li>2016: OpenTracing is adopted by CNCF.</li>
<li>2016: Uber introduces Jaeger, inspired by Zipkin.</li>
<li>2017: Datadog launches APM, their managed tracing solution.</li>
<li>2018: O&#39;Reilly publishes &#34;Distributed Systems Observability&#34;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The philosophy was observability. Originally coined by a rocket scientist in the 1960s, the term &#34;observability&#34; was popularized in the software community by Twitter&#39;s engineering team during the early 2010s. It quickly grew into a full-fledged product category and engineering discipline:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013: Twitter publishes &#34;Observability at Twitter&#34;.</li>
<li>2015: Charity Majors (Honeycomb founder) begins writing about observability, formalizing key concepts.</li>
<li>2017: Peter Bourgon (Soundcloud engineer who worked on Prometheus) coins the &#34;Three Pillars&#34;.</li>
<li>2022: O&#39;Reilly publishes &#34;Observability Engineering&#34;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, distributed tracing gave engineers a way to debug modern apps, which were cloud-based and distributed by nature, while observability gave them the framework for how to think about reliability in this new operating environment.</p>
<p>My point here is that observability wasn&#39;t born in a vacuum. It emerged as a response to real-world engineering challenges. And it persisted because, for the most part, it worked.</p>
<p>But then things took a turn for the worse. Encouraged by early results, engineering teams started to over-invest in observability tools and processes.</p>
<p>More instrumentation. More dashboards. More monitors. SLOs. Error budgets. Runbooks. Postmortems. By the early 2020s, observability was no longer a means to an end. It was an end unto itself.</p>
<p><strong>PART 2: OBSERVABILITY&#39;S PRESENT</strong></p>
<p>Today, most engineers will agree: observability is table stakes. If you&#39;re running production systems at almost any scale, you need a way to detect, mitigate, and resolve issues when they occur.</p>
<p>This is the role of modern observability platforms like Datadog, Grafana, and Sentry.</p>
<p>Yet, when I think about the current state of observability, one question stands out: why, after 10+ years of investment in better tools and processes, does observability still suck?</p>
<p>I&#39;m serious!</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Instrumentation takes forever. Dashboards are constantly out of date. Monitors misfire. Alerts lack context. On-call is a permanent tax on engineering productivity. Incident resolution can take hours, sometimes days.</p>
<p>We have more telemetry than ever, but getting an accurate mental model of your app in production is still a major challenge - not just for newgrads and vibe-coding Zoomers, but for experienced engineers too.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not for lack of effort. At companies of all sizes, engineering teams take observability seriously, investing enormous amounts of time and energy into implementing and maintaining observability systems.</p>
<p>They shell out for Datadog. They instrument EVERYTHING. They adopt structured logging and enforced standardized naming/labeling conventions. They create &#34;golden&#34; dashboards. They painstakingly tune their monitors. By any reasonable definition, these teams are doing everything right.</p>
<p>Yet there&#39;s a gap.</p>
<p>The amount of effort we put into observability does NOT line up with the progress we&#39;ve made towards its goals: better detection, faster root-cause analysis, and more reliable apps.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&#39;s because the real problem isn&#39;t about data, tooling, or process. It&#39;s about our ability - or inability - to understand and reason about the data we <em>already have</em>.</p>
<p>Observability made us very good at producing signals, but only slightly better at what comes after: interpreting them, generating insights, and translating those insights into reliability.</p>
<p><strong>PART 3: OBSERVABILITY&#39;S FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s true that observability isn&#39;t living up to expectations. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not useful or important. In fact, I believe observability is poised to become one of the most important technology categories of the coming decade.</p>
<p>The reason: software is changing again.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, observability emerged as an antidote to complexity. In 2026, software engineers face the largest complexity crisis we&#39;ve ever come up against: AI.</p>
<p>AI is cutting the cost of writing code to zero. As a result, engineering teams are shipping vast amounts of features and at breakneck speeds. Codebases are getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, vibe-coding platforms have brought software development to the masses. More apps will be built and deployed this year than in all previous years combined.</p>
<p>We&#39;re on the verge of an &#34;<a href="https://youtu.be/eIoohUmYpGI?si=o3CHH53RpkfJARLt">infinite software crisis</a>&#34;.</p>
<p>This raises an uncomfortable question: how will we support, maintain, and operate this ever-growing mountain of software? I&#39;m willing to bet the answer is observability.</p>
<p>Just not the version we have today...</p>
