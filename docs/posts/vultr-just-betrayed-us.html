<p>I suppose the hip kids would say this is enshittification, but it’s certainly a betrayal.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240327093822/https://www.vultr.com/legal/tos/">their new Terms of Service</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is unacceptable. No other hosting company does this.</p>



<p>The TLDR on the side is deceitful. They say that we own our stuff. Fine. The fine print declares that we license our stuff to them, for full exploitation, without compensation.</p>



<p>I have not agreed to those ToS. Fortunately, I can migrate off their systems without console access, so I do not have to agree. If you use vultr, I suggest you do the same. Also contact <a href="https://www.vultr.com/company/contact/">them through their contact page</a> and state your refusal. <a href="https://my.vultr.com/billing/cancel/">I’m told you can cancel via their page without logging in</a>, but haven’t yet tried it.</p>



<p>I am now investigating alternatives for hosting FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. Preferably that take custom installs.</p>
