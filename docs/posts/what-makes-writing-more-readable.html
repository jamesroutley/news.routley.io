This includes the <a href="https://www.ncld.org/research/state-of-learning-disabilities">20% of the population with learning disabilities</a>, a number of the <a href="https://ici-s.umn.edu/files/aCHyYaFjMi/risp_2017">more than 7 million people in the US</a> with intellectual disabilities (ID), readers for whom English is not a first language and people with limited access to education, among others.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
<p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These audiences are routinely excluded from public dialogues, including dialogues about themselves.
