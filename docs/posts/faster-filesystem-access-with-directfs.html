    <h1>Faster filesystem access with Directfs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Directfs is now the default in runsc. This feature gives gVisor’s application
kernel (the Sentry) secure direct access to the container filesystem, avoiding
expensive round trips to the filesystem gofer. Learn more about this feature in
the following blog that was
<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/optimizing-gvisor-filesystems-with-directfs.html">originally posted</a>

<h2 id="origins-of-the-gofer">Origins of the Gofer</h2>

<p>gVisor is used internally at Google to run a variety of services and workloads.
One of the challenges we faced while building gVisor was providing remote
filesystem access securely to the sandbox. gVisor’s strict
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/architecture_guide/security/">security model</a> and
defense in depth approach assumes that the sandbox may get compromised because
it shares the same execution context as the untrusted application. Hence the
sandbox cannot be given sensitive keys and credentials to access Google-internal
remote filesystems.</p>

<p>To address this challenge, we added a trusted filesystem proxy called a “gofer”.
The gofer runs outside the sandbox, and provides a secure interface for
untrusted containers to access such remote filesystems. For architectural
simplicity, gofers were also used to serve local filesystems as well as remote.</p>

<h2 id="isolating-the-container-filesystem-in-runsc">Isolating the Container Filesystem in runsc</h2>

<p>When gVisor was <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">open sourced</a> as
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/">runsc</a>, the same gofer model was copied over to
maintain the same security guarantees. runsc was configured to start one gofer
process per container which serves the container filesystem to the sandbox over
a predetermined protocol (now
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/pkg/lisafs">LISAFS</a>). However, a gofer
adds a layer of indirection with significant overhead.</p>

<p>This gofer model (built for remote filesystems) brings very few advantages for
the runsc use-case, where all the filesystems served by the gofer (like rootfs
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/">bind mounts</a>) are mounted
locally on the host. The gofer directly accesses them using filesystem syscalls.</p>

<p>Linux provides some security primitives to effectively isolate local
filesystems. These include,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount namespaces</a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root</code></a> and
detached bind mounts<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. <strong>Directfs</strong> is a new filesystem access mode that uses
these primitives to expose the container filesystem to the sandbox in a secure
manner. The sandbox’s view of the filesystem tree is limited to just the
container filesystem. The sandbox process is not given access to anything
mounted on the broader host filesystem. Even if the sandbox gets compromised,
these mechanisms provide additional barriers to prevent broader system
compromise.</p>

<h2 id="directfs">Directfs</h2>

<p>In directfs mode, the gofer still exists as a cooperative process outside the
sandbox. As usual, the gofer enters a new mount namespace, sets up appropriate
bind mounts to create the container filesystem in a new directory and then
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root(2)</code></a>s into
that directory. Similarly, the sandbox process enters new user and mount
namespaces and then
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root(2)</code></a>s into
an empty directory to ensure it cannot access anything via path traversal. But
instead of making RPCs to the gofer to access the container filesystem, the
sandbox requests the gofer to provide file descriptors to all the mount points
via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html"><code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> messages</a>.
The sandbox then directly makes file-descriptor-relative syscalls (e.g.
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstatat"><code>fstatat(2)</code></a>,
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat"><code>openat(2)</code></a>,
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/mkdirat"><code>mkdirat(2)</code></a>, etc) to perform filesystem
operations.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-directfs.svg" alt="Figure 2" title="Directfs configuration" width="100%"/></p>

<p>Earlier when the gofer performed all filesystem operations, we could deny all
these syscalls in the sandbox process using seccomp. But with directfs enabled,
the sandbox process’s seccomp filters need to allow the usage of these syscalls.
Most notably, the sandbox can now make
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat"><code>openat(2)</code></a> syscalls (which allow path
traversal), but with certain restrictions:
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/114a033bd038519fa6e867c230dc4ad4e057e675"><code>O_NOFOLLOW</code> is required</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/fcbc289a7ac14b8d84d0c0b23c4b2a14fc626e79">no access to procfs</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/aa8abdfa9256cf057202ec8f4a81ba9f5d6a203f">no directory FDs from the host</a>.
We also had to give the sandbox the same privileges as the gofer (for example
<code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code> and <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code>), so it can perform the same
filesystem operations.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that only the trusted gofer provides FDs (of the container
filesystem) to the sandbox. The sandbox cannot walk backwards (using ‘..’) or
follow a malicious symlink to escape out of the container filesystem. In effect,
we’ve decreased our dependence on the syscall filters to catch bad behavior, but
correspondingly increased our dependence on Linux’s filesystem isolation
protections.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Making RPCs to the gofer for every filesystem operation adds a lot of overhead
to runsc. Hence, avoiding gofer round trips significantly improves performance.
Let’s find out what this means for some of our benchmarks. We will run the
benchmarks using our newly released
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2023/04/28/systrap-release/">systrap platform</a> on bind
mounts (as opposed to rootfs). This would simulate more realistic use cases
because bind mounts are extensively used while configuring filesystems in
containers. Bind mounts also do not have an overlay
(<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/04/gvisor-improves-performance-with-root-filesystem-overlay.html">like the rootfs mount</a>),
so all operations go through goferfs / directfs mount.</p>

<p>Let’s first look at our
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/test/perf/linux/stat_benchmark.cc">stat micro-benchmark</a>,
which repeatedly calls
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lstat.2.html"><code>stat(2)</code></a> on a file.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-stat-benchmark.svg" alt="Figure 3" title="Stat micro benchmark" width="100%"/></p>

<p>The <code>stat(2)</code> syscall is more than 2x faster! However, since this is not
representative of real-world applications, we should not extrapolate these
results. So let’s look at some
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/test/benchmarks/fs">real-world benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-real-world-benchmarks.svg" alt="Figure 4" title="Real world benchmarks" width="100%"/></p>

<p>We see a 12% reduction in the absolute time to run these workloads and 17%
reduction in Ruby load time!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The gofer model in runsc was overly restrictive for accessing host files. We
were able to leverage existing filesystem isolation mechanisms in Linux to
bypass the gofer without compromising security. Directfs significantly improves
performance for certain workloads. This is part of our ongoing efforts to
improve gVisor performance. You can learn more about gVisor at
