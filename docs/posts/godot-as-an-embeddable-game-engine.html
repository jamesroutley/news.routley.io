    <h1>Godot as an Embeddable Game Engine</h1>

Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &#34;Godot is not what you are looking for&#34; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com.xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft&#39;s management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart&#39;s content on their mobile app.</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis&#39;s company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my prototype Godot on iPad into a complete product.
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>
