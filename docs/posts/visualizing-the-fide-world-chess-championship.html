    <p>This week is Never Graduate Week at the Recurse Center, where alumni come back to do Recurse-y things together.
It&#39;s a great experience and I&#39;ve had a lot of fun reconnecting with friends and meeting some new friends.
But it wouldn&#39;t be an RC experience without <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">working at the edge of your abilities</a>!
I did that this week by participating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a> day.</p>
<p>The day was structured nicely to help you push yourself to create something even if you haven&#39;t done it before.
(Which is great, because I haven&#39;t!)
The general structure was a kick-off call, then some hanging out together while we worked, and at the end we had presentations.
The kick-off call was where we could meet each other and ask for help and share ideas.
For me, this was a great place to validate that the idea I was working on was valid and interesting.
Then in the hangout time, we just shared little updates (I was very excited when I got a line to draw) and could have some accountability by seeing someone else also working.
The presentations at the end give you a nice target.
They motivated me to finish <em>something</em>, which gave me a nice time constraint.</p>
<p>What I decided to do was visualize how the pieces moved during the FIDE World Chess Championship.
I loaded in all the classical games (14 of them) from the event, parsed the game records, and recorded where the pieces moved.
Then I plotted those on a chessboard!</p>
<p>This is the result (and <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Entietz/sketches/tree/main/item/wcc">here&#39;s the code</a>):</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/wcc-piece-trails.png" alt="heatmap of where the pieces moved on the boards during the WCC"/></p>
<p>For each type of piece, I recorded each time it moved from a square to another one and plotted that as a line segment.
Red represented the player with the white pieces, and blue is the player with the black pieces.
The lines are transparent so the more often a piece took a particular path, the more opaque that line segment becomes.</p>
<p>Which pieces are which can be determined by inspecting how the piece trails are moving.
Clockwise from the top left: queen, king, rooks, knights, bishops, pawns.</p>
<p>I thought the image would be interesting.
What surprised me was what you could immediately learn from looking at it.
There were a few insights I took away from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player with white <em>never castled queenside</em></li>
<li>No pawns were promoted</li>
<li>The kings never passed the center line</li>
<li>The rooks tended to infiltrate on the queenside, and clash in the center</li>
</ul>
<p>I am thinking about adapting this for a Lichess dataset separated out by different rating bands.
If you&#39;re interested in seeing anything in particular, let me know and I&#39;ll try sketching it up!</p>
