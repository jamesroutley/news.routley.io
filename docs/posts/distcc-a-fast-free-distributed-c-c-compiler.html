<p><em>Speed, it seems to me, provides the one genuinely modern pleasure.</em></p><p>
      distcc is a program to distribute builds of C, C++,
      Objective C or Objective C++ code across several machines on a
      network.  distcc should always generate the same results as a
      local build, is simple to install and use, and is usually
      much faster than a local compile.

      </p><p>
      distcc does not require all machines to share a filesystem, have
      synchronized clocks, or to have the same libraries or header
      files installed.  They can even have different processors or
      operating systems, if cross-compilers are installed.


      </p><blockquote><p>
Just wanted to drop you a line to say that we are now using distcc at work and
it is excellent.  We have a rack of opteron machines that we use for
computational tasks and we are now using them as a compile farm to compile
our ~1MLOC C++ tree (which can take an hour on a single CPU to recompile if
we change certain header files).  We tried using Sun&#39;s grid engine to do this
(we already use it to schedule our computational jobs), but the combination
of its polled operation and the overhead of NFS led to little improvement
(and greatly stressed our network).  With distcc compile times are way down
and my productivity has greatly improved; the two best features for me are
its low impact on the network and its simplicity.

Thanks a lot for a great tool!  â€” Jeremy Barnes

<p><b>60-second instructions:</b></p>

<ol>
<li> For each machine, <a href="https://github.com/distcc/distcc/releases">download distcc</a>
	  unpack, and do
	  </li><li> On each of the servers, run <tt>distccd --daemon</tt>, with 
        <tt>--allow</tt> options to restrict access.
     </li><li> Put the names of the servers in your environment:</li><li> Build! </li></ol>

      distcc is developed on GNU/Linux, but has been reported to work
      on other systems including FreeBSD, NetBSD, Darwin, Solaris,
      HP-UX, IRIX, Cygwin and BSD/OS.

     </p><p>
      distcc sends the complete preprocessed source code across the
      network for each job, so all it requires of the volunteer
      machines is that they be running the <tt>distccd</tt> daemon,
      and that they have an appropriate compiler installed.

     </p><p>
      distcc is not itself a compiler, but rather a front-end to the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C/C++ compiler (gcc)</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">LLVM compiler (clang)</a>.  (There
      is preliminary support for some other compilers but the main focus is
      gcc.)  Almost all gcc options and features work as normal.

     </p><p>
      distcc is designed to be used with the <tt>-j</tt> parallel-build
      feature in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</a>
      or <a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>,
      or other build tools.
      Shipping files across the network takes
      time, but few cycles on the client machine.  Any files that can
      be built remotely are essentially &#34;for free&#34; in terms of client
      CPU.

     </p><p>
      distcc has been under development since early 2002.  It reliably
      and successfully compiles large, complex free and proprietary
      software systems.  Programs known to build correctly with distcc
      include
      the <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a>, 
      <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>,
      <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> (via 
      <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/">GARNOME</a>),
      <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.  

     </p><p>
      distcc is nearly linearly scalable for small numbers of
      machines: Building Linux 2.4.19 on a single 1700MHz Pentium IV
      machine with distcc 0.15 takes 6 minutes, 45 seconds.  Using
      distcc across three such machines on a 100Mbps switch takes only
      2 minutes, 30 seconds: <b>2.6x faster</b>.  The (unreachable)
      theoretical maximum speedup is 3.0x, so in this case distcc
      scales with 89% efficiency.

     </p><p>
      You don&#39;t need a lot of machines to benefit: <a href="https://www.distcc.org/scenarios.html">a laptop and a single desktop is much faster than a laptop alone</a>.

     </p><p>
     There are several tools available separately that 
     enhance or complement distcc:

     </p><ul>
       <li>
         <a href="http://ccache.samba.org/">ccache</a>
	 caches compiler output to accelerate builds.
      </li><li>
       <a href="http://dmucs.sourceforge.net/">dmucs</a> helps distcc select
       appropriate servers.

      </li><li>
        <a href="http://ccontrol.ozlabs.org/">ccontrol</a>  
	gives centralized control of parallelism, caching and distribution 
	even while the build is running.


      </li><li>
        <a href="http://kegel.com/crosstool/">crosstool</a>
        automates building cross-compilation toolchains.
       
    </li><li><a href="http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/tvanlaerhoven/#distccWebView">distccWebView</a> is a CGI to show which of your
  servers are up and running.

  </li><li>
<a href="http://www.snookles.com/erlang/tcpbalance/">tcpbalance</a>
   is a load-balancing TCP proxy written in Erlang that works well with
   distcc.
