    <h1>Ask HN: Reject/ghost on all job applications with 8 YoE, what am I doing wrong?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I know this isn&#39;t the forum for this kinda question but I&#39;ve been an avid reader and commenter here for 10+ years and I feel I align pretty well with the demographic. Which is why I&#39;m asking for help.</p><p>Recently I&#39;ve been applying to remote jobs, but literally all of my applications have been rejected or ghosted. It&#39;s so much different than when I was looking a couple years ago. I&#39;m in my mid-20s, with 7-8 years of professional experience and have been programming since I was a kid. I have FAANG names on my resume, jobs and internships (when I was a student). I consider myself a reasonably good engineer - I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hot shit, but I would&#39;ve expected to get to the first screening at least somewhere.</p><p>Has the landscape changed so much in the past few years? Or, if I&#39;m doing something wrong and raising a huge red flag to everyone, how the hell do I figure out what it is? Getting kinda jumpy about my prospects, it&#39;s been disheartening.</p></div></div></div>
