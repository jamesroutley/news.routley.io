Anyone can create, or &#34;mint&#34;, an NFT, and ownership of the token does not usually confer ownership of the underlying item. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-are-nfts-2021-11-17/"> read more </a></p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Reports of scams, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tech-art-idUKL8N2TM0VV" target="_blank">counterfeits</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/unreal-demand-irregular-sales-worth-billions-fire-up-wild-nft-market-2022-02-07" target="_blank">&#34;wash trading&#34;</a> have become commonplace.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The U.S.-based Cent executed one of the first known million-dollar NFT sales when it sold the former <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-29-million-an-nft-2021-03-22" target="_blank">Twitter CEO&#39;s tweet as an NFT</a> last March.
