<p><strong><a href="https://paulsmith.github.io/classic-mac-patterns/">TL;DR: I made a website for the original classic Mac patterns</a></strong></p>
<p>I was working on something and thought it would be fun to use one of the
classic Mac black-and-white patterns in the project. I&#39;m talking about the
original 8×8-pixel ones that were in the original Control Panel for setting the
desktop background and in MacPaint as fill patterns.</p>

history</a></p>
<p>I figured there&#39;d must be clean, pixel-perfect GIFs or PNGs of them somewhere
on the web. And perhaps there are, but after poking around a bit, I ran out of
energy for that, but by then had a head of steam for extracting the patterns en
masse from the original source, somehow. Then I could produce whatever format I
needed for them.</p>
<p>There are 38 patterns, introduced in the original System 1.0 in the 1984 debut
of the Macintosh. They were unchanged in later versions, so I decided to get
them from a System 6 disk, since that&#39;s a little easier with access to utility
programs.</p>
<h2><span>Preparation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">Mini vMac</a>.</li>
<li>Acquire &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_ROM">old world</a>&#34; Mac ROMs.</li>
<li>Download a <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/16994-mac-system-6-0-8-for-minivmac">System 6</a> startup disk image.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a> disk image.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/extras/sitpack/index.html">sitPack</a> disk image.</li>
<li>Install &#34;<a href="https://theunarchiver.com/">The Unarchiver</a>&#34; (<code>brew install --cask the-unarchiver</code>)</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=xcode+command+line+tools">Xcode command-line tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Extraction process</span></h2>
<p>Start System 6 (drag the ROM onto the Mini vMac icon, then drag the System 6
disk onto the window when you see the flashing floppy disk). Mount the ExportFl
and sitPack disks by dragging their files and dropping on the classic Mac
desktop.</p>
<h3><span>In emulation</span></h3>
<p>Double-click sitPack to launch the program. Command-O to open, then navigate to
the startup disk by clicking &#34;Drive&#34;. Scroll to find &#34;System Folder&#34; and
double-click on it. Scroll to the bottom, select &#34;System&#34; and click &#34;Open&#34;. Save
the output file as &#34;System.sit&#34; in the top-level of the startup disk. Quit
sitPack back to the Finder.</p>
<p>Start the ExportFl program. Command-O or pick &#34;Open&#34; from the &#34;File&#34; menu. Find
the &#34;System.sit&#34; created in the last step and click &#34;Open&#34;. A regular file save
dialog will appear on the modern Mac, pick a location and save the file.</p>
<h3><span>On the modern Mac</span></h3>
<p>Drag the &#34;System.sit&#34; file onto The Unarchiver, or open the file from within it.
This will produce a file called &#34;System&#34; (with no extension).</p>
<p>Run DeRez (part of the Xcode developer command-line tools) on the System file.
I first added <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin</code> to my <code>$PATH</code>, then
ran:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>DeRez<span> </span>-only<span> </span>PAT<span>\#</span><span> </span>System<span> </span>&gt;<span> </span>patterns.r
</pre></div>

<p>This produces a text representation of the <code>PAT#</code> resource in the System file.
It&#39;s a series of bytes that comprise 38 8×8 patterns meant for QuickDraw
commands. There&#39;s a leading big-endian unsigned 16-bit number (<code>0026</code>) to indicate the number of 8-byte patterns to follow.</p>

<p>It would have been simple enough to
parse this text, but I had Claude quickly make a <a href="https://github.com/paulsmith/mac-desktop-patterns/blob/3e033b4f0f3aedd9de089c440bcec3387478bcef/extract.py">Python
program</a>
to do so and output them in .pbm format, which is part of the Netpbm image
format class. This is a simple image format that is text-based, a &#39;1&#39; or a
&#39;0&#39; indicating a black or white pixel in a row and column.</p>
<p>For example, this subway tile pattern <img src="https://www.pauladamsmith.com/images/classic-mac-patterns/pattern_011-64x64.png" alt="example pattern11"/> is represented like
this in .pbm:</p>
<pre><code>P1
8 8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>From here, I can generate image files for the patterns in any format and
resolution I want, using ImageMagick or similar. It&#39;s important when scaling the
patterns to use <code>-filter point</code>, so that ImageMagick doesn&#39;t try to interpolate
the pixels it needs to fill in, which would lead to blurry results.</p>

<h2><span>Why do all this?</span></h2>
<p>It&#39;s nostalgic, I have a fondness for these old patterns and the original B&amp;W
Mac aesthetic, it reminds me of playing games like Dark Castle and Glider,
messing around with HyperCard, and using Tex-Edit and hoarding early shareware
programs.</p>
<p>The whole point of the above is to get a copy of the System file out with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork">resource fork</a> intact, that&#39;s
where the desktop patterns live.</p>
<p>According to old classic Mac
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf">manuals</a>,
the patterns were QuickDraw bit-pattern resources, a simple bitmap of 8 bits
per row packed into 8 bytes (columns). It was fast for QuickDraw to copy them
over an area of the screen. For example the following pattern was used for the
default gray desktop pattern on black-and-white Mac screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pauladamsmith.com/images/classic-mac-patterns/pattern_03_64x64.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>I could have extracted all 38 patterns other ways: I could have screenshotted
each one, I could have looked at each one and hand-written .pbm files, both of
which would have been tedious and error-prone.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I wanted to extract the exact original data from the source (or
close enough copy thereof) and have the patterns in a format I considered
archival for this limited purpose (.pbm files are trivial to parse and
manipulate).</p>
<p>Head over to my <a href="https://paulsmith.github.io/classic-mac-patterns/">pattern site</a> to get the patterns for yourself.</p>
