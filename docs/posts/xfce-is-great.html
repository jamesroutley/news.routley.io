    <h1>XFCE Is Great</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I have not been shy talking about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/xfce/">my love</a> of <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> over the years here. The desktop environment has been a trusted friend ever since I first loved it on the late Cobind Desktop (still the high water mark of desktop Linux, as far as I’m concerned).</p>
<p>I’m glad to see I’m not the only one. David Gerard of <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">Pivot to AI</a> fame recently shared <a href="https://reddragdiva.dreamwidth.org/582674.html">this post he wrote in 2012</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question with minimal desktops is the fine line between as simple as possible and just a bit too simple. How much basic stuff do you have to add back? 4.8 took it slightly far, 4.10 is almost Just Right. XFCE is so far a case study in Not Fucking It Up; I hope they never go to version 5, and just update 4 forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>This (a) longevity and (2) getting the balance right cannot be overstated. Here’s my current Xfce desktop, for example:</p>

<p>Except, <strong>no it isn’t</strong>. That’s a screenshot of my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1185/" title="Fun with Xfce, part one">FreeBSD desktop from 2008</a>, with the bright and clear Tango Iconset (speaking of high-water marks). Remember when iconography was discernable at a glance? Aka, functional as icons? But I digress.</p>
<p>Xfce in 2025 (no, 2026, damn it!) is just as easy to understand, light, and fast as it first was booting Cobind on my <a href="http://retro.rubenerd.com/brio.htm">HP Brio</a> when I was in school, or when building it from source in FreeBSD ports. Though unlike a barebones window manager or other “light” DEs, Xfce feels usable, feature complete, and designed by someone who understands why people use desktop computers (cough GNOME).</p>
<p>I do use KDE on my primary desktop. Version 4 was a mess, but they’ve made <em>massive</em> improvements, especially within the last year. I’m not sure how much this had to do with the Steam Deck, and a new generation of people realising that… wait… I can run stuff on this box other than games? There’s a desktop here!? But my laptops all run Xfce, and I’m half-tempted to move back to it on the desktop.</p>
<p>I’m with David here. I hope they never feel the need to “innovate” with “disruption” for “UX”. The switch to the Thunar file manager was the last major user-facing change I can remember, and it was great.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting we reached peak UI with Xfce, but no desktop since has made a compelling case (for me) for its replacement. I love, <em>love</em>, <strong>love</strong> that Xfce is maintained this way in spite of all the industry pressures to turn it into something else.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I stopped writing posts like this for years, out of fear of how people from specific desktop environments would respond. If you’re about to write me an angry screed, know that I will immediately delete it and block you, <a href="https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/" title="A thread about people who need to run Windows">just as I did last time</a>. Both yours and my time are better spent.</p>
<p>I also know (sigh) this disclaimer will be ignored, so I’m questioning why I’m even bothering. Maybe I’m a sucker for punishment.</p>
