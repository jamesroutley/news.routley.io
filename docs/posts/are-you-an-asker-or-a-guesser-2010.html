    <h1>Are you an Asker or a Guesser? (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span><span>T</span></span>he advice of etiquette experts on dealing with unwanted invitations, or overly demanding requests for favours, has always been the same: just say no. That may have been a useless mantra in the war on drugs, but in the war on relatives who want to stay for a fortnight, or colleagues trying to get you to do their work, the <a href="http://www.emilypost.com/" data-link-name="in body link">manners guru Emily Post</a>&#39;s formulation – &#34;I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t be possible&#34; – remains the gold standard. Excuses merely invite negotiation. The comic retort has its place (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook" data-link-name="in body link">Peter Cook</a>: &#34;Oh dear, I find I&#39;m watching television that night&#34;), and I&#39;m fond of the tautological non-explanation (&#34;I can&#39;t, because I&#39;m unable to&#34;). But these are variations on a theme: the best way to say no is to say no. Then shut up.</p><p>This is a lesson we&#39;re unable to learn, however, judging by the scores of books promising to help us. <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780553903522.html" data-link-name="in body link">The Power Of A Positive No</a>, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780767903806" data-link-name="in body link">How To Say No Without Feeling Guilty</a>, <a href="http://www.thebookofno.com/CMS/" data-link-name="in body link">The Book Of No...</a> Publishers, certainly, seem unable to refuse. (Two recent books addressing the topic are <a href="http://www.marshallgoldsmithlibrary.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Marshall Goldsmith&#39;s Mojo</a>, and <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061882753/Womenomics/index.aspx" data-link-name="in body link">Womenomics, by Claire Shipman and Katty Kay</a>.) This is the &#34;disease to please&#34; – a phrase that doesn&#39;t make grammatical sense, but rhymes, giving it instant pop-psychology cachet. There are certainly profound issues here, of self-esteem, guilt etcetera. But it&#39;s also worth considering whether part of the problem doesn&#39;t originate in a simple misunderstanding between two types of people: Askers and Guessers.</p><p>This terminology comes from a brilliant <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421" data-link-name="in body link">web posting</a> by Andrea Donderi that&#39;s achieved minor cult status online. We are raised, the theory runs, in one of two cultures. In Ask culture, people grow up believing they can ask for anything – a favour, a pay rise– fully realising the answer may be no. In Guess culture, by contrast, you avoid &#34;putting a request into words unless you&#39;re pretty sure the answer will be yes… A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won&#39;t have to make the request directly; you&#39;ll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.&#34;</p><p>Neither&#39;s &#34;wrong&#34;, but when an Asker meets a Guesser, unpleasantness results. An Asker won&#39;t think it&#39;s rude to request two weeks in your spare room, but a Guess culture person will hear it as presumptuous and resent the agony involved in saying no. Your boss, asking for a project to be finished early, may be an overdemanding boor – or just an Asker, who&#39;s assuming you might decline. If you&#39;re a Guesser, you&#39;ll hear it as an expectation. This is a spectrum, not a dichotomy, and it explains cross-cultural awkwardnesses, too: Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan, because it&#39;s a Guess culture, yet experience Russians as rude, because they&#39;re diehard Askers.</p><p>Self-help seeks to make us all Askers, training us to both ask and refuse with relish; the mediation expert<a href="http://www.williamury.com/" data-link-name="in body link"> William Ury </a>recommends memorising &#34;anchor phrases&#34; such as &#34;that doesn&#39;t work for me&#34;. But Guessers can take solace in logic: in many social situations (though perhaps not at work) the very fact that you&#39;re receiving an anxiety-inducing request is proof the person asking is an Asker. He or she is half-expecting you&#39;ll say no, and has no inkling of the torture you&#39;re experiencing. So say no, and see what happens. Nothing will.</p><p><a href="mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com" data-link-name="in body link | mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p></div></div></div>
