			<h2>Attention Subtitles Enthusiasts! Big Changes Ahead for OpenSubtitles.org API</h2>



<p>As the familiar landscape of online movie subtitle searches undergoes a transformation, OpenSubtitles.org has announced the <a href="https://forum.opensubtitles.org/viewtopic.php?t=17930#p47873">end of its original API service</a> in 2022. A significant shift in its system has been set in motion, marking the end of an era after 17 years of reliable service. This transition aims to pave the way for a more advanced and streamlined experience with the introduction of the new <a href="https://api.opensubtitles.com">REST API</a> on OpenSubtitles.com.</p>



<h3>End of an Era: What’s Changing and When?</h3>



<p>The original API service from OpenSubtitles.org is slated to cease functioning by the end of 2023, as announced earlier. This decision, initially disclosed in a forum post, will primarily affect non-VIP users, while VIP members will continue to enjoy access to the API. While this may seem daunting, fear not! The end of the old API service heralds a new chapter for subtitles enthusiasts with the revamped and optimized OpenSubtitles.com REST API.</p>



<h3>Embrace the Change: Introducing the 20% Black Friday Treat!</h3>



<p>To celebrate this transition and express gratitude to its loyal user base, OpenSubtitles.org is offering an <a href="https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/support">exclusive 20% discount</a> on a one-year subscription to VIP membership. This offer is valid until November 24th, 2023. Subscribers will not only gain VIP status on www.opensubtitles.org but also have access to VIP benefits on www.opensubtitles.com.</p>
