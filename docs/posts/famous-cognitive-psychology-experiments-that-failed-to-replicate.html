    <h1>Famous cognitive psychology experiments that failed to replicate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main components="[object Object]"><p><em>TL;DR is the part in bold below.</em></p>
<p>The field of psychology had a big crisis in the 2010s, when many widely accepted results turned out to be much less solid than previously thought. It&#39;s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Replication_crisis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replication crisis</a>, because labs around the world tried and failed to replicate, in new experiments, previous results published by their original &#34;discoverers&#34;. In other words, many reported psychological effects were either non-existent—artifacts of the experimenter&#39;s flawed setup—or so much weaker than originally claimed that they lost most of their intellectual sparkle.</p>
<p>(The crisis spanned other fields as well, but I mostly care about psychology here, especially the cognitive kind.)</p>
<p>This is very old news, and I&#39;ve been vaguely aware of several of the biggest disgraced results for years, but I keep on forgetting which are (still probably) real and which aren&#39;t. This is not good. <em>Most</em> results in the field do actually replicate and are robust<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, so it would be a pity to lose confidence in the whole field just because of a few bad apples.</p>
<p><strong>This post is a compact reference list of the most (in)famous cognitive science results that failed to replicate and should, for the time being, be considered false.</strong> The only goal is to offset the trust-undermining effects of my poor memory—and perhaps yours, too?—with a bookmarkable page.</p>
<p>This can&#39;t be a comprehensive list: if a study is <em>not</em> on this page, it&#39;s not guaranteed to be fully replicated. Still, this should cover most of the high-profile debunked theories that laypeople like me may have heard of.</p>
<p><em>Credit: I enlisted the help of Kimi K2, o3, and Sonnet 4 to gather and fact-check this list. I also checked, pruned, and de-hallucinated all the results.</em></p>

<h3>Ego Depletion Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> We have a &#34;willpower battery&#34; that gradually depletes during the day as we exercise self-control. (I remember reading Baumeister&#39;s pop-science book and being awed by the implications of their findings; I might have known it sounded too good to be true.)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Power Posing Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> Adopting expansive body postures for 2 minutes (like standing with hands on hips or arms raised) increases testosterone, decreases cortisol, and makes people feel more powerful and take more risks.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Social Priming: Elderly Words Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> People walk more slowly after being exposed to words related to elderly stereotypes.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Money Priming Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> Simply thinking about money makes you more selfish and more likely to endorse free market values.</li>

<h3>ESP Precognition Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> In some cases, people can predict future events &#34;that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process&#34;.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Glucose and Ego Depletion Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> Connected to the debunked ego-depletion effect, this one claims that adding glucose to your blood &#34;recharges&#34; the willpower battery. (For a while, I may have drunk more orange juice than usual after reading Baumeister&#39;s book. At least it&#39;s healthy-ish.)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Psychological Distance &amp; Construal Level Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result</strong>: &#34;Psychologically distant&#34; events are processed more abstractly, while &#34;psychologically near&#34; events are processed more concretely. E.g., you worry about the difficulty of a task if you have to do it tomorrow, but you see the same task&#39;s attractive side if it is planned far in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Representative paper</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438233/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trope &amp; Liberman (2010)</a>, building on <a href="https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/the-role-of-feasibility-and-desirability-considerations-in-near-a" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Liberman &amp; Trope (1998)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Marshmallow Test &amp; Long-Term Success Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> Children&#39;s ability to resist eating a marshmallow when left alone in a room at age 4-5 strongly predicts adolescent achievement, with those who waited longer showing better life outcomes.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Stereotype Threat (Women&#39;s Math Performance) Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result:</strong> Women risk being judged by the negative stereotype that women have weaker math ability, and this apprehension disrupts their math performance on difficult tests.</li>
<li><strong>Representative paper:</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103198913737" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn (1999)</a></li>
<li><strong>Replication status:</strong> <em>did not replicate</em></li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2014.10.002" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flore &amp; Wicherts (2015)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Smile to Feel Better Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claimed result</strong>: Holding a pen in your teeth (forcing a smile-like expression) makes you rate cartoons as funnier compared to holding a pen with your lips (preventing smiling). More broadly, facial expressions can influence emotional experiences: &#34;fake it till you make it.&#34;</li>
