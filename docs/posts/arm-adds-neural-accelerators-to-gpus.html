<h2 id="h-news-highlights">News Highlights:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Arm neural technology is an industry first, adding dedicated neural accelerators to Arm GPUs, bringing PC-quality, AI powered graphics to mobile for the first time – and laying the foundation for future on-device AI innovation </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Neural Super Sampling is the first application, an AI-driven graphics upscaler that enables potential for 2x resolution uplift at 4ms per frame </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Developers can start building now with the industry’s first open development kit for neural graphics with an Unreal Engine plugin, emulators, and open models on GitHub and Hugging Face </li>
</ul>



<p>On-device AI is transforming workloads everywhere, from mobile gaming to productivity tools to intelligent cameras. This is driving demand for stunning visuals, high frame rates and smarter features – without draining battery or adding friction. Announced today at SIGGRAPH, Arm neural technology is an industry first, bringing dedicated neural accelerators to Arm GPUs from 2026. This takes the performance of GPUs for graphics rendering to new heights, delivering up to 50% GPU workload reduction for today’s most intensive mobile content, starting with mobile gaming. And this is just the beginning – the availability of this new technology lays the foundations for the industry to deliver even more on-device AI innovation in the future.<strong> </strong> </p>



<p>Alongside this technology, we are launching the world’s first publicly available neural graphics development kit, designed to integrate AI-powered rendering into existing workflows so that developers can start building today, a full year ahead of hardware availability. All of Arm’s neural technology will be completely open – that means the model architecture, the weights and the tools that a studio would need to retrain the model. Partners that have shown support for the development kit to date include Enduring Games, Epic Games (Unreal Engine), NetEase Games, Sumo Digital, Tencent Games, and Traverse Research.  </p>



<p>This marks the arrival of desktop-quality neural graphics on mobile, a major milestone for game developers on the frontlines of the shift to on-device AI. But Arm neural technology isn’t just about games – it will have an impact in applications such as neural camera workloads, giving developers the tools to bring graphics to life, on-device and at scale in use cases ranging from upscaling to path tracing. </p>



<h2 id="h-meeting-developers-where-they-are-an-open-development-kit-for-neural-technology-nbsp">Meeting Developers Where They Are: An Open Development Kit for Neural Technology </h2>



<p>Developers can get going today with the neural graphics development kit – giving them a head start on integrating AI-powered graphics before hardware ships. Built with mobile gaming in mind, the kit includes everything needed to integrate and customize AI-driven visuals, including: </p>



<ul>
<li>An Unreal Engine plugin </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>PC-based Vulkan emulation </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Updated profiling tools </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Fully open models available via GitHub and Hugging Face </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>ML extensions for Vulkan </li>
</ul>



<p>The open ML extensions for Vulkan let developers bring AI directly into familiar rendering pipelines. While traditional Vulkan supports graphics and compute pipelines, Arm’s extensions introduce a third: the Graph Pipeline, designed specifically for neural network inference. All of this makes it dramatically easier to incorporate AI into mobile rendering as a native part of the graphics pipeline. Developers can find out more <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/mobile-graphics-and-gaming-blog/posts/how-arm-neural-super-sampling-works">here</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-neural-graphics-in-action-neural-super-sampling-nbsp">Neural Graphics in Action: Neural Super Sampling </h2>



<p>Leveraging all the pieces of the development kit is Arm Neural Super Sampling (NSS) – our AI-powered graphics upscaling engine. It builds on the foundation laid by <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/mobile-graphics-and-gaming-blog/posts/introducing-arm-accuracy-super-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arm Accuracy Super Resolution (Arm ASR),</a> which is already being leveraged by the studios behind games including Fortnite and Infinity Nikki.  </p>



<p>NSS delivers the potential for upscaling from 540p resolution to 1080p at a cost of 4ms per frame, while delivering near-native quality. Developers can save up to 50% of the GPU workload compared with rendering the full frame using traditional methods, and either bank that saving to reduce the overall power consumption of their game, spend it on delivering a higher frame rate or increasing the quality of the visuals. With NSS, developers can use AI to preserve surface detail, lighting, and motion clarity, giving them the flexibility to balance visual fidelity with energy efficiency depending on their game’s needs. </p>

<h2 id="h-beyond-upscaling-more-neural-graphics-ahead-nbsp">Beyond Upscaling: More Neural Graphics Ahead </h2>



<p>In 2026, we’ll expand our roadmap of neural technology applications with <em>Neural Frame Rate Upscaling</em> – which uses AI to double frame rates without doubling the rendering load – and <em>Neural Super Sampling and Denoising – </em>which applies AI to enable real-time path tracing on mobile with fewer rays per pixel. Both will be available ahead of hardware.  </p>
