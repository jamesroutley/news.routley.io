        <p><em>This post was originally sent to <a href="https://stitcher.io/newsletter/subscribe">my newsletter</a> in November, 2021. I wanted to share it here as well, just to hear some more thoughts.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Two months ago, I decided to give Twitter Home another chance: the timeline that Twitter fills using their algorithm instead of just chronologically showing tweets of people you follow. I wanted to discover interesting new people to follow and I figure Twitter would fill my feed with tweets related to my interests; based on what and who I liked, retweeted and followed over the years.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>After two months, I now only see tweets of:</p>
<ul>
<li>self proclaimed &#34;tech-gurus&#34; who don&#39;t have much, if any, up-to-date experience with real-life projects and clients;</li>
<li>people trying to sell me their latest products;</li>
<li>people showing off their new MacBook pro;</li>
<li>people going out of their way trying to spread &#34;positive vibes&#34; to the point that it becomes a little cringey;</li>
<li>people who use threads, which I don&#39;t find a very efficient way of communicating longer and coherent thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just to be clear, I&#39;m not mad at any of those people; most of them actually tweet interesting stuff as well; but Twitter simply didn&#39;t show those more interesting tweets in my Home feed.</p>
<p>It turns out <a href="https://medium.com/technically-social/study-suggests-twitters-timeline-algorithm-buries-external-links-92cb5841082f">their algorithm is rather picky</a>, especially when it comes to tweeting external sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On average, 51% of tweets in chronological timelines contained an external link, compared to just 18% in the algorithmic timelines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I find external sources (blog posts, news articles, etc) often the most relevant and insightful; and Twitter deliberately filters them out when discovering new people.</p>
<p>So after using Twitter Home for two months, I felt genuinely miserable every time I opened my feed. I knew that almost no tweet would interest me, and I&#39;m sad that the Twitter algorithm doesn&#39;t work better for my case. I&#39;m sure Twitter is well aware of how their algorithm works, and I&#39;m sure it yields the best results for the majority of their users, but I apparently don&#39;t belong in that group.</p>
<p>So, here&#39;s where I need your help: I really want to discover more interesting people online; people who write about PHP, webdev, and programming; people who dare to challenge ideas that we take for granted; content that makes us think outside our box.</p>
<p>But how do I find those people? Twitter clearly isn&#39;t the best platform and I find Reddit and HackerNews either too focussed or too broad. So what&#39;s left? Any ideas? I would very much appreciate your input!</p>
