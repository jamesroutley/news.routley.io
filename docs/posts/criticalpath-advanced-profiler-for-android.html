    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Optimize your mobile application for faster performance and enhanced responsiveness. Identify and address performance bottlenecks in your mobile app.</p><p>Only Android native apps are currently supported.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.productscience.app/integration/android/gradle/" target="_blank">View documentation</a></p></div><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tab8wfn9nvlu/4fGp7n8uDPyrpJhKwTenb5/ec4f5437a68e0ff567efbfe87c2bd163/crpath-ux.webp" height="500" alt="Profiler user interface"/></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Video Preview</h2><p>Context is key! Understand what’s happening in your mobile app and precisely when it occurs. With CriticalPath, you can record a trace file synchronized with a screen recording of your app’s UI, eliminating the need for tedious searches to pinpoint issues.</p></div><div><h2>Critical Path</h2><p>The critical path highlights the dependencies between functions to identify performance bottlenecks in multi-threaded environments. It allows you to see the order of execution of functions as a result of a user action and identify what is slowing down the response.</p></div><div><h2>Automatic Instrumentation</h2><p>You don’t need to manually instrument your code. Our plugin will take care of the hard work for you. Instrumentation has minimal impact on performance. Our intelligent filtering will eliminate non-essential data, enabling you to pinpoint critical performance insights.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Click on a slice to view the critical path. Each slice represents a function call; the longer the slice, the more time it took to execute this function. The critical path connects these slices in the order they were executed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Click the play button to see exactly what the user sees in the app and to view which functions are called at any given moment.</p><div><p>Use your keyboard to navigate the trace viewer. Press W and S to zoom in and out, respectively. Use A and D to move left and right.</p></div></div></div><p>Please open this page in your desktop browser to view the live demo.</p></div><div><div><p>Ready to test it with your app?</p></div></div><div><h2>Comparison With Other Tools</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>CriticalPath</th><th>Android Studio Profiler</th><th>Perfetto</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Video-trace synchronization</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Automatic instrumentation</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Smart trace filtering</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Execution path</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Learning curve</td><td>Ready for entry-level familiarity with code and instrumentation</td><td>Requires expert-level coding experience and extensive familiarity with the tool</td><td>Requires mid-level coding experience, but requires instrumentation expertise</td></tr><tr><td>Profiling method</td><td>Sample / Tracing</td><td>Sample / Tracing</td><td>Tracing</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumentation overhead</td><td>Minimal</td><td>Intensive</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumentation results</td><td>Smart filters</td><td>Overwhelm</td><td>Underwhelm</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div>
