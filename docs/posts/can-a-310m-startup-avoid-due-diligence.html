    <h1>Can a $310M startup avoid due diligence?</h1>

But an unwanted side effect of these high valuations is that investors become vulnerable targets for a type of founder who perpetually spins up new companies, takes cash off the table, enjoys a good lifestyle, keeps raising larger and larger rounds, all the while hoping the pieces fall into place for his latest business idea, but not really minding if they don’t.</p><p>Let’s take a deeper dive into <a href="https://merits.com" rel="">Merits.com</a>, a.k.a. Merit, a startup that just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/merit-grabs-50m-series-b-to-expand-digital-credentials-platform/" rel="">raised $50M</a>. The founder and CEO is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerkagan" rel="">Tomer Kagan</a>, a serial entrepreneur whose last startup, Quixey, raised $170M ($650M valuation) and then shut down, laying off all its employees, leaving observers scratching their heads about where all the money went, since the company never built and released a product.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78713d5e-2926-441b-b70f-04d7f0a25cab_595x470.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78713d5e-2926-441b-b70f-04d7f0a25cab_595x470.png" width="595" height="470" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78713d5e-2926-441b-b70f-04d7f0a25cab_595x470.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:470,&#34;width&#34;:595,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>What does Merit do?

According to <a href="https://plc.pearson.com/en-US/news/pearson-acquires-digital-credentialing-leader-credly" rel="">Pearson’s press release</a>, “Credly offers an easy-to-use platform for organizations, companies and educational institutions to award employees and workers trusted digital credentials that verify their skills and help connect them with the right opportunities” and “more than 2,000 organizations use Credly… making it the world’s largest professional credentialing marketplace”.</p><p>According to documents obtained by SV Gossip, Merit has made claims to investors of having over 1,500 organizations issuing “merits” on their platform. This would imply that Merit’s business is a close second to Credly’s. Is this claim factually true?

Thousands of AngelList members were invited to invest personal checks ranging from $2,000 to $20,000+ via the mailing lists of multiple syndicates. These individual investors were not provided with any kind of due diligence report about what business activities the company is really engaged in, how many organizations are really actively using the company’s products and services, and what kinds of spending have historically been paid for using investment capital. They were shown the positive spin coming from the company, as well as social proof in the form of names of other investors.</p><p>Sadly, this is how investing in AngelList syndicates works. The small-time angels in a syndicate put their trust in their syndicate lead, who often delegates that trust to the lead investor in a deal. The belief that others have done due diligence is typically what makes individual syndicate members feel comfortable investing based on the limited information they receive. Unfortunately, the system of trust fails if the lead investor is susceptible enough to a founder’s salesmanship or assumes proper diligence has been done by other investors even further upstream. This is usually a reasonable assumption, but in a frothy market, we are seeing signs of this system breaking.</p><p>Insiders familiar with Kagan tell SV Gossip that he’s preternaturally talented at pitching, blessed with a version of the famous Steve Jobs reality distortion field that lets him work investors into a frenzy while somehow not having checked off any of the milestones, metrics or other objective criteria they typically look for.</p><p>When you’re the founder of a startup that takes in a $50M investment like this, you’re all set to live off the money however you want. You can pay yourself a “market salary” of $500,000/yr+. You can use the money as a piggy bank for flights, hotels, Uber Black, and other travel expenses. You can hire your friends and give them similarly large salaries and expense accounts. You can do what’s known in the Silicon Valley jargon as “taking money off the table”, giving up a couple percentage points of your personal stock shares in exchange for transferring $5M+ from the investor’s bank account into your own personal bank account.</p><p>Hustles like this are becoming increasingly common in the world of Silicon Valley startups. The integrity of the founders who run them varies from having a real vision of a lucrative business, to deluding themselves, to deluding themselves and others, to just deluding others. Besides a few high-profile scandals like WeWork and Theranos, and besides the much-discussed explosion of token and NFT scams, many of today’s biggest startup disasters are unfolding under the radar. Being entrusted with tens of $millions isn’t enough to make them newsworthy.</p><p>If you have info about Merit or other gossip to share, email svgossiptips@gmail.com</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
