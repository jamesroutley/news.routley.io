    <h1>PSF Hires PyPI Safety and Security Engineer</h1>

<p>We <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-09-announcing-pypi-safety-and-security-engr-role/">announced our intention</a> back in May to fill this role with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/securing-pypi-for-the-future/">generous funding by Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, and after a thorough search, we are delighted to announce <a href="https://mike.fiedler.me/">Mike Fiedler</a> is joining the team! He joins the PSF for the next year as our first ever PyPI Safety &amp; Security Engineer. Mike is already a dedicated member of the Python packaging community – he has been a Python user for some 15 years, maintains and contributes to open source, and became a PyPI Maintainer in 2022.</p><p>This critical role would not be possible without funding from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/">AWS</a>: &#34;<i>We are happy to be able to invest in the sustainable and secure development of Python and PyPI, and we look forward to Mike&#39;s contributions</i>.&#34; - Tom Callaway, AWS. </p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQtH2F2N_fn2rburkNWVpr26ctTVpSbwdIo0c6gfgVpmoWa6E3sxBa9p8Jcnx1_9r4LsOT2hJkJrdN0ttP-EmMAA6o1AHptBHlcWnytl8fAvjBlIltUslJDHKE1lAKrUqX8aT1aE4CndI4Hp5-nMOvQyLXl6T80Boj30yN7wy1VeZmVsuxL3Q/s3289/49506768212_ac4f703527_o.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="A photo of Mike Fiedler smiling to the camera." data-original-height="3289" data-original-width="2500" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQtH2F2N_fn2rburkNWVpr26ctTVpSbwdIo0c6gfgVpmoWa6E3sxBa9p8Jcnx1_9r4LsOT2hJkJrdN0ttP-EmMAA6o1AHptBHlcWnytl8fAvjBlIltUslJDHKE1lAKrUqX8aT1aE4CndI4Hp5-nMOvQyLXl6T80Boj30yN7wy1VeZmVsuxL3Q/w243-h320/49506768212_ac4f703527_o.jpg" width="243"/></a></p><p>We are thrilled that for the first time we are able to bring on an engineer who will be dedicated full-time  to PyPI. PyPI is a massive project that has become key digital infrastructure serving millions of users. Up until now, PyPI has been almost entirely volunteer-run, depending on a tiny team with only one fraction of one person’s paid time. We’re expecting all PyPI users to have a tangibly improved experience from Mike’s work over the next year. Some of the outcomes we are targeting include increased support for package maintainers including multi-maintainer projects, improvements to reporting infrastructure for malicious projects, as well as a reduced response time for malware reports and account recovery requests. Mike will work closely with our also-recently-announced <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-our-new-security-developer.html">Security Developer in Residence, Seth Larson</a>. <br/></p><p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is the non-profit organization behind Python and PyPI. Our mission is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The PSF supports the Python community using corporate sponsorships, grants, and donations.
