Does that sound easy to you? Well it wasn&#39;t; we started with hardware
emulation of a 80386-equipped PC clone running a novel Windows XP
compatible operating system called ProgrOS, implemented in a clean
room in the Seychelles by a team of people who had never programmed
before (to keep the lawyers at bay).

</p><p>
Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t fast enough (there was too much lag death),
so we instead emulated the much faster Cray-2 supercomputer and ran
the 80386 emulator in that. But the 80386 kept getting hot, so we
switched to a 6502 overclocked at 120GHz with emulated liquid helium
coolant, and ported ProgrOS to that.
