    <h1>Anticheat Update Tracking</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A few years ago when I was into reverse engineering and binary analysis (and game modding), I did a lot of research into anticheats work. I was curious about tracking their updates, since that would allow me to:</p><ul><li>Know when a new version is released</li><li>Understand what changes were made</li><li>Use older versions for research purposes</li></ul><p>So I ended up researching different ways on how to track updates of various anticheats. Some of them are already very well documented, while others haven&#39;t been explored much. This post will summarize my findings and outline how they work.</p><p>EasyAntiCheat is widely recognized as one of the most advanced anticheats, and is used in many popular games like Rust, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and more.</p><p>Prior to the acquisition by Epic Games, EAC was using their own CDN to distribute updates: <code>https://download.eac-cdn.com/api/v1/games/{game_id}/client/{system}/download/?uuid=1239688</code>.</p><ul><li><code>game_id</code>: unique identifier for each game (e.g. 154 for Apex Legends)</li><li><code>system</code>: target platform/system (e.g. <code>wow64_win64</code>, <code>mac64</code>, <code>linux32_64</code>).</li></ul><p>After the acquisition, they switched to the EpicGames CDN, which has a slightly different URL structure: <code>https://modules-cdn.eac-prod.on.epicgames.com/modules/{product_id}/{deployment_id}/{system}</code>. The parameters to this URL are completely different:</p><ul><li><code>product_id</code>: unique identifier for each game (e.g. <code>429c2212ad284866aee071454c2125b5</code> for Rust)</li><li><code>deployment_id</code>: unique identifier for each deployment (e.g. <code>76796531e86443548754600511f42e9e</code> for Rust). This doesn&#39;t change when an update is released and is used to identify different game versions.</li><li><code>system</code>: same as in the old CDN</li></ul><p>After downloading the module for a game, we&#39;ll have a file which contains data with a very high entropy which is the first indication that it is encrypted or compressed:</p><pre><code><span>$ bat encrypted.bin | ent
</span><span>Entropy = 7.989390 bits per byte.
</span></code></pre><p>Looking at the data, we also can&#39;t really identify any patterns or strings. However, across versions the header seems to always stay the same (<code>a7 ed</code>): Very interesting 🤔</p><pre><code><span>$ hexyl encrypted.bin | head

</span></code></pre><p>Unfortunately, we&#39;re not yet done. According to <a href="https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy">Detect it Easy</a>, the binary is protected with VMProtect, which means we can&#39;t just read the <code>.text</code> or <code>.data</code> section. However, to further analyze the binary and extract the driver and usermode module we&#39;ll have to find a way to unpack it.</p><img alt="Detect it Easy screenshot" aspect-ratio="1133 / 1133" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://not-matthias.github.io/processed_images/eac_die.37a42aa7b7658bc0.webp"/><p>There are many ways to unpack binaries, with the most popular being <strong>emulation</strong> and <strong>native execution</strong>.

</span></code></pre><p>After analyzing this unpacked library, you&#39;ll eventually figure out that the <code>.data</code> section has a high entropy and is quite large. You might even recognize the encrypted PE headers from earlier: <code>a7 ed</code>. This is exactly where the driver and their internal module are stored.</p><p>The embedded files use the same encryption algorithm, so we can search for the encrypted PE header (<code>MZ</code> or <code>0x4D5A</code>). After looking at the data in IDA, I managed to find a pattern which we can use to extract the embedded files. The encrypted modules are always stored in the following order:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;encrypted_module&gt;  (encrypted data)
</span><span>&lt;size&gt;              (padded to 16 bytes)
</span></code></pre><p>This is somewhat equivalent to the following structure, where len always contains the size of the buffer:</p><pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>EncryptedModule</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>buffer</span><span>:</span> [<span>u8</span>],

</span></code></pre><p>By knowing that the encrypted module has a high entropy, which means that it&#39;s very unlikely that there will be patterns in the data, we can simply search for at least 8 bytes of zero padding which is always present after the size.</p><pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> section <span>=</span> pe<span>.</span><span>section_by_name</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>&#34;</span>.data<span>&#34;</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>

They put a lot of focus on detecting popular cheat providers, by detecting them via static signatures. It is used in games like Arma, DayZ, Escape from Tarkov, and most recently Grand Theft Auto V.</p><p>Their CDN seems to be built in-house and follows a very simple structure:</p><ol><li>Fetch the latest version (which is just a unix timestamp like <code>1746714230</code>)</li><li>Download the module using the version number from the actual CDN</li></ol><p>Here are the required URLs:</p><ul><li>Version URL: <code>https://cdn.battleye.com/{game}/ver</code></li><li>Download URL: <code>https://cdn.battleye.com/{game}/{version}</code></li><li>Possible values for the games include: <code>eft</code>, <code>unturned</code>, <code>ark</code>, <code>r6s/win-x64</code>, <code>dayz/win-x64</code>.</li></ul><p>The downloaded binary contains other bytes before the actual module, which have to be filtered out.

So it seems like the CDN is keeping not only the latest but also previous builds.

</span></code></pre><p>It&#39;s surprising to see the differences in CDNs for different anticheats. You might think, why don&#39;t all anticheats have a <em>state-of-the-art military-grade quantum-proof AI encrypted CDN™</em>: Turns out it doesn&#39;t matter if people can extract all of the anticheat modules or figure out when the anticheat updates.</p><p>At best, it makes it a little bit more inconvenient or time consuming for researchers (which is pretty much the whole purpose of an anticheat). The main purpose is to protect the games and this is done by protecting the modules that do the detections rather than the CDN.</p><hr/><p>I worked on this project a few years ago, even gave a talk at a local meetup about the architecture, but never got around to publish a blog post about the internals. I really enjoyed working on this project, trying out new tech stack and learning about devops, deployment, object storage (MinIO) and a lot more. While some of the information likely is not unknown anymore, I still hope you learned something.</p><h2 id="equ8">EQU8</h2><p><strong>EDIT: Turns out the CDN doesn&#39;t work anymore, but I wanted to include it for the sake of completeness</strong></p><p>EQU8 is an anticheat developed primarily for the game Splitgate. It isn&#39;t as advanced as the previously mentioned anticheats, but still provides <em>some</em> level of protection against cheaters.</p><p>The download URL is as follows: <code>https://download2.equ8.com/v1/a1/{id}/updates.json</code>, where <code>{id}</code> is a unique identifier for the game (e.g. 36 for Splitgate)</p><p>This response can be parsed with the following structures:</p><pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>allow</span><span><span><span>(</span></span></span><span><span>unused</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span>]</span></span>

They are one of the top anticheats in this space due to their invasive checks and little public information about their detections.</p><p>You can find the download link on their <a href="https://www.faceit.com/en/anti-cheat">anticheat page</a> which links to here: https://anticheat-client.faceit-cdn.net/FACEITInstaller_64.exe It only includes the frontend iirc, and I didn&#39;t spend much more time on it.</p><h2 id="esea">ESEA</h2><p>This anticheat requires you to have an account, and last time I checked their download page had a CAPTCHA, making it a little bit more inconvenient to track updates. Anyways, here&#39;s the download link: https://play.esea.net/index.php?s=downloads&amp;d=download&amp;id=1</p></section></div>
