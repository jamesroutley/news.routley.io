    <h1>NextNav&#39;s Callous Land-Grab to Privatize 900 MHz</h1>

    <div><div><div><p><span>The 900 MHz band, a frequency range serving as a commons for all, is now at risk due to NextNav’s brazen attempt to privatize this shared resource. </span></p>
<p><span>Left by the FCC for use by amateur radio operators, unlicensed consumer devices, and industrial, scientific, and medical equipment, this spectrum has become a hotbed for new technologies and community-driven projects. Millions of consumer devices also rely on the range, including baby monitors, cordless phones, IoT devices, garage door openers. But NextNav would rather claim these frequencies, fence them off, and lease them out to mobile service providers. This is just another land-grab by a corporate rent-seeker dressed up as innovation. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2224-240%22))&amp;page=1&amp;limit=100"><span>EFF and hundreds of others</span></a><span> have called on the FCC to decisively reject this proposal and protect the open spectrum as a commons that serves all.</span></p>
<h2><span>NextNav’s Proposed &#39;Band-Grab&#39;<br/></span></h2>
<p><span>NextNav wants the FCC to reconfigure the 902-928 MHz band to grant them exclusive rights to the majority of the spectrum. The country&#39;s airwaves are separated into different sections for different devices to communicate, like dedicated lanes on a highway. This proposal would not only give NextNav their own lane, but expanded operating region, increased broadcasting power, and more leeway for radio interference emanating from their portions of the band. All of this points to more power for NextNav at everyone else’s expense.</span></p>
<p><span>This land-grab is purportedly to implement a Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) network to serve as a US-specific backup of the Global Positioning System(GPS). This plan raises red flags off the bat. </span></p>
<p><span>Dropping the “global” from GPS makes it far less useful for any alleged national security purposes, especially as it is likely susceptible to the same jamming and spoofing attacks as GPS.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10416238018537/1"><span>NextNav itself</span></a><span> </span><span>admits there is also little commercial demand for PNT. GPS works, is free, and is widely supported by manufacturers. If Nextnav has a grand plan to implement a new and improved standard, it was left out of their FCC proposal. </span></p>
<p><span>What NextNav did include however is its intent to resell their exclusive bandwidth access to mobile 5G networks. This isn&#39;t about national security or innovation; it&#39;s about a rent-seeker monopolizing access to a public resource. If NextNav truly believes in their GPS backup vision, they should look to parts of the spectrum already allocated for 5G.</span></p>
<h2><span>Stifling the Future of Open Communication</span></h2>
<p><span>The open sections of the 900 MHz spectrum are vital for technologies that foster experimentation and grassroots innovation. Amateur radio operators, developers of new IoT devices, and small-scale operators rely on this band.</span></p>
<p><span>One such project is </span><a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/"><span>Meshtastic</span></a><span>, a decentralized communication tool that allows users to send messages across a network without a central server. This new approach to networking offers resilient communication that can endure emergencies where current networks fail.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the type of innovation that actually addresses crises raised by Nextnav, and it’s happening in the part of the spectrum allocated for unlicensed devices while empowering communities instead of a powerful intermediary. Yet, this proposal threatens to crush such grassroots projects, leaving them without a commons in which they can grow and improve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t just about a set of frequencies. We need an ecosystem which fosters grassroots collaboration, experimentation, and knowledge building. Not only do these commons empower communities, they avoid a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/crowdstrike-antitrust-and-digital-monoculture"><span>technology monoculture</span></a><span> unable to adapt to new threats and changing needs as technology progresses.</span></p>
<p><span>Invention belongs to the public, not just to those with the deepest pockets. The FCC should ensure it remains that way.</span></p>
<h2><span>FCC Must Protect the Commons</span></h2>
<p><span>NextNav’s proposal is a direct threat to innovation, public safety, and community empowerment. While FCC comments on the proposal have closed, </span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/standard?proceeding[name]=24-240"><span>replies remain open</span></a><span> to the public until September 20th. </span></p>
<p><span>The FCC must reject this corporate land-grab and uphold the integrity of the 900 MHz band as a commons. Our future communication infrastructure—and the innovation it supports—depends on it.</span></p>
