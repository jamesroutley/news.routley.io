<section><p>The Mullvad Browser is a privacy-focused web browser developed in a collaboration between
      Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project. It’s designed to minimize tracking and fingerprinting. You
      could say it’s a Tor Browser to use without the Tor Network. Instead, you can use it with a
      trustworthy VPN. The idea is to provide one more alternative – beside the Tor Network – to
      browse the internet with more privacy. To get as many people as possible to fight the big data
      gathering of today. To free the internet from mass surveillance.

        <p>We want to free the internet from mass surveillance, censorship and big data markets where
          your personal information is up for sale. Our browser and VPN are developed with the same
          goal in mind: to make mass surveillance impractical. But why is it so important?

        <p>Using a VPN alone is not enough to achieve perfect privacy. There’s simply too much data
          being extracted through most browsers. So, Mullvad reached out to the experts on
          privacy-focused browsers: the Tor Project. Learn about the idea behind the collaboration.

        <p>Big tech, authorities, and data brokers can use your IP address, cookies, scripts, and
          browser fingerprints to identify and track you online. Learn more about your unwanted
          followers and why you need a privacy-focused browser to stop them.

        <p>Some browsers are made to map your internet behavior. That’s their business model. Others
          just don’t have enough privacy protection. These are the questions you should ask yourself
          (or even better, the browser provider) before you choose a browser.

    <article><a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser/browser-fingerprinting">
        <p>When you visit a webpage, most browsers give away information about your software and
          device. Combining this information with your other browser data makes it possible to
          create a user profile that can identify you.

        <p>In our world, there’s only one way to reduce the absurd personal data collection of today,
          and it’s a classic: hide in the crowd. Take a look at the modifications and settings of a
          browser with a single purpose and ambition: for all of its users to appear as one.
