Lewis</p><p><strong>Part 2: Serving Sharneth in the face of Lord Bolvedere</strong></p><p>Sharneth&#39;s growth in wisdom has great bearing upon my story, for as Desrek aged, he put Sharneth in charge of his shop. It was a shop such as the large towns have, though not approaching the manner of the shops of the cities! It was the place where a goodwife may buy salt and flour for her baking, and cloth and thread for her sewing. When Sharneth&#39;s work led him to trade in another town, he set me the task of keeping shop in his absence.</p><p><span>These circumstances led to the dreadful day when I faced a neighboring noble, Lord Bolvedere. I still remember his red face, and his heavy form, which he lugged up to the counter. I remember the cringing and the bowing and scraping of his two footmen--one carried his coat, and the other supported his arm. Bolvedere informed me he was there to buy a plot of my master&#39;s land, a goodly stretch of meadow that lay between two parts of Bolvedere’s fields and had a fresh spring. I said, “My master is traveling.”</span></p><p>I said nothing, and so Lord Bolvedere kept talking. A second cold shiver washed over me as I listened to this smarmy fat fool pile word upon word and build phrase upon phrase, to lay a trap for the vulnerable. When the lord finally stopped speaking, he pressed plume and parchment against my hand.</p><p>I often wondered afterward what would have happened if Sharneth himself stood where I did that day. The false sweetness of the Lord&#39;s promises might have lured him in quickly. One poorly-managed deal, one display of weakness, and Bolvedere would be back again and again, like a vulture coming back to the same carcass.</p><p><span>I could not tell the man that he was wrong, nor could I bring a show of strength to bear--I had none. Only weakness could be brought in to play. Fortunately, I had that. I heard my own voice begin speaking almost before my ears caught up with me: &#34;I am not sure I am permitted to do this.&#34; And when I saw the lord’s face, I knew I had spoken a truth that was even truer than I even knew. In my haste, and in my fear, and in my anger, I had forgotten that it was the very law of the land: Manservants and maidservants cannot ratify sales of land.</span></p><p>Fortunately, there was the law and the law was good. Now that I had that certain knowledge, my master’s possession was as safe and secure as a landlocked bay. I could not help with the sale, I said, but offered bread and cheese and ale to Lord Bolvedere and his servants. (The footmen accepted; he did not.) I answered a few questions, and I did not fail to load them up with gifts before they left.</p><p><span>That evening, in the quiet candlelight of the house, I recorded the details of that day in a note for my master, along with my suggestions. I wrote and re-wrote that note, for proffering advice--even to Sharneth who had known me so long--was near to overstepping my authority. But I needn&#39;t have worried. By the time Sharneth returned three days later, the gossip against Lord Bolvedere&#39;s arrogance was so condemning that from pride alone, Sharneth would have refused.</span></p></div></div></div>
