Many types of kiriko are done around Japan, but only two are recognized by the Japanese government: edo-kiriko and satsuma-kiriko from Kyushu, an island on the southwest end of Japan’s archipelago.</p><p>According to the association, the technique was created in 1834 by Kyubei Kagaya, the owner of a glass wholesale company in Edo, who first tried to cut a glass using an abrasive emery powder. But it was Emmanuel Hauptmann, a British engraver invited to the country in the 1880s, who passed on his skills to local artisans.</p></div></div><div><p>In the Meiji Era, the mid-1800s to early 1900s, “after Japan opened up to Western civilization, craftsmen borrowed techniques and machines from the West,” Mr. Hayashi said. So while the basic glass cutting techniques came from England, the patterns incorporated into edo-kiriko are traditional Japanese ones: for example, the dotted nanako (fish eggs) or asa-no-ha (hemp leaves).</p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Saihou edo-kiriko cut glasses.

The result is a surface that shines and reflects the light like a kaleidoscope. The glasses are then distributed to department stores around Japan and the rest of Asia, and also sold directly on the company’s online shop.</p><p>“My grandfather was the founder; he used to work in a glass company in Tokyo, but came to Saitama to start his own business,” said Mr. Hayashi, 31. Initially the business produced a variety of glass products, but it became specialized in edo-kiriko in 1991, around the time Mr. Hayashi was born. “The edo-kiriko industry is very small, it consists of mainly family businesses, but my grandfather ran his business like a regular company, hiring outside craftsmen,” he said.</p><p>According to Mr. Hayashi, there are only 70 to 80 edo-kiriko artisans in Japan today, including those who are not active. Saihou employs 10 artisans, an equal number of men and women (having a staff balanced by gender “is very rare in the industry,” Mr. Hayashi said).</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Kyosuke Hayashi, the president of Mitsuwa Glass Kogei. “In order to be an edo-kiriko craftsman and use that label, you have to reside in the Kanto area of Japan,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>One day in October, I visited the Mitsuwa factory in a residential neighborhood in Saitama Prefecture, about an hour by train from central Tokyo. The large building, the only site the business has ever used, has the factory on the ground floor and the office on the upper level. The factory is divided into workstations and dotted with large crates of glassware; the constant grinding makes the area very noisy.</p></div><div><div><p>The edo-kiriko process starts with mouth-blown glassware obtained from three suppliers in Japan. “It arrives to the factory here as glasses, and we cut them,” Mr. Hayashi said, displaying a purple drinking glass. “The colored glasses are double walled. Outside is purple, but inside is clear glass, so when you cut the patterns, they peek through.”</p><p>The Saihou brand primarily features drinking glasses of various sizes and occasionally bowls or vases, but those usually are reserved for exhibitions. Most of the colors are jewel tones — red, purple and the like — but the brand also produces clear and black items, too. Prices, excluding tax, range from 20,000 to 30,000 yen ($135 to $205).</p><p>Kei Hosokoji, who at 40, is the oldest artisan in the factory and has been working there for 18 years, guided me through the three main steps in the edo-kiriko process: marking, cutting and polishing.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Saihou glasses are arranged during the edo-kiriko process, which results in a surface that shines and reflects the light like a kaleidoscope.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-540138b8">Marking</h2><p>Mr. Hosokoji selected a plain, double-walled glass in cobalt blue for his demonstration. “First, we draw lines on it to create a grid, to be used as guidelines for the cuts to be made,” he said. “The lines will be erased later.”</p></div></div><div><p>Pressing the glass to keep it stable against a rotating roller, an artisan used a pen with an oil-based ink to draw, by eye, a grid of perfectly straight horizontal and vertical lines (later the grid would be wiped away with a piece of wool cloth saturated with cerium oxide.)</p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">A craftsman works on a Saihou glass.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-31c005f3">Cutting</h2><p>“While looking inside the glass, you can cut the pattern” into the exterior, colored glass, he said, as he sat at a table with a vertical spinning blade. Edo-kiriko craftsmen engrave the pattern freehand, just using the grid.</p><p>“We use a diamond blade because glass is very hard,” he said, while he carefully rotated the glass on the blade, creating a sharp diagonal cut. “You have to make sure the pressure is accurate.</p><p>“The first cut can be rough, so you have to smooth it again,” he added, as he changed the blade for a finer cut.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Saihou glasses.

This second polishing was done with silica powder (the material used to make glass), mixed with water to make a paste and applied to the glass with a rubber blade. Once he wiped the paste off the glass, the incisions were revealed, clear and shiny. “It’s a mix of polishing and grinding,” he said.</p><p>One final polishing was done against a blade that looked as if a stack of rugs had been cut into a wheel shape. He applied a paste of cerium oxide and water to the blade, then rubbed the glass against the fast-spinning wheel.</p><p>Then the edo-kiriko glass was ready to be packaged. I tried my hand at cutting a grape pattern, considered to be an easy one, into a clear glass, with Mr. Hosokoji drawing circles on the glass so I could follow his markings. It was extremely difficult to create perfectly round circles and left me wondering how artisans can achieve such complex patterns by eye. And what happens when they make mistakes? “You can’t fix it,” Mr. Hosokoji said. “You have to discard it and recycle it.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Saihou collaborates with the independent watchmaker Daizoh Makihara, who has used edo-kiriko for his watch dials.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>Mitsuwa artisans can produce about 10 pieces per day of their most popular items; its best seller is a set of two small glasses with a bamboo-leaf design, priced at ¥22,000. “In a month we make about 2,000 pieces in varying shapes and sizes,” Mr. Hayashi, the president, said. “We wish we could make more, we want to hire more craftsmen, but we don’t have enough space in this building.”</p></div><div><div><p>Noyuri Yamada, 38, who has been working at Mitsuwa for 15 years, created the dial for Mr. Makihara’s first watch using the same techniques that the team uses for glassware.</p><p>But, she said, “the dial plates are much thinner” than the glassware. She first tried to use a 0.5-millimeter thick piece of glass for the dial, but finally settled on a 0.8-millimeter one.</p><p>Ms. Yamada drew a grid on the dial plate, as a guideline for cutting. “You have to be very careful about the pressure or the plates might break,” she said. “It’s also difficult to hold them, you have to just softly rest your fingers on each side. Cutting straight lines is also very challenging, as you have to make sure all the lines are symmetrical.”</p><p>The dial used the very intricate kiku-kogame pattern, a combination of chrysanthemum and basket weave, and she cut it successfully on her first try, with no mistakes. “But I broke one plate,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Makihara said he watched her cut the first dial, which took a full day. “I didn’t get bored,” he said. “We’re both artisans, but that’s the only part of the watch I couldn’t make.” Eventually, Ms. Yamada cut a total of eight dials. (Another artisan cut the dials for Mr. Makihara’s second watch.)</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="true">Mr. Makihara’s kikutsunagimon sakura watch.

I was aiming for a goal, so my body was relaxed,” she said. “Also, I used first-grade tools, which helped a lot.”</p><p>But for Mr. Hayashi, it was not about the tools: “Her skills made this possible.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
