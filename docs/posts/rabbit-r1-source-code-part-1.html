    <h1>Rabbit R1 source code [part 1]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/rabbitscam/rabbitr1/blob/main/rabbit.tech">rabbit.tech</a> has been making waves with its highly publicized release of the Rabbit R1 device, claiming it can perform tasks on your behalf and liberate you from app-based interactions. But let&#39;s call a spade a spade â€“ <strong>this is a blatant lie</strong>. And we&#39;re about to expose it with the first partial release of the source code for its so-called &#34;large action model&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those with a technical background, it&#39;s painfully clear that there&#39;s <strong>no artificial intelligence or large action model in sight</strong>. In reality, they&#39;re simply relying on several <strong>Playwright</strong> automation scripts to do the job for you, which is why they only support four apps: Spotify, Midjourney, Doordash, and UberEats.</p>
<p dir="auto">What&#39;s even more alarming is that they ask you to login through their web portal, which is just a virtual machine connected via <strong>NoVNC</strong>. They also expect you to <strong>fill in your private passwords on their VMs</strong>. To make matters worse, they <strong>store the user sessions on their machines</strong> without any additional layers of security. This is both a blatant disregard for user privacy and a hilariously bad engineering practice.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, this shouldn&#39;t come as a shock to anyone who&#39;s done minimal due diligence on the team. After all, they were still hawking NFTs just two years ago.</p>
<p dir="auto">Spread the word and stay vigilant.</p>
