    <h1>Semantic Zoom</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><!-- In these lab notes, we've often explored the itemized environment: a proposed user environment for an OS of the future which is centered around "items" — the *things* of our digital lives: emails, webpages, to-dos, podcast episodes, notes, events, and so forth. -->
<p>In the <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/037/">last lab note</a>, we started to explore how users might construct the interfaces they need with natural gestures. It held a glimpse at semantic zoom in an itemized environment:</p>
<!-- In the last lab note, I shared a version of the
Semantic zoom helps unlock the physicality and fluidity here.

<p>As the email item view gets bigger, the preview text of the email’s contents eventually turns into the fully-rendered email. At smaller sizes, this view makes less sense, so the system can swap it out for the preview text as needed. As seen in previous lab notes, earlier constructions of this environment had two to three view definitions for items (small, large, and full screen). The latest, as seen in this demo, allows for view components within one item view definition to swap out depending on the space available. This allows for the physicality and fluidity that this latest experiment required.</p>
<p>Let’s take this thinking further.</p>
<!-- With the pace graph we might add some notes to our latest run:

[demo]

Here, we've added some notes along the timeline, and to round out our analysis of our pace, we also expanded the elevation from our run <a href="#note1" name="return1" class="muted mono" data-note="1">[1]</a>. -->

<!-- Here we expand some weather detail, and remove stats we don't care about: -->


<!-- We can bring this result into our workout item for a better understanding of pace:

<!-- As we shrink our item back down, it now includes, and summarizes, the new data we've added into it:

[demo] -->




<!-- The broader idea is that we all have unique needs from our interfaces; being able to generate the interfaces we need would allow our software to better serve... -->
