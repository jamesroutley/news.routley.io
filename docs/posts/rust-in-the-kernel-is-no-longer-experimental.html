The topic of the Rust experiment was just discussed at the annual
Maintainers Summit.  The consensus among the assembled developers is that
Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental — it is now a core part of the
kernel and is here to stay.  So the &#34;experimental&#34; tag will be coming off.
Congratulations are in order for all of the Rust for Linux team.

      Ouch.  That is what I get for pushing something out during a meeting, I guess.  That was not my point; the experiment <i>is</i> done, and it was a success.  I meant no more than that.

Huh. I had figured it was a playful attempt at clickbait; it didn&#39;t occur to me that the headline&#39;s double meaning could be an accident.</p></div>

      &gt;  <i>Phoronix would be proud of that headline.</i>

<p>Elitist much?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the low quality user comments on Phoronix and somewhat challenged writing in its news items, the site does provide useful info by way of frequent updates of what&#39;s happening in and around the open source ecosystem.  Its benchmarks have also uncovered problems in the Linux kernel.  In certain ways it&#39;s complementary to LWN&#39;s coverage.

And their benchmark suite is genuinely pretty neat.<br/>

Oh it&#39;s really not that impressive really.  There&#39;s nothing readily available that&#39;s better but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s objectively good.</p></div>

      Phoronix also tends to benchmark in the &#34;dumb but obvious&#34; way - just follow the instructions, don&#39;t take the time to understand it in depth and tweak obsessively until it&#39;s as good as it&#39;s going to get. This is useful, because it exposes cases where something is genuinely useful once tweaked into shape, but where the defaults are bad and need fixing.

      Same here - for a second, I thought they were about to rip it all out for v6.20 -&gt; 7.0!
