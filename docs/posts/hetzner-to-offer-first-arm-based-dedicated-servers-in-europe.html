                                <h3>RX-Line: Pushing the envelop of parallelization</h3>
                                
                                <p>The new RX-line is now available and features the first Arm-based dedicated servers in Europe. The servers house an Ampere ® Altra ® Q80-30 SoC with Arm64 architecture, which gives you 80 cores of single-threaded processing power.</p><p>The new line includes two models. The RX170 is the smaller model of the two, but it still comes with 128 GB DDR4 registered ECC memory modules and 2x 960 GB NVMe SSD at the low price of € 169 a month and € 179 setup fee. The RX220, on the other hand, comes with impressive 256 GB DDR4 registered ECC memory modules and 2 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD at the fair price of € 219 a month and a setup fee of € 229.</p><p>Where is the catch, you wonder? Only a few servers are currently available. As we work through ramping the supply chain for the RX Line, be the first to get an Ampere-based server.  Over the next few months, expect further announcements of improved availability as we scale out this exciting product line.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Order yours now, and start saving time and money on your IT infrastructure.</p><p><a href="http://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/matrix-rx">Check it out now</a></p><p>All prices excl. VAT.</p>
