      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Growing up I always enjoyed tech and was excited for all the problems tech can solve and all the improvements it can make and has made in my life. However, recently I had to check-in into a doctors office using a 3rd party software and the process is incredibly worse for the patient. Normally, I walk in, tell them my name and sit down. Now on my phone, I have to enter my DOB, answer a few questions, &#34;Accept&#34; some consent forms every time. They will not see me if I don&#39;t use the system. Then, at the end I am greeted with an advertisement for a medication.<p>Another one, recently had to call comcast as they were charging my parents $70 for what they are offering for $20, I play the call of &#34;i want to cancel it is too expensive, AT&amp;T cheaper&#34;. They recently &#34;improved&#34; their phone bot and added some &#34;amazing&#34; features. I am saying I want to cancel service/speak to customer service, and this thing goes and tells me it is restarting my modem.......then for the next 15 minutes I cannot reach anyone at comcast because my modem is restarting, every time I call I was getting, &#34;We are restarting your modem call us back later GOODBYE!&#34;......I swear things like this just make me want to go live off-grid somewhere.</p></td></tr>
