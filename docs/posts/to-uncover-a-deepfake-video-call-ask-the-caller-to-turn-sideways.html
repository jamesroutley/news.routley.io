<p>An ontologist can bridge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> domain expertise and software development via production of</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a semi-informal so-called <em>intermediate representation</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that can be understood by
domain experts, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a formal ontology / knowledge graph that represents the domain in a machine-actionable way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When you do software development, you want to take the human out of the loop as much as possible
– really automate it, least amount of manual effort, just minimize that…When I explain to
[developers] that an ontology or knowledge graph [is] basically an ontologist talking to
stakeholders and making sure that all the implicit knowledge they have is expressed in an explicit
structural format that systems can also read…a light bulb [is] lit in their head, like “Oh…so it
means we do not have to talk to stakeholders?”…Yes!…You can basically have the ontologist talk
to the stakeholders and put it into a format that you just query.&#34;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you switch-hit as both a domain expert and a developer, “a little semantics goes a long way”
– developing competence in and discipline towards producing intermediate representations can
increase your capacity to effectively collaborate/delegate and thus increase professional impact.</p>
