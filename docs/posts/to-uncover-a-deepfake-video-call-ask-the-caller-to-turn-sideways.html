We asked Sensity’s CEO and Chief Scientist Giorgio Patrini if the experiments and tests included the subject making 90° turns from camera as part of the deception technique, and he confirmed<span><sup>†</sup></span> that they did not.</p><p>We also asked him if he considers that there is any possible merit in soliciting profile views as an anti-deepfake measure during videoconferencing calls. Patrini responded:</p><p><i>‘Lateral views of people faces, when used as a form of identity verification, may indeed provide some additional protection against deepfakes. As pointed out, the lack of widely available profile view data make the training of deepfake detector very challenging.<span> </span></i></p><p><i>‘Additionally, I’d argue that most state of the art deepfake software simply fails if applied for faceswapping or re-enacting faces fully rotated on their side. This is because deepfake software needs to accurately detect faces and their landmarks on the target video; profile views make this more difficult as the detector has to work with only half of the facial key points.<span> </span></i></p><p><i>‘Indeed, one tip for performing deepfake detection “by eye” today is to check whether one can spot face artefacts or flickering while a person is turning completely to their side — where it’s more likely that a face landmarks detector would have failed.’</i></p><p>Further, we asked deepfake expert <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/news/experts/siwei-lyu-faculty-expert-deepfakes-computer-vision.html?par_list_0_start=0"><span>Dr. Siwei Lyu</span></a>, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo School of Engineering and Applied Sciences,<span>  </span>if this ‘lateral’ approach potentially has any value in deepfake detection in a live video scenario. He agreed that it does:</p><p><i>‘The profile is a big problem for current deepfake technologies. The FAN network works extremely well for frontal faces, but not very well for side-on faces.</i></p><p><i>‘The lack of available data is certainly an obstacle. Another aspect is that these algorithms do have a fundamental limitation: the alignment mechanism works well if you cover only part of your face, and is quite robust in those circumstances – but when you turn around, more than half the landmarks are missing.<span> </span></i></p><p><i>‘Probably the best an algorithm can do is to roughly estimate the profile, particularly if the person is enacting various expressions, or taking requests from the other correspondent in a video call, or from an automated liveness detection system.<span> </span></i></p><p><i>‘In a case like that, profile estimation is going to be kind of a ‘guess’, even if you were to have some depth information from some of the more recent sensors in smartphones.’</i></p><p>However, Dr. Lyu believes that the emerging new generation of 3D landmark location systems could improve on FAN’s performance (though FAN itself can also enact 3D landmarks, and is used by DeepFaceLab in this way for ‘full head’ pose capture), but notes that this would not solve the problem of the lack of profile data for ‘non-famous’ people who deepfake attackers might want to train into models for deceptive purposes in a videoconference scenario.</p><p>In the absence of high-quality profile images as source training input, Dr. Lyu does not feel that novel-view synthesis systems such as <a href="https://metaphysic.ai/nerf-successor-deepfakes/"><span>NeRF</span></a>, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Signed Distance Fields (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07109.pdf"><span>SDF</span></a>) are likely to be able to provide the necessary level of inference and detail in order to accurately imitate a person’s profile views – at least, to a level that could stand up to the reasonably high-resolution capabilities of modern smartphone cameras and laptop webcams, which represent the likeliest environments for a deepfake attack.</p><p><i>‘The problem is that you would have to make up information on the basis of inadequate, estimated data.
