The updates range from improvements to our world-class security and reliability that are required by our largest customers, to tools that increase the simplicity and helpfulness desired by smaller teams. The power of our apps running in the cloud is that these enhancements are immediately available to all our customers, increasing the value we deliver.</p><p>Highlights include: </p><ul><li>Tools to help people connect with their customers, including <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/blog-post.html">appointment scheduling</a>, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/new-integrated-marketing-tools-for-gmail.html">email marketing in Gmail</a>, and soon e-signature support in Drive.</li><li><a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/how-google-workspace-is-delivering-innovation-for-the-future-of-hybrid-work">Features in Meet and Chat</a> that make it easier for hybrid workers to connect, create, and collaborate from anywhere.</li><li>Built-in, AI-powered data and threat protection capabilities, including <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/01/categorize-content-and-enhance-content.html">automated classification</a> and <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/google-drive-trust-rules-open-beta.html">Trust Rules</a> in Drive, and phishing and malware protections in <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/invitations-from-known-senders-only-google-calendar.html">Calendar</a> and <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/04/warning-banners-for-suspicious-docs-sheets-slides-files.html">Drive</a>. </li></ul><p>Today, we’re announcing a few updates to our pricing to reflect the value in our products, alongside expanded commitment options to lock in the lowest pricing, providing our customers with more choice. </p><p>First in our updates, we are introducing an <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1247364">Annual Plan</a> option for all editions available through our website. Annual Plans are great for organizations ready to commit to a longer-term agreement, and allow customers the ability to lock in the lowest per-user price. </p><p>Second, we are increasing the price of Flexible Plan subscriptions. Flexible Plans offer customers the option to pay as they go, with no commitment, and provide customers the option to add or delete user accounts at any time, offering added flexibility for businesses with a variable-size workforce. Starting March 14, 2023, new customers will be able to sign up for the new Annual Plan purchase option through our website, and existing customers on the Flexible Plan can switch to the Annual Plan in the Admin Console. The updated list prices for Google Workspace Business editions will be:</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><u>Workspace Edition</u></p></td><td><p>              <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1247362">Flexible Plan</a></p></td><td><p>                   <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1247364">Annual Plan </a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Business Starter</b></p></td><td><p>              <strike>$6.00</strike> $7.20 USD</p></td><td><p>                   $6.00 USD</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Business Standard</b></p></td><td><p>              <strike>$12.00</strike> $14.40 USD</p></td><td><p>                   $12.00 USD</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Business Plus</b></p></td><td><p>              <strike>$18.00</strike> $21.60 USD</p></td><td><p>                   $18.00 USD</p></td></tr></tbody></table><i>* All pricing is per user, per month.</i></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Third, we are increasing the price of Google Workspace Enterprise Standard to reflect the value we’ve added to the edition, including <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7284269?hl=en">industry-leading security controls and administrative features</a> designed for large enterprises. There are no list price changes to the other Enterprise editions, including education upgrades. Customers should connect with their account managers if they have questions.<br/></p><p>To give our existing partners and customers sufficient lead time, the new pricing will roll out starting in April of this year and through 2024, depending on factors that include number of user licenses, current contract terms, and payment plan. For example, pricing for existing Google Workspace subscriptions with <u>10 or fewer user licenses</u> will not change until January 2024. Customers will be notified via the Google Workspace Admin Console at least 30 days before their price changes take effect and provided with more specific information to help them navigate these changes. </p><p>Finally, alongside these changes, we are also adjusting some local currency pricing, something we evaluate periodically to maintain alignment with the exchange rates to the US dollar. Customers that will be impacted by any foreign exchange adjustments will be notified in advance of these changes. </p><p>Google Workspace delivers incredible value to teams and organizations of all sizes at a competitive price, and we’re committed to delivering flexibility and choice to customers. In the coming months, you will see us invest in additional innovation that extends the power of AI to help people create and connect safely.</p></span></section><section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements" data-g-event="tag list: body" data-g-action="product announcements" data-g-label="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements">Product Announcements</a></li><li><a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/inside-google-workspace" data-g-event="tag list: body" data-g-action="inside google workspace" data-g-label="https://workspace.google.com/blog/inside-google-workspace">Inside Google Workspace</a></li></ul></section></section></div></div></div></div>
