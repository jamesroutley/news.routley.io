<h2 dir="auto">Attack Vector</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">Vulnerable Workflow</h3>
<p dir="auto">The root cause the introduction of a vulnerable <a href="https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/nrwl/nx/pull/32458/hovercard">workflow</a> which contained the possibility for injecting executable code. The vulnerable workflow was reverted in <code>master</code> almost immediately after the team learned it could have been malicious. However, this proved to be inadequate to address the vulnerability.</p>
<p dir="auto">The workflow contained the 2 issues.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">Bash Injection</h4>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="      - name: Create PR message file
        run: |
          mkdir -p /tmp
          cat &gt; /tmp/pr-message.txt &lt;&lt; &#39;EOF&#39;
          ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"><pre>      - <span>name</span>: <span>Create PR message file</span>
        <span>run</span>: <span>|</span>
<span>          mkdir -p /tmp</span>
<span>          cat &gt; /tmp/pr-message.txt &lt;&lt; &#39;EOF&#39;</span>
<span>          ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The intention of these lines was to write pull request titles and bodies to a file which would then be validated via our commit format checks.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, if a PR was opened with a title such as <code>$(echo &#34;You&#39;ve been compromised&#34;)</code> the code would be executed within the workflow. We understood this once it was reported but we did not fully understand how this would compromise any secrets because the PR title validation workflow itself did not have access to any secrets.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">Elevated Permissions via <code>pull_request_target</code></h4>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]"><pre><span>on</span>:
  <span>pull_request_target</span>:
    <span>types</span>: <span>[opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>pull_request_target</code> trigger (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target">Github Docs</a>) was used as a way to trigger the action to run whenever a PR was created or modified. However, what was missed is the warning that this trigger, unlike the standard <code>pull_request</code> trigger, runs workflows with elevated permissions including a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> which has read/write repository permission. Furthermore, the workflows are executed on the target repo of the PR (<code>nrwl/nx</code>) which means that the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> had permissions for the <code>nrwl/nx</code> repo. In addition, the workflow is run using the version of the workflow available on the target branch which is not necessarily <code>master</code>. We believe that the PR was made targeting an outdated branch which still contained the vulnerable workflow despite the fact that the vulnerable workflow was removed from <code>master</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We believe the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> from this workflow was utilized to trigger another workflow, the <code>publish.yml</code> workflow.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">How the NPM token was compromised</h3>
<p dir="auto">Up until this point, the team believed that although the PR validation workflow was vulnerable, it didn&#39;t contain any secrets. The vulnerable pipeline was just a means to trigger our <code>publish.yml</code> pipeline which does indeed have the npm token which was used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>publish.yml</code> pipeline, is our most permissive pipeline. It is responsible for publishing the Nx packages and therefore has access to the npm token via a Github Secret. As such, we took great care at least within the pipeline itself that ONLY our team was able to utilize the pipeline. As recommended, our github secrets are only accessible within pipelines triggered on <code>nrwl/nx</code> and they are not accessible from any forks keeping it safe from external contributors.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, because of the elevated permissions from the PR validation workflow, the <code>publish.yml</code> workflow was triggered to run on the <code>nrwl/nx</code> repo. Additional changes were made in the <a href="https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/3905475cfd0e0ea670e20c6a9eaeb768169dc33d">malicious commit</a> which altered the behavior of the <code>publish.yml</code> pipeline to send the npm token to a webhook. As part of the bash injection, the PR validation workflows triggered a run of the <code>publish.yml</code> with this malicious commit and sent our npm token to an unfamiliar webhook. We believe this is how the user got a hold of the NPM token used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: The <code>publish.yml</code>  workflow did not publish packages in this incident but was the means to obtain the NPM token.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Malicious Behavior</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">Credentials published as a Github repo</h3>
<p dir="auto">The compromised package contained a <code>postinstall</code> script that scanned user&#39;s file system for text files, collected paths, and credentials upon installing the package. This information was then posted as an encoded string to a github repo under the user&#39;s Github account. The Github repo would be posted with a name which contains <code>s1ngularity-repository</code>. Github has since started to deactivate or archive these repos on their end. If you see that you have this repo, even though it may be archived now, at one point it was likely public meaning credentials in there could have been compromised.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Modification to <code>$HOME/.zshrc</code> and <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">The malicious <code>postinstall</code> script also modified the <code>.zshrc</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include <code>sudo shutdown -h 0</code> which prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shutdown the machine immediately.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">How the <code>postinstall</code> may be triggered</h3>
<p dir="auto">The most obvious way the <code>postinstall</code> is triggered is manually running <code>npm install</code>, <code>yarn</code>, or <code>pnpm install</code> in a repo with the compromised version in the <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are many less obvious ways NPM modules could get installed. Transitive dependencies, AI agents, editors, other editor extensions, other scripts are the first that come to mind but there are many many less obvious reasons why NPM modules might get installed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some users reported to the team that despite not having any workspaces which utilized Nx, they found that they had been affected. The team dug into how this was possible and found that Nx Console, our IDE extension, installs the <code>latest</code> version of <code>nx</code> to check the latest version of Nx. Because this installed <code>nx</code>, the malicious <code>postinstall</code> was effectively triggered by opening an editor with the Nx Console extension. So, if you have the Nx Console extension installed in your editor and launched it while the malicious versions of <code>nx</code> were tagged at <code>latest</code> (between August 26th 6:37 PM - 10:44 PM EDT) you may have been compromised as well. Best to check if a Github repo was created on your account.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not malicious behavior on its own but, a new Nx Console version has been released which no longer does this check. Again, this is just one of the many ways which NPM modules could be installed without being intentionally triggered by the user.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Timeline</h2>
<p dir="auto">All of the following times are in EDT.</p>
<p dir="auto">August 21, 2025 - Introduction of the vulnerability</p>
<p dir="auto">August 22, 2025 - Inadequate resolution of the vulnerability</p>
<p dir="auto">August 24, 2025 - Exploitation of the vulnerability</p>
<p dir="auto">August 26, 2025 - Escalation of the vulnerability and first response</p>
<p dir="auto">August 27, 2025 - Remediation and further investigation</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Immediate Actions Required</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">For all users, check if you were impacted</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Check this <a href="https://github.com/%5BGithubSlug%5D?tab=repositories&amp;q=s1ngularity-repository">https://github.com/[GithubSlug]?tab=repositories&amp;q=s1ngularity-repository</a> to see if your a repo was published to your Github account.</li>
<li>Download the file in the repo for your own records.</li>
<li>Then, remove the repo from GitHub.</li>
<li>E-mail <a href="mailto:security@nrwl.io">security@nrwl.io</a> and we will instruct you on how to decode the file so you are aware what information was leaked</li>
<li>Rotate your credentials and tokens on all of your accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="auto">For all users, stop using the malicious versions</h3>

<h3 dir="auto">For Users Who were compromised:</h3>
<p dir="auto">Refer to the section above to see if you were compromised. If so, do the following.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rotate npm tokens:</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/</a> and rotate your tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Rotate Github Tokens:</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.github.com/">https://www.github.com/</a> and rotate your tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Change Github Credentials:</strong> Change passwords for Github</li>
<li><strong>Change your passwords</strong> for any other services you use.</li>
<li><strong>Check your <code>.zshrc</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> files</strong> for any unfamiliar lines and remove them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Preventative measures implemented before the incident</h2>
<p dir="auto">We had several preventative measures in place before the incident some of which include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>2FA Enforcement:</strong> All maintainers under the nrwl org had to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. (2FA was not required to publish but it was required to login to the accounts)</li>
<li>Provenance was attached to recent versions of Nx
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of <code>nx</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Remediation and Preventative Measures Taken</h2>
<p dir="auto">We have taken the following actions to remediate this issue, prevent further issues, also ensure validity of future packages.</p>
<ul>
<li> Deprecated all malicious package versions</li>
<li> Restored <code>21.4.1</code> (a valid version) as <code>latest</code></li>
<li> Revoked possibly compromised personal account access, even though single compromised token seems most likely at this time</li>
<li> Rotated all team NPM and GitHub tokens</li>
<li> Audit GitHub and NPM activities across the organization for suspicious activities</li>
<li> Updated Publish access for <code>nx</code> to require 2FA or automation</li>
<li> Posted this advisory</li>
<li> The <code>nx</code> package now requires <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#supported-cicd-providers" rel="nofollow">Trusted Providers</a> methodology of publishing via our <code>.github/publish.yml</code> workflow in the <code>nrwl/nx</code> repo.</li>
<li> Remove NPM tokens from our pipeline now that we&#39;re using Trusted Providers on NPM</li>
<li> All NPM packages under Nx (the company) including <code>nx</code> have been set to require 2FA and cannot be published with access tokens</li>
<li> All Github secrets on the <code>nrwl/nx</code> repo have been rotated. If any other secrets were compromised, they are no longer valid.</li>
<li> We are continuing to assess how if any other malicious activity was done with the other secrets we have in Github but have not found any further malicious activity at this time.</li>
<li> All branches containing the vulnerable pipeline on <code>nrwl/nx</code> have been updated to not have the vulnerable pipeline.</li>
<li> The nx repo now also will require team members to approve workflows triggered by external contributors. This will block workflows unknown to us from slipping through.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This advisory will be updated when there is more information available.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p dir="auto">Along with the preventative measures we have now put in place, the team has learned many valuable lessons from this incident. The team will soon retrospect on this incident, formulate the lessons we have learned, and share those with the community.</p>
