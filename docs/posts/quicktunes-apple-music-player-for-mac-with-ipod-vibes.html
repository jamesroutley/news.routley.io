				<p>QuickTunes is a simple and fast Apple Music client for macOS. It aims to bring the
						simplicity of music players from the early 2000s like the iPod to your Mac. With QuickTunes, you
						can easily drill into your playlists, albums, artists, and songs, pick something, and press
						Play.

					<p>The app is optimized to make navigating your music library a breeze with buttery smooth
						scrolling, keyboard navigation, and multi-touch gestures. The beautiful floating player makes it
						easy to control the currently-playing song, skip songs, shuffle, repeat, and more.</p>

					<p>As you resize the app&#39;s main window, the layout adapts dynamically, so whether you prefer a
						simple iPod-style layout or a multi-pane window, there&#39;s something for you. You can further
						customize the appearance of the app to suit your liking in the Settings window.</p>
