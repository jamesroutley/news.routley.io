    <h1>How to Lead in a Room Full of Experts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>Here is a realization I made recently. I&#39;m sitting in a room full of smart people. On one side are developers who understand the ins and outs of our microservice architecture. On the other are the front-end developers who can debug React in their sleep. In front of me is the product team that has memorized every possible user path that exists on our website. And then, there is me. The lead developer. I don&#39;t have the deepest expertise on any single technology.</p>

<p>So what exactly is my role when I&#39;m surrounded by experts? Well, that&#39;s easy. I have all the answers.</p>

<h2>Technical Leadership</h2>

<p>OK. Technically, I don&#39;t have all the answers. But I know exactly where to find them and connect the pieces together. </p>

<p>When the backend team explains why a new authentication service would take three weeks to build, I&#39;m not thinking about the OAuth flows or JWT token validation. Instead, I think about how I can communicate it to the product team who expects it done &#34;sometime this week.&#34; When the product team requests a &#34;simple&#34; feature, I&#39;m thinking about the 3 teams that need to be involved to update the necessary microservices.</p>

<p>Leadership in technical environments isn&#39;t about being the smartest person in the room. It&#39;s about being the most effective translator.</p>

<h3>Leading is a Social Skill</h3>

<p>I often get &#34;eye rolls&#34; when I say this to developers: You are not going to convince anyone with facts. In a room full of experts, your technical credibility gets you a seat at the table, but your social skills determine whether anything productive happens once you&#39;re there.</p>

<p>Where ideally you will provide documentation that everyone can read and understand, in reality, you need to talk to get people to understand. People can get animated when it comes to the tools they use. When the database team and the API team are talking past each other about response times, your role isn&#39;t to lay down the facts. Instead it&#39;s to read the room and find a way to address technical constraints and unclear requirements. It means knowing when to let a heated technical debate continue because it&#39;s productive, and when to intervene because it&#39;s become personal.</p>

<h3>Leading is Remembering the Goal</h3>

<p>When you are an expert in your field, you love to dive deep. It&#39;s what makes you experts. But someone needs to keep one eye on the forest while everyone else is examining the trees.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve sat through countless meetings where engineers debated the merits of different caching strategies while the real issue was that we hadn&#39;t clearly defined what &#34;fast enough&#34; meant for the user experience. The technical discussion was fascinating, but it wasn&#39;t moving us toward shipping.</p>

<p>As a leader, your job isn&#39;t to have sophisticated technical opinions. It&#39;s to ask how this &#34;discussion&#34; can move us closer to solving our actual problem.</p>

<p>When you understand a problem, and you have a room full of experts, the solution often emerges from the discussion. But someone needs to clearly articulate what problem we&#39;re actually trying to solve.</p>

<p>When a product team says customers are reporting the app is too slow, that&#39;s not a clear problem. It&#39;s a symptom. It might be that users are not noticing when the shopping cart is loaded, or that maybe we have an event that is not being triggered at the right time. Or maybe the app feels sluggish during peak hours. Each of those problems has different solutions, different priorities, and different trade-offs. Each expert might be looking at the problem with their own lense, and may miss the real underlying problem.</p>

<p>Your role as a leader is to make sure the problem is translated in a way the team can clearly understand the problem.</p>

<h3>Leading is Saying &#34;I Don&#39;t Know&#34;</h3>

<p>By definition, leading is knowing the way forward. But in reality, in a room full of experts, pretending to know everything makes you look like an idiot.</p>

<p>Instead, &#34;I don&#39;t know, but let&#39;s figure it out&#34; becomes a superpower. It gives your experts permission to share uncertainty. It models intellectual humility. And it keeps the focus on moving forward rather than defending ego. It&#39;s also an opportunity to let your experts shine.</p>

<p>Nothing is more annoying than a lead who needs to be <a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/when-the-manager-gets-all-the-credit">the smartest person in every conversation</a>. Your database expert spent years learning how to optimize queries - let them be the hero when performance issues arise. Your security specialist knows threat models better than you, give them the floor when discussing architecture decisions.</p>

<p>Make room for some productive discussion. When two experts disagree about implementation approaches, your job isn&#39;t to pick the &#34;right&#34; answer. It&#39;s to help frame the decision in terms of trade-offs, timeline, and user impact.</p>

<p>Your value isn&#39;t in having all the expertise. It&#39;s in recognizing which expertise is needed when, and creating space for the right people to contribute their best work. </p>

<h3>The Translation Challenge</h3>

<p>There was this fun blog post I read recently about how non-developers <a href="https://anniemueller.com/posts/how-i-a-non-developer-read-the-tutorial-you-a-developer-wrote-for-me-a-beginner">read tutorials written by developers</a>. What sounds natural to you, can be complete gibberish to someone else. As a lead, you constantly need to think about your audience. You need to learn multiple languages to communicate the same thing:</p>

<p><strong>Developer language:</strong> &#34;The authentication service has a dependency on the user service, and if we don&#39;t implement proper circuit breakers, we&#39;ll have cascading failures during high load.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>Product language:</strong> &#34;If our login system goes down, it could take the entire app with it. We need to build in some safeguards, which will add about a week to the timeline but prevent potential outages.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>Executive language:</strong> &#34;We&#39;re prioritizing system reliability over feature velocity for this sprint. This reduces risk of user-facing downtime that could impact revenue.&#34;</p>

<p>All three statements describe the same technical decision, but each is crafted for its audience. Your experts shouldn&#39;t have to learn product speak, and your product team shouldn&#39;t need to understand circuit breaker patterns. But someone needs to bridge that gap.</p>

<h2>Beyond &#34;Because, that&#39;s why!&#34;</h2>

<p><img src="https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/556/why.jpg" alt="Because that&#39;s why meme"/></p>

<p>&#34;I&#39;m the lead, and we are going to do it this way.&#34; That&#39;s probably the worst way to make a decision. That might work in the short term, but it erodes trust and kills the collaborative culture that makes expert teams thrive.</p>

<p>Instead, treat your teams like adults and communicate the reason behind your decision:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;We&#39;re choosing the more conservative approach because the cost of being wrong is high, and we can iterate later.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I know this feels like extra work, but it aligns with our architectural goals and will save us time on the next three features.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;This isn&#39;t the most elegant solution, but it&#39;s the one we can ship confidently within our timeline.&#34;</li>
</ul>

<p>The more comfortable you become with not being the expert, the more effective you become as a leader.</p>

<p>When you stop trying to out-expert the experts, you can focus on what expert teams actually need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear problem definitions</li>
<li>Context for decision-making</li>
<li>Translation between different perspectives</li>
<li>Protection from unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>Space to do their best work</li>
</ul>

<p>Your role isn&#39;t to have all the answers. It&#39;s to make sure the right questions get asked, the right people get heard, and the right decisions get made for the right reasons.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Technical leadership in expert environments is less about command and control, and more about connection and context. You&#39;re not the conductor trying to play every instrument. You&#39;re the one helping the orchestra understand what song they&#39;re playing together.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a much more interesting challenge than trying to be the smartest person in the room.</p>
