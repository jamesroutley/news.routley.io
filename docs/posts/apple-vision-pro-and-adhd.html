    <h1>Apple Vision Pro and ADHD</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Apple Vision Pro reminds me that computers have become too efficient.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently typing this blog post in a floating window in the middle of
snow-covered Yosemite. I am a floating body manifested into the transcendental
Tim Cook matrix. I look into the sky and follow the soft clouds as they pass
overhead. They slowly part, revealing Steve Jobs&#39; smiling face watching over me
from the heavens above. I am merely one more thing.</p>
<p>When I walked into the Apple Store yesterday, the first question I had for the
assistant was the return policy on Apple Vision Pro. I have about 13 days left
to decide if this thing is worth $3,500. My early conclusion is that if you&#39;re
an enthusiast for entertainment and you have a lot of money to spend on it, the
Apple Vision Pro might be for you. Even the folks at the Apple Store seemed
convinced that &#34;entertainment&#34; is the current selling point of this device.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t fall into that category, so I&#39;m currently trying to figure out what the
hell to use it for.</p>
<p>I tried watching a YouTube video placed over my countertop while making coffee.
The display quality is stunning, but the video pass-through is starkly
disappointing—granted, it&#39;s probably the best there is, but the world around me
appears grainy and poorly-lit. On top of that, I&#39;m definitely a bit clumsier
with my hands.</p>
<p>iPad apps also feel clumsy. In visionOS, buttons highlight as your eyes pass
over them, indicating they&#39;re selected. This does not always happen in iPad
apps. In Octal (a Hacker News reader), I have to guess whether I&#39;m looking hard
enough at the correct element to bring up the story or the comments. In
Obsidian, pressing the corner buttons to expand the sidebar is nearly
impossible.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m staring at the center of a window, the window edges tend to shimmer as I
move my head around. This tells me visionOS uses higher-quality anti-aliasing
wherever your eyes are focused. Cool performance trick, but human peripheral
vision is highly sensitive to motion, which makes the shimmering somewhat
distracting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I sound pretty underwhelmed by my experience. Perhaps, but the most
exciting thing to me about Apple Vision Pro is that it has flaws like this.
Flaws bring charm to gadgets. They make you use them more selectively and
deliberately. Computers, phones and tablets have gotten boring because there is
no longer such deliberate use—they are always there, able to do anything and
instantly switch tasks as fast as your fingers can move.</p>
<h2>That&#39;s where ADHD comes in</h2><p>It&#39;s not strictly an ADHD problem that technology has gotten unbelievably
distracting. But as someone with ADHD, I feel acutely aware of my relationship
to technology in this way. It is incredibly hard to focus on a single task and
clear my mind of the &#34;itch to screw around&#34; when all the technology around me is
so goddamn fast and easy to use.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what makes Apple Vision Pro interesting for me. Navigating with your eyes
and fingers is (currently) not as fast or easy as using a mouse or a
touchscreen. Positioning windows in 3D space also takes time.</p>
<p>This has an interesting effect. I feel less inclined to mindlessly open and use
apps, because it has become a fundamentally mindful gesture to do so. I actually
have to go out of my way to bring up the Home Screen, launch an app, position it
where I want it, and interact with it by looking directly at it. I can&#39;t do
these things on autopilot.</p>
<p>Putting myself in an &#34;environment&#34; also seems to have the effect of eliminating
distractions from the outside world. I&#39;m not glancing around at the stuff in my
office every time I pause to think.</p>
<p>There is an amusing irony here, the way that strapping a $3,500 computer to my
face is making my interaction with the digital world more deliberate and
mindful.</p>
<p>So, am I going to keep this thing after all?</p>
<p>It&#39;s still a toss-up. I have a decent idea for a productivity app I want to
build for Apple Vision Pro. If I make solid progress on it this week, I might
keep the headset under justification for business.</p>
<p>However, 14 days is unfortunately not enough time for me to decide whether Apple
Vision Pro is a true quality-of-life improvement for an ADHD lifestyle. Maybe
I&#39;m still swept up in the novelty of it all. If I do end up keeping it, I&#39;ll
definitely write a follow-up in the near future. But for this price tag, I can&#39;t
justify the purchase on a &#34;maybe&#34;.</p>
