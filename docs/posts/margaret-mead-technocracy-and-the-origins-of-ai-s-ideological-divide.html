    <h1>Margaret Mead, technocracy, and the origins of AI&#39;s ideological divide</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4 translated="">Discover more from Res Obscura</h4><p>Notes on the history of technology, medicine, science, art, drugs, and empire from UC Santa Cruz history professor Benjamin Breen. Also: using AI in research and teaching.</p><p>Over 2,000 subscribers</p> </div><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p><span>This week may end up being remembered as an inflection point for the social history of AI. I say </span><em>social </em><span>history because the underlying technologies likely won’t change much. What will change — I suspect — is the role that AI tools and AI researchers play in our culture. </span></p><p>That’s because OpenAI’s recent fracturing has brought a larger ideological divide into public view. </p><p><span>As Karen Hao and Charlie Warzel write in a </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt-chaos/676050/" rel="">recent </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt-chaos/676050/" rel="">Atlantic </a></em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt-chaos/676050/" rel="">article</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>[Sam] Altman’s dismissal by OpenAI’s board on Friday was the culmination of a power struggle between the company’s two ideological extremes—one group born from Silicon Valley techno optimism… the other steeped in fears that AI represents an existential risk to humanity and must be controlled with extreme caution.</p></blockquote><p>Part of why I’ve been so fascinated by the drama at OpenAI is that I’ve spent the past five years researching and writing a book that’s partly about how these two ideologies emerged. </p><p><span>That book, </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-Utopia-Margaret-Troubled-Psychedelic/dp/1538722372?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ro067-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=ba347f678c5238772f23489f5065baa6&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" rel="">Tripping on Utopia</a><span>, </span></em><span>centers on the early history of psychedelic science. But the book is also about something bigger: the rise and fall of technological utopianism in the twentieth century, as told through the doomed romance between the anthropologist Margaret Mead and her third husband, Gregory Bateson. </span></p><p>Though Mead was globally famous in her lifetime, I think her historical impact is substantially underrated today. A pioneer not just in anthropology but also in science communication (a teenage Carl Sagan was one of her many fans) Mead was probably the most ambitious and controversial American scientist of her generation. </p><p>She was also, for a time, a leading proponent of what is now often called techno-optimism: the belief that technology will propel our species toward a transcendent new state by expanding human potential. Mead thought those changes were impossible to predict with any certainty. She just knew they were coming, and that she wanted to be part of them. </p><p><span>If humanity was to survive the twentieth century, Mead </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/fromsouthseasstu0000marg/page/n35/mode/2up?q=%22towards+a+more+ordered+heterogeneity%22" rel="">wrote</a><span> in July of 1939, we needed “to envisage a world in which new social inventions will permit us to draw upon human potentialities as never before... to build a world which shall be as new in the ordered interplay given to man’s myriad gifts as the present world is new in the technological utilization of physical resources.” The alternative, she wrote, was “a frightened retreat to some single standard which will waste nine-tenths of the potentialities of the human race in order that we may have a too dearly purchased security.”</span></p><p><span>Part of why Mead is so intriguing is not just that she was saying this kind of thing back in the 1930s. It’s that, after World War II, she </span><em>also</em><span> became a prominent theorist of existential risk. </span></p><p>In other words: the same person helped inspire the two supposedly opposed schools of thought that are battling it out in AI research today. </p><p><span>After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mead and Bateson dedicated themselves to publicizing the existential threat posed by the atomic bomb. In speeches, articles, and radio appearances, they argued that the creation of a world government was the only path which could ensure humanity’s survival. Bateson, who was deeply troubled by his wartime experiences in the OSS, the predecessor organization to the CIA, was markedly more pessimistic than Mead about our collective odds. Once, in 1947, Bateson spent the night at J. Robert Oppenheimer’s house. Over breakfast with the physicist’s family, the two men </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rigor_Imagination/yhRiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22the+world+is+moving+in+the+direction+of+hell%22+bateson&amp;dq=%22the+world+is+moving+in+the+direction+of+hell%22+bateson&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="">discussed</a><span> whether “the world is moving in the direction of hell.” They both agreed it was. </span></p><p>What makes Margaret Mead such a complex figure in the history of twentieth-century science is also what makes her relevant for understanding AI in the 2020s. She sought a middle way between the dystopias conjured by Bateson and the naive assumptions of the earliest techno-optimists (more on that below).</p><p><span>In the end, I don’t think she was successful. </span><em>Tripping on Utopia</em><span>’s title</span><em> </em><span>is not just a reference to the psychedelic experience, but an assessment of Mead’s scientific legacy. Throughout her life, she was driven by a burning ambition to create a better world — and, again and again, this ambition led her to overlook the ethical failings of people  close to her. Her life was a case study of the dangers of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism" rel="">longtermism</a><span>.</span></p><p>On the other hand, I can’t help but admire her idealism — or appreciate her timeliness. Flawed as it was, her effort to construct a path toward human flourishing amid the hatred, nationalism, and violence of the twentieth century is all too relevant today. </p><p><span>Below is an excerpt from </span><em>Tripping on Utopia</em><span>. For reasons of space, I ended up cutting it from the final draft of the book. It’s about a young Margaret Mead’s friendship with Howard Scott, the founder of the Technocracy movement, and the ways that technological utopianism manifested in the culture of the 1930s and 1940s United States. It’s been much on my mind as I read the news today. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg" width="739" height="374" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:374,&#34;width&#34;:739,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;11_technocracy&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;11_technocracy&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="11_technocracy" title="11_technocracy" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F320ade45-7167-4ebd-9146-4683d5e6d584_739x374.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>In 1933, the cartoonist Winsor McCay depicted Technocracy as a rapacious, autonomous machine (</span><a href="https://biblioklept.org/2013/09/16/technocracy-winsor-mccay/" rel="">via</a><span>).</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p><span>Howard Scott and Margaret Mead were similar, and they knew it. She </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/blackberrywinter0000unse_d8k3/mode/2up?q=%22endlessly+inventive+and+prophetic%22" rel="">remembered</a><span> him in her autobiography </span><em>Blackberry Winter</em><span> as “an extraordinary person... endlessly inventive and prophetic” who “made a great contribution… to my thinking.” </span></p><p><span>They shared the same galvanizing power of conjuring new futures. And they shared the same failings. If Mead was a genius, her genius manifested in her ability to push groups of people toward some larger goal which they found, to their surprise, that they were now able to achieve.  “Margaret seemed to live in a field of force that could combat anything nature had to offer,” Robert Jay Lifton recalled.</span><span> Sometimes, though, her “self-critical faculties would desert her” and she would spin out into extravagant speculation. Mead’s flirtation with Scott’s Technocracy movement was one such example.</span></p><p><span>A so-called “mystery man” with “Utopian dreams” and a penchant for double-breasted suits, Scott was like an Ayn Rand character come to life. His mysterious origin story provided much of his appeal. According to one article, Scott surfaced in 1920s Manhattan as a furniture wax salesman and unconventional engineer, “one of the many loquacious habitues of the candle-lit gathering places of New York’s Bohemia—Greenwich Village.”</span><span> As the Great Depression began, Scott emerged as the leader of a movement which claimed that engineers could leverage technological automation to eradicate poverty. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png" width="604" height="568" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:568,&#34;width&#34;:604,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:231800,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc171f79-58a4-4221-a9c3-73daa5719d59_604x568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Detail from an article on Technocracy that appeared in the December 31, 1932 issue of </span><em>The Winnipeg Evening Tribune</em><span>.

Despite his outlandish goal of leading the creation of a continent-spanning “Technate,” Scott seemed never to have traveled beyond the eastern half of the United States. More damagingly, he had no professional training as an engineer. </p><p><span>Mead </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/blackberrywinter0000unse_d8k3/page/218/mode/2up?q=%22At+the+height+of+his+notoriety%2C+Howard%22" rel="">recalled in her memoirs</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>At the height of his notoriety, Howard was attacked as an impostor who made all sorts of false claims about his activities and his training. In fact, he had only completed the ninth grade, but his prevision of the electronic revolution was extraordinary. His lack of mastery of the intermediate steps was one of his great handicaps and perhaps also the very vividness of his accounts of people he had never met, places he had never seen, and dams he had not built… Had his education matched the scope of his imagination, would he, I have often wondered, have had a profound effect on the country, or was he a forerunner, a man born before his time?</p></blockquote><p>The rise of the New Deal, which included figures once involved in Technocracy, took the wind out of Scott’s sails. After the death of the woman who had introduced them — Scott’s longtime mistress and Mead’s close friend,  Eleanor Steele — Mead distanced herself from his movement. But she still carried elements of his techno-utopian ethos into her later work.</p><p><span>One difference was that Mead thought both bigger and smaller. Scott spoke of vast hydrology projects in which the individual human was invisible. Mead saw nothing </span><em>but</em><span> the human. And she spoke not just to American intellectuals but to the people of the world. True, like Scott, she argued that scientists should work actively to create a new global society.

Though these publications were niche, they were influential. </span><em>Astounding </em><span>was so widely read by the engineers of the Manhattan Project that its editor, John Campbell, claimed to have been able to guess the existence of a secret research center at Los Alamos, New Mexico simply by noting how many of his subscribers had moved there.</span></p><p><span>Margaret Mead was close with many in that group — she counted </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" rel="">John von Neumann</a><span> as a friend, for instance. And if anything, she was even more important in popularizing both the concepts of existential risk and techno-optimism. What sets her treatment of these ideas apart is the degree to which she attempted to turn them into a global project of mass culture.</span></p><p><span>In his epic history of the nineteenth century, </span><em>The Transformation of the World</em><span>, German historian Jürgen Osterhammel argues that the period between 1870 and 1930 was unprecedented in part because “the scale of human mobility sharply increased.” Steamships and railroads, colonial empires and missionaries, telegraphs and telephones began to create modern globalization as we know it. But, Osterhammel notes, although “knowledge of the non-European world increased appreciably in the west” (thanks in part to the first generation of anthropologists and ethnologists) “it yielded no practical consequences.” As late as the 1920s, he argues, “whereas the East borrowed all it could from the West — from legal systems to architecture — no one in Europe or North America thought that Asia or Africa offered a model in anything.”</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>The key difference between Mead and the proto-techno-optimists of the Technocracy movement was this: Margaret Mead believed the model for a future culture </span><em>had to be global</em><span>. It could not be imposed by Western colonial powers (which she opposed) or by scientists alone. It could not be a synthetic culture cooked up in a research lab. Instead, it had to be an interweaving of thousands of different cultural patterns: a truly collective project. </span></p><p>In this, I think she was right. It’s still unclear if the current AI boom really will lead to an Industrial Revolution-level alteration in global society. And even if that transformation does come to pass, it’s even less clear that it will be, on net, a good thing for the majority of the world’s people. But if events do break in that direction, I hope it’s Mead’s skeptical, humane, and cosmopolitan version of the techno-optimist path that wins out. </p><p><span>• Much current writing about artificial intelligence blends together into one of two boring soups: either grifters promising the world alongside 🤯 emojis, or knee-jerk skepticism presented as sage wisdom. </span></p><p><span>’s newsletter </span></p><p><span> never does.
