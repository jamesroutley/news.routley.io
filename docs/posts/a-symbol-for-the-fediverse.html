      <h2>Paste it anywhere</h2>
      <p><span>⁂</span> is a typographical character, not an icon that needs to be inserted as an image. Unique-looking, but standardised. This means it’s very easy to copy-paste around! Its design style also automatically adapts to the font used where you insert it.</p>

      <h2>Written in the stars</h2>
      <p><span>⁂</span> is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography)" target="_blank">asterism</a>. In astronomy, it refers to groups of stars in the sky, akin to constellations. We suggest that it’s a very fitting symbol for the fediverse, a galaxy of interconnected spaces which is decentralised and has an astronomically-themed name. It represents several stars coming together, connecting but each their own, without a centre.</p>

      <h2>The fediverse?</h2>
      <p>The fediverse is a distributed ensemble of social networks and online communities that can all communicate with each other. Together, they form this “federated universe”. It includes social media projects such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://akkoma.social" target="_blank">Akkoma</a>, media sharing platforms such as <a href="https://pixelfed.org" target="_blank">Pixelfed</a> or <a href="https://joinpeertube.org" target="_blank">PeerTube</a>, certain <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> blogs, and many others. If you’re a member of one of those, you can follow and interact with anyone on any other.</p>

      <h2>The need for a symbol</h2>
      <p>Thanks to the interconnected nature of the fediverse, it usually doesn’t matter if someone is a member of one platform or another. What matters is that they can follow each other as part of the fediverse. A single symbol to represent that belonging can often be more relevant than individual icons for each service.</p>
      <p>@ is the symbol for e-mail. # is the symbol for hashtags. ☮ is the symbol for peace. ♻ is the symbol for recycling. <span>⁂</span> can be the symbol for the fediverse.</p>
      <p><span>⁂</span> is standardised as <a target="_blank" href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/2042">Unicode U+2042</a>, making it ready to copy and insert anywhere.</p>

      <img src="https://symbol.fediverse.info/img/icon-pentagram.svg" alt="An icon showing five dots, each connected to the other dots with lines, forming a pentagram-shaped network."/>
      <p>The pentagram icon is the original symbol for the fediverse, created back in 2018 by Dr. Quadragon and Eukombos. It’s a great depiction of the decentralised nature of the fediverse, and has been serving the community well. However, its design is a little too complex to be used at small sizes, as you would in text or in a button. It’s also only available in image form, not as a typographical character.</p>
      <img src="https://symbol.fediverse.info/img/threads-fedivere-white.svg" alt="An icon showing a circle orbited by two lines and two dots."/>
      <p>This other icon was created by Meta in 2024 to represent the fediverse within their product Threads. It incorrectly depicts a centralised network, with a big planet in the middle and the rest around it. We also don’t believe that a large corporation that is joining in as late should be the one defining the iconography for the fediverse.</p>
