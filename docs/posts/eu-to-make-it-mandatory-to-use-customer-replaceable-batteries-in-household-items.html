								<p>Well, it is good. But I&#39;ll wait to celebrate until something happen. There are so many tricks they can do to make this not work. Including replacement batteries costing 1/2 of the initial device price. I don&#39;t think there is a reasonable way to make a generic law limiting all that. A battery may be 1/2 of the device price for real.</p>

								<p>I was mostly speaking about the news article. I&#39;m not a lawyer, so reading a law even in English will not do me any good. I&#39;m sure companies will employ real lawyers that will tell them how to sabotage that law.</p>

								<p>Sorry, I was being very terse because I got caught mid-comment by the need to serve up dinner. EU documents are usually rather wordy, but are straightforward to understand once you get past the wordiness, law degree not required. As I understand it this is early days for this proposal, so the available documents will be less formal and more oriented towards informing policy makers what the proposals are. I&#39;ll see if I can find something later - dessert now.</p>

								<div id="msg_4058476"><p>Sure, I get it. But the lawyers will argue the meaning of common words to the death. It is their literal job. Laws like this need to be paired with strict enforcement and amendments to plug the creative ways manufacturers will find around it. And this is where everyone usually moves on and gives up.</p></div>

								<p>Very few device manufacturers make their own batteries. So somewhere there always going to be different company making these &#39;proprietary&#39; batteries, and an enterprising employee skimming the production line and selling cheaper &#39;OEM&#39; replacements. Probably with management&#39;s blessing. </p>

As for prismatics, I believe L x W x H is still how they are specified, and obviously if the manufacturer decides to specify some odd size there is likely to be a &#34;close enough&#34; standard size to fit.</p></div>
