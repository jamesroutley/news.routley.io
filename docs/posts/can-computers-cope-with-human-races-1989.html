<p>In trying to apply a computer to a task that humans do, we often
discover that it doesn&#39;t work. One common problem is that humans are
able to deal with fuzzy concepts but computers are not -- they need
precise representations and it is hard to represent a fuzzy concept
in a precise way. However, if we look closer at such tasks, we often
discover that the weakness actually lies not in the computer but in
ourselves -- we didn&#39;t understand what we were doing in the first
place.</p>
<p>When faced with a problem of this sort, some people refuse to
recognize the conceptual failure. Instead of seeking a better
representation for the task, they thrash away at making the fuzzy
scheme work, insisting that there is nothing wrong with the
conceptual base. I will illustrate one such problem with a true
story. The central theme is the fuzzy concept of racial and ethnic
classification, as used by the U.S. government and a horde of other
bureaucracies. These organizations have been carrying out elaborate
statistical computations and making major policy decisions based on
this concept for many years and are still doing it, with
problematical results. I begin with my first major encounter with
this scheme, some 25 years ago.</p>
<p><b>White faces in new places. </b>In 1963, after living in
Lexington, Massachusetts for 7 years, my family and I moved to the
Washington D.C. area where I helped set up a new office for Mitre
Corporation. After three days of searching, we bought a house then
under construction in a pleasant new suburb called Mantua Hills, near
Fairfax, Virginia. I hadn&#39;t noticed it during our search, but it soon
became evident that there were nothing but white faces in that area.
In fact, there were nothing but white faces for miles around.</p>
<p>We expected to find some cultural differences and did. For
example, people drove much less aggressively than in Massachusetts.
The first time that I did a Boston-style bluff at a traffic circle,
the other cars yielded! This took all the fun out of it and I was
embarrassed into driving more conservatively.</p>
<p>When I applied for a Virginia driver&#39;s license, I noticed that the
second question on the application, just after “Name,”
was “Race.” When filling out forms, I have always made it
a practice to omit information that I think is irrelevant. It seemed
to me that my race had nothing to do with driving a car, so I left it
blank. When I handed the application to the clerk along with the fee,
he just looked at me, marked “W” in the blank field and
threw it on a stack. I guess that he had learned that this was the
easiest way to deal with outlanders.</p>
<p>It shortly became apparent that on all forms in Virginia, the
second question was “Race,” right after “Name.”
Someone informed me that as far as the Commonwealth of Virginia was
concerned, there were just two races: “white” and
“colored.”  Included in “colored” were
all dark-skinned people, including both kinds of Indians. I felt
uncomfortable with this system, knowing that it was part of a scheme
of legal discrimination that still pervaded the laws of many states.
For example, it was still illegal in Virginia for a “white”
and a “colored” person to marry.</p>
<p>Our contractor was a bit slow in finishing the house. We knew that
there was mail headed our way that was probably accumulating in the
post office, so we put up the mailbox even before the house was
finished. The first day we got just two letters -- from the American
Civil Liberties Union and Martin Luther King&#39;s organization, SCLC. We
figured that this was the postman&#39;s way of letting us know that he
was on to us. Sure enough, the next day we got the rest of our
accumulated mail, a large stack.</p>
<p>When our kids brought forms home from school, I started putting a
“C” after the second question, leaving it to the
authorities to figure out whether that meant “Colored” or
“Caucasian.” I doubt that this actually confused anyone
-- the entire school was lily white.</p>
<p><b>Racing clearance. </b>About this time, my boss and I and
another colleague applied for a special security clearance that we
needed. There are certain clearances that can&#39;t be named in public --
it was one of those. I had held an ordinary Top Secret clearance for
a number of years and had held the un-namable clearance a short time
before, so I did not anticipate any problems. When I filled out my
personal history form, I noticed that question #5 was “Race.”
In the past I had not paid attention to this question; I just
thoughtlessly wrote “Caucasian.” Having been sensitized
by my new environment, I reexamined it.</p>
<p>All of my known forebears came from Europe, mostly from Bavaria
and Bohemia, with a few from England, Ireland, and Scotland. A glance
in the mirror, however, indicated that there was Middle Eastern blood
in my veins. I have a Semitic nose and skin that tans so easily that
I am often darker than many people who pass for Black. Did I inherit
this from a Hebrew, an Arab, a Gypsy or perhaps one of the Turks who
periodically pillaged Central Europe?  Maybe it was from a
Blackfoot Indian that an imaginative aunt thinks was in our family
tree. I will probably never know.</p>
<p>As an arrogant young computer scientist, I believed that if there
is any decision that you can&#39;t figure out how to program, the
question is wrong. I couldn&#39;t figure out how to program racial
classification, so I concluded that there isn&#39;t such a thing. I
subsequently reviewed some scientific literature that confirmed this
impression. “Race” is, at best, a fuzzy concept about
typical physical characteristics of certain populations. At worst, of
course, it provides a basis for more contemptible conduct than any
concept other than religion. In answer to the race question on the
security form, I decided to put “mongrel.” It would have
been slightly less provocative had I said “human,” but
I&#39;ve always enjoyed diddling forms a bit.</p>
<p>Shortly after I handed in the form, I received a call from a
secretary in the security office of the Defense Communications
Agency. She said she had noticed a typographical error in the fifth
question where it said “Mongrel.” She asked if I didn&#39;t
mean “Mongol.” “No thanks,” I said, “I
really meant mongrel.” She ended the conversation rather
quickly.</p>
<p>A few hours later I received a call from the chief security
officer of D.C.A., who I happened to know. “Hey, Les,” he
said in a friendly way, “I&#39;d like to talk to you the next time
you&#39;re over here.” I agreed to see him later that week. When I
got there, he tried to talk me out of answering the race question
“incorrectly.” I asked him what he thought was the right
answer. “You know, Caucasian,” he replied. “Oh, you
mean someone from the Caucasus Mountains of the U.S.S.R.?” I
asked pointedly. “No, you know, white.” “Actually,
I don&#39;t know,” I said.</p>
<p>We got into a lengthy discussion in which he informed me that as
far as the Defense Department was concerned there were five races:
Caucasian, Negro, Oriental, American Indian, and Pacific Islander. I
asked him how he would classify someone who was, by his definition,
7/8 Caucasian and 1/8 Negro. He said he wasn&#39;t sure. I asked how he
classified Egyptians and Ethiopians. He wasn&#39;t sure. I said that I
wasn&#39;t sure either and that “mongrel” seemed like the
best answer for me. He finally agreed to forward my form to the
security authorities but warned that I was asking for trouble.</p>
<p><b>A question of stability. </b>I knew what to expect from a
security background investigation: neighbors and former acquaintances
let you know it is going on by asking “What are they trying to
get you for?” and kidding you about what they told the
investigators. Within a week after my application for the new
clearance was submitted, it became apparent that the investigation
was already underway and that the agents were hammering everyone they
talked to about my “mental stability.” </p>
<p>Gale, the personnel manager where I worked, was interviewed quite
early and came to me saying “My God! They think you&#39;re crazy!
What did you do, rape a polo pony?” He also remarked that they
had asked him if he knew me socially and that he had answered “Yes,
we just celebrated Guy Fawkes Day together.” When the
investigator wanted to know “What is Guy Fawkes Day?” he
started to explain the gun-powder plot but thought better of it. He
settled for the explanation that “It&#39;s a British holiday.”</p>
<p>An artist friend named Linda, who lived two houses away from us,
told my wife that she had no trouble answering the investigator&#39;s
questions about my stability. She said that she recalled our party
the week before when we had formed two teams to “Walk the
plank.” In this game, participants take turns walking the
length of a 2 x 4 set on edge and drinking a small amount of beer.
Anyone who steps off is eliminated and the team with the most total
crossings after some number of rounds wins. Linda said that she
remembered I was one of the more stable participants.</p>
<p>I was glad that she had not remembered my instability at an
earlier party of hers when I broke my watch and bruised my ribs in a
fall off a skateboard. The embarrassing cause of the accident was
that I had run over the bottom of my own toga!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the investigation continued full tilt everywhere I had
lived. After about three months it stopped and a short time later I
learned that the clearance had been granted. The other two people
whose investigations were begun at the same time did not receive
their clearances until several months later. In comparing notes, it
appeared that the investigators did the background checks on my
colleagues in a much more leisurely manner. We concluded that my
application had received priority treatment. The investigators had
done their best to pin something on me and, having failed, gave me
the clearance.</p>
<p>The lesson was clear: if you want a clearance in a hurry, put
something on your history form that will make the investigators
suspicious but that is not damning. They get so many dull backgrounds
to check that they relish the possibility of actually nailing
someone. By being a bit provocative, you draw priority attention and
quicker service.</p>
<p>After I received the clearance, I expected no further effects from
my provocative answer. As it turned out, there was an unexpected
repercussion a year later and an unexpected victory the year after
that. The repercussion turned out to be an odd side effect of a new
computer application.</p>
<p><b>Mongrel in a star-chamber. </b>About a year after I had been
granted the supplementary security clearance, I received a certified
letter directing me to report to the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations at Suitland, Maryland very early in the morning on a
certain day a month later. To one whose brain seldom functions before
10 AM, this was a singularly unappealing trip request.</p>
<p>My wife somehow got me up early on the appointed day and I drove
off in my TR-3 with the top down, even though it was a cold winter
morning. I hoped that the air would stimulate my transition to an
awakened state.</p>
<p>When I arrived and identified myself, I was immediately ushered
into a long narrow room with venetian blinds on one side turned to
block the meager morning light. I was seated on one side of a table
on which there were two goose-neck lamps directed into my eyes. There
was no other light in the room, so I could barely see the three
inquisitors who took positions on the opposite side of the table.</p>
<p>Someone punched on a tape recorder and the trio began taking turns
at poking into my past. They appeared to be trying to convince me
that I was in deep trouble. While the pace and tone of their
questions were clearly aimed at intimidation, they showed
surprisingly little interest in my answers. I managed to stay
relaxed, partly because I was not yet fully awake.</p>
<p>They asked whether I had any association with a certain professor
at San Diego State College, which I had attended for one year. I
recognized his name as being one who was harassed by the House
Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy Era. He was an
alleged Communist. I answered that I did not know him but that I
might have met him socially since he and my mother were on the
faculty concurrently. They wanted to know with certainty whether I
had taken any classes from him. I said that I had not.</p>
<p>They next wanted to know how well I knew Linus Pauling, who they
knew was a professor at Caltech when I was a student there. I
acknowledged that he was my freshman chemistry professor and that I
had visited his home once or twice. I did not mention that Pauling&#39;s
lectures had so inspired me that I decided to become a chemist. It
was not until I took a sophomore course in physical chemistry that I
realized I wasn&#39;t cut out for it.</p>
<p>I recalled that Pauling had been regularly harassed by certain
government agencies during the McCarthy Era because of his leftist
“peacenik” views. He was barred from overseas travel on
occasion and the harassment continued even after he won the Nobel
Prize in chemistry, but seemed to diminish after the second one, the
Peace Prize.</p>
<p>The inquisitors wanted to know how often I got together with one
of my uncles who lived nearby. I acknowledged that we met
occasionally, the last time being a short time earlier when our
families dined together. It sounded as though they thought they had
something on him. I knew him to be a very able person with a
distinguished career in public service. He had been City Manager of
Fort Lauderdale and several other cities and had held a number of
positions in the State Department. It occurred to me that they might
be planning to nail him for associating with a known mongrel.</p>
<p>The questions continued in this vein for hours without a break. I
kept waiting for them to bring up a Caltech acquaintance named Bernon
Mitchell, who had lived in the same student house as me. Mitchell had
later taken a position at the National Security Agency, working in
cryptography, then defected to the Soviet Union with a fellow
employee. They were apparently closet gays. In fact, the inquisitors
never mentioned Mitchell. This suggested that they may not have done
a very thorough investigation. A more likely explanation was that
Mitchell and his boyfriend represented a serious failure of the
security clearance establishment -- one that they would rather not
talk about.</p>
<p>After about three and a half hours of non-stop questioning I was
beginning to wake up. I was also beginning to get riled over their
seemingly endless fishing expedition. At this point there was a short
pause and a rustling of papers. I sensed that they were finally
getting around to the main course. “We note that on your
history form you claim to be a mongrel,” said the man in the
middle. “What makes you think you are a mongrel?”</p>
<p> “That seems to be the best available answer to an
ill-defined question,” I responded.</p>
<p>We began an exchange that was very much like my earlier discussion
with the security officer in the Defense Communications Agency. As
before, I asked how they identified various racial groups and how
they classified people who were mixtures of these “races.”
The interrogators seemed to be taken aback at my asking them
questions. They asked why I was trying to make trouble. I asked them
why they would not answer my questions. When no answers were
forthcoming, I finally pointed out that “It is clear that you
do not know how to determine the race of any given person, so it is
unreasonable for you to expect me to. I would now like to know what
you want from me.”</p>
<p>The interrogators began whispering among themselves. They had
apparently planned to force me to admit my true race and were not
prepared for an alternative outcome. Finally, the man in the center
spoke up saying, “Are you willing to sign a sworn statement
about your race?” “Certainly,” I said. They then
turned up the lights and called for a stenographer. She appeared with
notebook in hand and I dictated a statement: “I declare that to
the best of my knowledge I am a mongrel.” “Don&#39;t you
think you should say more than that,” said the chief
interrogator. “I think that covers it,” I replied. The
stenographer shrugged and went off to type the statement.</p>
<p>With the main business out of the way, things lightened up --
literally. They opened the venetian blinds to let in some sunlight
and offered me a cup of coffee, which I accepted. We had some
friendly conversation, then I signed the typed statement, which was
duly notarized.</p>
<p><b>Punch line. </b>My former tormentors now seemed slightly
apologetic about the whole affair. I asked them what had prompted
this investigation. After some glances back and forth, one of them
admitted that “We were putting our clearance data base on IBM
cards and found that there was no punch for `mongrel&#39;.” I
thought about this for a moment, then asked “Why didn&#39;t you add
a new punch?”  “We don&#39;t have any programmers here”
was the answer. “We got the program from another agency.”</p>
<p>I said, “Surely I am not the only person to give a
non-standard answer. With all the civil rights activists now in
government service, some of them must have at least refused to answer
the race question.”  The atmosphere became noticeably
chillier as one of them answered, with clinched teeth, “You&#39;re
the only one. The rest of those people seem to know their race.”</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that nearly everyone believed in the
concept of racial classification. It appeared that even people who
were victims of discrimination acknowledged it as part of their
identity. It was clear that the security people believed I had caused
this problem, but I felt that it was the result of a stupid question
and the common programmer&#39;s blunder of creating a categorization that
does not include “Other” as an option. They apparently
found it impractical to obtain the hour or two of a programmer&#39;s time
that would have been needed to fix the computer program, so they
chose instead to work with their standard tools. This led to an
expenditure of hundreds of man-hours of effort in gathering
information to try to intimidate me into changing my answer.</p>
<p>Some important political developments occurred during the period
between my rapid security clearance and the later inquisition. Civil
rights workers from all over the country worked on voter registration
in the South. Three of them disappeared near Philadelphia,
Mississippi on June 22, 1964, and were later found to have been
murdered by local officials. A federal omnibus civil rights act
happened to be signed into law one week later. It banned
discrimination in voting, jobs, and public accommodations and
generally removed the last vestiges of legal support for racial
discrimination at the national level.</p>
<p>I never did find out how the security investigators coped with the
fact that I remained a mongrel, but in 1966 I discovered that
something very good had happened: the race question had disappeared
from the security clearance form. In fact, this question disappeared
from nearly all government forms then. I liked to think I helped that
change along.</p>
<p><b>Feeling naked without chains. </b>For a short period in the
mid-&#39;60s, just after the race question disappeared from the forms, it
became socially unacceptable in certain circles to talk about a
person&#39;s race, but then an odd thing happened. Those who had been
discriminated against for so long began to think of their racial
identity as something to be proud of and those who wished to end
discrimination decided that they needed to classify people into
racial groups in order to be able to statistically measure compliance
with anti-discrimination laws and to actively right earlier wrongs.</p>
<p>In support of the latter goals, government bureaucrats invented an
“ethnic” classification system that identified the
minorities that they felt might be discriminated against. They never
bothered to define their terms because, like the earlier racists,
they had only a hazy notion of where the boundaries were. Thus, the
fuzzy old concept of racial classification that had been a tool of
racists for so long came to be embraced by their former victims and
those who believed that in order to combat discrimination, you had to
classify everyone and compile statistics.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1965, I helped John McCarthy organize the Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and remained as principal
bureaucrat of that organization for 15 years. My first encounter with
the new classification system was in the late &#39;60s, when I received a
form that called for a matrix of numbers to be filled in for the lab,
with job levels in one dimension and ethnic and sex classifications
the other way. The classifications made no more sense to me than
those used by the armed services earlier, but being at a place like
Stanford gave me access to expert advice on a wide range of subjects,
so I decided to seek help.</p>
<p>I happened to know Joshua Lederberg, who had received a Nobel
Prize for his work in genetics. This seemed to qualify him as an
expert, so I asked him how he determined the ethnic classes of his
staff members. Josh laughed and said, “That classification is
nonsensical. I just let them choose whatever they would like to be.”</p>
<p>This sounded like good advice, but a problem arose when I applied
it. Among the listed ethnic classes were “Spanish surname”
and “Black,” but one of my secretaries happened to be
black and had a Spanish surname and she felt that she should be
listed in both places. I did as she requested, which meant that the
rows and columns of the matrix didn&#39;t add up. I left it that way just
to see what would happen. I never heard a word about it.</p>
<p><b>Ethnic emperor&#39;s new clothes. </b>After a few years of having
us fill out ethnic matrices, somebody in the Stanford administration
figured out that they could save a lot of fuss by simply adding
ethnic classifications to their personnel database, so that the
computer could generate all the statistics that the government might
want. Furthermore, the rows and columns of computer-synthesized
matrices would always add up correctly -- truly a conceptual
breakthrough! Thus was born the idea of adding individual ethnic
codes to the IBM cards that contained our personal data. Sound
familiar?</p>
<p>The Stanford administration managed to avoid one mistake that the
Defense Department security folks had made: they didn&#39;t ask anyone to
classify themselves, thus bypassing troublemakers like me. Everyone
was secretly classified by certain key administrators. These
administrators must have been remarkably well trained, because they
did their classifying just by looking at people -- I never found
anyone who was interviewed to determine their ethnic classification.</p>
<p>I later obtained a copy of the instructions for determining new
ethnic code. Here is the full text.</p>
<p>ETHNIC CODE Required for all
employees. The codes are:</p>
<p>1 = Black, not of Hispanic origin</p>
<p>2 = Asian or Pacific Islander (persons
having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East,
Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands.)</p>
<p>3 = American Indian or Alaskan Native.</p>
<p>4 = Hispanic (persons of Mexican,
Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish
culture or origin, regardless of race.)</p>
<p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="2">5 =
Non-Minority (persons having origins in any of the original peoples
of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.)</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p>I learned that this classification scheme came from the federal
government. I believe that it is still in use throughout the United
States today. Interestingly, there were still five categories, just
as the security folks claimed in the early &#39;60s, though the
categories had shifted. I was glad to see that the problem with
Hispanic blacks had been solved, but there were still some mysteries.
According to the definitions, people from Spain were both Code 4 and
code 5. Were we to assume that 4 takes precedence over 5?  Not
clear.</p>
<p>Once again, there was no code for “mongrel” or
“undefined” or “mixed” or “other.”
Notice that “Non-Minority” is defined as people from
certain specific parts of the world and so it does not function as
the “other” category. The designers of this system
obviously believed that everyone belonged to some unique ethnic
category, though they didn&#39;t describe exactly how to put them there.</p>
<p>In fact, there were no instructions given on how to classify
people who are mixtures of things. For example, where would I place
my three grandchildren who are half Yup&#39;ik Eskimo and half whatever
we are? They were born in Alaska, so I guess that they qualify as
“Alaskan Native” (code 3).</p>
<p>I believe that the failure of this ethnic code to deal with people
of mixed origins is not accidental. It is part of a persistent
conspiracy in the United States to deny that there are such people.
Instead of being accurately identified, they are forced to choose
membership in one of the traditional racial groups. Needless to say,
there are no reliable statistics on the number of such people, but it
is certainly very large and getting larger.</p>
<p>“<b>Black” and “White”
are relative. </b>We know that nearly all of the people in the U.S.
who call themselves “black” are genetic mixtures of
African and European peoples. Because our culture is predominantly
European, anyone who has detectably African features is called
“black,” even if they are genetically, say, 7/8 European.
If we were a predominantly African country, these same people would
likely be called “white” because they have detectably
European features. In other words, these racial classifications seem
to be made relative to the norm, which makes them intrinsically
subjective and rather unreliable.</p>
<p>I understand that South Africa, which has an
African majority and a dominant European culture, distinguishes
between “Black,” “White,” “Asian,”
and “Colored,” the last being the catchall for mongrels.
I find their racial policies abominable, but their racial
classification system is slightly more logical than ours; of course,
it too is senseless if you look a bit deeper.</p>
<p>Sometime after Stanford undertook the secret
ethnic classification project, I saw one of my personnel forms and
discovered that I was code 5. I seriously considered protesting.
After all, some of my ancestors were Huns, a fierce nomadic tribe of
Asian warriors. In the 5th Century A.D., under the leadership of
Attila, they swept over most of Asia and Europe as far West as Gaul,
raping, pillaging, and spreading their genes everywhere. Thus I
qualify as code 2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, based on the best available
anthropological evidence, we can all trace our ancestry back to
Africa at an earlier time. Thus if “Black” means anyone
whose ancestors came from sub-Sahara Africa, we all qualify as code
1.</p>
<p>While it was clear that logic would be on my
side if I made a fuss over my ethnic code, I had to consider the
potential consequences of such an action. One possibility was that I
would have another run-in with the ethnic police. I figured that I
could handle that. On the other hand, I had become older and,
presumably, wiser and did not wish to expend energy on hopeless
crusades. Everyone else seemed to believe in this absurd scheme, so I
finally decided to live with the shame of being a code 5
“Non-minority.”</p>
<p><b>What are we doing here? </b>“So what?” you may say,
“Nobody takes this ethnic stuff seriously anyway.” Wrong!
Ethnic codes determine eligibility for certain scholarships and which
schools our children are bussed to. Large employers must exhibit
ethnic statistics within certain ranges in order to avoid charges of
discrimination. Under some Affirmative Action programs approved by
the courts, people who are identified as members of certain ethnic
groups are given hiring or promotion preferences, supposedly to
rectify past discrimination. If you own a business, your ethnic code
determines your eligibility for certain kinds of low interest loans
and may give you preferential access to many kinds of government
contracts. And so forth.</p>
<p>I have made fun of racial and ethnic classification systems not
because I disagree with the goals of those who have created these
schemes (even though I do disagree in some cases) but because our
society as a whole continues to treat these schemes as if they had
substance, somehow ignoring the fact that they are, and have always
been, nonsense. We continue to build ever more elaborate bureaucratic
structures atop this rotten foundation.</p>
<p>Suppose that we continue building, presumably because it is for a
good cause. Do you think that these structures will be dismantled
once the original purpose has vanished or has been forgotten? From
what I know of the way bureaucracies work, I am sure that the answer
is “No.” Fighting racism with “benign” racism
leads to indefinite racism that will end only when another process
intervenes. Something will eventually intervene, as I discuss later,
but it seems silly to wait that long.</p>
<p><b>Problems and alternative solutions. </b>Great progress has been
made in reducing racial discrimination in my lifetime. I grew up in a
racist society that had laws prohibiting blacks in the South from
eating in the same restaurants, attending the same schools, using the
same restrooms, drinking from the same fountains, riding in the same
part of a bus or train, sitting in the same part of theaters, or
entering the same public parks as whites. I attended public high
school in Louisville, Kentucky, where we were segregated three ways:
white boys, white girls, and colored.</p>
<p>Job discrimination pervaded all of the U.S., not just the South.
Almost the only jobs that were available to blacks, who were then
called “negro” or “colored” or something more
derogatory, were as cooks, domestic servants, or bootblacks.
Professional sports were closed to them and few could get jobs in the
entertainment industry, though some made their living as singers,
dancers, or musicians.</p>
<p>Earlier, when I lived in San Diego, some acquaintances who
happened to be members of a “dangerous” race were rounded
up by the government and placed in concentration camps, though I was
not aware at the time of what had happened to them -- my parents told
me that they had “moved away.” Only recently have we
learned of atrocities that happened in those camps, such as the
elderly man who went outside the fence to retrieve a ball that had
been thrown there by his grandson and was machine-gunned to death by
a guard.</p>
<p>We can take some pride in the fact that our government did not
systematically murder people in our concentration camps, but then
neither did the Germans in the beginning. I shudder to think what
might have happened if our war in the Pacific had gone badly. U.S.
Government propaganda had already convinced most citizens that
Japanese were a sub-human species who bred themselves to serve the
Japanese national purpose by flying kamikaze missions or otherwise
serving as cannon fodder and that one of our national goals was to
“Kill Japs!”</p>
<p>Some of these prejudicial feelings seem to have resurfaced
recently in response to Japanese economic success. Nevertheless, we
seem to have made substantial progress in eradicating prejudice and
discrimination during the last 40 years. Still, it is clear that this
problem is not solved.</p>
<p>My vision of the future is a colorblind society. I know that we
will not reach it in my lifetime because old habits die hard. In
fact, we will never entirely escape this problem because of a
peculiarity of human nature: wherever there are distinguishable
groups of people, tribal instincts can take root and turn it into an
“us versus them” situation. This phenomenon is not just
racially based – if you have any doubt, attend a high school
basketball game and observe the fans on both sides.</p>
<p>There was a short time in the mid-&#39;60s when I thought we were
headed in the right direction. Essentially all of the legal
underpinnings of racial discrimination had been knocked out of the
law books. Then certain anti-discrimination forces mobilized,
claiming that it was insufficient to simply outlaw discrimination.
They believed that it was also necessary to measure it statistically
by classifying everyone.</p>
<p>I disagree. I think that all the important issues can be addressed
without resorting to the absurd exercise of trying to assign ethnic
codes to everyone. For example, one way to homogenize school
composition is to assign students in some area to schools in that
area in accordance with a random number generator. This would achieve
racial balance without resorting to classification foolishness.</p>
<p>The most direct way to fight discrimination in housing or
employment is to send a well-qualified minority applicant to a
suspect and, if the applicant is refused, send a less well qualified
majority applicant. If that person is accepted, repeat the experiment
once or twice to be sure, then nail them! This scheme has been tested
and it works.</p>
<p><b>Back to basics. </b>Please understand that I do not claim that
the concept of race is totally meaningless. People in certain parts
of the world do bear physical similarities to one another and racial
terms are sometimes useful as labels for those similarities, provided
that we do not pretend that these terms have well-defined meanings.
Ashley Montagu [1] and others have pointed out that most popular
racial concepts are, in fact, myths. What is truly nonsensical is to
turn the fuzzy concept of race around and try to classify all
individuals as being members of some particular race.</p>
<p>Also, I do not claim that there necessarily have to be logical
inconsistencies in racial and ethnic codes, though all that I have
seen to date do exhibit such properties. Simply including a “mixed
blood” or “mongrel” category would solve a lot of
problems, but for some reason that idea does not seem to occur to
most people who design these codes.</p>
<p>Though many people clearly believe that racial and ethnic
classifications are somehow linked to science, I observe that their
relationship to genetics is a lot like astrology&#39;s link to astronomy.
The analogy is imperfect, however; very few government officials are
willing to publicly admit that they plan their lives around astrology
(though some apparently do), but nearly all of them publicly plan
their programs around ethnic classifications. Indeed, the government
pours millions of dollars each year into reaffirmation of this belief
and requires that private industry join in the massive delusion.</p>
<p>The widespread delusion about racial and ethnic classification has
not been confined to the nonscientific world, unfortunately. As
Lancelot Hogben remarked 56 years ago [2]: “Geneticists believe
that anthropologists have decided what a race is. Ethnologists assume
that their classifications embody principles which genetic science
has proved to be correct. Politicians believe that their prejudices
have the sanction of genetic laws and the findings of physical
anthropology to sustain them.”</p>
<p>While there often are visible differences between people from
areas that are widely separated, these differences are very small
compared with the physical similarities of all humans [3]. Genetic
studies indicate that all modern humans evolved from a single
population about 100,000 years ago, possibly less than half that
time. On the evolutionary time scale, this is a very short period.</p>
<p>As these people spread out, the genetic compositions of widely
separated groups moved apart to some degree, but there have always
been gradations and mixtures of characteristics in between them. In
other words, there are no clear boundaries between groups. Europeans
and certain Africans are genetically somewhat closer to each other
than to their cousins in the Far East, but there are all kinds of
variations in between.</p>
<p>Some of the geographical variations in human characteristics
appear to be environmental adaptations. For example, having a
relatively large amount of melanin in the skin not only makes it dark
but also protects against intense solar radiation, which reduces the
frequency of skin cancer and other skin disorders. On the other hand,
having very fair skin facilitates the absorption of sunlight and the
production of vitamin D, which inhibits rickets and other diseases.
Thus, the Nordic complexion is well suited to life at the higher
latitudes where there is less sunlight available. Some people&#39;s skin
has the ability to bleach out if it is not exposed to much sun or to
become very dark if it is. This adaptation would have been useful to
nomadic groups that periodically migrated from one zone to the other.</p>
<p>Other interpretations of visible differences in people are more
speculative. The Semitic nose, for example, has a larger moist
interior that could be advantageous when breathing hot, arid air. The
relatively small noses and other features of Far Eastern people could
have been an adaptation to an extremely cold environment. Perhaps
their ancestors evolved in one of the nastier parts of Siberia.</p>
<p>Some of the visible differences in widely separated groups are
certainly not environmental adaptations but are the result of
“genetic drift.” For example, a small population with a
chance collection of genetic characteristics may happen to grow into
a very large population that then further propagates these
characteristics.</p>
<p><b>How do we describe people? </b>In addition to the use of ethnic
classifications as an alleged tool for fighting discrimination,
ethnic terms are also used for visual identification by police and
the media, though with different conventions. While police reports
are usually specific, such as “Male Caucasian, 5 feet 10,”
newspapers usually report only departures from the racial norm. In
other words, if the person&#39;s race is not mentioned, it is presumably
“white.”  Almost never does either group identify
people as being of mixed blood, even though a very large portion of
the people they deal with actually are.</p>
<p>While there are many people in the U.S. who visually match certain
racial stereotypes, there are also a lot who do not and the
proportion in the latter category is increasing year-by-year. People
who don&#39;t fit any racial stereotypes can cause serious problems for
those who try to identify them in racial terms. For example, I know a
lady with very dark skin and bright orange-red hair. How do you
suppose she should be classified? I saw some comely ladies in
Amsterdam a few years ago with pale skin and bright green hair. To
which racial group would you say they belong?</p>
<p>Obviously, the police and others who use racial terms for
identification have no clearer understanding of these terms than do
the bureaucrats. For the most part, they seem to use racial terms as
synonyms for skin color. Thus, it is reasonable to ask why they don&#39;t
use a more precise vocabulary that already exists: artists&#39; terms for
skin color. The reason seems to be rooted in history; racial terms
were adopted for individual identification at a time when our entire
society was racist, including police and newspaper reporters. Old
habits die hard.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those who long for a way out of the
classification morass, help is on the way!</p>
<p><b>Fuzzy concept made precise. </b>Given that human genetic codes
are now in the process of being unraveled, it will soon be possible
to accurately classify people into racial groups. All we need do is
measure the distance between a given individual&#39;s genetic code and
those of various racial standards and assign that person to the
nearest racial group. There are several schemes under development for
measuring genetic distance [4]. One of the more straightforward
methods uses an adaptation of Hamming distance, as follows.</p>
<p>The basic genetic material, DNA, is composed of strings of
nucleotides, each of which consists of one of four bases: adenine,
thymine, guanine, or cytosine. In computer terms, then, the genetic
information can be represented as a string of bytes, each having one
of four values. The distance between two such codes can be taken as
simply the number of corresponding positions in which the two codes
differ.</p>
<p>The word “corresponding” is a bit tricky. Considerable
analysis may be needed to align elements that have the same or
similar functions, given that there may be gaps or additions in one
code or the other [5].</p>
<p>The principal function of DNA is to control the fabrication of
proteins using various kinds of RNA as intermediaries, but only about
1% of the DNA sequences represent protein formulas. Some of the
remaining material apparently represents control structures, which
determine when the various fabrication events happen, but there also
appears to be a lot of “garbage” -- codes that do
nothing. About 10% of the material is so-called satellite DNA, which
consists of the same sequence concatenated over and over up to
thousands of times. Another 20% consists of the same sequence
repeated in many scattered places. The functions of these repeated
sequences, if any, are unknown.</p>
<p>If you consider the above scheme to be a byte-level metric, there
is also a word-level distance measure that can be used. Genetic
mechanisms interpret the code in three-byte words, called “codons&#39;”
by geneticists, each of which specifies one of 20 amino acids or a
“stop” code. Thus, another plausible distance measure is
simply a count of the number of corresponding codons in which there
is a difference in the amino acid specified. Note that each word
could designate one of 4<sup>3</sup> = 64 actions, but a number of
codes yield the same action, leaving just 21 possibilities. The
designer apparently left no undefined codes for future use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it will not be practical to routinely analyze
individual genetic codes in their entirety for the foreseeable future
-- the current practical limit is to determine a few thousand
nucleotide sequences at a time, whereas human DNA contains about 3
billion. There are plans to map the entire sequence for some
individual, but that will be a major undertaking that could not be
done routinely for many people any time soon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is practical to measure genetic distance based on
comparisons of selected genes. In order to do this, we will need to
select the set to be used and define corresponding code sequences for
various racial standards, such as a standard Black, standard White,
standard Chinese, etc. Of course, some people will want to carry this
a step further and define a standard Texan or even a standard South
Philadelphian.</p>
<p>The process of choosing which races will be “standard”
will no doubt generate a lot of heat, but suppose that we manage to
do that. Then everyone can be classified as being a member of the
racial group whose standard is closest to their own. With either of
the two distance measures discussed above or one of the others that
are under development [4], it will be possible to assign everyone
unambiguously to a racial group except for the rare individuals who
happen to be exactly equidistant from the two closest standards. To
deal with these rare exceptions, we can probably devise tie-breaking
rules.</p>
<p>While this marvel of future science will yield exact and
unambiguous racial classifications, such a scheme clearly will not be
useful for visual identification. In fact, I can&#39;t think of anything
that it would be good for, other than to provide a formalized basis
for bigotry. For the purpose of identification, the individual&#39;s
genetic codes will be far more useful than any racial classification
derived from them.</p>
<p><b>Urge to merge. </b>Whether or not we solve the problem of
racial discrimination through education, political action, and law
enforcement, human biology will apparently solve it for us in the
long run. If there are no more major influxes of foreign populations
into the United States, distinguishable racial groups will
essentially disappear in this country within a few centuries because
of the “urge to merge.” In other words, the U.S. seems
destined to become a nation of mongrels.</p>
<p>This blending process has almost certainly happened in other parts
of the world in the past, producing many of the “homogeneous”
modern human populations seen today. In the United States, future
white supremacists and black power advocates must inevitably
reconcile themselves to being members of shrinking minorities. I
predict that as the mongrels become dominant, new rallying cries will
be heard; perhaps, “Beige is beautiful.” Before that
happens, though, they must learn to identify themselves as members of
the new breed rather than as members of traditional races. The U.S.
government currently denies them that right.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions. </b>I have argued
that all historical and present racial and ethnic classification
systems for individuals are nonsensical and so are the laws, court
decisions, computer applications, and bureaucratic superstructures
that have been built on top of them.</p>
<p>The attempt to use computers to assist in racial
classification tasks has helped sharpen the issues because computers
can&#39;t deal with fuzzy concepts. If you try to define an ethnic code
that is logically complete, consistent, and determinable for every
person using current technology, you find that you can&#39;t.</p>
<p>There seems to be a silent conspiracy to deny
the existence of mixed racial groups in the United States. Most such
people have acquiesced to this conspiracy and don&#39;t even think of
themselves in those terms. Instead, they go along with the idea that
they are members of one of the races recognized by the government. In
fact, they often identify with a traditional race that represents
only a small fraction of their genetic heritage!</p>
<p>It appears that rigorous racial classification
will soon be possible through advances in genetics and the
development of computerized racial stereotypes, though the usefulness
of such schemes is suspect. Thus one answer to the title question,
“Can computers cope with human races?” is: “Not
yet, but soon -- but who cares?”</p>
<p>Even if we fail to deal effectively with the
racial issues, it appears that the “urge to merge” will
eventually settle this problem for our descendents. It is encouraging
to know that nature will handle it if we screw up.</p>
<p>Many people have quietly resisted the persistent
nonsense of racial classification by either refusing to answer such
questions or by listing themselves as “human.” Over the
last 25 years, I have consistently answered “mongrel.” In
order to turn back the classifiers, I believe that it will be
necessary to form an identifiable movement with a distinctive title.
As long as we&#39;re choosing a name, why not identify with the long term
winners? I propose USA Mongrels.</p>
<p>I invite others to join in
self-declassification, with the hope and expectation that the
bureaucrats and politicians will eventually be forced to quit playing
with this issue and will recognize that the United States of America
is a nation of egalitarian mongrels. I believe that we will all be
better off. So will the computers.</p>
<p>Finally, computer scientists who encounter
problems in adapting human concepts to computer use should not assume
that the source of such problems necessarily lies in the limitations
of computers. There is a real possibility that the concept itself may
be flawed.</p>
