But that was about it.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>They contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it &#34;did not have the tools&#34; to help.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>So Squire and his colleagues analysed everything they could see in Lucy&#39;s room: the bedspread, her outfits, her stuffed toys. Looking for any element which might help.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>And then they had a minor breakthrough. The team discovered that a sofa seen in some of the images was only sold regionally, not nationally, and therefore had a more limited customer base.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>But that still amounted to about 40,000 people.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;At that point in the investigation, we&#39;re [still] looking at 29 states here in the US. I mean, you&#39;re talking about tens of thousands of addresses, and that&#39;s a very, very daunting task,&#34; says Squire.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The team looked for more clues. And that is when they realised something as mundane as the exposed brick wall in Lucy&#39;s bedroom could give them a lead.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;So, I started just Googling bricks and it wasn&#39;t too many searches [before] I found the Brick Industry Association,&#34; says Squire.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;And the woman on the phone was awesome. She was like, &#39;how can the brick industry help?&#39;&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>She offered to share the photo with brick experts all over the country. The response was almost immediate, he says.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>One of the people who got in touch was John Harp, who had been working in brick sales since 1981.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;I noticed that the brick was a very pink-cast brick, and it had a little bit of a charcoal overlay on it.
