    <h1>Tiffin Tom: Fish, chips and a side of identity theft</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
<p>Fish &amp; chips?</p><p>Such an innocuous phrase which should have led to an evening in front of the TV with the better half.  Instead, a nightmare ensued; endlessly contacting several local eateries to alert them to a very serious problem.</p><p>Tiffin Tom is a &#34;Just Eat&#34; style, online food ordering service with hundreds of local businesses.  Just enter your postcode and a world of artery-clogging yet convenient food awaits.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s also a sure-fire way to have your identity &amp; payment information stolen - very, very quickly indeed.</p><p>After Googling my local Parkhill Fish Bar, <a href="https://parkhillfishbar.co.uk/">https://parkhillfishbar.co.uk/</a> appears as the first result.  I began adding items to my basket before the site asks me to register.</p><h2 id="pandoras-box">Pandora&#39;s Box</h2><p>Before you order, the site makes a database lookup to get the takeaway&#39;s details; opening hours, minimum order values, service area etc.</p><p>It returns data like this:</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="672" height="401" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-2.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-2.png 672w"/></figure><p>Nothing wrong so far... until you scroll down.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="842" height="1422" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-1.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-1.png 842w"/></figure><p>Let me make sense of that for you...</p><p>I asked to register.  Instead, Tiffin Tom gave me full, unfettered access to their Google, Firebase, Facebook, Twitter, MailChimp, Text Magic, Click Send, Pusher, Email, PayPal &amp; Stripe payment accounts!</p><p>You&#39;d be forgiven for thinking, they&#39;re obviously fake, outdated or canaries, right?</p><p>A quick call to Stripe&#39;s API confirms... I&#39;m their latest customer.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="323" height="456"/></figure><p>Sure enough, every single credential is live, working and leaking every single piece of customer information.</p><p>Full names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, order history, payment information including card data... literally everything you hand over is visible to the public.</p><h2 id="ignorance-is-bliss">Ignorance is bliss.</h2><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen an application do something so blatantly stupid &amp; dangerous - not since Police CyberAlarm in fact, when they returned user passwords in plain text.</p><p>At this point, I obviously didn&#39;t place an order and immediately visited Parkhill.  Parkhill&#39;s our local and whilst we don&#39;t visit often, it&#39;s always our go-to place for fish &amp; chips, so I already knew Baljinder, the owner.</p><p>Once I&#39;d outlined the issue to Bal, he promptly called Jamal Ahmed, the &#34;Director&#34; of Tiffin Tom Ltd.</p><p>Bal explained &amp; relayed the information to Jamal, but we eventually ended up on speakerphone, during which I explained the entire system was exposed, Stripe keys were breached and everything should be taken offline immediately.  His immediate response was &#34;we&#39;ve not been breached&#34;, a line he continues to repeat to every business I&#39;ve notified.</p><p>However, he promised to take Parkhill offline and remove their data.  I also agreed to email &amp; call the following day with more concrete information.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The &#34;fix&#34;</h2><p>The following day, I started pulling the rest of the service apart.  However, during a mandatory due diligence period, I noticed something odd at Companies House.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1273" height="1575" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-5.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-5.png 1273w"/></figure><p>What?! No Directors whatsoever?</p><p>Jamal resigned in July 2022 - meaning the company has been &#34;trading&#34; illegally ever since.  It&#39;s probably why Companies House have tried to strike off the company - that and a lack of accounts/confirmation statement, but someone&#39;s lodged an objection, so the company remains active with no leadership.</p><h3 id="curve-ball">Curve ball</h3><p>This is a situation I&#39;ve never faced before.</p><p>Normally, I&#39;d hand over all the supporting evidence to the company and let them resolve it.  Now however, I can&#39;t - legally at least - because Jamal is no longer the Director he purports to be.</p><p>A quick call to the ICO and they too are equally stumped; asking me to forward a complaint but with no guarantee of any action because of the unique circumstances.</p><p>One thing was for sure however... the businesses using Tiffin Tom were still liable for sizeable fines, something I&#39;m trying to avoid.</p><p>Anyway, I digress... let&#39;s move on to the &#34;fix&#34;.</p><p>Despite claiming (and continuing to claim) there has been no breach, Jamal did admit he&#39;d &#34;found a few things&#34; which his developers were fixing.</p><p>A few days later, the database call which prompted this mess changed significantly.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1453" height="1450" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-6.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-6.png 1453w"/></figure><p>They&#39;ve clearly found and discussed the problem (keep in mind, I didn&#39;t tell them where it was) - but their &#34;solution&#34; is equally as pathetic as the site itself.</p><p>Instead of returning the critically-sensitive details in plain text, they&#39;ve encrypted it.  However, the astute amongst you will have already surmised... if the site is decrypting the results to populate forms/javascript, the encryption key must be accessible in the DOM.</p><p>Sure enough...</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="550" height="423"/></figure><p>Decrypting the data is as simple as Googling &#34;aes decrypt&#34;</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1326" height="1626" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-8.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-8.png 1000w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-8.png 1326w"/></figure><p>Sigh.</p><p>OK, they tried... but not particularly hard.  They didn&#39;t even change the exposed secret keys!  They&#39;ve just encrypted the existing, leaked keys - then told customers there&#39;s been no breach!</p><p>I rarely get angry, but this piss-poor effort continues to place 21,000 customers at immediate, demonstrable risk and instead of holding their hands up, apologizing and making a reasonably-competent effort to fix it... they&#39;ve lied &amp; covered it up.</p><p>Now, Jamal told Parkhill that his site was offline (confirmed) and his data had been removed.  That however, is a lie too.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1442" height="1006" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-9.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-9.png 1000w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-9.png 1442w"/></figure><p>Instead of doing what was legally required, Tiffin Tom have simply hidden Parkhill from search results.</p><p>All the PII &amp; payment data - which places Parkhill and countless other businesses at risk of huge fines - <strong>still</strong> remains in the database.</p><h2 id="tip-of-the-iceberg">Tip of the iceberg</h2><p>Believe me when I tell you, this is merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The site is festooned with the most rudimentary of security flaws; stored XSS, CSRF, iDOR, broken authentication, session hijacking - it&#39;s a perfect little CTF competition masquerading as a business.</p><p>Did I mention, they offer debit cards &amp; payment machines too?</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="875" height="385" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-10.png 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image-10.png 875w"/></figure><h2 id="more-denials">More denials...</h2><p>After finishing my research, I notified Bal @ Parkhill of the further findings, prompting him to contact Jamal again.</p><p>His response, as of the 28th June 2023.</p><figure><img src="https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image_20230701182052.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="955" height="2048" srcset="https://paul.reviews/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image_20230701182052.jpg 600w, https://paul.reviews/content/images/2023/07/image_20230701182052.jpg 955w"/></figure><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>I&#39;ve researched some pretty egregious sites in the past but this one... it takes some beating.</p><p>If you value your business, your customer&#39;s data or simply want to avoid a colossal fine from the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office, avoid Tiffin Tom/Ubsidi/Nibs Solutions at all costs.</p><p>Ya know the worst part? After explaining all this, my chips were cold. Oh, the humanity.</p><h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3><p>1)  I run a business and have a Tiffin Tom account. What should I do?</p><p>2) What if Tiffin Tom doesn&#39;t respond, or refute this?</p><p>3)  I&#39;ve placed an order with a takeaway, am I affected?</p>
