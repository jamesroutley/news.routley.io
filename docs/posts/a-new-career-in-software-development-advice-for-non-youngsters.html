			<p>Lately I have been encountering non-young people looking to switch careers, into software development.  My suggestions have centered around the ageism culture and how they can take advantage of fashions in software ecosystems to improve their job prospects.</p>
<p>I start by telling them the good news: the demand for software developers outstrips supply, followed by the bad news that software development culture is ageist.</p>
<p>One consequence of the preponderance of the young is that people are heavily influenced by fads and fashions, which come and go over less than a decade.</p>
<p>The perception of technology progresses through the stages of fashionable, established and legacy (management-speak for unfashionable). </p>
<p>Non-youngsters can leverage the influence of fashion’s impact on job applicants by focusing on what is unfashionable, the more unfashionable the less likely that youngsters will apply, e.g., maintaining Cobol and Fortran code (both seriously unfashionable).</p>
<p>The benefits of applying to work with unfashionable technology include more than a smaller job applicant pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>new technology (fashion is about the new) often experiences a period of rapid change, and keeping up with change requires time and effort.  Does somebody with a family, or outside interests, really want to spend time keeping up with constant change at work?  I suspect not,</li>
<li>systems depending on unfashionable technology have been around long enough to prove their worth, the sunk cost has been paid, and they will continue to be used until something a lot more cost-effective turns up, i.e., there is more job security compared to systems based on fashionable technology that has yet to prove their worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is lots of unfashionable software technology out there.  Software can be considered unfashionable simply because of the language in which it is written; some of the more well known of such languages include: Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, and Basic (in a multitude of forms), with less well known languages including, MUMPS, and almost any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a> related language.</p>
<p>Unless you want to be competing for a job with hordes of keen/cheaper youngsters, don’t touch Rust, Go, or anything being touted as the latest language.</p>
<p>Databases also have a fashion status.  The unfashionable include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBase</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_(programming_language)">Clarion</a>, and a whole host of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">4GL systems</a>.</p>
<p>Be careful with any database that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> related, it may be fashionable or an established product being marketed using the latest buzzwords.</p>
<p>Testing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">QA</a> have always been very unsexy areas to work in.  These areas provide the opportunity for the mature applicants to shine by highlighting their stability and reliability; what company would want to entrust some young kid with deciding whether the software is ready to be released to paying customers?</p>
<p>More suggestions for non-young people looking to get into software development welcome.</p>
