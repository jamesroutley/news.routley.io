		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, one of the great intellectuals of his generation, was known by most as the founder of analytic philosophy, but he was actually a man of many talents: a pioneering mathematician, an accomplished logician, a tireless activist, a respected historian, and a Nobel Prize-winning writer, to name but a handful. When he wrote this principled letter at the beginning of 1962, Russell was 89 years old and clearly still a man of morals who stood firm in his beliefs. Its recipient was Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, a man most famous for founding, in 1932, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>.</p>

<article><header>The Letter</header><div>
<p>22 January 1962</p>



<p>Sir Oswald Mosley,</p>



<p>Dear Sir Oswald,</p>



<p>Thank you for your letter and for your enclosures. I have given some thought to our recent correspondence. It is always difficult to decide on how to respond to people whose ethos is so alien and, in fact, repellent to oneâ€™s own. It is not that I take exception to the general points made by you but that every ounce of my energy has been devoted to an active opposition to cruel bigotry, compulsive violence, and the sadistic persecution which has characterised the philosophy and practice of fascism.</p>



<p>I feel obliged to say that the emotional universes we inhabit are so distinct, and in deepest ways opposed, that nothing fruitful or sincere could ever emerge from association between us.</p>



<p>I should like you to understand the intensity of this conviction on my part. It is not out of any attempt to be rude that I say this but because of all that I value in human experience and human achievement.</p>



<p>Yours sincerely,</p>



<p>Bertrand Russell</p>
