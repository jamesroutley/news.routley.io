    <h1>Tell HN: Airbnb’s transparent pricing is a lie</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I made a booking at Crowne Plaza Times Square on July 22, 2023. Set the option to show all prices and paid $1500 for it. At checking, in presented with a bill for city and state taxes and “resort fees” totaling $552 and a $500 security deposit. Doesn’t seem very transparent since they specially state that you’d see all taxes when you pay on Airbnb.</p><p>I called support when I was doing checkin, and they just said it was on the hotels terms/fine print in the listing and I should have read more carefully. Well, I assumed the value of Airbnb was to protect users from this, otherwise they’re just a middle man collecting a tax.</p><p>This is the listing btw. You’ll pay 30% more than advertised, so factor that in when comparing to other places. Also, weren’t security deposits unnecessary with Airbnb because they handle charging customers for things like damage, and aren’t listings insured?</p><p>Finally I use Airbnb a lot, so trust wise there should not be any red flags what’s justify security deposits.</p></div></div></div>
