      <span>Abstract:</span>  he ethical implications of algorithmic systems have been much discussed in
both HCI and the broader community of those interested in technology design,
development and policy. In this paper, we explore the application of one
prominent ethical framework - Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency - to a
proposed algorithm that resolves various societal issues around food security
and population ageing. Using various standardised forms of algorithmic audit
and evaluation, we drastically increase the algorithm&#39;s adherence to the FAT
framework, resulting in a more ethical and beneficent system. We discuss how
this might serve as a guide to other researchers or practitioners looking to
ensure better ethical outcomes from algorithmic systems in their line of work.
