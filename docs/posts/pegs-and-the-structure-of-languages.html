<p>How Parsing Expression Grammars help us (and computers)
understand the structure of programming languages.</p>
<p>Estimated reading time: 7 mins</p>

<span>May 29, 2021</span>

<p>When I first began working on my programming language <a href="https://nomsu.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nomsu,</a> one of the
first challenges I faced was how to get the computer to see code written in my
language as more than just a long sequence of letters. Code has
<em>structure</em>, and finding that structure is called parsing. After spending
a long time digging through different approaches to the problem, one
lesser-known (though increasingly popular) approach called Parsing Expression
Grammars became my favorite, and allowed me to make my own programming language.
This post will explain what Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are, and a bit of
background on the problem they solve. There are some very good PEG libraries
available (I first found out about PEGs through the Lua library <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LPEG</a>), and in a follow-up post, I’ll even explain how to
implement a PEG parser from scratch. Hopefully, after reading this post, you’ll
have enough understanding to try defining your own language (programming or
otherwise) with a Parsing Expression Grammar.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-tokens">A Note on Tokens</h2>
<p>Parsing is the problem of understanding the structure and meaning of a series
of tokens. “Tokens” can refer to discrete chunks of an input. For example,
“bytes in a file” or multi-byte chunks like “words” or “whitespace”. If a parser
does split input into multi-byte tokens before processing, this step is called
“tokenization” or “lexing.” PEGs are very good at concisely expressing low-level
concepts, so you often don’t need to do this preprocessing step. In this post,
I’m going to assume that the input is just text without any preprocessing.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>
<p>Formal specifications of the structure of a language go back a long way to
linguists like Noam Chomsky. Two of the more influential concepts are context
free grammars and regular expressions. A full explanation of these topics is
beyond the scope of this post, but I will say that these paradigms have been
massively useful for describing the structure of a language or pattern.
Unfortunately, these paradigms come from a <em>generative</em> perspective, in
other words, they’re structured like a choose-your-own-adventure. Consider this
grammar:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>sentence <span>&lt;-</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    subject (intransitive_verb | intransitive_verb object) <span>&#34;.&#34;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>subject <span>&lt;-</span> noun_phrase</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>object <span>&lt;-</span> noun_phrase</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>noun_phrase <span>&lt;-</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    article (noun | adjective noun) | pronoun | proper_noun</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>article <span>&lt;-</span> <span>&#34;the&#34;</span> | <span>&#34;a&#34;</span> | <span>&#34;an&#34;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>adjective <span>&lt;-</span> <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>noun <span>&lt;-</span> <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pronoun <span>&lt;-</span> <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>proper_noun <span>&lt;-</span> <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>intransitive_verb <span>&lt;-</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you read it as a choose-your-own-adventure, you can generate a great
number of sentences with even this simple grammar like “The hungry cat ate the
mouse.” or “I like turtles.” or “A raindrop fell.” From a linguistic
perspective, this is a very useful paradigm for understanding the rules
governing how humans produce language, but it runs into some problems if you use
this approach for having a computer <em>parse</em> a language.</p>
<p>Namely, this approach can be very inefficient if it has to do a lot of
backtracking. Grammars of this sort can have many possible parsings for each
token in the sentence, and it may be the case that only one possible set of
assignments will lead to a successful parsing, or worse: many possible sets of
assignments will lead to many different successful parsings. As a trivial
example, imagine parsing a sentence one word at a time with the grammar
above:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Token</th>
<th>Guess</th>
<th>Commentary</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The</td>
<td><code>article</code></td>
<td>This one’s pretty straightforward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>clever</td>
<td><code>adjective</code></td>
<td>This could be either a noun or an adjective, but let’s go with adjective for
now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>trick</td>
<td><code>noun</code></td>
<td>If “clever” was an <code>adjective</code>, this must be a <code>noun</code>
(as in the noun phrase “The clever trick”).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>parsers</td>
<td><code>verb</code>?!?!</td>
<td>Uh oh, “parsers” definitely isn’t a verb. That means that we have to go back
and re-evaluate all the choices we’ve made so far.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Let’s try again:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Token</th>
<th>Guess</th>
<th>Commentary</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The</td>
<td><code>article</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>clever</td>
<td><code>noun</code></td>
<td>Since labeling this as an adjective didn’t work last time, this must be a
noun (i.e. “the clever”, meaning “clever people”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>trick</td>
<td><code>verb</code></td>
<td>Since “the clever” is a noun phrase, this must be the verb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>parsers</td>
<td><code>noun</code></td>
<td>Har har. “The clever trick parsers.” (i.e. “Clever people trick
parsers.”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td>
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>That’s the end of the sentence, no more surprises.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Sentences like “The clever trick parsers.” are known in linguistics as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">garden path sentences.</a> They don’t come up all that often in
normal usage, because people instinctively avoid them, but they can be
surprisingly common in computer languages. For example, consider scanning along
some C code one character at a time and so far, you have seen:</p>

<p>At this point, you might assume that the variable <code>x</code> is being
assigned to the variable <code>y</code>, but if you scan a little further and
see:</p>

<p>then suddenly you’ll have to re-evaluate your assumption that <code>x</code>
is a variable, because now it appears to be function, called with the argument
<code>z</code>, so <code>y</code> is being assigned the return value of a
function call. But if the next two characters you see are:</p>

<p>then you need to re-interpret the right hand side of the assignment as the
sum of a function’s return value and a number literal.</p>
<p>All of that backtracking in such a simple expression!</p>
<h2 id="parsing-expression-grammars">Parsing Expression Grammars</h2>
<p>The real strength of Parsing Expression Grammars is that they’re
deterministic and unambiguous. Parsing Expression Grammars will <em>never</em>
backtrack beyond the current rule, unless the language explicitly requires it,
and the grammar specifies the order in which the rules will attempt to match.
Here is a simple grammar that defines a lisp-like language:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>File <span>&lt;-</span> (expression <span>/</span> ws<span>+</span>)<span>*</span> <span>!</span><span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>FunctionCall <span>&lt;-</span> <span>&#34;(&#34;</span> ws<span>*</span> name ws<span>*</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  (expression ws<span>*</span> (expression ws<span>*</span>)<span>*</span>)<span>?</span> <span>&#34;)&#34;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>expression <span>&lt;-</span> FunctionCall <span>/</span> Variable <span>/</span> Number</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span>/</span> Text <span>/</span> <span>&#34;(&#34;</span> ws<span>*</span> expression ws<span>*</span> <span>&#34;)&#34;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Variable <span>&lt;-</span> name</span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Number <span>&lt;-</span> <span>[0-9]</span><span>+</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Text <span>&lt;-</span> <span>&#39;&#34;&#39;</span> (<span>&#39;\&#34;&#39;</span> <span>/</span> <span>&#39;\\&#39;</span> <span>/</span> <span>[^&#34;]</span>)<span>*</span> <span>&#39;&#34;&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>name <span>&lt;-</span> <span>[a-zA-Z]</span><span>+</span></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>ws <span>&lt;-</span> <span>[ \n\t]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The PEG above will handle parsing a file like:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span>print</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>&#34;The golden ratio is:&#34;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    (divide (add (<span>sqrt</span> <span>5</span>) <span>1</span>) <span>2</span>))</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span>print</span> <span>&#34;A random number:&#34;</span> (<span>random</span>)) </span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, you can see an interactive demo of the parsing in action (click “Run”
to give it a go):</p>

<p>PEGs have a lot of similarity to Regular Expressions and context-free
grammars, but with some key differences. Instead of the <code>|</code> (pipe)
operator in Regular Expressions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Backus-Naur form,</a> PEGs use the <code>/</code> (slash)
operator, which indicates an ordered choice. If one of the operands matches,
none of the following operands will be attempted. This same principle applies to
the <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> repetition operators. This means that
although it might seem like a file containing <code>(foo)</code> could parse as
either a function call or a parenthesized variable, it is actually guaranteed to
parse as a function call. This is because the PEG rule for
<code>expression</code> formally specifies that it will attempt to match
<code>FunctionCall</code> before attempting to match a <code><span>&#34;(&#34;</span> ws<span>*</span> expression ws<span>*</span> <span>&#34;)&#34;</span></code>.
When <code>FunctionCall</code> attempts to match, it will either fail, or
succeed and greedily gobble up as much input as it can. If the expression rule
were instead written as <code>expression <span>&lt;-</span> <span>&#34;(&#34;</span> ws<span>*</span> expression ws<span>*</span> <span>&#34;)&#34;</span> <span>/</span> FunctionCall <span>/</span> Variable <span>/</span> Number <span>/</span> Text</code>
(with parenthesized expressions before FunctionCalls), then <code>(foo)</code>
would parse as a parenthesized variable. Unlike regular expressions, PEGs will
never backtrack and consider different possibilities for something that
successfully matched. This makes them much more predictable and less likely to
have degenerate performance. This limited backtracking might seem very
restricting, but with proper caching it actually allows PEGs to guarantee that
arbitrarily long strings can be parsed in linear time, using linear space, while
still being extremely expressive.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>The Parsing Expression Grammars described in this post are a great way to
formalize the description of strictly-defined languages like programming
languages or data storage formats. PEGs are a powerful tool that let you explain
to a computer how to understand patterns and structure in text, and in a future
blog post I’ll also explain how to turn a PEG grammar into a usable program that
can actually parse text. Until then, you can check out <a href="https://medium.com/@gvanrossum_83706/peg-parsing-series-de5d41b2ed60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guido van Rossum’s posts on PEG parsing,</a>
which also explains some of the topics covered in this post.</p>
