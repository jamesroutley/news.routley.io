    <h1>The MP3mobile (1998)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


This page documents my efforts at fitting my car with a MP3 player: I&#39;m
still twiddling with lots of bits of the setup, and so this page will change
when things do with the setup. Hopefully, this page will help anyone else
trying to do the same thing! There are now some pictures (thanks to <a href="http://www.reality.demon.co.uk/">Patrick</a>,
who lent me his Mustek VDC-200).
<p>First of all: a disclaimer. Basically, all this worked for me. If it
doesn&#39;t work for you, burns down your house/car/household pet, that&#39;s your
problem. People building PSUs, it&#39;s a good idea to test them (voltage,
current, etc) under load (eg: a partially dead hard disk) before plugging
in an expensive PC motherboard which it may well blow up.
</p><p>For those of you looking for a complete, built, in-dash player should look
at my <b>empeg</b> unit (<a href="http://www.empeg.com">http://www.empeg.com</a>
which is very cute ;)

<h2>
<a name="Why"></a>Why?</h2>
The whole idea got rolling when I decided I wanted to upgrade my car stereo
in my <a href="http://www.cryton.demon.co.uk/mx5">Mazda MX5</a> (Miata
to Americans, Eunos Roadster for Japanese!). Up until MP3mobile, I&#39;d been
using a Sony TCD-D3 DAT walkman on a car-mount arm as the primary audio
source, which was great: long play, good quality audio - just that I never
seemed to have the tapes with me that suited my mood, and the D3 doesn&#39;t
have useful things like track programming or repeat. While looking at new
head units/autochangers, two thoughts struck me:
<ul>
<li>
6 or 10 CDs isn&#39;t a very big choice - even blowing your own CDRs with your
favourite music, it still means that you have a pretty limited selection,
and the slow disc change doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re flitting around tunes
trying to find what you want.</li>

<li>
The boot in the MX5 is small enough already without an autochanger box
taking up room.</li>

<li>
The price of a new head unit and autochanger is awfully close to a complete
PC.</li>
</ul>
So, I built an in-car MP3 player. The result isn&#39;t minature, like the MPman,
but does take no &#39;user-accessible&#39; space in the car interior, and is pretty
secure. Possible future commercial versions will most likely be the same
form factor as a normal radio/cassette. The rest of this page goes into
mind-numbing detail about how it was built and things to look out for if
you try this yourself - but the basic concept is simple: a wide range of
great quality music (all of which I like, unlike compilations) whenever
I want it.
<p>The final result is immensely wonderful, and impresses the hell out
of most hackerish people (like me). Non-computer people just wonder why
you havn&#39;t got a CD player. But, with my setup (based on RedHat Linux 5.0)
I can do these things:
</p><ul>
<li>
NFS mount my car from my laptop (there&#39;s a loose 10-base-T cable behind
the drivers seat) and squirt new tunes into it.</li>

<li>
Hook up my GSM-modem to the car (so you can telnet into it and run emacs
at 60mph :-) ).</li>

<li>
Hook up a GPS unit, so you could finger the car and find out exactly where
a car full of computer equipment suitable for stealing is located.</li>

<li>
Compile as I go round bends.</li>

<li>
Coredump as I change gear :-)</li>
</ul>
None of these things can be done with an autochanger. Sorry, but you lose
:-)
<p>Future plans include:
</p><ul>
<li>
418Mhz low-power radio link to allow me to upgrade the software when the
car is in the garage 30m or so from the flat.</li>

<li>
Link into the car&#39;s engine management to monitor boost pressure, etc</li>

<li>
Voice-command of the music functions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="How"></a>How it looks</h2>
Here are some pictures of the system&#39;s display: mounted just below the
stock radio/cassette unit, it&#39;s very unobtrusive. The lefthand part of
the display usually scrolls the title/artist information, with the right
hand side showing elapsed time. The sexy spun-aluminium gearknob is a Voodoo
knob (see <a href="http://www.miata.net">miata.net</a>&#39;s marketplace section).
You can also see the audio output from the MP3 player going into the CD-in
jack on the front of the radio.

<p>...and yes, I own all the CDs that the music on the system has been
compressed from. Below you see the ridiculous looking exclaimation mark
on the VFD display :-)
