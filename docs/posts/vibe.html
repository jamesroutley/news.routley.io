    <p>The intangible quality <em>vibe</em> was popularized in 1967 as a clipping of “vibration” in the wake of the Beach Boys’ 1966 chart-topper “Good Vibrations”. “Vibrations” meaning intangible qualities or communications, inspired by ESP, made it into the lyrics through California drug slang. Perhaps coincidentally, the cordless vibrator, also abbreviated <em>vibe</em>, was first marketed for sexual purposes in 1968.</p>

<p><em>Vibe</em> and its relatives were ubiquitous enough to be called the cliche of the 1960s. Both the plural form <em>vibes</em> and the verb <em>vibing</em>, suggesting being “in tune with the vibration of the universe”, were in common use by 1970.</p>

<p>The word experienced a resurgence in the late 2010s, perhaps buoyed by political commentary about <em>vibes being off</em> and <em>running on vibes</em>. Novel phrases like <em>vibe shift</em> and <em>vibe check</em> were popularized as recently as 2022. <em>Vibe coding</em> was coined by Slovak-born AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in 2025.</p>
