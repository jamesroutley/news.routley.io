    <h1>Even the worst mass extinction had its oases</h1>

<p>Some earlier plants might not have made it through the extinction since rock layers from the onset of the End-Permian Mass Extinction showed a decrease in pollen and spores, as well as fewer plant species. Other species were scarce because they had not been as well-preserved as others; the team did not automatically assume the scarcity of a plant that did not fossilize meant it had gone extinct.</p>
<p>While there were plant species that ended up being victims of the Great Dying, analysis of species through spore and pollen told the team that only about 21 percent of them succumbed to extinction.</p>
<h2>Life will not be contained</h2>
<p>The fossils also revealed the presence of plant species known to grow near lakes, which meant an environment that most likely provided drinking water for land-dwelling animals. Fossilized spores farther from what were once the banks of an ancient lake or the edge of a lakeplain suggest it was surrounded by a forest of gymnospermous trees, such as conifers or ginkgo, and ferns.</p>
<p>Because the researchers found so many spores from plant species known to grow in humid climates, they think the regional climate before the extinction was either humid or sub-humid, with plenty of rain. It was a lush environment that would see dry periods during the mass extinction event, but not be completely devastated.</p>
<p>Despite some species of plants vanishing, those that were found to have survived during and after the extinction mostly belonged to conifers and pteridosperms (now-extinct plants similar to ferns), which showed “a remarkable ability to adapt to drought,” as Liu and his team said in the same <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads5614#con5">study</a>.</p>
<p>The drought turned out to be only temporary. Younger rock layers were found to contain a greater abundance of pollen and spores from species that grew during the extinction event. The types of plants represented suggest a climate that had returned to subhumid and was more habitable.</p>
<p>Fossils of animals found at the site support its role as a haven for life. From the herbivorous <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/Lystrosaurus"><i>Lystrosaurus</i></a> (not a dinosaur), which looked something like a walrus with legs and a shovel face, to the carnivorous <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772019.2021.1873435">chroniosuchians</a> that resembled giant lizards and fed on insects and small amphibians, the refugium in what is now Xinjiang kept life going.</p>
<p>Both flora and fauna would soon spread across terrestrial environments once again. Life on land flourished only 75,000 years after the End-Permian Mass Extinction, so life really does find a way.</p>
