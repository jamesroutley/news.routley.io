<p>üö® Council to greenlight #Chatcontrol 2.0 on Thursday! üö®</p>



<p>Contact details and additional information: <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/council-to-greenlight-chat-control-take-action-now/">https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/council-to-greenlight-chat-control-take-action-now/</a></p>











<p>The EU Commission proposes to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content ‚Äì generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). The result: Mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time surveillance of messaging and chats and the end of privacy of digital correspondence. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the proposal include ineffective network blocking, screening of personal cloud storage including private photos, mandatory age verification resulting in the end of anonymous communication, appstore censorship and excluding minors from the digital world. </p>



<h2 id="chatcontrol20"><strong>Chat control 2.0 on every smartphone</strong></h2>



<p>On 11 May 2022<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/proposal-regulation-laying-down-rules-prevent-and-combat-child-sexual-abuse_en">the European Commission presented a proposal</a> which would make chat control searching <em>mandatory</em> for all e-mail and messenger providers</strong> and would even apply to so far securely end-to-end encrypted communication services. Prior to the proposal a public consultation had revealed that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Child-sexual-abuse-online-detection-removal-and-reporting-/public-consultation_en">a majority of respondents, both citizens and stakeholders, opposed imposing an obligation to use chat control.</a> Over 80% of respondents opposed its application to end-to-end encrypted communications.</p>



<p>Currently a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/">regulation</a> is in place <em>allowing</em> providers to scan communications voluntarily (so-called ‚ÄúChat Control 1.0‚Äù). So far only some unencrypted US communications services such as GMail, Facebook/Instagram Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, iCloud email and X-Box apply chat control voluntarily (more details <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/BOSE%20transparency%20report%20Dec%202022.pdf">here</a>). As a result of the mandatory Chat Control 2.0 proposal, the Commission expects a 3.5-fold increase in scanning reports (by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2022:0209:FIN:EN:PDF">354%</a>).</p>



<p>Parliament has positioned itself almost unanimously against indiscriminate chat control. With supporters and opponents of mandatory chat control irreconcilably opposed in the EU Council and no common position in sight, the EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=COM(2023)777&amp;lang=en">proposed</a> a two-year extension of voluntary chat control 1.0 in November 2023 ‚Äì see <a href="#timeline">timeline</a> and <a href="#documents-chatcontrol1">documents</a>. A victim of child sexual abuse and <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/meta-facebook-defends-error-prone-chat-control-csam-scanner-algorithms-in-court/">Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer have filed lawsuits</a> to stop the indiscriminate scanning by US big tech companies.</p>

<h3 id="epmandate">Changes proposed by the European Parliament</h3>



<p>In November 2023, the European Parliament nearly unanimously adopted a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CSAR_LIBE-Verhandlungsmandat.pdf">negotiating mandate</a> for the draft law. With the Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer, the most determined opponent of chat control sat at the negotiating table. The result: Parliament wants to pull the following fangs out of the EU Commission‚Äôs extreme draft:</p>



<ol>
<li>We want to safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and <strong>remove the plans for blanket chat control</strong>, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption</strong>. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>guarantee the right to anonymous communication</strong> and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face.</li>



<li><strong>Removing instead of blocking:</strong> Internet access blocking ist to be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked.</li>



<li>We prevent the digital house arrest: <strong>We don‚Äôt want to oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps</strong> ‚Äòfor their own protection‚Äô as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained.</li>
</ol>



<p>Parliament wants to protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission‚Äôs extreme proposal:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Security by design:</strong> In order to protect young people from grooming, Parliament wants internet services and apps to be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated.</li>



<li>In order to <strong>clean the net</strong> of child sexual abuse material, Parliament wants the new EU Child Protection Centre to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling could also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers.</li>



<li>Parliament wants to oblige providers who become aware of clearly illegal material to <strong>remove it</strong> ‚Äì unlike in the EU Commission‚Äôs proposal. Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material would be obliged to report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beware: This is only the Parliament‚Äôs negotiating mandate</strong>, which usually only partially prevails. Most EU governments continue to support the original chat control proposal of the EU Commission without significant compromises. However, many other governments prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority). As soon as the EU governments have reached an agreement in Council, Parliament, Council and Commission will start the so-called trilogue negotiations on the final version of the regulation. Patrick Breyer or his potential successor Anja Hirschel from the Pirate Party will again sit at the negotiating table to fight against chat control.</p>



<h2 id="councilpositions">Position of EU governments in Council</h2>



<p>Most EU governments continue to support the original extreme proposal of the EU Commission without making any significant improvements. Several other governments, however, prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority), so that proposed Council positions have already failed twice.</p>

<p><strong>2020: The European Commission proposed ‚Äútemporary‚Äù legislation allowing for chat control</strong></p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-300x158.png 300w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-768x403.png 768w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-600x315.png 600w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf">proposed ‚Äútemporary‚Äù legislation</a> allows the searching of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This allows the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process, in part using error-prone ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed (usually automatically and without human verification) to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>



<p><strong>6 July 2021: The European Parliament <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/" target="_blank">adopted the legislation allowing for chat control</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The European Parliament voted in favour for the ePrivacy Derogation, which allows for voluntary chat control for messaging and email providers. As a result of this some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls.</p>



<p><strong>9 May 2022: Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/destruction-of-digital-privacy-of-correspondence-lawsuit-filed-against-chat-control/">filed</a> a lawsuit against U.S. company Meta.</strong></p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications <strong>violates fundamental rights and is prohibited </strong>(paragraph 177). Former judge of the European Court of Justice Prof. Dr. Ninon Colneric has extensively analysed the plans and <strong>concludes in a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">legal assessment</a> that the EU legislative plans on chat control are not in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice and violate the fundamental rights of all EU citizens</strong> to respect for privacy, to data protection and to freedom of expression. On this basis the lawsuit was filed.</p>



<p><strong>11 Mai 2022: The Commission presented a proposal to make chat control mandatory for service providers.</strong></p>



<p>On 11 May 2022 the EU Commission made a second legislative proposal, in which <strong>the EU Commission obliges all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology in the absence of any suspicion. <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/">However, a representative survey conducted in March 2021 clearly shows that a majority of Europeans oppose the use of chat control¬†</a></strong><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/"> (</a><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">Detailed poll results here)</a><strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">.</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-affect-you">How does this affect you?</h2>



<p>Messaging and chat control scanning:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li>



<li>If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos</strong> may be viewed by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for ‚Äúchild grooming‚Äù frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li>



<li><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated </strong>for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual ‚Äúchild abuse material‚Äù. Nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù target minors.</li>



<li>On your next <strong>trip overseas,</strong> you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy ‚Äì with incalculable results.</li>



<li><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails. </strong>The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li>



<li><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li>
</ul>



<p>Age verification:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can <strong>no longer set up anonymous e-mail or messenger accounts or chat anonymously</strong> without needing to present an ID or your face, making you identifiable and risking data leaks. This inhibits for instance sensitive chats related to sexuality, anonymous media communications with sources (e.g. whistleblowers) as well as political activity.</li>



<li><strong>If you are under 17, you will no longer be able to install the following apps from the app store</strong> (reason given: risk of grooming): Messenger apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram or Twitter, social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok or Facebook, games such as FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, dating apps, video conferencing apps such as Zoom, Skype, Facetime.</li>



<li>If you don‚Äôt use an appstore, compliance with the provider‚Äôs minimum age will still be verified and enforced. <strong>If you are under the minimum age of 16 years you can no longer use Whatsapp</strong> due to the proposed age verification requirements; the same applies to the online functions of the game FIFA 23. <strong>If you are under 13 years old you‚Äôll no longer be able to use TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram.</strong></li>

<p>Do you fear that this law would cause <strong>massive damage</strong> to fundamental rights and is the wrong approach?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>What is important now is to <strong>increase pressure on the negotiators: </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Talk about it! Inform others about the dangers of chat control. <strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk">Here, you can find tweet templates, share pics and videos</a></strong>. Of course, you can also create your own images and videos.</td></tr><tr><td>Generate attention on social media! Use the hashtags <strong>#chatcontrol</strong> and <strong>#secrecyofcorrespondence</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Generate media attention! </strong>So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject ‚Äì online and offline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers!</strong> Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="Myths">Debunking Myths</h2>



<p>When the draft law on chat control was first presented in May 2022, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Commission promoted the controversial plan with various arguments.</a> In the following, various claims are questioned and debunked:</p>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999710" role="button"><strong>1. ‚ÄúToday, photos and videos depicting child sexual abuse are massively circulated on the Internet. In 2021, 29 million cases were reported to the U.S. National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.‚Äù</strong></h5><p>To speak exclusively of depictions of child sexual abuse in the context of chat control is misleading. To be sure, child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) is often footage of sexual violence against minors (child sexual abuse material, CSAM). However, an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/TerminologyGuidelines_en.pdf" target="_blank">international working group of child protection institutions points out</a> that criminal material also includes recordings of sexual acts or of sexual organs of minors in which no violence is used or no other person is involved. Recordings made in everyday situations are also mentioned, such as a family picture of a girl in a bikini or naked in her mother‚Äôs boots. Recordings made or shared without the knowledge of the minor are also covered. Punishable CSEM also includes comics, drawings, manga/anime, and computer-generated depictions of fictional minors. Finally, criminal depictions also include self-made sexual recordings of minors, for example, for forwarding to partners of the same age (‚Äúsexting‚Äù). The study therefore proposes the term ‚Äúdepictions of sexual exploitation‚Äù of minors as a correct description. In this context, recordings of children (up to 14 years of age) and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) are equally punishable.</p></div>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999711" role="button"><strong>2. ‚ÄúIn 2021 alone, 85 million images and videos of child sexual abuse were reported worldwide.‚Äù</strong></h5><div id="ac-5999711">
<p>There are many misleading claims circulating about how to quantify the extent of sexually exploitative images of minors (CSEM). The figure the EU Commission uses to defend its plans comes from the U.S. nongovernmental organization NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) and includes duplicates because CSEM is shared multiple times and often not deleted. Excluding duplicates, 22 million unique recordings remain of the 85 million reported.</p>



<p>75 percent of all NCMEC reports from 2021 came from Meta (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp). Facebook‚Äôs own internal analysis says that ‚Äúmore than 90 percent of [CSEM on Facebook in 2020] was identical or visually similar to previously reported content. And copies of just six videos were responsible for more than half of the child-exploitative content.‚Äù So the NCMEC‚Äôs much-cited numbers don‚Äôt really describe the extent of online recordings of sexual violence against children. Rather, they describe how often Facebook discovers copies of footage it already knows about. That, too, is relevant.</p>



<p>Not all unique recordings reported to NCMEC show violence against children. The 85 million depictions reported by NCMEC also include consensual sexting, for example. The number of depictions of abuse reported to NCMEC in 2021 was 1.4 million.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/blog/2020/we-are-in-danger-of-losing-the-global-battle-for-child-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7% of NCMEC‚Äôs global SARs go to the European Union.</a></p>



<p>Moreover, even on Facebook, where chat control has long been used voluntarily, the numbers for the dissemination of abusive material continue to rise. Chat control is thus not a solution.</p>

The very configuration of the algorithms has a large impact on the number of SARs. Moreover, the increase shows that the circulation of CSEM cannot be controlled by means of chat control.</p></div>

To screen cloud storage, it is not necessary to mandate the monitoring of everyone‚Äôs communications.

<h2 id="wrong-approach">Mass surveillance is the wrong approach to fighting ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù and sexual exploitation</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scanning private messages and chats does not contain the spread of CSEM.</strong> Facebook, for example, has been practicing chat control for years, and the number of automated reports has been increasing every year, most recently reaching 22 million in 2021. </li>



<li><strong>Mandatory chat control will not detect the perpetrators</strong> who record and share child sexual exploitation material. Abusers do not share their material via commercial email, messenger, or chat services, but organize themselves through self-run secret forums without control algorithms. Abusers also typically upload images and videos as encrypted archives and share only the links and passwords. Chat control algorithms do not recognize encrypted archives or links. </li>



<li><strong>The right approach would be to delete stored CSEM where it is hosted online.</strong> However, <a href="https://ipexl.europarl.europa.eu/IPEXL-WEB/download/file/082d2908811d46d301814771a13101cb">Europol does not report</a> known CSEM material. </li>



<li><strong>Chat control harms the prosecution of child abuse</strong> by flooding investigators will millions of automated reports, most of which are criminally irrelevant. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="message-and-chat">Message and chat control harms everybody</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime. </strong>Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring ‚Äì contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications. </strong>According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li>



<li><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed. </strong>Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/us/politics/edward-snowden-at-nsa-sexually-explicit-photos-often-shared.html?_r=0">reportedly</a> circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past. A Google engineer has been <a href="https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats">reported</a> to stalk minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual ‚Äúchild abuse material‚Äù.</li>



<li><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk. </strong>Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized. </strong>In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates to more intrusive technologies and legislation</strong>. Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or ‚Äúharmful content‚Äù. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="why-messaging-and-chat-control-harms-children-and-abuse-victims"><strong>Messaging and chat control harms children and abuse victims</strong></h2>



<p>Proponents claim indiscriminate messaging and chat control facilitates the prosecution of child sexual exploitation. However, this argument is controversial, even among victims of child sexual abuse. In fact messaging and chat control can hurt victims and potential victims of sexual exploitation:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Safe spaces are destroyed. </strong>Victims of sexual violence are especially in need of the ability to communicate safely and confidentially to seek counseling and support, for example to safely exchange among each other, with their therapists or attorneys. The introduction of real-time monitoring takes these safe rooms away from them. This can discourage victims from seeking help and support.</li>



<li><strong>Self-recorded nude photos of minors (sexting) end up in the hands of company employees</strong> and police where they do not belong and are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Minors are being criminalized. </strong>Especially young people often share intimate recordings with each other (sexting). With messaging and chat control in place, their photos and videos may end up in the hands of criminal investigators. German crime statistics demonstrate that nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all investigations for child pornography target minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the circulation of illegal material but </strong><strong>actually makes it more difficult to prosecute child sexual exploitation. </strong>It encourages offenders to go underground and use private encrypted servers which can be impossible to detect and intercept. Even on open channels, indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the volume of material circulated, as evidenced by the constantly rising number of machine reports.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>



<h3 id="Strengthening-the-capacity-of-law-enforcement"><strong>Strengthening the capacity of law enforcement</strong></h3>



<p>Currently, the capacity of law enforcement is so inadequate it often takes months and years to follow up on leads and analyse collected data. Known material is often neither analysed nor removed. Those behind the abuse do not share their material via Facebook or similar channels, but on the darknet. To track down perpetrators and producers, undercover police work must take place instead of wasting scarce capacities on checking often irrelevant machine reports. It is also essential to strengthen the responsible investigative units in terms of personnel and funding and financial resources, to ensure long-term, thorough and sustained investigations. Reliable standards/guidelines for the police handling of sexual abuse investgations need to be developed and adhered to.</p>



<h3 id="Addressing-not-only-symptoms"><strong>Addressing not only symptoms, but the root cause</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of ineffective technical attempts to contain the spread of exploitation material that has been released, all efforts must focus on preventing such recordings in the first place. Prevention concepts and training play a key role because the vast majority of abuse cases never even become known. Victim protection organisations often suffer from unstable funding.</p>



<h3 id="Fast-and-easily-available-support"><strong>Fast and easily available support for (potential) victims</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Mandatory reporting mechanisms at online services: </strong>In order to achieve effective prevention of online abuse and especially grooming, online services should be required to prominently place reporting functions on the platforms. If the service is aimed at and/or used by young people or children, providers should also be required to inform them about the risks of online grooming. </li>



<li><strong>Hotlines and counseling centers:</strong> Many national hotlines dealing with cases of reported abuse are struggling with financial problems. It is essential to ensure there is sufficient capacity to follow up on reported cases.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="Improving-media-literacy"><strong>Improving media literacy</strong></h3>



<p>Teaching digital literacy at an early age is an essential part of protecting for protecting children and young people online. The children themselves must have the knowledge and tools to navigate the Internet safely. They must be informed that dangers also lurk online and learn to recognise and question patterns of grooming. This could be achieved, for example, through targeted programs in schools and training centers, in which trained staff convey knowledge and lead discussions. Children need to learn to speak up, respond and report abuse, even if the abuse comes from within their sphere of trust (i.e., by people close to them or other people they know and trust), which is often the case. They also need to have access to safe, accessible, and age-appropriate channels to report abuse without fear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn the course of the initiative ‚ÄúFighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content‚Äù, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy [‚Ä¶]. The initiative would also severely harm Europe‚Äôs strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies.</p>

</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>Experts from the police and academia are rather critical of the EU‚Äôs plan: on the one hand, they fear many false reports by the scanners, and on the other hand, an alibi function of the law. Daniel Kretzschmar, spokesman for the Federal Board of the Association of German Criminal Investigators, says that the fight against child abuse depictions is ‚Äúenormously important‚Äù to his association. Nevertheless, he is skeptical: unsuspected persons could easily become the focus of investigations. At the same time, he says, privatizing these initiative investigations means ‚Äúmaking law enforcement dependent on these companies, which is actually a state and sovereign task. ‚Äú</p>



<p>Thomas-Gabriel R√ºdiger, head of the Institute for Cybercriminology at the Brandenburg Police University, is also rather critical of the EU project. ‚ÄúIn the end, it will probably mainly hit minors again,‚Äù he told WELT. R√ºdiger refers to figures from the crime statistics, according to which 43 percent of the recorded crimes in the area of child pornographic content would be traced back to children and adolescents themselves. This is the case, for example, with so-called ‚Äúsexting‚Äù and ‚Äúschoolyard pornography ‚Äú, when 13- and 14-year-olds send each other lewd pictures.</p>



<p>Real perpetrators, who you actually want to catch, would probably rather not be caught. ‚ÄúThey are aware of what they have done and use alternatives. Presumably, USB sticks and other data carriers will then be increasingly used again,‚Äù R√ºdiger continues.</p>
