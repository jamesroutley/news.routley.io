    <h1>The Privacy Sandbox on Android</h1>

          <div><p>Mobile apps are a core part of our everyday lives. Currently over 90% of the apps on Google Play are free, providing access to valuable content and services to billions of users. Digital advertising plays a key role in making this possible. But in order to ensure a healthy app ecosystem — benefiting users, developers and businesses — the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy. That’s why we originally developed <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en">advertising ID</a> to give users more control. Last year we <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html">introduced</a> improvements to these controls, but we believe it’s important to go further.</p><p>Today, we’re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the <a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a> on Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions. Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID. We’re also exploring technologies that reduce the potential for covert data collection, including safer ways for apps to integrate with advertising SDKs.</p><p>The Privacy Sandbox on Android builds on our <a href="https://web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox/">existing efforts on the web</a>, providing a clear <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/path-forward-privacy-sandbox/">path forward</a> to improve user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk.</p><h3>Blunt approaches are proving ineffective</h3><p>​​We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that — without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path — such approaches can be <a href="https://blog.lockdownprivacy.com/2021/09/22/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html">ineffective</a> and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses.</p><p>Our goal with the Privacy Sandbox on Android is to develop effective and privacy enhancing advertising solutions, where users know their information is protected, and developers and businesses have the tools to succeed on mobile. While we design, build and test these new solutions, we plan to support existing ads platform features for at least two years, and we intend to provide substantial notice ahead of any future changes.</p><h3>Working with the industry</h3><p>Starting today, developers can review our initial design proposals and share feedback on the <a href="https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/ads">Android developer site</a>. We plan to release developer previews over the course of the year, with a beta release by the end of the year. We&#39;ll provide regular updates on designs and timelines, and you can also <a href="https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/ads/subscribe">sign up</a> to receive updates.</p><p>We know this initiative needs input from across the industry in order to succeed. We’ve already heard from many partners about their interest in working together to improve ads privacy on Android, and invite more organizations to participate.</p></div>
