<p>On January 12th, 2023, without warning, Elon Musk ordered his employees at Twitter to suspend access to 3rd party clients which instantly locked out hundreds of thousands of users from accessing Twitter from their favorite clients. We’ve invested over 10 years building Tweetbot for Twitter and it was shut down in a blink of an eye. We are very sorry to all of our customers who chose Tweetbot as their way to interact with Twitter’s service and we thank you so much for the many years of support and feedback.</p>
<p>While it is time for us to lay it to rest, a new bot will rise in its place and be greater than Tweetbot ever was. Built on an open and free platform, we are proud to introduce <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> for <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>. We have taken everything great about Tweetbot and used it as the starting point for the future of Ivory. We have great plans to make Ivory better than Tweetbot ever could be. We hope you join us on this journey to help make Mastodon a success. Follow us at <a href="https://tapbots.social/@tapbots">@tapbots</a> and <a href="https://tapbots.social/@ivory">@ivory</a> on Mastodon to keep up with the latest news from us.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
