<h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>a computer club is where a group of people hang out and do computer together</p>

<h2>WHAT IS &#34;DOING COMPUTER&#34;?</h2>
<p>doing computer is whatever you want...on computers, together. our bias is towards programming and <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> shared computing infrastructure. but there&#39;s also art and music and open data science and circuit-bending and a million other things we don&#39;t know about</p>

<h2>WHY SHOULD I START A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>the political economy of computing is awful. have you read <a dir="ltr" lang="en" href="https://bookwyrm.social/book/525851/s/palo-alto"> palo alto</a>? me neither. we should read it. we deserve better than the <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> darpa-funded </span> visions of <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> xerox parc </span> technologists</p>
<p>make the political economy of computing less awful and bring it home to you and yours by starting a computer club in the place that you live</p>

<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>we can&#39;t make you do anything, so do whatever you want. but these are the things we think are really important</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>hang out in real life:</strong> online has rude vibes, real life has kinder vibes. hang out in real life for trust and strength and to ground your computer club in your actual local context</li>
    <li><strong>reject corporate sponsorship:</strong> corporate sponsorship constrains behavior and undermines collective ownership. computer club isn&#39;t yours if a corporate sponsor might get upset by something you do</li>
    <li><strong>computer club is a collective project:</strong> you don&#39;t need a mission statement, but you might have an ethos that defines your computer club. computer club is beholden only to that ethos and the people who show up</li>
</ul>

<h2>GUIDELINES</h2>
<p>we still can&#39;t make you do anything, so continue doing whatever you want. but these are things we think are important to think about</p>
<ul>
    <li>computing is political, so let computer club be political too</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules"><span dir="ltr" lang="en"> recurse center </span> social rules</a> foster collaboration and psychological safety, consider using them</li>
    <li>be inspired by permaculture</li>
    <li>be inspired by small web</li>
    <li>be inspired by <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> culture</li>
    <li>be inspired by computing as a medium through which better things are possible</li>
    <li>try to host computer club&#39;s stuff on your own computers in the place that you live</li>
    <li>be open to interdisciplinary computing</li>
    <li>be open to different histories and &#34;skill levels&#34; with computing</li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW SHOULD I START THE COMPUTER CLUB</h2>
<p>there are lots of ways to start a computer club; how you start will be unique to yours. but you could try</p>
<ul>
    <li>talk about what used to excite you about doing computer. talk about how the political economy of computing could be better. talk about these things publicly. the computer club might already be breathing in the communities you&#39;re in</li>
    <li>attend preexisting computing meetups and find like-minded people. meetups about &#34;how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> apolitically&#34; are sidelining people who want &#34;how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> pro-socially.&#34; don&#39;t try to be a recruiter -- just be excited at events and find people who are also excited</li>
    <li>does your city have a food coop? food coops and computer clubs have a similar ethos; and food coops are a great place to get your food for the same reasons that a computer club is a great place to do computer. make friends at your food coop and find the computer-doers</li>
    <li>join a project or start a project and talk to people there about starting a computer club. are you or someone you know doing<ul>
        <li>web design for a <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> venue? work together!</li>
        <li>technical support for a cool local project? work together!</li>
        <li>communications for your neighborhood&#39;s nascent mesh network? work together!</li>
        <li>analysis for local open data projects? work together!</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>talk to existing computer clubs!</li>
</ul>
