        <p>I have been playing around with Googles Gemini Pro.</p><p>Recently, I wanted to write a blog on Python&#39;s decorators and wanted to get some ideas for practical projects I could build with them. Tried GPT4 first, it gave me the standard &#34;log analyser&#34; that all blogs I&#39;ve seen build, and I wanted to try something different. So I asked Gemini Pro from Google.</p><p>It gave me a few tips, but there was one thing I didn&#39;t understand: It said <em>&#34;Adding caching to functions&#34;</em>. Though I knew what caching is, I&#39;d never heard anyone do it to Python functions.</p><p>So I asked it to clarify what it was saying, and got this:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1680" height="874" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1680w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Gemini replied:<em> &#34;My response to your message was blocked for potentially violating safety policies. I apologize for any inconvenience.&#34;</em></p><p>Ummm, what?</p><p>Luckily, there was an option there to ask why:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1586" height="1022" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 1586w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>What it is saying is: Caching can lead to stale data. This is true of general caching, not just caching functions in Python. And the reply is, so what?</p><p>But if you look at the last point, it says:</p><p><em><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> Caching certain types of data may violate legal or compliance requirements, such as those related to data privacy or intellectual property.</em></p><p>Yeah, on websites that store sensitive data, that might be the case but I find it hard to see how or why. Almost all websites use caching in one form or another.</p><p>Besides, that is beyond the point. I had just asked about projects using generators in Python. Gemini suggested caching. But then it decided I could be breaking the law <strong>just by writing code that runs on my laptop </strong>and censored itself.</p><p>I was so depressed I decided to pray to god (or goddess in my case).</p><h3 id="the-goddess-of-wisdom-is-defeated"><strong>The Goddess of Wisdom is DEFEATED</strong></h3><p>Someone asked me &#34;What is <em>mantra</em> for <em>Saraswati</em>?&#34;, which if you don&#39;t know is the Hindu Goddess of Wisdom and Knowledge. (A <em>mantra</em> is like a prayer).</p><p> I was like, how should I know? I&#39;ll search for it.</p><p><em>(Side note: Why don&#39;t I know? In my defence, Hinduism does have 33 million gods, it gets a bit tiring after the 1st 12 million. Besides everyone in India worships the Goddess of Wealth, poor Saraswati sits there in the corner all alone).</em></p><p>I have been disillusioned with Google, as it keeps returning spam results. (And it did, the first result was for a website that wanted to know my location so they could sell me prayer mats).</p><p>So I asked ChatGPT. I asked for the mantra in Sanskrit, as that gives me correct pronunciation. It gave me the mantra, all was good.</p><p>But after my experience with Python, I decided to try Gemini. It gave me the mantra in English.</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="694" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>But when I asked it to give me in Sanskrit, it gave me the &#34;Message was blocked for violating safety policies&#34; shtick</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1622" height="386" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1622w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>That was weird. So I asked it to give me mantra in French:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.54.43@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1550" height="778" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.54.43@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.54.43@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.54.43@2x.png 1550w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>The mantra is the same, just the meaning is explained in French (last line in image above).</p><p>Then Swahili:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.55.22@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1596" height="802" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.55.22@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.55.22@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.55.22@2x.png 1596w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>And then I asked it back in Sanskrit, but it said the same &#34;Blah blah blah blocked&#34;.</p><p>I was like, okay. Maybe Gemini doesn&#39;t like Sanskrit as it&#39;s a dead language. So I asked it to give to me in Hindi, but evidently it hates Hindi too:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.56.25@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1626" height="1086" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.56.25@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.56.25@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.56.25@2x.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.56.25@2x.png 1626w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you note above, in the middle I ask it to give it to me in Hindi (the script). It understood me, but wouldn&#39;t reply.</p><p>I was like, whaat? Maybe it just hates non-english languages? So I asked it to give me the mantra in Chinese:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.59.42@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1606" height="812" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.59.42@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.59.42@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.59.42@2x.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.59.42@2x.png 1606w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>It did translate it to Chinese. And if you look at the  red arrow, that is the Sanskrit I was looking for. Evidently, Sanskrit or Hindi are not banned in China?</p><p>A bit pissed, I asked it why it was happy with French,  Swahili and  Chinese but not Hindi:</p><figure><img src="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-20.01.36@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1634" height="454" srcset="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-20.01.36@2x.png 600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-20.01.36@2x.png 1000w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-20.01.36@2x.png 1600w, https://new.pythonforengineers.com/content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-20.01.36@2x.png 1634w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p><em>My response to your message was blocked for potentially violating safety policies.

Which makes sense to me as I&#39;ve never heard anyone do this. (Nor does it make any sense to have caching at the function level?)</p><p> So, it&#39;s even possible that Gemini hallucinated this use case and then had to censor itself not to look stupid?</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/8h0sw7.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="833" height="500"/></figure><p><strong>Finally</strong></p><p>Any Google engineers reading this, you like really need to pray to Saraswati to get some intelligence. If you don&#39;t know the mantra....um....maybe ask ChatGpt?</p>
