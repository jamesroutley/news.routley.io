DuckDuckGo is currently turning up seven links when searching Reddit, but provides no data on where the links go or why, instead only saying that ‚ÄúWe would like to show you a description here but the site won&#39;t allow us.‚Äù Older results will still show up, but these search engines are no longer able to ‚Äúcrawl‚Äù Reddit, meaning that Google is the only search engine that will turn up results from Reddit going forward. Searching for Reddit still works on <a href="https://www.404media.co/friendship-ended-with-google-now-kagi-is-my-best-friend/" rel="noreferrer">Kagi</a>, an independent, paid search engine that buys part of its search index from Google.</p><p>The news shows how Google‚Äôs near monopoly on search is now actively hindering other companies‚Äô ability to compete at a time when Google is facing increasing criticism over the quality of its search results. And while neither Reddit or Google responded to a request for comment, it appears that the exclusion of other search engines is the result of a multi-million dollar deal that gives Google the right to scrape Reddit for data to train its AI products.</p><p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre [Reddit] killing everything for search but Google,‚Äù Colin Hayhurst, CEO of the search engine Mojeek told me on a call.¬†</p>
