    <h1>Court rejects Verizon claim that selling location data without consent is legal</h1>

<p>Instead of providing notice to customers and obtaining or verifying customer consent itself, Verizon &#34;largely delegated those functions via contract,&#34; the court said. This system and its shortcomings were revealed in 2018 when &#34;the New York Times published an article reporting security breaches involving Verizon&#39;s (and other major carriers&#39;) location-based services program,&#34; the court said.</p>
<p>Securus Technologies, a provider of communications services to correctional facilities, &#34;was misusing the program to enable law enforcement officers to access location data <em>without</em> customers&#39; knowledge or consent, so long as the officers uploaded a warrant or some other legal authorization,&#34; the ruling said. A Missouri sheriff &#34;was able to access customer data with no legal process at all&#34; because Securus did not review the documents that law enforcement uploaded.</p>
<p>Verizon claimed that Section 222 of the Communications Act covers only call-location data, as opposed to device location data. The court disagreed, pointing to the law&#39;s text stating that customer proprietary network information includes data that is related to the location of a telecommunications service, and which is made available to the carrier &#34;solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Device-location data comfortably satisfies both conditions,&#34; the court said.</p>
<h2>Verizon chose to pay fine, giving up right to jury trial</h2>
<p>As for Verizon&#39;s claim that the FCC violated its right to a jury trial, the court said that &#34;Verizon could have gotten such a trial&#34; if it had &#34;declined to pay the forfeiture and preserved its opportunity for a <em>de novo</em> jury trial if the government sought to collect.&#34; Instead, Verizon chose to pay the fine &#34;and seek immediate review in our Court.&#34;</p>
<p>By contrast, the 5th Circuit decision in AT&amp;T&#39;s favor said the FCC &#34;acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge,&#34; violating the right to a jury trial. The 5th Circuit said it was guided by the Supreme Court&#39;s June 2024 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859_1924.pdf">ruling</a> in <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em>, which held that &#34;when the SEC seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the Seventh Amendment entitles the defendant to a jury trial.&#34;</p>
<p>The 2nd Circuit ruling said there are key differences between US telecom law and the securities laws considered in <em>Jarkesy</em>. It&#39;s because of those differences that Verizon had the option of declining to pay the penalty and preserving its right to a jury trial, the court said.</p>
<p>In the <em>Jarkesy</em> case, the problem &#34;was that the SEC could &#39;siphon&#39; its securities fraud claims away from Article III courts and compel payment without a jury trial,&#34; the 2nd Circuit panel said. &#34;The FCC&#39;s forfeiture order, however, does not, by itself, compel payment. The government needs to initiate a collection action to do that. Against this backdrop, the agency&#39;s proceedings before a ยง 504(a) trial create no Seventh Amendment injury.&#34;</p>
