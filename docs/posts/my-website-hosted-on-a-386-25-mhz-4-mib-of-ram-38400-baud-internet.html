<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I, Serentty (real name withheld, but probably ridiculously easy to find) am
a linguistics student at York University in Toronto, and an avid computer
hobbyist. I collect the latest machines such as IBM clones, Commodore
8-bitters, and dabble in networking.
</p>
<h2>About Serentty’s Compunet</h2>
<p>
This page is being served from a 386SX at 25 MHz, running MS-DOS 6.22. This
machine is from 1992, making it about as old as this new information
superhighway called the World Wide Web that I keep hearing about.
It currently has 4 MiB of RAM, and is connected through a 38400 baud serial
link. The HTML has all been written in the MS-DOS editor (technically the
FreeDOS one since it has some nice features). This page will probably not
be up 24/7 at first, since I like using this machine for other things, but
perhaps I will eventually find some other way to host it using less power
and making less noise. VIC-20 maybe? Let me know if you would be okay with
the longer load times over 9600 baud.
</p>
<h3>CloudFlare!</h3>
<p>
I am not sure how everyone managed to do it, but you managed to overload a
state-of-the-art 386, leaving the site nearly entirely unaccessible.
Thankfully, there is a service called CloudFlare which will cache requests.
They probably have a lot of bandwidth—maybe even a 115200 baud modem!
They seem to be keeping up. The 386 is still running and handling lots of
requests.
</p>
<p>
This page is served using the brand-new UTF-8 encoding! Technically it is
only using the ASCII subset and is thus identical to ASCII at the moment,
and I will use HTML escapes for anything outside the ASCII range. After all,
UTF-8 is brand new and many browsers do not support it yet. However, when
the time comes, this page should be future-proofed for the new,
international and multilingual World Wide Web! Look out for pages on here
dealing with linguistics and ancient languages in the future. Truly fitting
for a website with a .COM domain name—those are worth their weight in
gold.
</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
You can find my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Serentty">here</a>.
I work on bringing support for Rust-based development to the latest machines
such as the Commodore 64 and 386 PCs. I have gotten Rust to compile for 386
DOS machines before, but that stagnated after a while. Now that I have my
386 networked, I plan on getting protected mode through DPMI working, since
Rust and LLVM require at least a 386 anyway, and using a flat memory model
makes Rust’s pointers and safety guarantees easier to work with.
</p>
<p>
However, as a 386-class machine is expensive and out of reach for many
people, I am also excited to work with new technologies such as LLVM-MOS to bring Rust
to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. A user called MRK-ITS has already made a
fork of the Rust compiler that targets 6502 processors and clones using
LLVM-MOS, so I plan on working on wrapper libraries and such that make
acessing the VIC-II and SID easy from Rust without having to poke around at
hardware addresses manually. The compiler will inline such functions and
generate assembly similar to what you would write by hand for these things
in many cases. We truly are living in a new age of structured programming!
</p>
<h2>Accessing the World Wide Web</h2>
<p>
Many users of recent machines such as IBM clones, Tandy PCs, Commodore
8-bitters, Amigas, and so on have reported issues accessing the World Wide
Web because of a technology called HTTPS which seems not to have been
updated to handle the latest browsers, such as Netscape 3. To deal with
this, there are many tools available that will serve pages to you without
HTTPS, such as <a href="http://frogfind.com">Frogfind</a> and
<a href="http://theoldnet.com">The Old Net</a>.
</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>
You can reach me on GitHub (user: Serentty), or Discord
(user: Serentty#2181). Alternatively, mention @Serentty#2181 (the Discord
user) on #retrodreams on SlashNet IRC, and hopefully it will ping me. No
email address currently, since bots will mine it, but if this website gets
somewhere I might create one for feedback.
