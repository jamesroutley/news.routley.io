    <h1>Brazilian Amazon lost 18 trees per second in 2021</h1>

<p>The Brazilian Amazon lost about 18 trees per second in 2021 as deforestation in the country increased by more than 20 percent, according to a satellite data-based report released Monday.</p>
<p>The Mapbiomas report said the country lost some 16,557 square kilometres (1.65 million hectares) of indigenous vegetation in 2021 – an area bigger than Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2020, the area lost was 13,789 square kilometres.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 percent of land deforested in 2021 was in the Amazon, the world&#39;s largest tropical rainforest, the report said.</p>
<p>&#34;In the Amazon alone, 111.6 hectares per hour or 1.9 hectares per minute were deforested, which is equivalent to about 18 trees per second,&#34; according to Mapbiomas, a network of NGOs, universities and technology companies.</p>
<p>Clearing land for farming was the main driver, accounting for almost 97 percent, it said, with illegal mining also a major factor.</p>
<p>In the last three years, coinciding with the presidency of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, the tree cover lost in Brazil was about 42,000 square kilometres – &#34;almost the area of the state of Rio de Janeiro,&#34; said the report.</p>
<p>Data from the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) show that between January and June 2022, the Brazilian Amazon lost 3,988 square kilometres to deforestation.</p>
<p>And government statistics state that average annual Brazilian Amazon deforestation increased by 75 percent during Bolsonaro&#39;s presidency compared to a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Environmentalists accuse Bolsonaro of actively encouraging deforestation for economic gain and of weakening research and protection agencies.</p>
