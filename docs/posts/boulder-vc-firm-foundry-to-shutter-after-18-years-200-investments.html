    <h1>Boulder VC firm Foundry to shutter after 18 years, 200 investments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dev="content stream"><!----><div data-dev="content body"><!--[--><p>After raising a new fund every three to four years, a Boulder venture capital firm is calling it quits.</p><p>Foundry announced on Jan. 19 that its current fund will be its last. This $500 million fund, called Foundry 2022, was announced in May but investments began in 2022.</p><p>“While VC firms rarely make decisions like this, it’s precisely what we planned to do when we started Foundry in 2006,” Seth Levine, co-founder and partner at Foundry, wrote in a blog post. “From our founding, we intentionally decided not to build a legacy or generational firm — one meant to live beyond the tenure of the founding partners. Instead, we intended to focus on the work of investing, re-evaluating each potential new fund as our fundraising cadence required.”</p><p>Foundry was born and raised in Boulder, co-founded by Levine, Brad Feld and Ryan McIntyre, who believed great companies could be built anywhere.</p><p>For the last 18 years, it has invested in more than 200 early-stage tech companies and early-stage venture funds across the U.S. Its portfolio includes local names like Havenly, SendGrid, Infleqtion (<a data-ct="Article: In-Content Link" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2022/11/01/boulders-coldquanta-fundraise.html" data-link="1">formerly ColdQuanta</a>), JumpCloud, <a data-ct="Article: In-Content Link" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/inno/stories/fundings/2022/01/19/spekit-series-b-denver-startup-onboarding-learning.html" data-link="1">Spekit</a>, Gnip and <a data-ct="Article: In-Content Link" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/inno/stories/fundings/2021/06/01/the-pros-closet-raises-40-million.html" data-link="1">The Pro’s Closet</a>, and national brands such as Fitbit, Rover, Help Scout and Seat Geek.</p><p>Foundry has 70 active investments, 100 general partners and a whopping 1,900 Foundry network companies, according to its website.</p><p>As of January 2023, the firm had $4.29 billion under management, <a data-ct="Article: In-Content Link" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/subscriber-only/2023/09/15/2023-denver-area-venture-capital-firms.html" data-link="1">according to Denver Business Journal research</a>.</p><p>In 2016, the firm expanded its reach and began investing in other venture firms. To date, Foundry has invested in approximately 50 venture firms, including California-based Bonfire Ventures and K9 Ventures and Boulder-based Matchstick Ventures and Techstars.</p><p>“We are passionate advocates for the power of entrepreneurship, believing in its ability to transform people and communities, and have tried to be supportive of entrepreneurs around the country and the world, even when we weren’t direct investors,” Levine wrote.</p><p>Startup coach and serial entrepreneur Eric Marcoullier echoed these remarks.</p><p>Marcoullier said his career traces back to Feld and Foundry. Feld was an early user and advocate for Marcoullier’s first business venture and wrote the company’s first “hard-circled angel check,” Marcoullier said in a <a data-ct="Article: In-Content Link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7154165311611518976/" target="_blank" data-link="1" rel="nofollow noopener">LinkedIn post</a>. Marcoullier said he also pitched Feld various startup ideas, eventually landing on Gnip, which Foundry invested in before the company sold to Twitter in 2014.</p><p>“I am vocal that I don’t think that VCs are the right choice for a majority of startups,” Marcoullier wrote. “... I also want to be very vocal that Foundry and its partners have been an extreme and consistent force for good for Boulder, for Colorado and for entrepreneurs everywhere.”</p><p>Levine said the work at Foundry isn’t done yet. It plans to continue making investments and lead Series A and B rounds out of Foundry 2022.</p><p>“Given the lifespan of venture funds, we expect to continue this work for at least the next decade,” he wrote. “Our work continues to energize us, and we are as committed as ever to the mission of Foundry — building a network of entrepreneurs, investors and LPs that benefits everyone in our ecosystem.”</p><p>Foundry isn’t the only VC firm to recently close.
