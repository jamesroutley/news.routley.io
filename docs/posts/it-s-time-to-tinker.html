    <h1>It&#39;s time to tinker</h1>
    
    <p>I just announced at Monzo that I&#8217;m stepping away from leading Monzo&#8217;s product organisation. Now is a good time to do this because Monzo is doing incredibly well.</p><p>Just in the past few months we&#8217;ve shipped three Zero to One products: Monzo Flex, Monzo Pay and Monzo Trends. These new products are doing great. And we&#8217;ve already shipped tons of improvements to these brand new products. All the graphs are going up and to the right. We&#8217;ve hired a ton of excellent people. And we just raised a lot of money.</p><p>I first got involved with Monzo three years ago when Tom Blomfield asked me if I wanted &#8220;a hobby&#8221; helping him build Monzo. That conversation led to me spending a day a week at the Monzo offices as an advisor. That day led to two, then three, then four days. By the end of 2019 I was basically doing a job and not just advising, and Tom asked me to officially join full time and accept a title. So I did. </p><p>I joined as Chief Product Officer in February of 2020. I started as CPO only a few weeks before the first Lockdown. Like a lot of companies, Covid hit us hard. It was difficult, but we got through it. We rebuilt and came out stronger. And now we&#8217;re shipping great products at pace. </p><p>Our products make our customers&#8217; lives better. We&#8217;ve been taking the single greatest source of anxiety in people&#8217;s lives and making it better. Only a third of UK adults say they feel in control of their finances but more than two thirds of Monzo's customers say they feel in control of their finances.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;m incredibly proud of how we improve customers' lives, the pace at which we're shipping high quality products, and the way our graphs are moving up and to the right. But I want to work across a broader range of industries and I feel free to do so now that Monzo's doing so well.&nbsp;</p><h2>What I&#8217;ll be doing </h2><p>I&#8217;ll be: </p><ol><li><p>Angel investing</p></li><li><p>Helping out as a non-exec director</p></li><li><p>Tinkering, building and learning</p></li></ol><h3>Angel Investing </h3><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinehudack/">Caroline</a> and I have been investing a lot lately, and we&#8217;ve been really enjoying the opportunity to support some great entrepeneurs. We&#8217;re really proud of our investments in companies like <a href="https://practice.do/">Practice</a>, <a href="https://incident.io/">incident.io</a> and <a href="https://www.multiverse.io/en-US?utm_term=multiverse&amp;utm_campaign=B2B+%7C+BAU+-+Brand+-+Multiverse+%7C+SRCH+%7C+BOFU+%7C+US+%7C+US+%7C+AW2MU6C1080&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=3167436195&amp;hsa_cam=14598040786&amp;hsa_grp=129542620920&amp;hsa_ad=556901990842&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-487657406820&amp;hsa_kw=multiverse&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAk4aOBhCTARIsAFWFP9HeRk2zlLTXUBRypf9KkpxSpxqhw8EMXCYpKnyKEkgntTYXaROwbwkaAn3UEALw_wcB">Multiverse</a>, and we&#8217;re hoping to develop relationships with more great entrepreneurs.</p><p>We work together as a team. Caroline brings deep marketing experience &#8212; she's CMO at <a href="https://impala.travel/">Impala</a>, was the sole product marketer on News Feed back in the day, and ran European marketing for both Airbnb and Facebook's consumer business. I bring, well, whatever it is that I do.</p><h3>Helping out as a non-exec </h3><p>I recently joined the Board of Trustees at BookTrust, the UK&#8217;s largest children&#8217;s reading charity. Our mission is to engage every child with books. This is something near and dear to my heart. I wasn&#8217;t very good at school and dropped out early. But my parents and my brother instilled a deep love of reading in me. Books were &#8212; and are &#8212; an incredibly important part of my life. I feel privileged to help an organisation give more children this gift.</p><p>And I&#8217;ve been on the board of&nbsp;<a href="https://vidiq.com/">VidIQ</a>&nbsp;for a while now. It was started by a really good friend of mine &#8212; our start-ups competed with each other more than a decade ago &#8212; and it&#8217;s been a joy to help out.</p><p>I think there are also interesting opportunities to advise start-ups and entrepreneurs to help them figure out what to build and how to build those things well. I figure I might do some of this, too.</p><h3>Tinkering, building and learning</h3><p>I'm a builder at heart. I&#8217;m fascinated by a lot of things, and I have a lot of ideas. I want to learn a lot more about Web3, and quickly. </p><p>I have some ideas about how to build healthier, deeper conversational places on the internet. I&#8217;m fascinated by the idea that gig economy workers could participate in the financial upside of the networks that they help build. And, maybe most of all, I&#8217;m interested in building real, portable identity for the internet. </p><h3>Next steps </h3><p>It took a lot of work to get to this point, and I'm really happy about it. I'm already reaching out to a few people to ask their advice on some things I want to build. And, of course, I'm going to write even more. I can't wait.</p>
