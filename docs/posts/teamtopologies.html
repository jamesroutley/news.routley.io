<p>Any large software effort, such as the software estate for a large
    company, requires a lot of people - and whenever you have a lot of people
    you have to figure out how to divide them into effective teams. Forming
    <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html">Business Capability Centric</a> teams helps software efforts to
    be responsive to customersâ€™ needs, but the range of skills required often
    overwhelms such teams. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1942788819&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">Team Topologies</a> is a model
    for describing the organization of software development teams,
    developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. It defines four forms
    of teams and three modes of team
    interactions. The model encourages healthy interactions that allow 
    business-capability centric teams to flourish in their task of providing a
    steady flow of valuable software.</p>

<p>The primary kind of team in this framework is the <b>stream-aligned
    team</b>, a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html">Business Capability Centric</a> team that is
    responsible for software for a single business capability. These are
    long-running teams, thinking of their efforts as providing a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html">software
    product</a> to enhance the business capability.</p>

<p>Each stream-aligned team is full-stack and full-lifecycle: responsible for
    front-end, back-end, database,
    business analysis, feature prioritization,
    UX, testing, deployment, monitoring - the
    whole enchilada of software development.
    They are <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html">Outcome Oriented</a>, focused on business outcomes rather than <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">Activity Oriented</a> teams focused on a function such as business
    analysis, testing, or databases.
    But they also shouldn&#39;t be too
    large, ideally each one is a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html">Two Pizza Team</a>. A large
    organization will have many such teams, and while they have different
    business capabilities to support, they have common needs such as data
    storage, network communications, and observability.</p>

<p>A small team like this calls for ways to reduce their cognitive load, so they
    can concentrate on supporting the business needs, not on (for example) data
    storage issues. An important part of doing this is to build on a platform
    that takes care of these non-focal concerns. For many teams a platform can
    be a widely available third party platform, such as Ruby on Rails for a
    database-backed web application. But for many products there is no
    single off-the-shelf platform to use, a team is going to have to find and
    integrate several platforms. In a larger organization they will have to
    access a range of internal services and follow corporate standards.</p>

<h3><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html">What I Talk About When I Talk About Platforms</a></h3>

<div>
<p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms/meta.png"/></p>

<p>
    These days everyone is building a &#39;platform&#39; to speed up delivery of
    digital products at scale.  But what makes an effective digital platform? Some
    organisations stumble when they attempt to build on top of their existing
    shared services without first addressing their organisational structure and
    operation model.
  </p>


</div>
</div>

<p>This problem can be addressed by building an internal platform for the
    organization. Such a platform can do that integration of third-party
    services, near-complete platforms, and internal services. Team Topologies
    classifies the team that builds this (unimaginatively-but-wisely) as a <b>platform
    team</b>.</p>

<p>Smaller organizations can work with a single platform team, which
    produces a thin layer over an externally provided set of products. Larger
    platforms, however, require more people than can be fed with two-pizzas.
    The authors are thus moving to describe a <b>platform grouping</b>
    of many platform teams.</p>

<p>An important characteristic of a platform is that it&#39;s designed to be used
    in a mostly self-service fashion. The stream-aligned teams are still
    responsible for the operation of their product, and direct their use of the
    platform without expecting an elaborate collaboration with the platform team.
    In the Team Topologies framework, this interaction mode is referred to as
    <b>X-as-a-Service mode</b>, with the platform acting as a service to the
    stream-aligned teams.</p>

<p>Platform teams, however, need to build their services as products
    themselves, with a deep understanding of their customer&#39;s needs. This often
    requires that they use a different interaction mode, one of <b>collaboration
    mode</b>, while they build that service. Collaboration mode is a more
    intensive partnership form of interaction, and should be seen as a temporary
    approach until the platform is mature enough to move to x-as-a service
    mode.</p>

<p>So far, the model doesn&#39;t represent anything particularly inventive.
    Breaking organizations down between business-aligned and technology support
    teams is an approach as old as enterprise software. In recent years, plenty
    of writers have expressed the importance of making these business capability
    teams be responsible for the full-stack and the full-lifecycle. For me, the
    bright insight of Team Topologies is focusing on the problem that having
    business-aligned teams that are full-stack and full-lifecycle means that
    they are often faced with an excessive cognitive load, which works against
    the desire for small, responsive teams. The key benefit of a
    platform is that it <i>reduces this cognitive load</i>.</p>

<p>A crucial insight of Team Topologies is that the primary benefit of a
    platform is to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned
    teams</p>

<p>This insight has profound implications. For a start it alters how
    platform teams should think about the platform. Reducing client teams&#39;
    cognitive load leads to different design decisions and product roadmap to
    platforms intended primarily for standardization or cost-reduction. 
    Beyond the platform this insight leads Team Topologies to develop their model
    further by identifying two more kinds of team.</p>

<p>Some capabilities require specialists who can put considerable time and
    energy into mastering a topic important to many stream-aligned teams. A
    security specialist may spend more time studying security issues and
    interacting with the broader security community than would be possible as a
    member of a stream-aligned team. Such people congregate in <b>enabling
    teams</b>, whose role is to grow relevant skills inside other teams
    so that those teams can remain independent and better own and evolve their
    services.
    To achieve this enabling teams primarily use the third and final interaction
    mode in Team Topologies. <b>Facilitating mode</b>
    involves a coaching role, where the enabling team isn&#39;t there to write and
    ensure conformance to standards, but instead to educate and coach their colleagues so
    that the stream-aligned teams become more autonomous.</p>

<p>Stream-aligned teams are responsible for the whole stream of value for their
    customers, but occasionally we find aspects of a stream-aligned team&#39;s work
    that is sufficiently demanding that it needs a dedicated group to focus on
    it, leading to the fourth and final type of team:
    <b>complicated-subsystem team</b>. The goal of a complicated-subsystem
    team is to reduce the cognitive load of the stream-aligned teams that use
    that complicated subsystem. That&#39;s a worthwhile division even if there&#39;s
    only one client team for that subsystem. Mostly complicated-subsystem teams strive to interact
    with their clients using x-as-a service mode, but will need to
    use collaboration mode for short periods.</p>

      Team Topologies includes a set of graphical symbols to illustrate teams
      and their relationships. These shown here are from the <a href="https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-Shape-Templates">current standards</a>, which differ from those used in
      the book. A <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies">recent article</a> elaborates on
      how to use these diagrams.</p>
</div>

<p>Team Topologies is designed explicitly recognizing the influence of
    <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html">Conways Law</a>. The team organization that it encourages
    takes into account the interplay between human and software organization.
    Advocates of Team Topologies intend its team structure to shape the future
    development of the software architecture into responsive and decoupled
    components aligned to business needs.</p>

<p>George Box neatly quipped: &#34;all models are wrong, some are useful&#34;. Thus
    Team Topologies is wrong: complex organizations cannot be
    simply broken down into just four kinds of teams and three kinds of
    interactions. But constraints like this are what makes a model useful. Team
    Topologies is a tool that impels people to evolve their organization into a more effective
    way of operating, one that allows stream-aligned teams to maximize their
    flow by lightening their cognitive load.

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>The best treatment of the Team Topologies framework is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1942788819&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">the book</a> of the same name, published in 2019. The authors
      also maintain the <a href="https://teamtopologies.com">Team Topologies</a> website
      and provide education and training services. Their recent article on <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies">team interaction modeling</a> is a good intro to
      how the Team Topologies (meta-)model can be used to build and evolve a
      model of an organization. </p>

<p>Much of Team Topologies is based on the notion of Cognitive Load. The
      authors <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters">explored cognitive load</a> in Tech Beacon. Jo Pearce expanded on how
      cognitive load may <a href="https://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2015/12/day-3-managing-cognitive-load-for-team-learning/">apply to software
      development</a>.</p>

<p>The model in Team Topologies resonates well with much of the thinking
      on software team organization that I&#39;ve published on this site. You can
      find this collected together at the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/tags/team%20organization.html">team
      organization tag</a>.</p>
