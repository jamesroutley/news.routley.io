dilapidated, yet so, so beautiful. I especially loved the cats. We were blown
away with how near-universally friendly and well cared for they were.</p>

<p>This was the first time I’ve traveled with my newly acquired second-hand Sony
A6000. The results were so-so, but for a first time shooting with a proper
digital camera on a stock lens I think they’re about as good as I could
expect.</p>
