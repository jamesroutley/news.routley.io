    <h1>Reflections on a Decade of Coding</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I&#39;ve been programming professionally for about 12 years. Here are some of the things I worked on in the last 2 years. </p>
<ul>
<li>In a small team (averaging ~3 people, I think?) in a little under a year, we built a SQL query planner that passed the &gt;6 million tests in the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki">sqlite logic test suite</a>. </li>
<li>I figured out how to <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/materialize-decorrelation">decorrelate arbitrary SQL subqueries</a> (I wasn&#39;t the first person to figure this out, but I got there independently).</li>
<li>I demonstrated <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/">a mode of consistency failure</a> in various popular streaming systems that I believe was not widely understood at the time.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jamii/focus">the text editor</a> that I use for coding and writing every day. It took on the order of 100 hours of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s hard to write these examples without sounding like I&#39;m bragging, but to be very clear - I don&#39;t think that these projects are particularly impressive in context. They are the kind of projects that someone with a decade of experience in a specialized area should be capable of. </p>
<p>But they are also projects that I&#39;m fairly confident I would have failed at even 5 years ago. </p>
<p>My ability now isn&#39;t due to any intrinsic talent or grand insight but instead hundreds of tiny changes in habits, processes and values. When I compare these changes to online writing and discussions about how to get better at programming, I see very little overlap. The changes that lead to me being more effective are either not talked about at all or are in direct opposition to popular advice.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hesitant to write these kinds of posts, because they veer awfully close to flamebait and I really prefer to write things that are strongly factual rather than opinion-based. But there are a lot of things that I wish I could go back in time and tell my younger self, and the situation hasn&#39;t gotten much better since. There is a lot of high-quality writing aimed at people who are just learning to program, but very little that helped me figure out how to progress from being a novice.</p>
<p>When I started reflecting on what has and hasn&#39;t worked for me I found a <em>lot</em> of things that I wanted to write down, so I&#39;ve tried to roughly organize it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/on-bad-advice/">On bad advice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/things-unlearned/">Things unlearned</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/emotional-management/">Emotional management</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/setting-goals/">Setting goals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/speed-matters/">Speed matters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/moving-faster/">Moving faster</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/coding/">Coding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/testing/">Testing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/writing/">Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notable gaps where I don&#39;t have useful experience to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining large codebases</li>
<li>Operating long-lived systems</li>
<li>Collaboration / working in teams</li>
</ul>
