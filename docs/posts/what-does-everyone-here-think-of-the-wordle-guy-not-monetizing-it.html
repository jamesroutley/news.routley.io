      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I have to admire the guy for sticking to his guns and his vision and not monetizing it. It would be so easy too- keep the existing version free but create an iOS/Android app with some bells and whistles like longer words and boom rake in the cash. Being so hell bent on your vision commands respect. But I can&#39;t help but feel that the guy is about to let someone else benefit from his creation and am not sure how to feel about that (see https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1481345622938685443).<p>Apple is cracking down on blatant Wordle clones in the appstore right now but there is demand there, there is going to be a different app with a different name with a different ui with some added features like multiplayer that is probably gonna make some good money for a few months.</p><p>If someone is gonna inevitably end up benefiting from it, I&#39;d rather the guy who made the original rather than an app cloning team in China or some bay area tech bro. I am putting myself in his shoes and even if I had the vision that he has, I would not be able to stop myself from monetizing it even if just to not let the copycats make as much of a windfall.</p><p>What do people here think of this situation?</p></td></tr>
