	<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Anton here.</p>
<p>Thank you for subscribing to my new blog. Currently it’s 20 people total, but I think more people have read some of my posts.</p>
<p>I’ve only started writing this one 20 days ago but already have 8 posts:</p>

<li><a href="https://antiantihuman.com/on-hiding"><u>https://antiantihuman.com/on-hiding</u></a></li>

<li><a href="https://antiantihuman.com/communication"><u>https://antiantihuman.com/communication</u></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I still have few topics sitting in drafts. But I also want to slow down writing a bit (maybe one post per week).</p>
<p>I didn’t figure out how to find a positive spin on issues I discuss and when I only think about problems I get annoyed and frustrated.
So I will soon try to find a balance and also write about things I consider good.</p>
<p>Eg here I already have evergreen list of people who I like <a href="https://antiantihuman.com/inspirations"><u>https://antiantihuman.com/inspirations</u></a></p>
<p>I also decided to create subreddit - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiantihuman/"><u>https://www.reddit.com/r/antiantihuman/</u></a>. Not sure if this is a good idea, but if you have some public comments/ideas - you can try leaving them there.</p>
<p>I think I was able to write so many things in a short period of time mostly because of comments from people - my friends and also <a href="https://www.recurse.com/"><u>https://www.recurse.com/</u></a> community - that was encouraging, so thank you a lot for reading and commenting.</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend,</p>
<p>Anton</p>
