<p>In what may be a unique event in world history, a Something Awful forums user has posted so hard that it&#39;s become news—returning from the void after a decade-long ban purely in order to pick up the exact same tabletop game nerd debate that got him banned in the first place.</p><p>Let&#39;s begin at the beginning. The Something Awful forums are (in)famous and, god help us, genuinely culturally important. Despite—or maybe because of—a $10 registration fee, all sorts of memes, turns of phrase, and general ephemera of internet culture have sprung from them over the course of their 24-year existence. It also bears the burden of being at least partially responsible for the creation of 4chan, which was originally created by disgruntled members of SA&#39;s anime subforum.</p><p>The SA forums are <em>also</em> famous for giving moderators free reign when it comes to laying down the law. It&#39;s not uncommon for users to end up eating bans (which you have to pay $10 to get out of) or lengthy probations (&#34;probes,&#34; or time-limited bans) because they&#39;re being annoying, or have neglected some bit of posting etiquette, or just because it&#39;d be funny. The forums keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/banlist.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://forums.somethingawful.com/banlist.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">a dedicated list</a> of all recent bans and probes alongside the reasons they were handed out, like a wall of heads on spikes.</p><p>One such head on one such spike was a poster in SA&#39;s tabletop game subforum. Etherwind, the hero of our tale, was disciplined all the way back in 2013 for, ah, jokingly wishing death upon an author on the World of Darkness TTRPGs in an argument over the political direction of the series. Etherwind&#39;s punishment was swift and <em>lengthy</em>: A probation period 100,000 hours long that began on the 14th of February, 2013, at 10:24 pm BST.</p><a target="_blank" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png" alt="A screenshot of a Something Awful forum post by Etherwind reading, &#34;I broadly consider nWoD&#39;s politics and social commentary through the perspective of &#34;Death of the Author&#34;, and while I know that&#39;s a figurative expression, your reply makes me wish it was at least partly literal commentary.&#34; Underneath is a notice that the user who posted it has been probated." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPwfPfQyMDUWLYrhRv5JVK.png"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>The 2013 post that got Etherwind banned. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Something Awful / Etherwind)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>It&#39;s far from the only time a 100,000 hour probe has been handed down by SA&#39;s mods but, where most users simply take it as the de facto permaban it is, our Etherwind set an internal timer. 100,000 hours equals about 1.1 decades, 11.4 years, or 4167 days.

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHF7M4j_j7OHnbnkTHdhcMr7NOpkKLMT52cxdDG5Y5I/edit" target="_blank" data-url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHF7M4j_j7OHnbnkTHdhcMr7NOpkKLMT52cxdDG5Y5I/edit" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Google Doc</a> shared with the thread via social media, our hero explained how posting in SA&#39;s community had been an important part of his life, how he had done a lot of growing up and a lot of mental healing in the intervening 100,000 hours, and how he now regretted his life as an infamously abrasive poster.</p><p>But still, even with his new outlook, he recognised the end of his ban could be an incredible opportunity for comedy. His decision? To set a calendar reminder and resume his argument like no time had passed at all, picking on a poster from back in the day that he had no beef with whatsoever, committing to the bit before dropping the account entirely.</p><p>Which is, frankly, quite heartwarming on top of being the greatest feat of posting I&#39;ve ever witnessed. As strange as it might sound to say it, online communities like SA are an important aspect of a lot of people&#39;s lives. Lord knows I&#39;ve gone through several over the course of my life that have actually shaped me as a person. Coming back 1.1 decades after a minor forum spat has ended to pick up the gauntlet again seems like a perfect way to reflect just how serious and ridiculous that is all at once.</p><p>Finally, Etherwind was right. Wraith&#39;s 20th Anniversary Edition <em>didn&#39;t</em> come out in 2016.</p>

<div id="slice-container-authorBio-UjAkH8AeMD22coivRJN5Ti"><div><p>One of Josh&#39;s first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he&#39;s been irreparably game-brained ever since. His writing has been featured in Vice, Fanbyte, and the Financial Times. He&#39;ll play pretty much anything, and has written far too much on everything from visual novels to Assassin&#39;s Creed. His most profound loves are for CRPGs, immersive sims, and any game whose ambition outstrips its budget. He thinks you&#39;re all far too mean about Deus Ex: Invisible War.</p></div></div>
