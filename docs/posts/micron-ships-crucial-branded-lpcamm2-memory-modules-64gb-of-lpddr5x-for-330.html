            <p>As LPCAMM2 adoption begins, the first retail memory modules are finally starting to hit the retail market, courtesy of Micron. The memory manufacturer has begun selling their LPDDR5X-based LPCAMM2 memory modules under their in-house Crucial brand, making them available on the latter&#39;s storefront. Timed to coincide with the release of Lenovo&#39;s ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 laptop – the first retail laptop designed to use the memory modules – this marks the de facto start of the eagerly-awaited modular LPDDR5X memory era.</p>

<p>Micron&#39;s <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21069/modular-lpddr-becomes-a-reality-samsung-introduces-lpcamm-memory-modules">Low Power Compression Attached Memory Module 2</a> (LPCAMM2) modules are available in capacities of 32 GB and 64 GB. These are dual-channel modules that feature a 128-bit wide interface, and are based around LPDDR5X memory running at data rates up to 7500 MT/s. This gives a single LPCAMM2 a peak bandwidth of 120 GB/s. Micron is not disclosing the latencies of its LPCAMM2 memory modules, but it says that high data transfer rates of LPDDR5X compensate for the extended timings.</p>

<p>Micron says that LPDDR5X memory offers significantly lower power consumption, with active power per 64-bit bus being 43-58% lower than DDR5 at the same speed, and standby power up to 80% lower. Meanwhile, similar to DDR5 modules, LPCAMM2 modules include a power management IC and voltage regulating circuitry, which provides module manufacturers additional opportunities to reduce power consumption of their products.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting, however, that at least for the first generation of LPCAMM2 modules, system vendors will need to pick between modularity and performance. While soldered-down LPDDR5X memory is available at speeds up to 8533 MT/sec – and with 9600 MT/sec on the horizon – the fastest LPCAMM2 modules planned for this year by both Micron and rival Samsung will be running at 7500 MT/sec. So vendors will have to choose between the flexibility of offering modular LPDDR5X, or the higher bandwidth (and space savings) offered by soldering down their memory.</p>

<p>Micron, for its part, is projecting that 9600 MT/sec LPCAMM2 modules will be available by 2026. Though it&#39;s all but certain that faster memory will also be avaialble in the same timeframe.</p>

<p>Micron&#39;s Crucial LPDDR5X 32 GB module costs <a href="https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/ct32g75c2lp5xg">$174.99</a>, whereas a 64 GB module costs <a href="https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/ct64g75c2lp5xg">$329.99</a>.</p>
