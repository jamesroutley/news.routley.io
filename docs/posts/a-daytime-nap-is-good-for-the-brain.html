She described the findings as &#34;quite novel and quite exciting&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Napping has been shown to be critical for development <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30776745">when we are babies,</a> becomes less common as we age and then goes through a resurgence in popularity after retirement, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00965-x">with 27% of people over 65</a> reporting having a daytime nap. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Garfield says advice to nap is &#34;something quite easy&#34; to do in comparison to weight loss or exercise which are &#34;difficult for a lot of people&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The brain naturally shrinks with age, but whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer&#39;s will still need extra research. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Overall brain health is important for protecting against dementia and <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/sleep">the condition is linked to disturbed sleep.</a></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers suggest poor sleep is damaging the brain over time by causing inflammation and affecting the connections between brain cells. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Thus, regular napping could protect against neurodegeneration by compensating for deficient sleep,&#34; researcher Valentina Paz said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, Dr Garfield is not about to find a comfy spot to snooze at work and prefers other ways of looking after her brain.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Honestly, I would rather spend 30Â minutes exercising than napping, I&#39;ll probably try and recommend that my mum does it.&#34; </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="How-to-find-the-answer"><span role="text">How to find the answer?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Studying napping can be a challenge. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Napping might boost health, but the reverse is also true as your health can leave you so tired you need to nap more. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So the researchers used a clever technique to prove that napping is beneficial. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They used a gigantic natural experiment based on the DNA - the genetic code -  with which we are born. Previous studies have identified 97 snippets of our DNA that either make us more likely to be nappers or to power through the day. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So the team took data from 35,000 people, aged 40 to 69, taking part in the UK Biobank project and simply compared those genetic &#34;nappers&#34; and &#34;non-nappers&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The results, published in the journal Sleep Health, showed a 15 cubic centimetre difference - equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing. Total brain volumes were about 1,480 cubic centimetres in the study. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I enjoy short naps on the weekends and this study has convinced me that I shouldn&#39;t feel lazy napping, it may even be protecting my brain,&#34; Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh and the president of the British Neuroscience Association, told me.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said the &#34;interesting&#34; findings study showed a &#34;small but significant increase in brain volume&#34; and &#34;adds to the data indicating that sleep is important for brain health&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers did not directly study having a big sleep in the middle of the day, but said the science pointed towards a cut off of half an hour. </p></div></article></div></div>
