    <h1>Kaspersky: Poorly detected backdoor targeting governments and NGOs around globe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In December 2021, Kaspersky uncovered “<a href="https://securelist.com/owowa-credential-stealer-and-remote-access/105219/">Owowa</a>”, a
        previously unknown IIS module that steals credentials entered by a user when
        logging into Outlook Web Access (OWA). Since then, the company’s experts have
        kept an eye on the new opportunity for cybercriminal activity – it has become clear
        that deploying a backdoor within IIS is a trend for threat actors, who previously
        exploited one of the “<a href="https://devco.re/blog/2021/08/06/a-new-attack-surface-on-MS-exchange-part-1-ProxyLogon/">ProxyLogon-type</a>”
        vulnerabilities within Microsoft Exchange servers. In a recent investigation,
        Kaspersky experts came across a new unwanted module backdoor, dubbed
        SessionManager. </p>

<p>The SessionManager backdoor enables threat actors to
        keep persistent, update-resistant and rather stealth access to the IT
        infrastructure of a targeted organization. Once dropped into the victim’s system,
        cybercriminals behind the backdoor can gain access to company emails, update
        further malicious access by installing other types of malware or clandestinely
        manage compromised servers, which can be leveraged as malicious infrastructure.
    </p>

<p>A distinctive feature of SessionManager is its poor
        detection rate. First discovered by Kaspersky researchers in early 2022, some of
        the backdoor samples were still not flagged as malicious in most popular online
        file scanning services. To date, SessionManager is still deployed in more than
        90% of targeted organizations according to an Internet scan carried out by
        Kaspersky researchers. </p>

<p>Overall, 34 servers of 24 organizations from Europe, the
        Middle East, South Asia and Africa were compromised by SessionManager. The threat
        actor who operates SessionManager shows a special interest in NGOs and government
        entities, but medical organizations, oil companies, transportation companies,
        among others, have been targeted as well. </p>

<p><em>Map of organizations targeted by SessionManager campaign </em></p>

<p>Because of a similar victimology and the use of the
        common “<a href="https://lab52.io/blog/chimera-apt-updates-on-its-owlproxy-malware/">OwlProxy</a>”
        variant, Kaspersky experts believe that the malicious IIS module might have
        been leveraged by the <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eset_gelsemium.pdf">GELSEMIUM</a>
        threat actor, as part of its espionage operations.</p>

<p><em>“The exploitation of exchange server vulnerabilities has
            been a  favorite of cybercriminals
            looking to get into targeted infrastructure since Q1 2021. It notably enabled a
            series of long unnoticed cyberespionage campaigns. The recently discovered
            SessionManager was poorly detected for a year and is still deployed in the wild.
            Facing massive and unprecedented server-side vulnerability exploitation, most
            cybersecurity actors were busy investigating and responding to the first
            identified offences. As a result, it is still possible to discover related
            malicious activities months or years later, and this will probably be the case
            for a long time,</em>” comments Pierre Delcher, Senior Security Researcher
        at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis team.</p>

<p><em>“Gaining
            visibility into actual and recent cyberthreats is paramount for companies to protect
            their assets. Such attacks may result in significant financial or reputational losses
            and may disrupt a target’s operations. Threat intelligence is the only
            component that can enable reliable and timely anticipation of such threats. In
            the case of Exchange servers, we cannot stress it enough: the past-year’s
            vulnerabilities have made them perfect targets, whatever the malicious intent,
            so they should be carefully audited and monitored for hidden implants, if they
            were not already,”</em> adds Pierre.</p>



<p>Kaspersky products detect several malicious IIS
        modules, including SessionManager. To learn more about SessionManager’s operation style

<p>To protect your businesses from such threats,
        Kaspersky experts also recommend that you:</p>

<ul><li>Regularly check loaded
        IIS modules on exposed IIS servers (notably Exchange servers), leveraging
        existing tools from the IIS servers suite. Check for such modules as part of
        your threat hunting activities every time a major vulnerability is announced on
        Microsoft server products.</li><li>Focus your defense
        strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to the internet.
        Pay special attention to outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminal connections.
        Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access it in an emergency.</li><li>Use solutions like<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/endpoint-detection-response-edr"> Kaspersky
            Endpoint Detection and Response</a> and the <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/managed-detection-and-response">Kaspersky
            Managed Detection and Response</a> service, which help to
        identify and stop the attack in the early stages, before the attackers achieve
        their goals.</li><li>Use a reliable
        endpoint security solution, such as <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/endpoint-advanced">Kaspersky
            Endpoint Security for Business</a>
            (KESB) that is powered by exploit prevention, behavior detection
        and a remediation engine that is able to roll back malicious actions. KESB also
        has self-defense mechanisms that can prevent its removal by cybercriminals.</li></ul>
