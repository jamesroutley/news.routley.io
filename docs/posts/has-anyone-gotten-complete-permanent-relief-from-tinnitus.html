    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone gotten complete, permanent relief from tinnitus?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As far as I can tell, there&#39;s no universally accepted &#34;cure&#34; for tinnitus, but there are a number of &#34;therapies&#34; out there, some of which seem to prey upon people looking for relief but some of which seem plausible.</p><p>I&#39;m wondering if any subscribers here have had tinnitus and experience <i>permanent relief</i> from the ringing? Not just reduction, but actual permanent relief that never comes back even when doing things that previously worsened the tinnitus.</p><p>If you can&#39;t tell, I&#39;m trying to establish an &#34;existence proof&#34; here, if no one has ever gotten permanent relief then it seems like it might not be worth bothering with the &#34;symptom reduction&#34; therapies since they would most likely lead to focusing on the symptoms more intensely.</p></div></div></div>
