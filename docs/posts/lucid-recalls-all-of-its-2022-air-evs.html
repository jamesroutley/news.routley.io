    <h1>Lucid recalls all of its 2022 Air EVs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite already <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/28/lucid-slashes-2022-vehicle-production-forecast.html" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">struggling to meet production targets</a>, luxury EV maker Lucid has now issued a recall for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arIp-gLw_wQ&amp;t=64s" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">the Air</a> due to potential issues stemming from the car&#39;s wiring harness.</p>
<p>In a recent notice <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/LUCID/AIR#recalls" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">posted on the NHTSA website</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.lucidinsider.com/2022/05/25/lucid-motors-issues-recall-for-glass-cockpit-instrument-panel-for-some-lucid-air-evs/" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">Lucid Insiders</a>, a summary for the recall says unsecured wires on 2022 Air vehicles could cause the car&#39;s displays to turn off. And because the Air&#39;s displays contain critical information including speed, range and warning indicators, this would present a hazard in violation of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.</p>
<p>The notice states that the potential number of affected vehicles is 1,117. That means with Lucid having delivered less than 1,000 cars to date, the recall appears to cover all 2022 Air Dream Edition and Grand Touring models. For any potentially affected owners, you can get more info by calling Lucid&#39;s customer service at 1-888-995-8243 and mentioning recall number NCR-22-01-0.</p>
<p>Official notification letters are slated to be sent out on June 20th Meanwhile, for cars that are subject to the recall, the NHTSA says Lucid dealers will be responsible for inspecting vehicles and addressing the issue as needed, free of charge.</p>
<p>Going forward, Lucid Insiders claims the company has already started making adjustments to the glass canopy on new vehicles to prevent any issues with unsecured wires. However, perhaps the bigger concern is that this recall comes just a few months after Lucid recalled 200 cars for having front strut dampers that may have been improperly installed by a supplier. And with reservations for the Air now exceeding 25,000 cars, ironing out any issues will be hugely important if Lucid hopes to deliver those vehicles in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 5/25/22 3:35PM ET: </strong>A Lucid spokesperson has provided Engadget with an official statement regarding the recall which you can see below.Â </p>
<p>&#34;For Lucid, the safety of our customers and their families is the highest priority. Lucid is recalling certain model year 2022 Lucid Air vehicles because of the possibility that the wiring connection to the instrument panel may not have been secured properly during assembly. The recall applies to 1,117 vehicles that have been delivered to customers, and it is estimated that the defect is present on 1% of cars. Lucid is not aware of any instances when these components have failed in a vehicle or caused an interruption to the instrument display panel.&#34;</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
