    <h1>AI Mode Is Good</h1>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">how good ChatGPT with GPT-5</a> is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google&#39;s efforts around this are.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad I left that out, because it turns out Google&#39;s new &#34;AI mode&#34; is genuinely really good! It feels  very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/ai">www.google.com/ai</a></strong> (not available in the EU, as I found out this morning since I&#39;m staying in France for a few days.)</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://share.google/aimode/SZNHD7Owi0Wv9d3Ci">what I got</a> for the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot of search results page with navigation tabs &#34;AI Mode&#34; and more.  Main search query reads &#34;Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?&#34; Results show &#34;11 sites&#34; and include text: &#34;In 2024, Anthropic paid millions of dollars to buy physical books in bulk, which they then cut up, scanned, and discarded to train their AI models. This method was a major component of a copyright lawsuit settlement that Anthropic paid in September 2025. While Anthropic took this destructive, large-scale approach, other major AI labs have taken different routes to acquire book data.&#34; Followed by &#34;Here&#39;s how other AI companies have sourced book data:&#34; with bullet points for &#34;OpenAI and Microsoft: In June 2025, the companies announced a partnership with Harvard University libraries to train AI models on digitized, public-domain books. This non-destructive method provides high-quality text while preserving the original physical copies.&#34; &#34;Meta: Meta has been accused of relying on large-scale piracy to build its datasets for models like LLaMA. In 2025, a search tool revealed that Meta had copied more than 7.5 million books from the pirate site LibGen for its AI systems.&#34; &#34;Google: Decades before the current AI boom, Google pioneered non-destructive scanning methods for its Google Books project. This method became a successful legal precedent for digitizing copyrighted works for internal purposes. In 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of this project, Tom Turvey, to help with its own book-acquisition strategy." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-mode-books.jpg"/></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest: I hadn&#39;t spent much time with AI mode for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My expectations of &#34;AI mode&#34; were extremely low based on my terrible experience of &#34;AI overviews&#34;</li>
<li>The name &#34;AI mode&#34; is so generic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on some initial experiments I&#39;m impressed - Google finally seem to be taking full advantage of their search infrastructure for building out truly great AI-assisted search.</p>
<p>I do have one disappointment: AI mode will tell you that it&#39;s &#34;running 5 searches&#34; but it won&#39;t tell you what those searches are! Seeing the searches that were run is really important for me in evaluating the likely quality of the end results. I&#39;ve had the same problem with Google&#39;s Gemini app in the past - the lack of transparency as to what it&#39;s doing really damages my trust.</p>
