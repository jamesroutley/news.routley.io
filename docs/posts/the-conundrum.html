    <h1>The ü/ü Conundrum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p id="9c3e">I implemented search and filtering for entities on our product at epilot. The users were heavily using the feature, however, a unique issue surfaced: difficulties in filtering file names containing diacritical marks like umlauts (<code>Äpfel</code>, <code>über</code>, <code>schön</code>, etc.).</p>



<p id="b54a">Intrigued, I delved into the logic to investigate. Initially, everything seemed in order. For instance, a file named “blöb” was saved precisely as “blöb” — no bizarre encoding alterations were apparent.</p>



<p id="0f99">Can you spot any difference between “blöb” and “blöb”?</p>



<p id="9a66">This time instead of typing the word in the search bar, I copied it from the uploaded and saved filename, and and voilà, the search functioned perfectly! 🤯. This definitely meant the file name was subtly altered upon upload, hinting at a background encoding transformation.</p>



<p id="49f9">So, as anyone would, I employed the power of <code>encodeURIComponent</code> to see for myself what really was different.</p>



<p>There it was! The different types of encoding forms that led to this. Now you might be wondering (<em>I was wondering too!</em>):</p>



<p><em>As if worrying about encoding wasn’t enough, now we’ve got to stress over its different types too 🤦‍♀ and wait, its 2024, and we are still grappling with Unicode character encoding problems?</em></p>

<p>The culprits in this case were these two contrasting encoding types: <code><strong>%C3%BC</strong></code> and <code><strong>%CC%88</strong></code>, leading to the search malfunction. This is a well-known issue with NFD/NFC encoding forms.</p>

<p><em>Now imagine explaining this technical jargon that to a user! </em>😃</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
