    <h1>Pyramid structure discovered near Caral Peru</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>According to an announcement by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, the find consists of a pyramidal structure uncovered by the Caral Archaeological Zone under the direction of renowned archaeologist Ruth Shady. Hidden beneath dense vegetation and dry huarango trees, the pyramid remained concealed in Sector F of Chupacigarro. </p>



<p>After clearing the natural cover, stone walls forming at least three overlapping platforms were revealed, indicating its ceremonial or administrative function. One of the most striking features of the pyramid is the imposing vertical stones, known as <strong>“huancas”</strong>, which mark the building’s corners and the central staircase leading to the top. </p>



<p>These elements are characteristic of Caral’s monumental architecture, reinforcing the site’s importance within the urban planning of the time.</p>




<p>Next to the pyramid, archaeologists discovered a large geoglyph (62.1 by 30.3 meters) depicting a profile head in the distinctive style of the Sechín culture from Peru’s northern coast. The figure, oriented eastward, is only visible from a strategic vantage point within the settlement, suggesting a possible ritual or astronomical significance.</p>

<p>This geoglyph discovery is particularly significant as it establishes a connection between Caral and other ancient Andean civilizations, suggesting cultural and symbolic exchanges much earlier than previously believed.</p>        
		



<p>Chupacigarro is part of an extensive network of urban centers that flourished between 3000 and 1800 BCE. Its strategic location allowed it to establish ties with coastal populations in the Huaura Valley and exploit natural resources such as springs and quarries.</p>




<p>The archaeological site spans 3,859 hectares and includes 12 public and ceremonial structures, among them a building with a sunken circular plaza—a distinctive feature of Caral architecture. In its peripheral areas, residential zones have been identified, indicating a highly organized society both socially and economically.</p>

<p>This discovery not only provides new insights into Chupacigarro’s urban planning but also enhances its preservation and recognition, aiming for its integration into Caral’s tourist circuit. The pyramid and geoglyph have the potential to become new attractions that will enrich Peru’s cultural identity and contribute to the conservation of the oldest civilization in the Americas.</p>

<p>With each new discovery, Caral and its associated settlements reveal more about a sophisticated society that, without resorting to war, managed to thrive with a complex organizational structure and a deep understanding of its environment.</p>
