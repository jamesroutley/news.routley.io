<p>Fairphone is a unique Android manufacturer; it offers a smartphone designed for repair, long software support times, and a selection of parts available online. The Dutch electronics manufacturer has mostly only focused on the European market and says, &#34;When is Fairphone coming to the US?&#34; is one of the most common questions it gets asked. Well, ask no more! The company is finally bringing the Fairphone 4 to the US—with some caveats.</p>
<p>Fairphone is launching a &#34;US pilot&#34; program to sell the Fairphone 4 in America in partnership with <a href="https://murena.com/">Murena</a>, the primary developer behind the /e/ Android fork. Murena has been selling Fairphones in Europe for a while, and they come pre-loaded with the /e/ OS, instead of Fairphone&#39;s build of Android, and now the US is getting the deal. The phone costs $599.</p>

This collaboration with e/OS/ is a great opportunity for us to pilot selling devices in the US market with a long-standing partner and learn more about the American market.”

<p>/e/ is a &#34;fully <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/what-s-e#degoogling--ungoogling">deGoogled</a>,&#34; &#34;privacy by design&#34; fork of Android that dumps Google&#39;s apps and services for alternatives provided by /e/. Instead of the Play Store, you get the &#34;<a href="https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge#is-x-app-available-on-app-lounge/">App Lounge</a>&#34; full of Android APKs and progressive web apps. Instead of Google Play Services, you get the open source <a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a> reimplementation. Instead of Google Maps, you&#39;ll get the OpenStreetMap-based <a href="https://www.magicearth.com/">Magic Earth</a>, Cloud data can be stored on the NextCloud-based <a href="https://murena.io/">Murena cloud</a> based on NextCloud, or <a href="https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/infra/ecloud-selfhosting">self-hosted</a> by the user. If you just wanted a repairable phone, this will be a big change over regular Android, but presumably it&#39;s also possible to flash the normal, <a href="https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405858261777-Fairphone-4-OS-Manual-Installation">Google-approved builds</a> of Android.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As a quick recap, the Fairphone 4 came out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/fairphone-4-has-an-incredible-5-year-warranty-aims-for-6-years-of-updates/">in 2021</a> with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G SoC, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Just like before the days of sealed phones, the back comes off, and the 3905 mAh battery is user-removable. The whole phone is designed to be modular with repairable parts, as the camera array, loudspeaker, USB-C port, display, and phone body are all individual components. Normally Fairphone sells the parts on its website for easy repairs, but for the US, we&#39;re told parts will be available through Murena. If you go online and activate your warranty at <a href="http://Fairphone.com/warranty">Fairphone.com/warranty</a>, the phone has a five year warranty.</p>
<p>By the time you read this, the phone should be up for sale at <a href="https://murena.com/shop/">murena.com/shop</a></p>
