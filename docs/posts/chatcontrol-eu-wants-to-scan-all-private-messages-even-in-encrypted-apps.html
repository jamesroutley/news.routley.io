    <h1>ChatControl: EU wants to scan all private messages, even in encrypted apps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>
  The European Union wants to force tech companies to scan your private messages &amp; images, even in your favorite encrypted apps.
</p>


<h2>Introduction 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#introduction" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>The 🇪🇺 European Union is advancing legislation that could fundamentally change how we communicate online. <strong>ChatControl</strong> would require <em>all</em> messaging platforms to automatically scan their users’ private messages and images.</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, even encrypted ones like <em>Signal</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> and <em>Telegram</em>. <strong>No</strong>, you can’t opt out.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another privacy policy update you can ignore. If passed, this EU regulation (<em>strongest and most binding legal instrument in EU law</em>) would automatically apply to all member states without any wiggle room for national interpretation. It would even override constitutional protections for communication privacy and establish unprecedented mass surveillance of private communications.</p>
<p>The official justification? Fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material" target="_blank">child sexual abuse material</a> (CSAM). Protecting children is undeniably crucial, but the proposed methods would eliminate digital privacy for 450 million Europeans and set a global precedent for mass surveillance.</p>
<p>This surveillance trend extends beyond Europe: 🇨🇭 Switzerland is advancing metadata retention requirements, the 🇬🇧 UK is implementing comprehensive age verification systems and now the 🇪🇺 EU proposes to scan <em>every private message</em>. Each initiative is positioned as child protection policy, but the implications reach far beyond their stated goals.</p>

<h2>What is ChatControl 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#what-is-chatcontrol" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl is what critics call the EU’s proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_to_Prevent_and_Combat_Child_Sexual_Abuse" target="_blank">Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse</a>, also known as CSAR (<em>Child Sexual Abuse Regulation</em>).</p>
<p>The proposal builds on surveillance techniques already deployed by major tech companies. Meta analyzes all Facebook Messenger conversations and unencrypted WhatsApp data (profile photos, group descriptions). Apple announced similar scanning for iCloud content in 2021, though they later suspended the program.</p>
<p>This turns voluntary corporate surveillance into mandatory government-ordered scanning. A temporary 2021 EU regulation allowed platforms to scan content voluntarily for three years. That authorization expired in 2024, which is why CSAR was proposed. The temporary regulation merely permitted scanning; CSAR would make detection obligatory under certain conditions.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/internal-security/lawful-access-data_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> which has an even bigger goal: making all our digital data readable by authorities upon request. We’ll dive deeper into this broader surveillance agenda later.</p>

<h3>Scope and Coverage 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#scope-and-coverage" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>CSAR casts an extremely wide net. The regulation would apply to all <em>interpersonal communication service providers</em>, not just obvious targets like Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email providers</li>
<li>Dating apps</li>
<li>Gaming platforms with chat features</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>File hosting services (Google Drive, iCloud, DropBox…)</li>
<li>App stores</li>
<li>Even small community hosting services run by associations</li>
</ul>
<p>This means virtually any digital service that allows people to communicate or share content would fall under surveillance requirements. The scope extends far beyond what most people imagine when they hear <em>messaging apps</em>.</p>

<h2>How it Works 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl relies on <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-client-side-scanning/" target="_blank">Client-Side Scanning</a>. Your device becomes a monitoring station that analyzes your content before encryption happens.</p>
<p>This represents a fundamental shift away from traditional surveillance that intercepts messages during transmission. With ChatControl, every message gets automatically checked, assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent and effectively reversing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence" target="_blank">presumption of innocence</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>How does Chat Control work?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The system would automatically scan for three categories of content <strong>before</strong> encryption:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Known illegal content</strong>: Images or videos already catalogued by authorities as CSAM. Your device creates <em>hash fingerprints</em> of your content and compares them against databases of known illegal material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unknown potential content</strong>: Photos or videos that might constitute CSAM but haven’t been previously identified. AI algorithms analyze visual elements (like exposed skin) to flag potentially problematic content based on statistical models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grooming behavior</strong>: Text analysis using AI to identify communication patterns that match predefined indicators of adults soliciting children. This involves scanning the actual content of your private conversations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If something gets flagged, it automatically gets reported to authorities. No human checks it first, that would be impossible given the billions of daily messages. This would be mandatory for all messaging platforms in 🇪🇺 Europe.</p>

<h3>Why This Breaks Encryption 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#why-this-breaks-encryption" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>

  
  
  
  





<p>ChatControl <strong>doesn’t break encryption, it bypasses it entirely</strong>. While your messages still get encrypted during transmission, the system defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption by examining your content before it gets encrypted. True <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank">E2EE</a> means only you and your recipient can read messages: no government, no company, no algorithm should peek inside. This surveillance violates that principle by inserting monitoring at the source.</p>
<p>Privacy-focused companies like Proton <a href="https://proton.me/blog/fr/why-client-side-scanning-isnt-the-answer" target="_blank">point out</a> this approach might be <strong>worse than encryption backdoors</strong>. Backdoors give authorities access to communications you share with others. This system examines everything on your device, whether you share it or not.</p>
<p>Your encrypted messaging app becomes spyware. Supporters claim this protects privacy because scanning happens locally, but surveillance built into your device makes it <strong>impossible to escape</strong>.</p>

<h3>Governance Structure

</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes" target="_blank">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The proposal would create a centralized <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Centre on Child Sexual Abuse</a> to receive all reports, but EU institutions wouldn’t control the scanning technology itself.</p>
<p>Service providers would face additional obligations beyond scanning. They would need to conduct <em>risk assessments</em> to evaluate and minimize the potential for illegal content sharing on their platforms. This requires collecting detailed information about their users (<em>age groups, content types</em>) that many privacy-focused services deliberately avoid gathering.</p>
<p>The regulation also pushes for mandatory age verification systems. No viable, privacy-respecting age verification technology currently exists. These systems would eliminate online anonymity, requiring users to prove their identity to access digital services.</p>

  </span>

  <span><strong>Rules for thee, but not for me</strong>: While ordinary Europeans would have all their messages scanned, the proposed legislation includes exemptions for government accounts used for “<em>national security purposes, maintaining law and order or military purposes</em>”. Convenient.</span>

<p>ChatControl fits into a broader political strategy. Since the 1990s <em>crypto wars</em>, certain states have argued that privacy-protecting technologies, especially encryption, obstruct police investigations. These technologies are designed to do exactly that, protect everyone’s ability to control their expression and communication.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-presents-roadmap-effective-and-lawful-access-data-law-enforcement-2025-06-24_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> wants to make all digital data accessible to authorities by 2030. This involves systematically weakening encryption rather than simply bypassing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a>’s revelations ten years ago led to widespread adoption of encryption and institutional consensus supporting the right to encrypted communication. But governments remain frustrated by their inability to access private communications. We’re seeing a return to authoritarian positions using terrorism, organized crime and child exploitation as justifications for undermining encryption.</p>
<p>🇩🇰 <strong>Danish Minister of Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hummelgaard" target="_blank">Peter Hummelgaard</a></strong>, chief architect of the current ChatControl proposal, <a href="https://www.ft.dk/samling/20231/almdel/REU/spm/1426/index.htm" target="_blank">recently stated</a>: <em>“We must break with the totally erroneous perception that it is everyone’s civil liberty to communicate on encrypted messaging services.”</em> Well, there you have it folks: <strong>encrypted communication</strong> isn’t a civil liberty anymore. You <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk" target="_blank">cypherpunks</a> were wrong all along. /s</p>
<p>Similarly in 🇫🇷 France, both Bernard Cazeneuve and Emmanuel Macron have explicitly stated their desire to control encrypted messaging, seeking to pierce the privacy of millions who use these services.</p>
<p>CSAR provides the perfect opportunity for member states to finally design and implement a generalized surveillance tool for monitoring population communications. Crossing this threshold means eliminating all confidentiality from communications using digital infrastructure.</p>

<h3>False Positives

<p>These scanning systems get it wrong most of the time. <strong>Studies show approximately 80% of algorithmic reports are false positives</strong>: innocent content incorrectly flagged as illegal. 🇮🇪 Irish law enforcement <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/" target="_blank">confirms this</a>: only 20.3% of 4,192 automated reports actually contained illegal material.</p>

<p>Even with hypothetical 99% accuracy (<em>which current systems don’t achieve</em>), scanning billions of daily messages would generate millions of false accusations. Police resources would be overwhelmed investigating innocent families sharing vacation photos while real crimes go uninvestigated.</p>
<p>Innocent content regularly triggers these systems: family photos, teenage conversations, educational materials and medical communications. Consider this real case: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html" target="_blank">a father was automatically reported to police</a> after sending photos of his child’s medical condition to their doctor. Google’s algorithms flagged this legitimate medical consultation as potential abuse, permanently closed his account and refused all appeals. His digital life was destroyed by an algorithm that couldn’t distinguish between medical care and criminal activity.</p>

<p>For the third time in three years, over 600 cryptographers, security researchers and scientists across 35 countries have <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/danger-to-democracy-500-top-scientists-urge-eu-governments-to-reject-technically-infeasible-chat-control/" target="_blank">co-signed an open letter</a> explaining why this mass scanning project is “<em>technically unfeasible</em>”, constitutes a “<em>danger to democracy</em>” and would “<em>completely compromise</em>” the security and privacy of all European citizens.</p>
<p>The letter emphasizes that client-side scanning cannot distinguish between legal and illegal content without fundamentally breaking encryption and creating vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commission has provided no serious studies demonstrating the effectiveness, reliability or appropriateness of these intrusive measures for actually protecting children. Industry claims appear to have taken precedence over evidence-based policy-making.</p>
<p>Genuine security emerges through thoughtful design where security measures and civil liberties function as complementary forces, not opposing ones.</p>

<h3>Easily Defeated 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#easily-defeated" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>

<p>The fundamental flaw in ChatControl becomes clear when examining how easily determined actors can circumvent these scanning systems. Criminals don’t need sophisticated techniques to bypass client-side scanning; they use well-documented public knowledge already employed by malicious actors.</p>
<p><strong>Layered Encryption</strong></p>
<p><strong>External Platform Bypass</strong></p>
<p><strong>Custom Messaging Clients</strong></p>
<p><strong>Digital Steganography</strong></p>
<p><strong>Platform Migration</strong></p>
<p>ChatControl catches only amateur criminals who directly attach problematic content to messages. Professional networks already employ these evasion techniques as standard practice. EU legislation won’t make them forget how computers work.</p>
<p>The system fails at protecting children while succeeding at mass civilian monitoring. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_a_bug,_it%27s_a_feature" target="_blank">It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.</a></p>

</h3>
<p>The child protection narrative masks concerning business interests. The European Commission based its CSAR proposal primarily on claims from industry players rather than independent research.</p>
<p>Commercial surveillance companies would manage the technology with guaranteed access to the European market. Organizations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28organization%29" target="_blank">Thorn</a> (co-founded by actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Kutcher" target="_blank">Ashton Kutcher</a>), Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna" target="_blank">PhotoDNA</a> and other tech companies develop these detection systems while simultaneously lobbying for regulations that would require their adoption across Europe.</p>
<p>These companies develop the detection technologies and lobby for laws mandating their adoption, creating a profitable feedback loop. The proposal would secure privileged market positions for surveillance companies across hundreds of millions of European users. Pretty nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>These systems would be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proprietary</strong>: Built on closed-source code with methods hidden from public view</li>
<li><strong>Unverifiable</strong>: Operating without meaningful external examination or accountability</li>
<li><strong>Legally powerful</strong>: Capable of starting criminal proceedings through algorithmic decisions</li>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children" target="_blank">Think of the children</a>” is a well-documented political rhetoric technique that appeals to emotion rather than evidence. While child protection is genuinely important, this approach frames any opposition as being against child welfare, making nuanced discussion more difficult.</p>
<p>This creates a false choice. Privacy isn’t a luxury for troublemakers, it’s a <strong>fundamental right</strong> that protects journalists, whistleblowers, activists and ordinary people from unwarranted intrusion.</p>
<p>Critics aren’t opposing child protection. We’re questioning whether undermining privacy rights for 450 million 🇪🇺 Europeans is the most effective approach when targeted alternatives exist that preserve rights.</p>

<p>The effects of these proposals go beyond individual privacy concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity gets compromised</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innovation suffers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Buy our ultra-secure encrypted stuff!” (Terms and conditions apply, government backdoors included).&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tech companies will leave Europe</strong></p>
<p>Even 🇨🇭 Switzerland, traditionally seen as a privacy haven, is facing severe legislative pressures that are forcing tech companies to relocate. Proton has confirmed it has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/is-proton-leaving-switzerland-legal-uncertainty-of-proposed-surveillance-laws-is-pushing-them-to-make-several-changes" target="_blank">begun moving some of its physical infrastructure out of Switzerland</a> due to “<em>legal uncertainty</em>” over the proposed surveillance law amendments. Lumo, their AI chatbot, became the first product <a href="https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai" target="_blank">to relocate</a>, moving to Germany instead of Switzerland specifically because of these legislative concerns.</p>
<p>The Swiss <strong>OSCPT</strong> (<em>Ordinance on the Surveillance of Correspondence by Post and Telecommunications</em>) revision would require VPNs and messaging apps to identify users and retain data for up to six months, plus decrypt communications upon authority request. As Proton’s CEO <strong>Andy Yen</strong> explained, these are proposals that “<em>have been outlawed in the EU</em>” but could soon become reality in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Other privacy-focused providers like Tuta have <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/switzerland-surveillance-plan" target="_blank">expressed</a> similar concerns and contingency plans to leave 🇨🇭 Switzerland if the surveillance laws pass.</p>
<p><strong>Europe might become dependent on US surveillance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social behavior changes</strong></p>
<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect" target="_blank">chilling effect</a>. Rights don’t disappear overnight: they erode gradually as people change their behavior to avoid potential problems.</p>

<p>The irony is kinda painful: the continent that built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">GDPR</a> to protect digital privacy now designs ChatControl to dismantle it systematically. What was once a fundamental right could become mandatory surveillance.</p>
<p>ChatControl represents a historic choice for 🇪🇺 Europe. Either we become the first democracy to normalize mass surveillance of private communications or we defend the digital rights that made Europe a global privacy leader.</p>

<p>This decision deserves close attention: authoritarian regimes worldwide are watching, ready to justify their own programs with: “<em>Eh, if Europe does it, why shouldn’t we?</em>”</p>
