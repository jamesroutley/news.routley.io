In the past two years, I’ve had over twenty people ask me about changing careers from structural engineering (through word of mouth, LinkedIn, and Twitter), so I thought it would be helpful to outline what the process has been like.</p><h2 id="background"><a href="#background" aria-label="background permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Background<!-- --></h2><p>I have been writing code alongside my job (and also for fun) since 2015. Some of that experience was in an academic setting (admittedly that was probably the worst and least productive stage), but the majority of it has been experimenting and building tools on my own time. I also did two focused retreats in programming at the <!-- --><a href="https://recurse.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Recurse Center</a> in Fall 2019 (in person) and Summer 2021 (virtual).<!-- --></p><p>It is <!-- --><em>really</em> hard to be dedicated to and consistently study a completely different field while working a full-time job. When I re-entered structural engineering practice in 2018, I was working 60+ hours a week, which made it nearly impossible to have any downtime and hobbies. I prioritized attending a monthly meetup with <!-- --><a href="https://nyc.pyladies.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pyladies NYC</a>, which made a world of difference, since it made me accountable to working on projects to show. It was also extremely motivating to spend at least an evening a month with likeminded individuals who wanted to get better at software craft. While some aspects of programming might lend themselves to structural engineering (i.e. optioneering in project early stages or conducting sensitivity studies), I had a lot of projects that were in construction documentation (CDs) or contract administration (CA), where administrative stuff just needed to <!-- --><strong>get done</strong>, and there wasn’t any room for experimentation or research.<!-- --></p><p>When I moved from NYC to LA, I did my first batch at the Recurse Center and then started a new job in a new city just four months before the pandemic. I didn’t do much coding during the first four months as I was settling into my new role and new company (and my projects were largely in coding-won’t-help-you phases). However, during the first year of the pandemic, a number of my projects at work went on hold, so I was able to learn more C# and work on the company’s open source code base. I also continued to tinker in my spare time (it was a mixed blessing that part of the pandemic survival strategy was to have Fridays off due to lack of work).</p><h2 id="preparation"><a href="#preparation" aria-label="preparation permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Preparation<!-- --></h2><p>After I quit my full time job as a structural engineer in summer 2021, I first started off with another batch at the Recurse Center with some flexibility on my learning goals (other than wanting to do more in web and data visualization).

Some had prompts that were directly relevant to the company’s work (which was nice to get an idea of what types of problems they’re dealing with). Others were completely unrelated (like coding up a small game), so it was more about reasoning out all the components needed and talking through it with my interviewer. In general, it’s better to say more during an interview since it gives the interviewer a better idea of your thought process. One good way to get better at live coding is through pair programming, which is something I’ve done a lot of thanks to the Recurse Center.</p><p>The other type of technical interview was usually a systems design problem, either troubleshooting bad behavior for a system or explaining a personal project. If I was doing a personal project walkthrough, I needed to explain all the microservices used and respond to questions on potential improvements to the project.</p><h3 id="on-sites"><a href="#on-sites" aria-label="on sites permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>On Sites<!-- --></h3><p>I had five onsites during my interview process (biggest lesson learned was not to do two in a day if you can help it 😬) There was more live coding in the on sites than I originally expected, as a number of them were past the initial technical screen. Virtual on sites are a real marathon, so make sure you’re well hydrated (and eat ahead of time or have snacks for off camera). My on sites were a mix of more technical portions (additional live coding and system architecture) and more behavioral portions (can you tell me a time when?, etc.)</p><h3 id="negotiation"><a href="#negotiation" aria-label="negotiation permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Negotiation<!-- --></h3><p>Negotiation is not my strong suit or something I consider <!-- --><em>fun</em>, and there are many people that can give better advice on how to do it. The offers I’ve received are largely in the range of what I was looking for, plus generous benefits and time off compared to structural engineering. In addition, every company I interviewed with was “remote-first”. On average, the compensation packages were anywhere from a 30-50% improvement on my structural engineering salary (which had miniscule bonuses and no profit sharing) with an equivalent software full-time experience level of 2-4 years. Once I had an offer, usually the company would offer a one on one with an engineer (or I’d ask for one). For those meetings, I’ve beeng using Julia’s Evans <!-- --><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Questions I’m Asking In Interviews</a> as a jumping off point to get a better idea of the day to day and what I’d be doing.<!-- --></p><p>While the interview process has been significantly more in depth than my interviews for structural engineering positions (usually that’s limited to a single on site interview), it hasn’t been as painful as I thought it would be. The live coding portions were mercifully void of gotchas or super tricky algorithms, and the people I interviewed with were great. I’ve gotten a much better feel for these companies than I ever did after a structural engineering interview, and it’s been good to get a chance to interview the company as much as they’ve been interviewing me.</p><p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@m-clare/software-engineer-interviews">Interview Time By Category</a></p></div></div>
