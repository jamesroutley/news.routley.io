    <h1>Ask HN: Why doesn&#39;t Apple bring continuity to the Music app?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple boasts a lot about their handoff feature, but the one place where I need it most is when I play some music on my iPhone and want to later continue listening to it on my Mac. Spotify does a great job at that and that&#39;s been the main reason I haven&#39;t switched to Apple Music yet. Is there any technical/legal limit for Apple to avoid doing this?</p></div></div>
