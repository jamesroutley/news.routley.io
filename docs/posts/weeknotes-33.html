<ul>
<li>was almost going to postpone the 33rd weeknote just so it could coincide with my birthday week and 33rd birthday. luckily for you, i decided it&#39;s fine.</li>
<li>been reading more and am deciding that i need to concentrate on one or two books a week if i&#39;m ever going to finish any, i have like 12 books on the go (for a given definition of &#39;go&#39;) at the minute so trying to marshal myself.</li>
<li>started reading tiny experiments and mostly enjoying it so far. my first experiment is at least one post a day on bluesky, for a week. so far so good on the pact, but i think it reinforced for me that it shouldn&#39;t be where my focus rests, sadly. that&#39;s the point of experiments though, we just keep iterating!</li>
<li>using mullvad browser and learnt that dark mode can be used in fingerprinting browsers???? people were recommending it because firefox browser is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/firefox-deletes-promise-to-never-sell-personal-data-asks-users-not-to-panic/">also shady now</a> but i think like with spotify i am going to have to eat it until there&#39;s a better solution. maybe i download <a href="https://gethorse.com/">horse browser</a> again and use <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser">mullvad</a> when i&#39;m doing sensitive things?? partly joking cos i assume all the privacy people are screaming as horse is chromium run in electron, which i assume is not secure at all, but whatever. another video idea for the every growing pile.</li>
<li>trying to do a bit of writing daily-ish, so far it&#39;s going well, lots going on over at <a href="https://notes.olu.online">my notes site</a>.</li>
<li>i&#39;m thinking more about taking the &#34;independent researcher&#34; idea a bit more seriously, after a discussion with someone maybe i try and do a course on research methods and do some study into how people build things from scratch (in liberatory tech or otherwise!). watch out for pestering emails soon!!</li>
<li>i still think a lot about doing a masters or phd but i don&#39;t think the extra stress would be worth it to me, as well as the financial hit of having to live on whatever stipend (i refuse to pay for it out of pocket lol).</li>
<li>for my technopaganism blog series i&#39;m writing; if you believe in animism and have thought through ideas about why, hit me up! the entire idea makes me think &#34;you mean that EVERYTHING has an opinion?&#34; and that makes me feel terrible in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326979070_Object_personification_in_autism_This_paper_will_be_very_sad_if_you_don%27t_read_it">&#34;this paper will be very sad if you don&#39;t read it&#34;</a> sense. i&#39;m also uncomfortable with a lot of stuff people say about ancestors and spirituality (and fun at parties), so maybe it&#39;s just a given that i won&#39;t be able to identify with this even in a fictionalist way.</li>
<li>this week i have been enjoying fizzy gummy sweets, pitta chips, lime squash and creme eggs. i&#39;ve been trying to eat chocolate that is more ethical/uses less or no enslaved labour (wild, but we live in a society) and not sure the creme eggs live up to that, so will be on the lookout for a different brand than the classic one.</li>
<li>hope you had a great week and have a great one coming up!! see you next time okay?</li>
