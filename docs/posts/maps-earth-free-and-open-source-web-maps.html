    <h1>Maps.earth – free and open-source web maps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><article id="maps-liberated"><section><p><a href="https://github.com/headwaymaps">The Headway Project</a> was born out of a frustration with the need to send current and future location data to a corporation in order to figure out how we’re getting from A to B. Offline-only maps apps can be frustrating to use, and sometimes suffer from performance problems, poor data coverage, or other technical limitations.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway">Headway</a> aims to remedy these issues by bundling industry-standard software into a web app that’s easy to set up for yourself or your friends. No need to send your location data to anyone you don’t trust, not even <a href="https://maps.earth/">maps.earth</a>.</p></section></article></div><div><article id="run-it-yourself"><section><p><a href="https://maps.earth/">maps.earth</a> is a planet-scale installation of <a href="https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway">Headway</a>, but you can easily set up your own server on a smaller scale for your own personal use by running just a few commands.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ earthly -P +build --area=Amsterdam
$ cp .env-example .env
$ docker-compose up -d
</code></pre><p>That’s all it takes to bring up a fully functional maps server for the Amsterdam metro area, including place and address search, and routing via car, bicycle and on foot. Other areas require small tweaks to the <code>.env</code> file. More details are available in the project’s <a href="https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway/blob/main/BUILD.md">BUILD.md</a> file.</p></section></article></div></div></div>
