    <h1>From Google to Twitter</h1>

<p>2022.03.01</p>




<p>In 2021, I joined Twitter after 14 years at Google. Here are a few minor
thoughts about some differences I have noticed so far.</p>

<p>A few caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🏭 I haven’t been able to visit an actual Twitter office yet, so I can’t say
anything about that side of things.</li>
  <li>🧪 I’ve only been at Twitter since July 2021; I was at Google for a lot longer
but I didn’t move around between projects as much as the average. So for both
companies, my “sample size” isn’t <em>that</em> large.</li>
  <li>G I have never worked for another tech company apart from these two. The
“early Google way” heavily influences what I would find “normal”, for better or
worse.</li>
  <li>💣 These are just mundane observations as a lowly engineer. If you’re looking
for a perspective that is both a little higher level (company ethics,
leadership, etc.), more lighthearted, and often a lot more critical, take a
look at the two cartoon series <a href="https://goomics.net">“Goomics”</a> and
<a href="https://twittoons.com">“Twittoons”</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So here we go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>💬 <strong>Slack vs email</strong>: everything at Twitter happens on Slack. One-on-one
chats, team discussions that don’t need to be meetings, questions to
leadership for all-hands meetings, requests for code reviews, social
chit-chat, etc. It’s not uncommon that I don’t even bother to check my work
email for a few days; that would never have happened at Google where most
things are done over email (some people also use instant messaging, but those
discussions aren’t assumed to be archived/preserved for the future). At
Twitter, you will more likely find relevant information for your problem by
searching Slack than other internal properties. The flip side is that if Slack
is down for any nontrivial period of time, that’s a significant loss of
productivity / knowledge.</li>
  <li>🔃 <strong>If it’s not core, it’s outsourced</strong>: Twitter outsources a lot more things
than Google does. Google likes to spin their own solution for pretty much
everything. They even used to have their own HR system (named, wait for it,
GHR) until they switched to Workday. Google has their own bug tracking system,
email, calendar, online office suite, code review system, internal
communication and social interaction tools, you name it. Twitter uses Google
calendar, email, office suite, Jira (bug tracker, project management), Okta
(single sign on), Phabricator (code reviews), Sentry (error monitoring),
WorkDay (HR, goal setting, peer reviews), Splunk, Office Timeline, Duo
(authentication – when I first joined and was told to install Duo on my
phone, I was mildly puzzled as I thought that referred to Google’s video chat
application). This also applies to more technical stuff and using <strong>open
technologies</strong>. On the one hand, this makes Twitter a lot less of a “tech
island” than Google is; on the other hand, authenticating into a thousand
services at Twitter can be a little inconvenient (single-sign-on tools are
making it mostly painless, but not always). The outsourcing can go quite far:
I was surprised when my team did its first “retrospective” (discussion on what
went well and what can be improved) and we were pointed to an external tool
for that, too. It makes sense in many ways, but it’s the sort of things that
ex-Googlers may find surprising.</li>
  <li>🍎 <strong>Apple laptops</strong>: for some reason, I would have expected Twitter to also be
big on <em>using</em> more open source software. It turns out 99% of employees use
Mac laptops: it’s the only officially supported platform. A very small number
of people use Linux laptops, and they need to jump through a bunch of extra
hoops to get things to work smoothly. I expect that this will gradually change
if the company keeps growing.</li>
  <li>🗓️ <strong>Meetings</strong> : I sometimes hear that one company or the other has a more
meeting-heavy culture. I haven’t really noticed that. From my experience, it
depends more on the team/project you’re on, than on the company.</li>
  <li>🤡 <strong>No Memegen</strong>: maybe I should make a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/reyhan/inside-googles-internal-meme-generator">Memegen</a> clone for Twitter :-D</li>
  <li>🌍 <strong>Distributed</strong>: Twitter is overall friendlier to remote work. Teams are
distributed geographically (and likely even more so with the
pandemic). Instead of trying to top-down “defragment” teams, the tools and
culture are adapted to better fit a distributed workforce and be
“async-first”. I would have expected Google to go further in that direction
too with the pandemic: it has, to some extent, but not as much as I’d have
thought. Twitter also has a lot more international offices than one would
expect for the company’s size, so it seems like the the threshold for opening
a new office is significantly lower.</li>
  <li>💻 <strong>My other computer is <em>not</em> a data center</strong>: maybe paradoxically (given
the previous item), it is very common for Google engineers to use a big
powerful machine “in the cloud” (or in an office) and to drive it remotely
using something lighter, that can be used from anywhere with good internet (I
started doing that around 2008). I would think this is overall more cost
effective, especially if the computing resources are dynamic/shared. That
doesn’t seem to be a thing yet at Twitter (though there are some discussions).
Hence, every engineer carries a beefy laptop around. Of course there are pros
and cons.</li>
  <li>🛠️ <strong>Hack week, 20%</strong>: Google has had its famous “20% project” policy for a
long time; it’s all but moribund by now. I quite like Twitter’s “Hack Week”
because it makes it clear and accepted that people aren’t expected to be
making progress on their main project during that week. It obviously doesn’t
quite amount to 20% though. I wonder what one “hack week” per quarter would
produce.</li>
  <li>👫 <strong>Gender diversity</strong>: my sample size is likely too small to tell if it’s
really a difference between companies, but on average a lot more of my
engineer co-workers at Twitter are women. And it’s actually the first time in
my career that in many of the eng meetings I attend, I’m the only guy in the
virtual chat room (out of 3 or 4 people). This is absolutely awesome.</li>
  <li>👷 <strong>Manager technicity</strong>: again my sample may be biased, but it seems like
managers at Twitter aren’t as technical, or actually, they are technical in a
different way. While I was at Google, a lot of the time my manager could
(maybe after a week or two for getting up to speed again) have done all, or
most of what I did, and often times better and faster than I could. Come
“performance evaluation” time, they could absolutely (and often would) look at
some of the code changes I made over the period. Again maybe I haven’t seen
enough yet, but Twitter “TLMs” (“tech lead managers”) are more managers and
less “tech”. I mean, my current manager used to be an iOS engineer so she
would absolutely kick my butt around the Earth five times before I can say
“autorelease”, and she would definitely understand the gist of my code in a
web application, but maybe not with as much of a deep understanding of the
tech stack. This also has pros and cons, but let’s say that I spend three
weeks on a really difficult task, but at the end of the year I forget to boast
about it or to request a peer review from someone who was in the loop, it
would likely go unnoticed.</li>
  <li>🙋 <strong>Q &amp; A with leadership</strong>: Googlers used to have a pretty open channel of
communication with the company’s leadership during the weekly company-wide
all-hands (TGIF). It’s much less open by now. Twitter’s “OneTeam” is still
pretty open from what I can see, but the process for asking questions and get
them forwarded to people on the virtual stage is pretty messy (all done on
Slack). During the last “hack week”, I made an open source clone of Google’s
“Dory” (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Moderator">Moderator</a>
for a little while) that I named <a href="https://github.com/lmanul/marlin">Marlin</a>. I
then found out that Twitter used to have a similar tool, and there’s a bit of
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-twitter-silenced-anonymous-posts-on-an-internal-emp-1798354222">controversial
history</a>
to dig up here. We’ll see where this goes.</li>
  <li>📃 <strong>Documentation/comments</strong>: I don’t have objective data to back this up,
but I feel like engineers at Twitter are less diligent at adding comments and
documentation to their code. I would say that most teams at Google are far
from great for this, but if anything Twitter is a bit worse. For instance, a
good practice could be to provide for each toplevel “class” (assuming an
object-oriented programming model) a short description of what it does.</li>
  <li>🗝️ <strong>Code ownership granularity</strong>: Code “ownership” is a common pattern to
guard against bad changes. To make any modification, you need to either be
an owner of the piece of code you are changing (or of a superset), or get an
approval from an owner. In most projects that I’ve seen at Google, the level
of “granularity” for ownership is significantly lower, meaning that various
sections and sub-sections of a piece of software can be owned by different
people. With the general rule of thumb that the longer you’ve been on a
project, the more you “bubble up” the ownership tree and can change or approve
changes to larger chunks. Twitter, so far, has more of an “all or nothing”
approach. Once you become an owner for the web application code (respectively
the iOS client, the Android client, etc.), you can make changes to any part
(with a couple of exceptions). I know there are discussions to potentially
move to more granularity.</li>
  <li>👀 <strong>Code reviews</strong>: I would say that the code review process at Twitter is
both faster, and requires more effort. Google’s internal code review tools
provide you with a simple and automated way to add a suggested set of
reviewers for a given change. It takes into account code ownership, time
zones, people out of office, etc. So you can generally just press a button and
assume that your change will get reviewed in a reasonable time frame. At
Twitter, the “code ownership” constraints will be enforced, but it is up to
you to assign reviewers (as groups or individuals). Once you’ve done that, you
need to explicitly ask for a review, either on a Slack channel, or to a given
person (I made a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/review-plz/cdbcggkjiegcjopnplpimilepkobhgbd">simple browser
extension</a>
to make it a little easier). The flip side is that you can usually get a review
faster.</li>
  <li>👨‍👧‍👦 <strong>Pods</strong>: I am still figuring this out, and I think this is specific
to engineers working on the Twitter web application (I still need to read
<a href="https://leaddev.com/scaling-teams-hypergrowth/how-twitter-grew-single-team-thriving-distributed-community">this
article</a>
which specifically describes this in more detail). But my first reaction to
seeing these “pods” was mostly puzzlement. They are not purely a social thing
or it would probably make more sense to include engineers working on iOS,
Android, Back-end, etc. They are not project-based either (pod members tend to
work on different features). Nor are they related to the org chart, since pod
members report to different managers. But there is a social dimension, with
regular meetings for casual chat and/or playing games together. There is also
a project dimension since pods seem to have meetings where everyone quickly
describes their ongoing tasks. And there are regular meetings between the
pod’s “tech lead” and the pod members. I’m going to guess the goal may be to
bring people with various degrees of seniority together (but wouldn’t
project-based teams tend to achieve the same purpose?), to spread knowledge
about the various ongoing efforts, and to provide a smaller work group within
which people can review one another’s code. So I’m still a little puzzled, and
I look forward to reading the article above, but I thought I would share my
impression before getting the “official” story.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that wasn’t too boring, thank you for reading, and feedback welcome!</p>
