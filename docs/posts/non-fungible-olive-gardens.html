                <h2>Project mission</h2>
                <p>For too long, ownership of Olive Garden franchises has been dominated by the capricious whims of the fiat system. That’s why we’re enabling anyone to trustlessly mint a nonfungible token representing 1 of 880 real Olive Garden franchises in the United States.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to bootstrap a community of Olive Garden enthusiasts, which is why the franchise mint price is tethered to the reasonable cost of a Tour Of Italy entree ($19.99, as of Dec 20, 2021).</p>
                <p>Missed out on minting a franchise? You can <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/non-fungible-olive-gardens">browse them on OpenSea</a> or become part of the family by minting unlimited complimentary breadsticks. And everyone is welcome to <a href="https://dsc.gg/nfog" target="_blank">come join our Discord for some good conversation over a hot bowl of minestrone</a>.</p>

                <h2>Technical specifications</h2>
                <p>Every Non-fungible Olive Garden franchise is an ERC-721 token representing one real-world Olive Garden location. Images are programatically generated with a variety of 9 delicious backgrounds including fettucini alfredo, chicken marsala, and more. Metadata and images are distributed on IPFS.</p>
                <p>Breadsticks are ERC-721 tokens numbered in the order minted. Breadstick metadata is stored on-chain with images distributed on IPFS.</p>

                <h2>FAQs</h2>

                <p>Does this confer ownership of or investment in a real Olive Garden franchise?</p>
                <p>While every Non-fungible Olive Garden is tethered to a real Olive Garden, ownership is currently limited to the Non-fungible Olive Garden Metaverse, granting owners no rights or privileges in meatspace Olive Gardens. This may change in the future (see roadmap).</p>

                <p>Is this affiliated with Olive Garden?</p>
                <p>No. We are simply a community of Olive Garden fans invested in both trustless future economies and delicious, reasonably-priced Italian fare.</p>

                <p>So am I buying a picture of an Olive Garden?</p>
                <p>No. Token artwork is for representation only and confers no ownership over the photograph. You&#39;re not purchasing art, you&#39;re purchasing ownership of a Non-Fungible Olive Garden franchise.</p>

                <p>One of the photos is wrong or out of date.</p>
                <p>We&#39;ve done our best to verify the accuracy of the images used, but there may be discrepancies.</p>

                <p>Can I buy a specific Olive Garden?</p>
                <p>The initial mint of franchises is random and you&#39;re unable to select a location. You can browse franchises that have already been minted on OpenSea and make offers there.</p>

                <p>The breadsticks are really free?</p>
                <p>Yes. Breadsticks will remain free and unlimited in perpetuity. You will have to pay gas fees to mint them, but these fees go to miners, not to us.</p>
