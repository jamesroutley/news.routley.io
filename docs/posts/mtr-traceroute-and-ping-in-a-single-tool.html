    <h1>MTR: &#39;traceroute&#39; and &#39;ping&#39; in a single tool</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<h2>What is MTR?</h2>
<p>
  mtr combines the functionality of the &#39;traceroute&#39; and &#39;ping&#39; programs 
  in a single network diagnostic tool.
</p>
<p>
  As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
  mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
  determines the address of each network hop between the machines, 
  it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the 
  quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
  running statistics about each machine. For a preview take a look at
  the <a href="https://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/screenshots.html">screenshots</a>.
</p>
<p>
  mtr is distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
  See the COPYING file for details.  
</p>
<h2>Where to get MTR</h2>
<p>
  mtr is now maintained in <a href="https://github.com/traviscross/mtr">
  a git repository at github</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively you can get
  MTR from the BitWizard FTP site at 
  <a href="ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/mtr/">
           ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/mtr/</a> or
  <a href="https://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/files">
           https://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/files</a>.
  I&#39;m still struggling to make my new &#34;make a release script&#34; adapt
  to the new situation with git. If the latest version is missing, and
  you can&#39;t get it from github for one reason or another, let me know 
  and I&#39;ll have to  make one for you manually. 
</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>
  Mtr uses autoconf. This should allow compatibility with a large range
  of operating systems. Feel free to report problems. We can then try to
  iron them out.
</p>
<p>
  I don&#39;t have much experience in using autoconf. Therefore I&#39;m eager to
  learn more about it, as it seems a very useful tool. I&#39;ve been editing
  small sections of the autoconf files, but I welcome suggestions on how
  to do things better. There usually IS a way to do it better....
</p>
<h2>Compiling MTR</h2>
<p>
  Compiling mtr should be as easy as &#34;make&#34;. If it is harder
  for you, your computer is misconfigured, or there is a problem with
  mtr that we should take care of. Please report this kind of problems.
</p>
<h2>Questions / bugs / Mailing list.</h2>
<p>
  mtr has moved to github as the bug tracking system. If you have a
  bug, preferably with a patch to fix it please enter it into the tracking
  system. <a href="https://github.com/traviscross/mtr/issues">MTR bugtracking at github.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The mailing list was dismantled when I noticed that ALL messages 
  from the last two years were spam, and no serious messages at all 
  were in the logs. Mail me or submit a bug request or preferably 
  a patch. :-) 
</p>
<h2>Binary distributions</h2>
<p>
Ryan&#39;s build and/or mirror apparenltly stopped working somewhere in 1999, 
14 years ago and nobody noticed. Apparently not worth maintaining. 
</p>
<p>
kanedaaa has packages up to slackware 12.1, also a while ago. Possibly
because mtr is included in the distribution. 
</p>
<p>
The debian distribution has mtr builtin, so it would be preferrable to
just use that. 
</p> 
<p>
The freebsd ports link still works and has a reasonably recent version. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>  Ryan Weaver has been making RPMs for mtr. He puts them
  on his ftp site, which I mirror onto 
  <a href="ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/mtr/rpms/">
           ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/mtr/rpms/</a> .

</li><li> kanedaaa builds slackware packages at: 
  <a href="http://kaneda.bohater.net/slackware/packages/">
            http://kaneda.bohater.net/slackware/packages/</a>.
</li><li> The freeBSD team makes binaries at 
 <a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-stable/net/">
          ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-stable/net/</a>
 Substitute the correct packages-..-current if you are running a &#34;-current&#34;
 version. If anybody can tell me how I can get mirror to flatten the symlinks
 that they use, I&#39;ll mirror them here at BitWizard. 
</li><li> The debian team makes binaries at 
 <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/net/mtr_0.39-1.deb">
          ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/net/mtr_0.39-1.deb</a>
 The mirror worked in 30 seconds, no problems there. So you can get the package
 from the <a href="ftp://ftp.bitwizard.nl/mtr/debian/">BitWizard site
too</a>. 

</li><li> Michael Collard no longer builds and maintains x64_64 binaries at:
http://members.iinet.net.au/~quadfour/projects.html. (the link is dead. I don&#39;t
expect Michael to still do this, If he does and you know the new location, tell me.)

</li></ul>
<p>
  If you want to contribute binaries in a way similar to this, feel
  free to volunteer.</p>
<h2>Live on the web</h2>
<p>
Christian Pekeler had setup a web-frontend for running mtr from six (or
maybe more by now) different places around the globe. That seems to have
gone offline now in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
This is great for figuring out if your server is really down or just 
unreachable from part of the world. Of course, if all of Christian&#39;s
servers can reach your target, that doesn&#39;t guarantee that it is reachable
from everywhere, but it  does make it clear that a 
possible problem is not &#34;near&#34; your server network-wise. 
</p>

<p>
As that service has gone offline, a quick google search revealed several
different services setup by others. So you may have to hop between a few
of those services to test the &#34;from different parts in the world&#34; aspect
that used to be possible. In general the &#34;parts of the world are 
unreachable from some locations&#34; problems seem to have reduced enormously
over the last two decades. Such events are now very rare. 
</p>
<p>
I searched for &#34;online mtr&#34; and got decent results. (Top four results 
were valid). 
</p>


<h2>History</h2>
<p>  MTR was written by Matt Kimball, with contributions by many people.
  Take a look at the &#34;AUTHORS&#34; file in the distribution.
  Roger Wolff took over maintenance of MTR in october 1998.
