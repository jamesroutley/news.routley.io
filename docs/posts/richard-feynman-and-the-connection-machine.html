<p>One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that        I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million        processors. His reaction was unequivocal, &#34;That is positively the dopiest idea        I ever heard.&#34; For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it        wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch        he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.</p>
<p>Richard&#39;s interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where        he supervised the &#34;computers,&#34; that is, the people who operated the mechanical        calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable        tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened        in the late 1970&#39;s when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT.</p>
<p>I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT        Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me        with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve        common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain        a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called        it a &#34;Connection Machine.&#34; Richard, always interested in his son&#39;s activities,        followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever        we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early        hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time        he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the        lunchtime meeting.</p>
<p>Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had        been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We        set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up        we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars        in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months.        We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked        in, saluted, and said, &#34;Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what&#39;s        my assignment?&#34; The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was        astounded.</p>
<p>After a hurried private discussion (&#34;I don&#39;t know, you hired him...&#34;), we        informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of        parallel processing to scientific problems.</p>
<p>&#34;That sounds like a bunch of baloney,&#34; he said. &#34;Give me something real to        do.&#34;</p>
<p>So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided        that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router        that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that        our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we        gave him the assignment of analyzing the router.</p>
<h2>The Machine</h2>
<p>The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed        the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the        processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire        between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would        require $10^{12]$ wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a        20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20        others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously,        many messages would contend for the same wires. The router&#39;s job was to find        a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn&#39;t, to hold        onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard        Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate        efficiently.</p>
<p>During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams        as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations        of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything        himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard        occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring        the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects        Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did        a remarkable job of focusing on his &#34;assignment,&#34; stopping only occasionally        to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the        investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we        all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines        Corporation, Richard was delighted. &#34;That&#39;s good. Now I don&#39;t have to explain        to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name        of the company.&#34;</p>
<p>The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities.        We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but        even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own        silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent        packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways        of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring        the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands        of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated        the project was going to be, we never would have started.</p>
<h2>&#39;Get These Guys Organized&#39;</h2>
<p>I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head.        Richard volunteered to help out. &#34;We&#39;ve got to get these guys organized,&#34; he        told me. &#34;Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.&#34;</p>
<p>Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their        life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were        supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at        Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got &#34;cockeyed,&#34; Richard        would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using        this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance        in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the        &#34;group leader&#34; in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>Part Two of Feynman&#39;s &#34;Let&#39;s Get Organized&#34; campaign was that we should begin        a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things        to do with our machine. Richard&#39;s idea was that we should concentrate on people        with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind        of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield,        a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural        networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying        ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was        certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation.</p>
<p>What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory],        a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains        it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet.        Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar        pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter &#34;A&#34; will &#34;remind&#34;        the memory of another &#34;A&#34; that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured        out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological        neurons.</p>
<p>Not only did Hopfield&#39;s method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on        the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor        to simulate each of Hopfield&#39;s neurons, with the strength of the connections        represented as numbers in the processors&#39; memory. Because of the parallel nature        of Hopfield&#39;s algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with        100\% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster        than any conventional computer.</p>
<h2>An Algorithm For Logarithms</h2>
<p>Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield&#39;s network on the Connection        Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine        for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever        algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the        mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between        1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty).        Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product        of numbers of the form $1 + 2^{-k]$, where $k$ is an integer. Testing each of        these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift        and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed        by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm        fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the        logarithms of $1 + 2^{-k]$ could be shared by all the processors. The entire        computation took less time than division.</p>
<p>Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical        of Richard&#39;s approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid        attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he        insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted        abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years        later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific        American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked,        &#34;How is anyone supposed to know that this isn&#39;t just a bunch of crap?&#34;</p>
<p>Feynman&#39;s insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential        of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced        ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at        &#34;number-crunching,&#34; because the first prototype had no special hardware for        vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were &#34;known&#34; to be requirements        for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that        he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics.</p>
<p>Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles        such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute        the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton&#39;s mass. In practice,        such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest        computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to        use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding        the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations        of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative        sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes        this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration        involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and        the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all        of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity        to keep all 64,000 processors busy.</p>
<p>To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer        program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar        with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the        program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the        Connection Machine.</p>
<p>He was excited by the results. &#34;Hey Danny, you&#39;re not going to believe this,        but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!&#34; According to        Feynman&#39;s calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware        for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building        for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more        toward looking at numerical applications of the machine.</p>
<p>By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the        behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented        his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist        this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean        circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman&#39;s        router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities        such as &#34;the average number of 1 bits in a message address.&#34; I was much more        accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis        than taking the derivative of &#34;the number of 1&#39;s&#34; with respect to time. Our        discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman&#39;s equations        suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.</p>
<p>The decision to ignore Feynman&#39;s analysis was made in September, but by next        spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly        too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the        number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman&#39;s equations claimed we        could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking        better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the        smaller number of buffers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked.        The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway&#39;s game of Life.</p>
<h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
<p>The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested        Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their        lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman        often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton.        The notion is that the &#34;continuum&#34; might, at its lowest levels, be discrete        in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence        of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton        that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors,        like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way,        then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit        on the density of information per cubic meter of space.</p>
<p>The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman        had known at Los Alamos. Richard&#39;s recent interest in the subject was motivated        by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated        by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out        to them that he considered their specific models &#34;kooky,&#34; but like the Connection        Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into.</p>
<p>There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical        space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity.        One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look        the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata,        such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the        axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed        lattice of automata?</p>
<p>Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted        (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying        automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a        pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through        this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction.</p>
<p>Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen        Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should        use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating        physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each        cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics.        For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem        since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a        simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram        used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a        turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially        Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions        to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make        it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time.</p>
<h2>Feynman the Explainer</h2>
<p>In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what        we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started        talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman        told us to explain it like this,</p>
<p>&#34;We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little        on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow        of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings.        We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary        particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect        ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow        of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural        fluids.&#34;</p>
<p>This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated        the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention        all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted        the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of        the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality.</p>
<p>We tried to take advantage of Richard&#39;s talent for clarity by getting him        to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions.        Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of        our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the        planned presentation. &#34;Don&#39;t say `reflected acoustic wave.&#39; Say [echo].&#34; Or,        &#34;Forget all that `local minima&#39; stuff. Just say there&#39;s a bubble caught in the        crystal and you have to shake it out.&#34; Nothing made him angrier than making        something simple sound complicated.</p>
<p>Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended        not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise.        Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse        with &#34;That&#39;s not my department.&#34; I could never figure out just what his department        was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on        those &#34;not-my-department&#34; problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more        often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, &#34;I&#39;ve        been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...&#34; This        worked best if you were careful not to expect it.</p>
<p>I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the &#34;dirty work.&#34; In        fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines        was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or        painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being        asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even        when Richard didn&#39;t understand, he always seemed to understand better than the        rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well.        Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him        as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your        question was, he never made you feel like a fool.</p>
<p>The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming        characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it        came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest &#34;girl&#34;        and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook,        an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer        who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. &#34;Yes, it really annoys        me,&#34; she said. &#34;On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum        mechanics to me as if I could understand it.&#34; That was the essence of Richard&#39;s        charm.</p>
<h2>A Kind Of Game</h2>
<p>Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating        point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its        successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more        for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with        his QCD program. Richard&#39;s interest shifted from the construction of the machine        to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse        to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science.        We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists        --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible        to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine        requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly        the kind of thing that Richard loved to do.</p>
<p>For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started        by asking very basic questions like, &#34;What is the simplest example?&#34; or &#34;How        can you tell if the answer is right?&#34; He asked questions until he reduced the        problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve.        Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results.        While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible        to interrupt. &#34;Don&#39;t bug me. I&#39;m busy,&#34; he would say without even looking up.        Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he        lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next        day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems        in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images,        and reading insurance forms.</p>
<p>The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution.        I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually        reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results        were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden        leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows        some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such &#34;punctuated        equilibrium,&#34; so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened.        He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in        Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based        on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library        and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment,        all of our &#34;discoveries&#34; were covered in the first few pages. When I called        back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. &#34;Hey, we got it right!&#34;        he said. &#34;Not bad for amateurs.&#34;</p>
<p>In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together,        we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing,        we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were        so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs        who made the progress.</p>
<h2>Telling The Good Stuff You Know</h2>
<p>Actually, I doubt that it was &#34;progress&#34; that most interested Richard. He        was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking        at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the        world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete        for him until he had taught it to someone else.</p>
<p>I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in        the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard,        recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than        usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up        on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and        his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer        had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my        mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, &#34;Hey, what&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
<p>I hesitated. &#34;I&#39;m sad because you&#39;re going to die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he sighed, &#34;that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.&#34;        And after a few more steps, &#34;When you get as old as I am, you start to realize        that you&#39;ve told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.&#34;</p>
<p>We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where        another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings.        Suddenly a grin lit up his face. &#34;Hey,&#34; he said, all trace of sadness forgotten,        &#34;I bet I can show you a better way home.&#34;</p>
<p>And so he did.</p>
