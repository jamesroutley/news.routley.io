<article>
    <p>January 2026 will mark 10 years since I started storing my personal finances in plain
text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I&#39;ve taken out about 30-45 minutes every
single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount
ledger.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot to talk about here, but let&#39;s start with some fun numbers!</p>
<h2 id="the-10-year-old-beancount-ledger">The 10 year old Beancount ledger</h2>
<p>10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over
45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored
in a <code>finances</code> directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here&#39;s a snapshot:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find . -name </span><span>&#34;*.beancount&#34; </span><span>| </span><span>xargs wc -l
</span><span>    4037 ./includes/2020.beancount
</span><span>    3887 ./includes/2018.beancount
</span><span>      27 ./includes/cash.beancount
</span><span>    4398 ./includes/2021.beancount
</span><span>    5531 ./includes/2019.beancount
</span><span>    5267 ./includes/2022.beancount
</span><span>    3287 ./includes/2017.beancount
</span><span>    5506 ./includes/2024.beancount
</span><span>    5606 ./includes/2023.beancount
</span><span>    1454 ./includes/2016.beancount
</span><span>    1089 ./includes/open/04-expenses.beancount
</span><span>      66 ./includes/open/03-income.beancount
</span><span>      11 ./includes/open/05-liabilities.beancount
</span><span>      37 ./includes/open/02-assets.beancount
</span><span>       1 ./includes/open/01-equity.beancount
</span><span>    4807 ./main.beancount
</span><span>   45011 total
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running <code>bean-query</code> on <code>main.beancount</code> tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ uv run bean-query main.beancount
</span><span>Input file: </span><span>&#34;Goel&#34;
</span><span>Ready with 12466 directives (19743 postings in 9895 transactions)</span><span>.
</span><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are 1086 accounts in total.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select count(</span><span>*</span><span>) from (select distinct(account))</span><span>;
</span><span>coun
</span><span>----
</span><span>1086
</span></code></pre>
<p>... which does not mean that there are 1086 <strong>bank</strong> accounts. Accounts in Beancount are
virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing
supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription,
and so on.</p>
<p>Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>❯ find documents/ -name </span><span>&#34;*.pdf&#34; </span><span>| </span><span>wc -l
</span><span>     507
</span></code></pre>
<p>Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that
makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax
returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right
there next to the relevant transaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023
was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>beanquery</span><span>&gt;</span><span> select year(date), count(</span><span>*</span><span>) where year(date) </span><span>&lt; </span><span>2025 </span><span>group by year(date)</span><span>;
</span><span>year  coun
</span><span>----  ----
</span><span>2016   715
</span><span>2017  1422
</span><span>2018  1605
</span><span>2019  2437
</span><span>2020  1582
</span><span>2021  2022
</span><span>2022  2435
</span><span>2023  2651
</span><span>2024  2602
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-monthly-ritual">The Monthly Ritual</h2>
<p>I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial
transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much
more detailed <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/how-you-can-track-your-personal-finances-using-python/">blog post</a> about it a few years ago, but here&#39;s a gist.</p>
<p>It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s)
in CSV (CSV because it&#39;s much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run
these CSV files through what&#39;s called an &#34;importer&#34;, that converts this CSV data into
data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries
into my current <code>.beancount</code> file (which is the main file containing <strong>all</strong> my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it&#39;s balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction&#39;s description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.</p>
<p>Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a
<code>&lt;year&gt;.beancount</code> file and add an <code>include &lt;year.beancount&gt;</code> in the active
<code>main.beancount</code>file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.</p>
<p>With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are
contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.</p>
<h2 id="building-beancount-importers-for-german-banks">Building Beancount Importers for German Banks</h2>
<p>Beancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge
of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes
in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV
export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work
with.</p>
<p>I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few
importers for a few different banks, specifically <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-dkb">beancount-dkb</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-ing">beancount-ing</a>,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-n26">beancount-n26</a>, and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siddhantgoel/beancount-commerzbank">beancount-commerzbank</a>. I closed out my Commerzbank account a
while ago, so I don&#39;t maintain that integration anymore, but the first three
libraries are actively maintained (and used)!</p>

<p>My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but
as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some
trial and error to figure things out and have that &#34;aha&#34; moment.</p>
<p>I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it&#39;s tricky for others as well. So I wrote
a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you&#39;re
interested, here&#39;s a link: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com">https://personalfinancespython.com</a>.</p>
<p>The feedback on the book has been super positive. It got mentioned on Beancount&#39;s
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/external_contributions.html">external contributions</a> page, and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://personalfinancespython.com/#testimonials">reader reviews</a> have all been very encouraging!</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels
invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on <strong>my own
machine</strong>, not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that
I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem
gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext
accounting is so powerful.</p>
