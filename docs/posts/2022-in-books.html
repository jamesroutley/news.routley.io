<p>I was quite happy with this post format <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2022-01-01-2021-in-books.html">a year ago</a>, so here‚Äôs a list of
very short book reviews for what I‚Äôve read in 2022. Way more fiction,
compared to none at all a year ago!</p>

</figure>
<p>Reading this was part of my long-term low-priority project ‚Äúread all
<em>A Book Apart</em> books‚Äù, because they‚Äôre nice and short, and they
help extend my backend-focused horizons. The second edition is from
2015, so there‚Äôs no mention of flexbox and grids, which I‚Äôm pretty sure
would dominate a contemporary version.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt all useless, though, and among other things has nice
introductions to media queries and mobile-first design.</p>

</figure>
<p>I found this pretty interesting because it comes with lots of
examples of companies I‚Äôm familiar with, and I could always think about
the design of the product of the company I work for as well. As always,
I was thrilled to find references to books I‚Äôve read previously, such as
applying the ‚ÄúPeak-end Rule‚Äù from <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2020-07-07-thinking-fast-slow-takeaways.html"><em>Thinking, Fast
and Slow</em></a> to figure out when to talk how to a user. Like, you
probably shouldn‚Äôt solicit an app store review right after the user has
encountered an error. (Unless you‚Äôd like to have a really low rating, of
course.)</p>

<p>This was my third attempt at reading this. The first time around I
had made it through the first two parts, then for some reason I stopped
for a long time and started over, and then the third edition of the book
came out and I kind of had to start over again.</p>
<p>In any case, this time I finished, and I think it‚Äôs an excellent
book! The exercises are fun and insightful, the online playground is
well done, and it‚Äôs fully open source. I did all the <a href="https://github.com/bewuethr/exercises/tree/main/eloquent_js">exercises</a>,
and two silly creations from there now even have a permanent home on my
blog (<a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2022-01-09-mouse-trail.html">here</a> and <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2022-01-16-game-of-life.html">here</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>I was doing a survey for developers at work, and wanted to read
something to help me avoid common mistakes. This was nice and short,
though I‚Äôm not sure how useful it really was. In the end, I drew a lot
more value from the <a href="https://infraeng.dev/developer-survey/"><em>Developer Productivity
Survey</em></a> article by Will Larson on his Infrastructure Engineering
website.</p>

</figure>
<p>I‚Äôm trying to (re-)read classics I definitely wasn‚Äôt able to
appreciate when told to read them in high school (like <em>Brave New
World</em>, which I re-read in 2019), or this one, which I haven‚Äôt read
before. I‚Äôm not going to bother and try to add a meaningful review here,
but I enjoyed it a lot, and the speakers/screens in every room‚Ä¶ I think
that prediction has come true <span data-emoji="grimacing">üò¨</span></p>

</figure>
<p>We read this in the book club at work. It‚Äôs based on the <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/">essay of the
same name</a>, and my slightly snarky review would be that just reading
the essay probably is a much better bang for buck. I didn‚Äôt hate it, but
I also didn‚Äôt feel like it gave me some deep insights. I will read the
essay at some point, though, and maybe walk back this assessment.</p>
<p>If I had to pick one thing I <em>did</em> like, it‚Äôs the notion of
‚Äúwealth is what you don‚Äôt see‚Äù: the ‚Äúcars not purchased‚Äù, the ‚Äúupgrade
declined‚Äù.</p>

</figure>
<p>Apparently, 2021 saw a second edition of this, but O‚ÄôReilly only has
the first edition from 2016, so that‚Äôs what I read. I think this brings
the most value when read right after <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/"><em>The
Phoenix Project</em></a>, because it makes so many of the concepts
introduced there more clear and concrete.</p>
<p>I read TPP in 2018, but thanks to <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2020-02-24-unicorn-project-review.html"><em>The Unicorn

there was no shortage of business books written as novels in the first
person until I got around to reading the DevOps Handbook.</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt actually played many of the more recent id games, but
mostly ancient ones (such as Commander Keen). How id has pushed what‚Äôs
possible technically has always fascinated me, though, and this book is
an excellent retelling of the entire story. Plus, I love reading about
places that must have been special to work at.</p>

</figure>
<p>We read this in the tech book club at work. It doesn‚Äôt go super deep,
but gives a nice high-level overview of the topic. It would sometimes
talk about challenges one might encounter without really talking about
solution approaches, but more often than not, those would be discussed
in <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2021-02-02-ddia-review.html"><em>Designing Data-Intensive
Applications</em></a>, which we read previously.</p>
<p>Much was also very complementary to <a href="#the-devops-handbook"><em>The DevOps Handbook</em></a>, or maybe
that was just top of mind because the readings overlapped.</p>

Web Development on the JAMstack</em></a> by Mathias Biilmann and Phil
Hawksworth</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is more of a ‚Äúreport‚Äù than a book, and I read it because I
started working with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> around
that time. It talks about JAMstack as a new paradigm for web
development, and was a quick and easy read to solidify my understanding
of the space.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2023-01-21-neuman-cover.jpg" alt="Neuromancer by William Gibson"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/293994/neuromancer-by-william-gibson/9780441007462"><em>Neuromancer</em></a>
by William Gibson</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I had heard of <em>Neuromancer</em> often before, and wanted to
tackle a few seminal science fiction books for a while, so this is where
I started. The alternative would have been <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal
Stephenson, which I still plan to read, but later.</p>
<p>Gibson coined the term ‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù, and this novel is considered
instrumental in the birth of the cyberpunk genre, though Gibson himself
apparently doesn‚Äôt like it being called that. I definitely had to look
up a lot more words than usual when reading, and as it turns out, a
bunch of them are totally made up by Gibson and exist only in the
universe of the <em>Sprawl</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>It was a very entertaining read, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I haven‚Äôt
understood everything fully.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2023-01-21-couzer-cover.jpg" alt="Count Zero by William Gibson"/>

Zero</em></a> by William Gibson</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clearly, I thought I should go all in and read the whole
<em>Sprawl</em> trilogy as fast as possible. This might have contributed
to everything being a bit of a blur, but Gibson doesn‚Äôt make it easy,
either, and loves to have the story develop in multiple separate
threads, which come together only at the very end.</p>
<p>As usual, I had to discover the big reveal by reading about it
elsewhere rather than ‚Äúgetting‚Äù it from the book itself, but that‚Äôs
fine‚Äîthe experience of reading was not made worse by that.</p>

</figure>
<p>The final book in the <em>Sprawl</em> trilogy is a bit more obviously
set in the same universe; rather than just brand names and the like
re-appearing, some of the main characters are actually the same as in
the other books.</p>
<p>And, like in the other books, it was more about the journey than the
destination, as again, I totally did not get the big reveal at the
end.</p>

</figure>
<p>Reading this was part of my efforts to get through <em>those</em>
books that appear on every single ‚Äúmust read‚Äù list for software
people.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but even though this revised edition came out in
2019, it felt very dated overall. I did take away a few things that I
haven‚Äôt thought about before in the way the book presents them, such as
‚Äútracer bullets‚Äù, and applying the ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù theory to code.</p>
<p>Overall, though, I certainly don‚Äôt agree with the ‚Äúlive-changing!‚Äù
reviews elsewhere, and the awful reading experience in the O‚ÄôReilly app
didn‚Äôt help. Code blocks are, for some reason, displayed all centred,
instead of using correctly indented lines‚Ä¶</p>

</figure>
<p>We picked this for book club at work. It wasn‚Äôt entirely useless, but
I spent lots of energy being annoyed by the off-the-charts egocentrism
of the author. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm addicted to Twitter, ergo everybody is. It‚Äôs a
problem!‚Äù</p>
<p>It didn‚Äôt help that a few minutes of googling bring to light
instances of plagiarism and fabrication of story elements by the author‚Ä¶
I was confused for a while why he‚Äôd post the full length of all audio
interviews on the book website, but I guess it‚Äôs some kind of
self-protection mechanism.</p>
<p>In any case, it wasn‚Äôt a <em>total</em> waste of time, and I did take
away a few things, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that was the last book by this
author I‚Äôve read.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is a collection of short stories, mostly by Gibson, with three
contributed by guest authors. Of the ones written by Gibson, three take
place in the same universe as the <em>Sprawl</em> trilogy; since I‚Äôd
already gone through that in its entirety, I thought why not make it
complete.</p>
<p>Almost every story has some delightful plot twist, or maybe all of
them do and I just didn‚Äôt catch them. One of the <em>Sprawl</em> stories
is <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>, which I only knew as a weird movie starring
Keanu Reeves until learning about its short story origin. I re-watched
it after reading, with all the context of the books, and it was still
definitely weird, but also entertaining.</p>

<p>Part 2 of the ‚Äúread all the books from <em>those</em> lists‚Äù project,
after <em><a href="#the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic
Programmer</a></em>. I can confirm all the common criticisms: it should
really be called ‚ÄúClean Java‚Äù, the disclaimer about there maybe existing
other truths is half-hearted, and the whole thing is pretty dated by
now.</p>
<p>I did take away a few points, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>A renewed willingness to spend more time on giving things meaningful
names (or asking others to do so in code reviews)</li>
<li>The idea of abstraction levels and avoiding straddling too many in a
single function</li>
<li>Making an effort to make code read top to bottom, telling a
story</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>I skipped a few books from <em>A Book Apart</em> to jump ahead to
this one; specifically, I needed to learn enough Sass/SCSS so I could
create a calendar layout for the <a href="https://swissclubtoronto.ca/events/">Swiss Club Toronto events
page</a>; that website uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
and Jekyll uses Sass. So there. The result can be admired <a href="https://github.com/swissclubto/swissclubto.github.io/blob/dc6a89f7c049c124621c9825b0915261743110ac/assets/css/main.scss#L12-L87">here</a>.</p>
<p>I quite like SCSS, and it still does a few things that modern CSS
doesn‚Äôt do natively, but with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/">CSS nesting</a> on the
horizon, I guess we‚Äôre getting closer to not needing preprocessors any
longer.</p>

Brains: Dealing with All THOSE Impossible People at Work</em></a> by
Albert J. Bernstein and Sydney Craft Rozen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I bumped into this in the references of <em><a href="#the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></em>, put
it on my ‚Äúto read‚Äù list, and then was gifted a physical copy, making
this the only non-electronic book I read this year. (And books are great
gifts.)</p>
<p>The fundamental premise of the book is to be aware of an irrational
‚Äúmode‚Äù of the human brain (the eponymous ‚Äúdinosaur brain‚Äù), and
recognize it in others as well as oneself. That‚Äôs a pretty useful
idea.</p>
<p>In many ways, though, the book is a product of its time (published in
1989): gender roles are pretty stereotypical, women get advice on how to
better navigate that time of the month where, you know, they‚Äôre more
irritable‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And maybe I was just lucky in my career, but the workplaces described
all sound like terrible companies. I‚Äôd rather quit than employ all the
techniques to keep the dinosaurs at bay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4014333341">This
Goodreads review</a> summarizes it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A strange mix of insightful, useful commentary and questionable,

First Design Patterns</em></a>, 2nd ed., by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth
Robson</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I read this to prep for reading the OG <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/"><em>Design
Patterns</em></a>, which, though clearly part of <em>The List</em>, is
now old enough to warrant more context before reading, and I wanted that
context from a modern interpretation such as the <em>Head First</em>
book. (After <em>Design Patterns</em>, I should probably go on and also
read the <em>actual</em> OG books, <a href="https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/timeless-way-of-building.html"><em>The
Timeless Way of Building</em></a> and <a href="https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/pattern-language.html"><em>A
Pattern Language</em></a>.)</p>
<p>I was a bit skeptic of the <em>Head First</em> style at first, but I
think I‚Äôm a convert now. When I want to retain much from a book, I‚Äôll
read and highlight in a first pass, then go over the chapter again and
summarize it. This book basically did that work for me by repeating
principles, never skipping over details, and I guess the
unapologetically silly cartoons and interviews with patterns also
helped. I didn‚Äôt even mind that it all was Java.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Sterling</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After reading his first trilogy and the related short stories, the
logical consequence was to commit to reading William Gibson‚Äôs work in
its entirety, and <em>The Difference Engine</em> is the next book after
the <em>Sprawl</em> trilogy. I knew the co-author, Bruce Sterling, from
one of the short stories in <em><a href="#burning-chrome">Burning
Chrome</a></em> already.</p>
<p>Apparently, every few books, Gibson creates an entire new literary
genre (or at least popularizes it); in this one, it‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">steampunk</a>. I loved
all the references to mechanical computers and how they changed the
course of the world as we know it, and even though I (again) totally
missed the huge reveal at the end of the book, I thoroughly enjoyed
it.</p>
