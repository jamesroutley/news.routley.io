    <h1>Show HN: Clippy â€“ 90s UI for local LLMs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>
            Clippy lets you run a variety of large language models (LLMs)
            locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the
            1990s. It&#39;s a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy - and
            the visual design created by Microsoft in that era.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Simple, familiar, and classic chat interface</strong>.
              Send messages to your models, get a response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Batteries included: No complicated setup</strong>. Just
              open the app and chat away. Thanks to llama.cpp and
              <code>node-llama-cpp</code>, the app will automatically discover
              the most efficient way to run your models (Metal, CUDA, Vulkan,
              etc).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom models, prompts, and parameters</strong>: Load your
              own downloaded models and play with the settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Offline, local, free</strong>: Everything runs on your
              computers. The only network request Clippy makes is to check for
              updates (which you can disable).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This app is not affiliated, approved, or supported by Microsoft.
            This project isn&#39;t trying to be your best chat bot. I&#39;d like you to
            enjoy a weird mix of nostalgia for 1990s technology paired with one
            the most magical technologies we can run on our computers in 2025.
