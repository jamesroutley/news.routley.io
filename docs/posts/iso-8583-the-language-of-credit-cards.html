    <h1>ISO 8583: The language of credit cards</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79451.html">ISO 8583</a></p><!-- --><p>is the standard for real-time messages communicated between acquirers and issuers through all of the major card networks. Whenever you tap your card at a point of sale device or click “purchase” online, odds are it will eventually end up as an ISO 8583 message sent between the merchant’s acquiring processor, the card network, and your bank’s issuer processor. Early on, the point of sale device or the ATM might have built and sent the ISO 8583 message directly to the acquirer, but in today’s ecommerce environment messages typically pass from the merchant to a payment processor in higher-level formats, such as JSON, which then in turn are translated to the card network’s ISO 8583-based format. This approach simplifies the process by abstracting away the complexity of the ISO 8583 format from the rest of the payments ecosystem.</p><!-- -->  <!-- --><!-- -->  <!-- --><!-- --> <!-- -->  <!-- --></div><p>Basic format</p><p>ISO 8583 messages can only be transmitted and received by parties with a shared specification detailing exactly which fields are present and in what positions. ISO 8583 messages, similar to other storage-efficient formats and unlike a more verbose format like JSON, carries only values and no field names. A basic message contains a “message type indicator” describing what type of message is sent, a bitmap explaining which fields are present, and the fields themselves.</p><p>Message Type Indicator</p><div><p>The message type indicator is a four-digit code that informs the receiver of the type of message being sent, such as an authorization message or a reversal. This tells the recipient which fields to expect to be present and not present in the message. While the specification defines a standard set of values—e.g.,</p><!-- --> <p><code>0100</code> for an authorization request and</p><!-- --> <p><code>0110</code> for an authorization response—some networks deviate from these values and retain only the general concept. The way the indicator is serialized also varies between networks. Some networks use packed BCD to reduce its size to 2 bytes, while others use simpler formats like an ASCII or EBCDIC 4-byte value.</p></div><p>Bitmap</p><div><p>Most of the fields in an ISO 8583 message are optional, requiring the sender to convey which fields are present and which are missing. This is done with a bitmap, where each bit is set to 1 if the field is present and 0 if it is not. For example,</p><!-- --> <p><code>0110 1100</code> in the first byte of the bitmap communicate that field 2, 3, 5, and 6 are present. The first bit in the first byte is reserved for communicating whether a second 8-byte bitmap is included, required when more than 64 fields are present. Similar to the Message Type Indicator, how the bitmap itself is serialized varies from network to network: hex, binary, ASCII, or EBCDIC are all possible choices.</p></div><p>Data elements</p><div><p>Following the bitmap, the sender serializes each present field in sequential order. Fields can be either primitive, containing a single value such as a string or an integer, or complex, containing nested fields within them. The serialization of primitive fields typically involves a combination of the factors enumerated below.</p></div><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> <!-- -->or ASCII: Typically used for freeform text but sometimes preferred for all fields, regardless of content. Some networks support both EBCDIC and ASCII and translate between the formats according to their participants’ preferences. The major networks usually default to EBCDIC, as this was the encoding of choice for IBM mainframes when the networks were first built.</li><li>Packed<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">BCD</a>: Often used for integers, with each digit occupying 4 bits. This encoding aligns with the 0-9 subset of hexadecimal, making it space-efficient for numerical data.</li><li>Binary: Occasionally used for fixed length integers, encoded as 1 or 2 byte values in either low-endian or big-endian format, depending on the system’s requirements.</li></ul><p>Nested messages</p><div><p>While the standard defines core fields such as “transaction amount” and “merchant identifier,” the list of pre-defined fields in the</p><!-- --> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583#ISO-defined_data_elements_(ver_1987">original standard</a></p><!-- --><p>eventually became a limiting factor for card network feature development. To address this, the standard reserved certain “private use” fields that card networks could utilize to serialize custom data as needed. This is where the specifications really started to differ between networks, both in the data they chose to communicate but also in how each nested field was serialized. The original standard provided limited guidance on this topic, an oversight that later versions sought to address.</p></div><ul><li>Tables: Each field is usually of fixed length and is always included, either with its actual value or replaced by a default placeholder value if empty.</li><li>Nested bitmap messages: Only present fields are serialized, using a simplified, fixed-length version of the top-level bitmap to indicate field presence.</li><li>Tag Length Value (TLV) messages: Each field is serialized as a tuple containing the field number (&#34;tag&#34;), the length of the field, and the field value. This format is defined by a separate standard,<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81420.html">ISO 8825</a>, which outlines the encoding rules from<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1">ASN.1</a>.</li></ul><p>How common each nested message type is varies from network to network. You might see American Express heavily use tables, while only Visa and China UnionPay make use of nested bitmap messages. Mastercard primarily sticks to Tag Length Value messages, a direction in which most of the card networks are slowly moving towards for all their new sub-fields.</p><p>Tables</p><div><p>The original nested message element is both the simplest and the most complex. In its simplest form, each sub-field is serialized sequentially, with no fields omitted, always resulting in a fixed number of bytes. This works fine for basic tables with a low number of fields but resulted in space inefficiencies for tables with a larger number of optional fields by having to send unnecessary padding characters for fields that were rarely present. Attempts to tweak the format to better support this and other scenarios introduced significant complexity, where the implementors would have likely been better off with a completely different sub-message type altogether.</p><!-- --> </div><p>This concept is also used to nest sub-messages within sub-messages, as shown in the <i>Additional Amounts</i> field below, where we can serialize up to 6 additional amounts of 20 bytes each:</p><div><p>A similar extension happens when we want to support having one of the sub-fields take up a variable amount of space. Going back to our</p><!-- --> <p><i>Card Acceptor Name or Location</i> table, if we wanted to support a card acceptor name sub-field of up to 200 characters, the original approach would require all participants to pad the value with spaces up to the maximum length of 200 characters. This method, while functional, is inefficient for a standard that greatly values its frugal use of space.</p></div><p>Serialized, this would look like:</p><ul><li>Byte 1: <i>terminal type</i> for the first 4 bits,<!-- --> <i>terminal entry capability</i> for the last 4 bits</li><li>Byte 2: <i>chip condition code</i> for the first 4 bits,<!-- --> <i>special condition indicator</i> for the last 4</li><li>…and so on.</li></ul><p>Nested bitmap messages</p><div><p>Most of the complexity discussed earlier comes from trying to omit certain sub-fields without having to waste space on empty characters to communicate that a field has been omitted. A nested bitmap message solves this problem by including a bitmap before the elements, communicating to the recipient which fields are present and which are omitted. This is identical to how the top-level message itself is serialized, with the distinction that nested sub-level message bitmaps are generally shorter and of fixed length (e.g., 8 bytes to allow 64 bits/fields).</p></div><p>Tag-length value messages</p><div><p>Later versions of the ISO 8583 standard incorporated parts of a separate standard altogether,</p><!-- --> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81420.html">ISO 8825</a>, for use in nested sub-messages. This approach is so robust that it completely removes the need for other nested message types like tables and bitmap messages. In this format, each field is serialized as a tuple consisting of a tag, the length of the field, and the field value itself. Similar to the nested bitmap messages this lets the sender omit any missing fields as the recipient can rely on the tag component to identify which sub-field is being parsed.</p></div><div><p>The TLV format is, unlike the other two message formats we’ve looked at, unordered. While the tags are defined in a specific order in the specification, the sender can choose to serialize each tag-length-value tuple however they want without causing issues for the recipient. This would not work for the nested bitmap field, where the recipient reads the bitmap to see which fields (e.g., field 1, 3, and 5) are present and then expects the corresponding data to follow in that order. A tag-length-value parser, on the other hand, would read the tag first and use that to know which field is being parsed.</p></div><p>Framing</p><div><p>ISO 8583 messages are generally sent over long-lived TCP sockets, as described in</p><!-- --> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://vinayak.io/articles/visa-redundancy">&#34;Visa: half a century of high availability&#34;</a>. As such, there needs to be a layer of framing around the messages so that the recipient knows where one ISO 8583 message ends and another begins in a stream of TCP packets. This is usually done with a simple length indicator, preceding the ISO 8583 message with a 4-byte indicator that informs the recipient of how many bytes they should read for the ISO 8583 message itself.</p></div><p>Network-specific header</p><p>Some of the card networks, such as Visa, also include a header between the framing Message Length Header and the ISO 8583 message itself. This generally consists of meta information about the message itself, such as where it was sent from and where it is to be delivered, and whether the network rejected it with any errors.</p><p>Building parsers</p><div><p>Parsing a basic ISO 8583 message is straight forward and generally only requires the implementation of a bitmap parser and a length definition for each field to be able to handle the primitive elements at the top level. A lot of the complexity comes from correctly handling the various types of nested sub-messages and the subtle differences between each card network’s implementation. A useful technique for tackling this complexity is to define the core building blocks needed to declaratively compose a message, as opposed to imperatively implementing each of the different field types on their own.</p><!-- -->  <!-- --><!-- --> </div><div><div><div><pre><p><span>class</span> <span>Message</span> &lt; T::<span>Struct</span>

This type of future-proofing is generally only required for tag-length-value messages, but gracefully handling local errors in sub-messages is a useful concept to apply to the rest of the parser as well. While the card networks do validate the overall format of the message, there is lots of room for subtle errors that do not result in rejections at the network level.</p><!-- --> </div><div><p>An important nuance to keep in mind here is that we still need to ensure that we serialize the table back to a reasonable value (often called round-tripping), especially if it’s a table the sender expects to receive mirrored back in the response. Simply omitting the value you failed to parse altogether would result in a shorter overall length for the table, and so you&#39;ll need to either replace the unknown value with a placeholder—such as a space or a zero, depending on the content—or keep hold of the raw value you were unable to parse to put it back in the message afterwards.</p></div><p>Finally, at the very top level there are errors that we just can’t recover from. If we fail to parse the length indicator for one of the top-level fields we’ll have no way to parse the rest of the message and it is likely critical enough that we shouldn’t attempt to use what we have so far.
