Specifically, the amendment could require all VPN services, messaging apps, and social networks to identify and retain user data – an obligation that is now limited to mobile networks and internet service providers.</p><p>The firm behind one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">best VPN</a> and encrypted email services, Proton, is ready to fight back on behalf of the privacy of its over 100 million users. Other Swiss-based companies, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/nymvpn" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/nymvpn">NymVPN</a>, are also doing the same.</p><h2 id="no-choice-but-to-leave-3">No choice but to leave</h2><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/2025/article/proton-menace-de-quitter-la-suisse-face-aux-nouvelles-regles-de-surveillance-28883036.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/2025/article/proton-menace-de-quitter-la-suisse-face-aux-nouvelles-regles-de-surveillance-28883036.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">interview with RTS</a> (Radio Télévision Suisse) on May 13, 2025, Proton CEO Andy Yen slammed the proposed amendment as a &#34;major violation of the right to privacy&#34; that will also harm the country&#39;s reputation and its ability to compete on an international level.</p><p>&#34;This revision attempts to implement something that has been deemed illegal in the EU and the United States. The only country in Europe with a roughly equivalent law is Russia,&#34; said Yen.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.news.admin.ch/fr/nsb?id=103968" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.news.admin.ch/fr/nsb?id=103968" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">The amendment</a> aims to expand the number of service providers targeted to include so-called &#34;derived service providers&#34;. Crucially, the new provisions will introduce three new types of information and two types of monitoring.</p><p>If the changes pass, Proton will be forced to modify how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/protonmail-secure-email" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/protonmail-secure-email">Proton Mail</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/protonvpn" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/protonvpn">Proton VPN</a> handle encryption, alongside its strict no-log policies – something the company isn&#39;t willing to do.</p><p>&#34;I think we would have no choice but to leave Switzerland,&#34; said Yen. &#34;The law would become almost identical to the one in force today in Russia. It&#39;s an untenable situation. We would be less confidential as a company in Switzerland than Google, based in the United States. So it&#39;s impossible for our business model.&#34;</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In Switzerland, the new version of the surveillance law aims to make it impossible for Proton, Threema and@nymproject to operate from Switzerland.
