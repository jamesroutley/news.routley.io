We have enjoyed serving you the amazing food that Australia is known for, working with thousands of brilliant restaurants and riders.&#34;</p><p>The company said customers could no longer place orders on Deliveroo in Australia, however accounts would remain open for the next six months to allow customers to download their information.</p><p>Deliveroo, which had operated in Australia since 2015, blamed &#34;challenging economic conditions, which requires us to take difficult decisions&#34;.</p><p>Despite starting in the market ahead of Uber Eats, it fell substantially behind its rival.</p><p>Competitors Menulog and DoorDash also overtook Deliveroo, pushing it into an unsustainable fourth place in an already-crowded market.</p><p>&#34;In Australia, we have concluded that achieving a sustainable position of leadership in the market is not possible without a disproportionate level of investment which would have highly uncertain returns,&#34; the company concluded.</p><p>Deliveroo got out of the German market in 2019, and already this year has quit The Netherlands and Spain.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Administrators take control</h2><figure role="group" data-print="inline-media" aria-labelledby="101662338" data-component="Figure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/101662338"><div><p><img alt="A food delivery driver wearing a black helmet and a teal jacket stands in front of a fast food outlet window." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cfdfaf63719b37a1c63c0b9743d4d00f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=1073&amp;cropW=1616&amp;xPos=4&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div><figcaption id="101662338" data-component="Figure__figcaption"> <!-- -->Food delivery enjoyed a surge in popularity during the pandemic with people locked down at home or worried about eating out.<cite data-component="Figure__cite">(<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text"><span>Supplied: @Abuzar/Instagram</span></span></span>)</cite></figcaption></figure><p>The Australian arm of the company had more than 12,000 partner restaurants, employed approximately 120 staff and recently expanded into grocery and liquor delivery.</p><p>Firm KordaMentha has been appointed as the voluntary administrator. Creditors have been told to visit the <a href="https://kordamentha.com/creditors" data-component="Link">administrator&#39;s website</a> for more information.</p><p>But administrator Mark Korda said Deliveroo was &#34;unable to achieve sufficient market share in Australia to develop a sustainable business&#34;.</p><p>With the London Stock Exchange-listed UK parent company deciding to wind up Deliveroo Australia, administrators said they had &#34;no alternative but to cease operations immediately in the absence of financial support&#34;.</p><p>&#34;Our priority is to execute an orderly wind-down of the Australian operations to achieve the best outcome for all stakeholders.&#34;</p><p>The decision to cease trading immediately means all of the company&#39;s employed staff in Australia had their employment terminated today, with the administrator working to calculate and secure their outstanding pay and entitlements.</p><p>The administrator said delivery riders were considered contractors, not employees, of the company and would be treated as unsecured creditors.</p><p>That means that any delivery riders owed money by Deliveroo will need to submit a proof of debt form to the administrator to make a claim, but will not be guaranteed to receive what they are owed in full.</p><p>The administrator said riders could keep their company-supplied kit.</p><p>Transport Workers&#39; Union national secretary Michael Kaine said the union had sought &#34;urgent consultation&#34; with the administrator to understand what &#34;entitlements might be clawed back for food delivery riders who stand to lose their jobs&#34;.</p><p>&#34;This will be a shock to the thousands of food delivery riders who rely on Deliveroo for income,&#34; he said.</p><p>Mr Kaine said it highlighted the &#34;urgent need&#34; for the federal government to enact reform for gig workers.</p><p>&#34;It is clear that urgent regulation is necessary to stabilise this industry and ensure workers are treated fairly, can work safely, and have secure jobs,&#34; he said.</p><p>Restaurants owed money by Deliveroo are also unsecured creditors and will need to lodge a proof of debt form. They are being asked to contact the administrator if they possess any Deliveroo-supplied IT equipment to arrange its return.</p><p>Information for creditors, such as riders and restaurants, can be found on <a href="file:///C:/Users/jandam8m/Downloads/Riders-restaurants-and-contractors-FAQ-Deliveroo.pdf" data-component="Link">KordaMentha&#39;s website</a>.</p><p>The first creditors meeting for Deliveroo Australia will be held on Monday, November 28, 2022.</p><p>The future of Deliveroo Australia will then be decided at the second meeting of creditors, which the administrators say is likely to be held in mid-to-late December.</p><p>Food delivery companies are suffering due to competition and the threat of workers getting more rights, making labour costs more expensive.</p><p>One of the Labor Party&#39;s promises during its recent election win was to expand the security of work and boost workers&#39; conditions.</p></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2022-11-16T05:51:28.000Z">3h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2022-11-16T05:51:28.000Z">3 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 16 Nov 2022 at 5:51am</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2022-11-16T07:20:11.000Z">1h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2022-11-16T07:20:11.000Z">1 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 16 Nov 2022 at 7:20am</time></p></div>
