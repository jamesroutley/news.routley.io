    <h1>What we can deduce from a leaked PDF</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc-inner"><p>In 1979, Bob Wood­ward and Scott Armstrong published <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/the-brethren.html"><i>The Brethren</i></a>, a chron­icle of the Supreme Court during the tumul­tuous and conse­quen­tial terms from 1969 to 1975. Including, of course, the delib­er­a­tions around <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/the-brethren.html">I’ve recom­mended</a> the book before—it’s my favorite work of legal <span>jour­nalism.</span></p><p>At the time, <i>The Brethren</i> was contro­ver­sial. Despite the Supreme Court’s long­standing policy of secrecy around internal delib­er­a­tions, it was apparent that sources within the court had spoken to Wood­ward and Armstrong off the record. After the death of Justice Potter Stewart in 1985, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CecDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Justice+Potter+Stewart%22+%22key+source%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F8bny1j84Z&amp;sig=ACfU3U0CIueu58LOpJ3uPWtp46ifQ5qK0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCi4zMmMX3AhXODkQIHdR1Bf0Q6AF6BAgXEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Justice%20Potter%20Stewart%22%20%22key%20source%22&amp;f=false">Wood­ward confirmed</a> that Stewart had been one of his key <span>sources.</span></p><p>Thus, the bad news for those who contend that the recent leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/us/politics/supreme-court-leak-roe-v-wade-abortion.html">“unthink­able”</a> or, in the words of Chief Justice Roberts, a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_05-03-22">“singular and egre­gious breach”</a>—the horse is long out of the barn. Indeed, with so many more ways to securely leak infor­ma­tion these days, the only surprise in recent years is that there haven’t been <span>more.</span></p><p>Much as I enjoy Wood­ward’s writing, his sources are not neces­sarily well concealed. One just needs to ask: “which person in this story takes the fewest hits?” For instance, in Wood­ward’s earlier book about the Trump admin­is­tra­tion, <i>Fear</i>, this line of thinking <a href="https://www.axios.com/gary-cohn-statement-bob-woodward-book-donald-trump-d04d866b-1005-4f91-8791-f8008114ab06.html ">led inex­orably</a> to former White House economic adviser Gary <span>Cohn.</span></p><p>Cohn publicly ques­tioned the accu­racy of the book. Tellingly, he didn’t specify any partic­ular fact it had gotten wrong. In general, when sources deny jour­nal­istic reporting, I trust the jour­nal­ists, because there are still <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/16/media/fox-news-court-dominion/index.html">serious legal conse­quences</a> for news orga­ni­za­tions that publish false­hoods; mean­while, no conse­quences at all for sources who issue blanket <span>denials.</span></p><p>(This dynamic isn’t limited to polit­ical reporting. In 2018, Bloomberg Busi­ness­week published a story called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">“The Big Hack”</a> that was vigor­ously denied by Apple and Amazon. Based on these denials, certain tech blog­gers <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/10/19/apple-demands-retraction-bloombergs-big-chip-infiltration-story-bloomberg-has-some-explaining-to-do/">became convinced</a> that the story was false. The fact that neither Apple nor Amazon sued Bloomberg for defama­tion—despite being extremely rich, finicky, and liti­gious—made nary a <span>dent.)</span></p><p>To be fair, this exchange of favors is not unique to Wood­ward. Rather, it’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/08/archives/the-news-leak-a-washington-necessity-a-master-of-the-art-seldom.html">long­standing feature</a>—or bug, some might say—of Wash­ington polit­ical jour­nalism. Much of the oper­a­tion of govern­ment is committed to the public record. But much more is not. Thus, leaks become currency, traded constantly. Without them, there would be <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-scotus-leak-is-good-actually.html">no national polit­ical news</a>.</p><p>So when you hear the cater­wauling—“egad, the leakers!“—assume it refers to the leaks that the cater­wauler finds unflat­tering. Although disclosing actual <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798">clas­si­fied infor­ma­tion</a> is a crime, much infor­ma­tion about the govern­ment doesn’t fall into that cate­gory. In partic­ular, it doesn’t appear that leaking a draft Supreme Court opinion breaks any law. So the hot-blooded idea that the leaker <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/03/the-supreme-courts-integrity-demands-its-leaker-be-prosecuted/">should be “pros­e­cuted”</a> is <span>misplaced.</span></p><p>Not every leak is published, however. Over time, one of the reci­p­rocal favors that Wash­ington jour­nal­ists have offered is to plug certain leaks rather than publi­cize them. For instance, during his first 10 years on the Supreme Court—including the time depicted in <i>The Brethren</i>—Justice William Rehn­quist became <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2005/09/chief-justice-rehnquist-s-drug-habit.html">addicted to Placidyl</a>, a powerful seda­tive. Never­the­less, this fact was not mentioned in Wood­ward’s book, nor much other jour­nalism of the time. As best I can tell, the Wash­ington Post didn’t explic­itly connect Rehn­quist to Placidyl <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/01/13/ban-or-limit-to-be-sought-on-sleeping-pill/07636409-c5be-41d8-9a0c-40344487c469/">until after</a> he had completed a detox program in <span>1981.</span></p><p>Bringing us to this week’s leak by Politico of a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504">draft Supreme Court opinion</a> in the case of <i>Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Orga­ni­za­tion</i>. I don’t usually comment on current events. But the possi­bil­i­ties for typo­graphic foren­sics were too intriguing to <span>ignore.</span></p><p>Consis­tent with the Wash­ington jour­nal­istic prin­ciple of leaks-for-favors, I infer that whoever leaked this draft must foresee a benefit from the leak—as usual, <i>cui <span>bono?</span></i></p><p>There­fore, I don’t think the source is someone who works at the Supreme Court, like a justice or a clerk. Justices under­stand that they don’t always end up in the majority. Clerks rely on these jobs as a calling card for the rest of their careers. To be exposed as a leaker would amount to setting that future career on fire. It’s not worth the <span>risk.</span></p><p>Though I’m not going to delve into the substance of this draft opinion, I believe it’s much more likely that the leaker is someone who supports the opinion rather than an <span>oppo­nent—</span></p><ul><li><p>The opinion is marked “1st draft” and dated February 10. In the inter­vening months, there are only three options: either a) the majority bloc in favor of the opinion has held together, or b) it has drifted apart, or c) there never was a <span>majority.</span></p></li><li><p>If (a) is true—the majority bloc has held—there’s no reason for a supporter or an oppo­nent to leak an old draft now. The final opinion is likely to be released within six weeks. Leaking this docu­ment changes <span>nothing.</span></p></li><li><p>But if (b) is true—the majority bloc has expe­ri­enced defec­tions or eroded subse­quent drafts of the opinion—it’s a different <span>story.</span></p><p>In that case, an oppo­nent of the opinion has no reason to leak it, because to them, the tides are already shifting in the right <span>direc­tion.</span></p><p>But a supporter of the opinion would have an incen­tive to leak an earlier opinion and thereby pres­sure the defec­tors back toward the first draft. (Again: this reasoning has nothing to do with the substance of the opinion. It is just the most likely tactical <span>logic.)</span></p></li><li><p>Option (c)—there never was a majority—may seem curious, since most of the press coverage so far has assumed other­wise. The docu­ment claims to be the “opinion of the Court”, right? True, but it’s a <b>first draft</b>. For all we know, the justices who initially expected to be in the majority saw this draft and declined to adopt <span>it.</span></p><p>In this case, however, the tactical outcome would be the same as case (b)—the leak would benefit whoever wants to restore a coali­tion around this version of the <span>opinion.</span></p></li></ul><p>So what can we tell from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504">the docu­ment itself</a>?</p><p>For thor­ough­ness, I ran the PDF through some meta­data checkers to see if there were any inter­esting tidbits left behind. There weren’t. Though I didn’t expect to find any, based on the appear­ance of the <span>docu­ment.</span></p><p>How was it created? Let’s go in <span>steps:</span></p><ol><li><p>An orig­inal color PDF was created on a computer using the US Supreme Court’s usual type­set­ting soft­ware. (I’m not sure what this is. I’m pretty sure it’s not a vanilla word processor like Microsoft Word. I’ve seen theo­ries online that it’s either <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">La­TeX</a> or some myste­rious propri­etary type­setter called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/1galio/comment/caie3mv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“Acomp.exe”</a>. Maybe a FOIA request is called for. But it doesn’t matter <span>today.)</span></p></li><li><p>It seems that the PDF was created on a modern computer and not with a different device because of the use of <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/arial-alternatives.html">Arial</a> in the upper right corner of the first <span>page.</span></p><p><img src="https://matthewbutterick.com/img/leak-arial.gif"/></p></li><li><p>It seems that the PDF was created in color because the yellow high­light around “1st Draft” is a rectangle that perfectly fits the text. Thus, the box must’ve been present in the digital file, and not, say, drawn by hand with a high­lighting <span>pen.</span></p><p><img src="https://matthewbutterick.com/img/leak-color.gif"/></p></li><li><p>It seems the PDF was printed and stapled because of the pres­ence of staple holes on the top left corner of each page. The opinion is 98 pages, so that must’ve been a pretty big <span>staple.</span></p><p><img src="https://matthewbutterick.com/img/leak-staple.gif"/></p></li><li><p>It seems that the printed PDF was unsta­pled and then rescanned. Why? The reso­lu­tion of the page itself is very coarse and uneven, which is a kind of typo­graphic degra­da­tion char­ac­ter­istic of sheet scan­ners. Further­more, the pages have been scanned at different angles, which indi­cates the use of a low-volume home-office device. A typical office scanner would have an auto­mated sheet feeder that would keep the sheets in a more uniform vertical <span>orien­ta­tion.</span></p><p><img src="https://matthewbutterick.com/img/leak-scan.gif"/></p></li><li><p>The text of the PDF is search­able because OCR was run on the PDF after it was created. Perhaps by the leaker, but more likely by the recip­ient, <span>Politico.</span></p></li></ol><p>It’s possible that Politico received the printed docu­ment and made their own scan. If that were the case, however, I’d expect them to have better quality scan­ning equip­ment and produce a nicer <span>PDF.</span></p><p>But Politico has a strong incen­tive to protect their source. By making their own scan from a paper orig­inal, they wouldn’t open them­selves up to the disclo­sures of confi­den­tial infor­ma­tion that have <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/judicial/publications/judges_journal/2019/spring/embarrassing-redaction-failures/">tripped up others</a>. (That said, printed docu­ments are not neces­sarily free of meta­data, as Reality Winner found out <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/06/06/reality-winner-was-outed-by-in.html">the hard way</a>.)</p><p>Is it possible the docu­ment was scanned twice—once by the leaker, once by the publisher? I don’t think so. If it had been, I’d expect to see more pecu­liar pixel-level arti­facts and <span>distor­tions.</span></p><p>So what does the state of the PDF tell us about the iden­tity of the <span>leaker?</span></p><ul><li><p>I conclude it must be someone who only had access to a stapled, printed copy of the draft opinion. (If the person had access to the under­lying digital file, they wouldn’t have printed &amp; stapled it just to unstaple <span>it.)</span></p></li><li><p>As explained above, I don’t think the leaker was an oppo­nent of the opinion, because there would be no tactical value in doing so. More­over, if the objec­tive of the leak was indeed to recon­sol­i­date support, then the leak didn’t come from someone whose support is <span>wobbling.</span></p></li><li><p>Further­more, notice also that the docu­ment is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504">completely unmarked</a>, so whoever owned this copy didn’t find anything to disagree <span>with.</span></p></li><li><p>In sum—I’d suppose it’s a friend, spouse, or family member of a Supreme Court justice who has consis­tently opposed <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, acting with some­thing between autonomy and plau­sible <span>deni­a­bility.</span></p></li></ul><p>Of course, I’m prob­ably wrong. Best of luck to Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_05-03-22">on his inves­ti­ga­tion</a>.</p><p>PS—<i>should</i> court delib­er­a­tions be confi­den­tial? Or should justices be required to post drafts of opin­ions to the judi­cial equiv­a­lent of <a href="https://www.afj.org/article/five-takeaways-from-the-dobbs-v-jackson-oral-arguments/">Git­Hub</a>?</p><p>On the one hand, we can see the virtue of a certain kind of delib­er­a­tive veil for written opin­ions: it allows the members of the Court to freely explore ideas and alter­na­tives, some of which may be strange or unrea­son­able, on the way to a final <span>result.</span></p><p>On the other hand, oral argu­ments are out in the open. Partly because we the public are inter­ested in how the Supreme Court justices are framing the issues, and where they detect strengths and weak­nesses in the parties’ <span>argu­ments.</span></p><p>Oral argu­ments happen in real time, however. The justices’ ques­tions are under­stood to be a tool for sharp­ening the presen­ta­tion, not for revealing their own posi­tions (though <a href="https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/at-oral-arguments-in-dobbs-viability-falters-and-puts-roe-itself-in-jeopardy">infer­ences</a> are <a href="https://www.afj.org/article/five-takeaways-from-the-dobbs-v-jackson-oral-arguments/">made</a> <span>anyhow).</span></p><p>Majority opin­ions, by contrast, repre­sent the offi­cial output of the Court, and thus neces­sarily should evolve more slowly. The delib­er­a­tive veil is a wise policy specif­i­cally because it promotes open-mind­ed­ness and flex­i­bility among the justices while allowing for a high stan­dard of output. (Most famously: the case where Chief Justice Roberts wrote <a href="https://www.salon.com/2012/07/03/roberts_wrote_both_obamacare_opinions/">both the majority and minority</a> opin­ions.) Justices who had to put every draft in a public loca­tion would become more <span>cautious.</span></p><p>Finally, as a typog­ra­pher, I think the Supreme Court’s apparent habit of type­set­ting draft opin­ions as if they were final is bad policy. I’ve cited the Supreme Court’s typog­raphy as <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/court-opinions.html">the best</a> in the country. I still think so. But part of the reason the Supreme Court’s typog­raphy works so well is because it visu­ally connects an opinion to a centuries-long tradi­tion of delib­er­a­tive thought. When that typog­raphy is applied to a draft opinion, it gives the ideas therein a grav­itas and authority they haven’t yet earned. Perhaps the people within the Supreme Court aren’t affected by such suppos­edly cosmetic consid­er­a­tions. But I’m certain that if this leaked PDF didn’t <i>look</i> like a finished Supreme Court opinion—say, <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/research-memo-before.pdf">more like this</a>—the public recep­tion would’ve been quite <span>different.</span></p></div></div>
