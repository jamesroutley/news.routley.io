    <h1>Voice.ai: GPL Violations with a Side of DRM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Since the release of Eleven Labs’s Prime Voice AI platform, AI-based voice synthesis and modification
has seen a revival in popularity. Browsing online forums, I stumbled upon <strong><a href="https://voice.ai">Voice.AI</a></strong>,
which bills itself as a “Real-Time AI Voice Changer” software program and community platform. Since the
program seemed to run offline (more on that later), I was more interested in it than Eleven Labs’s
offering. I figured it would be possible to pipe the output of a regular TTS like espeak into Voice.ai in
order to obtain better results.</p>
<p>As a curious software developer and privacy-conscious person, after installing version 0.1.25.0 (I later
updated to 0.1.25.1, which is the latest version as of my writing this post on February 4, 2023), I
naturally dug into the program files to see exactly what was installed and how it worked.</p>
<h2 id="gpl-violation-saga">GPL Violation Saga</h2>
<p>After running <code>strings</code> on the files in the <code>\Program Files\Voice.ai</code> directory, I discovered some of
the third-party components they were using: <strong><a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat">Praat</a> and <a href="https://gnupg.org/software/libgcrypt/index.html">libgcrypt</a></strong>. These were statically linked into the VoiceAILib.dll
library.</p>

</code></pre><p>This is concerning, since Praat is licensed under the <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/License.html">GPLv3</a>
and libgcrypt is licensed under the <a href="https://gnupg.org/software/libgcrypt/index.html">LGPLv2.1</a>. These licenses
are not included with the software at all; in fact, Voice.ai’s <a href="https://archive.is/p19nI">Terms of Service</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
has sections which explicitly violate these licenses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We retain all right, title and ownership to the Beta product. You agree the Beta Product is for personal use only.
You may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or in any way encumber or convey the Beta product or any portion or component
thereof to any third party or use it in any manner to produce, market or support your own products. You <strong>shall not</strong> copy,
sell or market Beta product to any third party; or <strong>modify, reuse, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise
translate the beta product or any portion thereof</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the GPLv3 states plainly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you convey a covered work, <strong>you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures</strong> to the
extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and
you <strong>disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work</strong> as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to confirm that these strings were in fact evidence of copied GPL code, I fired up the Ghidra reverse
engineering tool and searched for references to these strings. After decompiling VoiceAILib.dll, I found many
functions that matched code from the Praat GitHub repository.</p>

<h3 id="reaching-out-for-an-explanation">Reaching Out for an Explanation</h3>
<p>In order to figure out the best contact method to discuss the license issues, I joined the Voice.ai Discord
and asked a simple question:</p>
<p><img src="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/discord_first_message.png" alt="Good morning/afternoon/evening. I have some licensing questions for the developers with regard to thevoice.ai software. With whom should I speak?"/></p>
<p>I was then told I could either email <a href="mailto:support@voice.ai">support@voice.ai</a> or direct message Heath, the founder of the company.
I opted to send an email, since that was the more “formal” communication method.</p>
<p>On February 2, 2023, I sent an email to <a href="mailto:support@voice.ai">support@voice.ai</a> requesting source code. Originally I had
only identified libgcrypt, and so I cited relevant sections of the LGPLv2.1 in my message. The full text of
my message can be found <a href="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/first_email.txt">here</a>, but here are the most important parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the developers of Voice.ai:</p>
<p>I have recently downloaded and installed the Voice.ai Software on my PC. I have also discovered that the
Voice.ai software includes a software component licensed under the Lesser GNU General Public License
version 2.1 (LGPL v2.1) - more specifically, libgcrypt within VoiceAILib.dll.</p>
<p>In accordance with the LGPL v2.1, I am requesting a copy of the libgcrypt source code plus the source code
of VoiceAILib.dll and of any other components, tools, and/or scripts necessary to reproduce a working
executable with my own version of libgcrypt. Your requirement to fulfill this request is explained in
Section 6 of the LGPL v2.1 text</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After later identifying the presence of the GPLv3-licensed Praat code, I sent a more succint <a href="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/second_email.txt">follow-up
email</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have also discovered that VoiceAILib.dll also includes Praat, which is strictly licensed under the GNU
General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). As a result, I am requesting the full Voice.ai client software
source code, which you must release in order to comply with the GPLv3 license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of February 6, 2023 at 11 AM, I have not received a response to my emails.</p>
<h3 id="lashing-out-in-return">Lashing Out in Return?</h3>
<p><strong>February 6, 2023 update:</strong> The actual reason I was banned was for “ToS violations” in regard to discussing
DRM evasion. Regardless, those provisions are not practically enforceable due to the GPL code and the license’s
requirement to allow DRM circumvention.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, on February 4, I suddenly found myself banned from the Voice.ai Discord server.</p>
<p><img src="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/discord_banned.png" alt="Banned"/></p>
<p><img src="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/discord_invite_window.png" alt="Invite link"/></p>
<p>I received no warning from any moderator or developer, and I had sent fewer than ten messages during my time
in the server; therefore, I have no reason to believe I broke any legitimate rule.</p>
<h2 id="invasive-drm-alert">Invasive DRM Alert</h2>
<p>Voice.ai developers are utterly insistent that their software <a href="https://voice.ai/hub/is-safe/">is</a>
<a href="https://support.voice.ai/hc/en-us/articles/8296309878173-Are-you-having-issues-with-your-Antivirus-">not</a>
<a href="https://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/discord_not_malware.png">malware</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/z01tg5/is_voiceai_safe/">at</a>
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/software/comments/yy9v9t/is_voiceai_safe/">all</a>, but the widespread warnings
from antivirus software do raise some questions.
Now, Voice.ai certainly is not a cryptominer, and modern antiviruses are overly paranoid and annoying, but
Voice.ai does collect a concerning amount of data from the systems it runs on.</p>
<p>The Voice.ai software is heavily obfuscated, and the main components of interest are the aforementioned
VoiceAILib.dll and the main VoiceAI.exe executable, a C/C++ DLL and .NET assembly respectively. VoiceAI.exe
collects at least the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motherboard and CPU info</li>
<li>Audio interfaces</li>
<li>OS version</li>
<li>Enabled network interfaces, along with IP address and MAC address</li>
<li>Computer hostname</li>
<li>Voice.ai install path</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of this information has obvious legitimate uses for debugging or otherwise (audio interfaces, OS
version, install path), other information such as the computer hostname and network interface metadata is
completely irrelevant to Voice.ai’s primary function. This information is sent to the Voice.ai servers and
used to derive an encryption key to encrypt and decrypt later communications with the API. Note that all
communications with the API happen over HTTPS and are already secured, so this only serves as obfuscation
to dissuade reverse engineering.</p>
<p>Other users have reported in the official Discord server that the software also contains virtual machine
detection routines. It’s no wonder that antivirus software often detects it as malware: no other class of
software is this heavily obfuscated, gathers this much information, attempts to avoid being executed in
a virtual machine, and sends what it gathers to a central server. While this isn’t to say that Voice.ai
is the next Zeus trojan, it is very understandable why it seems to be a victim of antivirus false positives.</p>
<p>Because of this “DRM spyware,” it is not possible to run the Voice.ai software offline, even though it is
clearly technically possible to do so, since it requires a local GPU for live AI processing.</p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Voice.ai developers claim that such obfuscation is necessary in order to protect their proprietary secrets
(which, by the way, are not allowed to be secrets due to the included GPL code); however, anyone should be
wary of feeding their text and voice recordings to a “blacker than black” box program.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="to-the-reader">To The Reader</h3>
<p>I personally recommend <a href="https://cdn.voice.ai/installer/Voice.ai-Installer-0.1.25.exe">downloading</a>
a copy of the Voice.ai software and contacting the developers to request source code. Showing community
intolerance for GPL violations is one of the best strategies for combatting them. If you intend to actually
run and use the software, you should launch it in a sandbox to protect your privacy.</p>
<h3 id="to-the-voiceai-developers">To The Voice.ai Developers</h3>
<p>I implore you to release the code to your software under the GPLv3 as the license requires in order to avoid
future trouble. It is <em>not</em> too late to do so, and the community will thank you. I also implore you to better
respect your users’ privacy, even if that is at the expense of protecting “proprietary secrets.”</p>
