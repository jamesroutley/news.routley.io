            <p>Recently, my father and I took a trip out to a local provincial park for a weekend of camping.</p>
<p>Last time I had been camping happened to coincide with the period of time that I was starting to gain curiosity about amateur radio. I vividly recall being out there wishing I had a radio that I could use to communicate from the campsite.</p>
<p>So, to appease my past self, the present-tense radio-license-having version of me took my HF rig along to make some contacts.</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-step-back">Taking a step back</h2>
<p>A glaring problem in this plan was that I didn&#39;t actually have an antenna to bring. So a week in advance, I set out to build one for the trip.</p>
<p>I opted to build a duplicate of my current fixed-in-place at-home antenna, a slightly more sketchy variant of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wb3gck.com/tag/speaker-wire-antennas/">WB3GCK&#39;s speaker wire end-fed half-wave</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/spkr-wire-efhw-lengths.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m not very good at following other people&#39;s antenna instructions. I like to tinker with the specifics.</p>
<p>WB3GCK&#39;s design was <em>probably</em> intended to produce two distinct antennas out of a single 50ft spool of speaker wire, but I prefer to use the whole thing as a single unbalanced dipole. The more I think about it, the more the math regarding that 34ft segment breaks down, so I choose not to think about it too much.</p>
<p>Having already built one of these antennas before, I just set out to the local Canadian Tire to buy the same components again and repeat my last antenna build.</p>
<p>...slight problem, they didn&#39;t have speaker wire.</p>
<p>So I began searching for <em>literally anything conductive</em>, and came across a pile of spools of 24-ft &#34;lamp wire&#34;.</p>
<p>Lamp wire looks like speaker wire, so I figured its probably fine. Although the <strong>24ft</strong> part was a bit more of a problem. You generally don&#39;t want to build your antennas <em>too short</em>, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è thats what antenna tuners are for I guess.</p>
<p>Armed with a surprisingly large amount of wire, I began the process of splicing and measuring.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240713_194740810.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Everyone in my immediate life has spent the past two weeks listening to me say &#34;100 feet is <em>a lot</em> of wire!&#34;, so this is now your opportunity to hear it too.</p>
<p>I also decided to hack up the wire packaging and use a little paracord to make insulators for the tips of the antenna.</p>

<h2 id="preflight-checks">Preflight checks</h2>
<p>The next day, I took some time to pack up all my radio gear and give the antenna a test run.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240714_151953924.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>My original intent was to head to a nearby trail and find some trees to set up in.</p>

<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240714_153706887.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>But I wasn&#39;t super satisfied with the area, so I instead did what any sane radio operator would do.</p>
<p>I headed across the street, and set up in a grocery store parking lot.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240714_162523877.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Feeling rather <em>in the open</em>, I sat down, watched out for people, and spun up <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/iftx/id6446093115">iFTx</a> to see what kind of reach I could get with my new antenna.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/Screenshot_20240714-124916.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>For two watts into an incorrectly sized and badly tuned antenna laying on the ground, I was very happy with these results.</p>
<h2 id="camping-time">Camping time</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few days, and I find myself surrounded by trees with a hundred feet of wire in my hand.</p>
<p>I had learned from my earlier trial run that its a good idea to keep some rope with me so I can actually attach my antenna to trees instead of just using hope and friction to keep my little paracord loops attached to twiggy branches.</p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240719_200332311.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="https://ewpratten.com/images/posts/camping-radio/PXL_20240719_201852022.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>I ended up effectively wrapping the campsite in wire. One end was tied to a tree using some rope, and the other end was tent-pegged into the ground so I could adjust the tension as my brand new wire inevitably stretched over the weekend.</p>
<p>In terms of operation, this setup was <em>awesome</em>. The worst noise I had to deal with was barely pushing an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_meter">S2</a>, and I was able to make far more (and better) contacts than I had expected.</p>
<p>I had originally intended to spend this trip operating <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FT8">FT8</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave">CW</a>, but for some reason I found myself really enjoying <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/FT4_Protocol.pdf">FT4</a> (a mode I had never used before), so I spent most of my day camped out on 14080<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_per_second">Kc</a>, and then shifted to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WARC_bands">10136</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-meter_band">7074</a> in the evening.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p>So? How&#39;d I do?</p>
<p>Since I happened to be where the cell service wasn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t have access to PSKReporter to keep an eye on my signal reports. So those had to wait.</p>
<p>In terms of contacts, I made a bunch. All over the bands (although mainly 20m), and I even set my new distance record! (North-Western Europe from Ontario Canada)</p>
<p>Once I finally caught enough of a glimpse of a network connection, I was blown away by the signal reports. By far the best I&#39;ve ever received!</p>
