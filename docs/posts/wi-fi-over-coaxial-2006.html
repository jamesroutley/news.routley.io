    <h1>Wi-Fi over Coaxial (2006)</h1>

<p>When I first moved in to my house, I decided to run CAT5 everywhere that I thought I might need network access.  It
was a big job that involved opening-up the walls and ceilings, and I was glad when I finally got it all done.  Now, after
putting together a streaming video server and a server-based DVR, I realize that there are some areas in the house that I
missed - the areas behind televisions in the family roon, game room, and the master bedroom.</p>
<p>Rather than start opening-up the walls again, and not wanting to go wireless (too many access points in my
neighbourhood), I decided to try and use the existing CATV cabling and some el-cheapo WAPs for Ethernet access.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of low-cost routers last year at Best Buy during the Boxing Day sale.  They have just been sitting
around waiting for a project, so I opened-up a couple of them and replaced the external antenna with a female type-F connector</p>

<p>The only difficulty I had was with handling the cable that goes from the antenna to the circuit board.  The 
conductive surface on the board is very thin, and I ended-up lifting the conductive material off the board when I pulled too
hard on the cable.  I was extra careful when working on the second access point, but I still ended-up lifting that one as well.</p>

<p>CATV signals are fall between 50MHz to 850MHz, and 802.11g is around 2400MHz.  I bought some diplexers designed for working with off-air televison signals
and satellite LNB outputs and used them to combine/split the cable TV and the WiFi signals.  I also upgraded the splitter used to distribute the
cable TV signals though the house from the 50-850MHz unit that Shaw installed to a 5-2400MHz one to try and minimized the losses at 2400MHz.</p>

<p>The cable modem has it own filter and pad (not shown in photos).  I put Ethernet switches on both the LAN and WAN networks so that I wouldn&#39;t
need to break the network connections for troubleshooting.  The UPS keeps everything going in case I blow the breaker.</p>

                 <p>The client-side of the access sides on the floor behind the TV.  The access point reports 98 (out of 100) for signal strength.  Note that no other access points are visible.</p>

<p>After connecting the Ethernet from the access point to the media player I find that I have connectivity and can watch a movie.</p>

<p>Now two more access points to go ...</p>
