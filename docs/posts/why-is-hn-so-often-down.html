    <h1>Ask HN: Why is HN so often down?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It&#39;s daily now, that I&#39;m seeing &#34;We&#39;re having some trouble serving your request. Sorry!&#34;, maybe even 10-20 times during different times.</p><p>From Europe, especially during the lunch break hours, HN is down again and again. For instance as of the past 30 minutes, I see the above message more often than the expected pages. It&#39;s been like that also yesterday, the day before that.</p><p>I understand that this happens often based on searching, but I don&#39;t remember having it that often in the past.</p><p>Honest question: what happens, why do we get that message, especially during these times? Is there something that is going on the the early AM hours in the US? Maintenance work maybe?</p><p>Edit based on some comments below:</p><pre><code>  - could it be this has to do with being logged in or not? I will try to stay less often logged in.
  - another reason could be rate limits, especially if not logged in
  - rozenmd is monitoring HN, that looks awesome: https://hackernews.onlineornot.com/
  - &#34;Did you post something negative about Google/DEI? Or maybe just upvote it? Or skim one of those threads. There you go. Time out for you.&#34; &lt;---- this is particularly disturbing IF TRUE</code></pre></div></div></div>
