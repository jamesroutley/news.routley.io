    <p>Last updated 3 days, 21 hours ago</p>
<p>been thinking a lot about <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a> (i want to <a href="https://olu.online/ideas/">make a search engine-y thing for them</a>), and one of the ones on the list is /questions, and by coincidental magic the next letter of <a href="https://olu.online/alphabet-superset/">alphabet superset</a> is q! what a turn of events. i don&#39;t know if this should technically <a href="https://docs.bearblog.dev/post/">be a page and not a post</a> on my blog provider, but at the end of the day i can do what i want!</p>
<p>in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do we create technology that allows life to thrive and people to be empowered to live better lives (with or without directly having to use said technology), when most of the people with money are not at all interested in this?</li>
<li>how can people earn money through the web without relying on fickle payment providers and even more fickle giant social media companies? this is especially focused for people who create primarily in video, as its so expensive to host.</li>
<li>has anything that could &#34;come after&#34; or supplant the internet and web been invented? i have read (okay, skimmed with deep interest, with closer attention on imaginary networks) lori emerson&#39;s <a href="https://othernetworks.net/">other networks</a> book, and wonder if there&#39;s anything game changing already out there.</li>
<li>is the use of technology a thing like &#34;learning to read&#34;, where if it&#39;s possible you should always have the ability to use it? i&#39;m sure that&#39;s where all the &#34;teach every child to code!&#34; benevolent impulse comes from... loads of them just want money for their programs/hardware/software/pockets sure, but a lot also think that <a href="https://coolguy.website/the-future-will-be-technical/index.html">the future will be technical</a>, and we should put people in the best stead for that. writing out the question, i think i don&#39;t believe it&#39;s like reading, but i would love to hear <a href="https://olu.online/contact">other takes</a>.</li>
<li>are some technologies just always harmful?</li>
<li>other than unions, strikes, petitions, sabotage (up the luddites) and boycotts, are there ways that groups of users, or groups of creators of technology can change its path? i think i&#39;m particularly interested in users, as often i have fewer answers for what to do if not using a thing isn&#39;t an option.</li>
<li>what are ways we can collect blogs and other personal and poetic sites together? i don&#39;t personally use rss - feel free to try and convince me to - mostly because i miss the social aspect of social media link sharing, and without the commentary i&#39;d rather just go the websites themselves. is the answer &#34;mastodon/bluesky/similar&#34; or could something else exist here?</li>
<li>to return to money, could internet infrastructure like subsea cables ever end up even partially in collective, non-corporate or government hands?</li>
<li>can i think of a way to talk about subsea cables for 45 mins plus on video without boring the life out of whoever watches?</li>
</ul>
