    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="mon">Mon</h2>

<ul>
  <li>installed ruby for jekyll finally (omg @<strong>Maura</strong> !) so I can finally build my site locally and preview changes before deploying them on gh pages; using this, I figured out how to add a favicon to my website (also @<strong>Maura</strong> thank you for the photoshoot) https://gracekwak.me/</li>
  <li>paired with @<strong>Michael</strong> on git exercises :D</li>
  <li>coffee chat with @<strong>Nadja</strong> so nice to meet you in person :)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tues">Tues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>missing semester: debugging and profiling</li>
  <li>fixed floodfill thank you @<strong>Miriam</strong></li>
  <li>gratie: added a function to export piet programs as png, added test programs that actually terminate!!!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weds">Weds</h2>

<ul>
  <li>almost done with missing semester debugging+profiling exercises. decided i wanna do a presentation of the cool things I’ve learned from this course! learning generously so that i can remember stuff better and maybe help others too</li>
  <li>had a chat with a mentor about grad apps and what i wanna do during the spring. i think i actually wanna travel around (central and south america!!!!) because i speak spanish fluently and i have the luxury of freedom at this point in my life. and it’ll be easier to find an internship that starts in May (rather than late-Feb or March, after RC)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thurs">Thurs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>missing semester: metaprogramming</li>
  <li>finished debugging+profiling exercises. these were very cool!</li>
  <li>got macos script and tmux conf dotfile to work :)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fri">Fri</h2>

<ul>
  <li>started drafting <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Nir5r4jn8s7Lyqthzh6kZgAH8BNQZ72aqQQHAuiV_c/edit?usp=sharing">“the found semester” presentation</a>. thinking of demo-ing 1-2 cool tools from each lecture due to the time limit, and coming up with some kind of story to tie them all together, inspired by @<strong>Nicole</strong> ‘s presentation with Friend! and getting feedback/discussing with the group on our Tues and Weds meetings</li>
  <li>paired with @<strong>Jordan</strong> on Gratie! having fun with it and excited that it’s coming together</li>
  <li>checked out Heap Computer Club for the second half of batch</li>
  <li>fixed some functions and added some tests for Gratie</li>
</ul>

<p>for this first half-batch, i haven’t been able to “work at the edge of my abilities” as much as I would’ve liked to, but i still feel happy with myself :smile:</p>
