    <h1>On the future of free long term support for Linux distributions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>On the future of free long term support for Linux distributions</h2>

	<p><small>July 27, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the things that&#39;s quite popular with people out in the world
is being able to set up a Linux server and then leave it be for the
better part of a decade without having to reinstall it or upgrade
the distribution. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSUsageCases">I believe this is a significant reason people
used CentOS</a>, and it&#39;s popular enough to support
similar things in other distributions. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZombieDistroVersions">I&#39;m not fond of these old
zombie distribution versions</a>, but even we
have some of them (running CentOS 7). However, I&#39;m broadly pessimistic
about people being able to get this for free in the future (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110695820822065790">cf</a>), and I&#39;m also
pessimistic about even the current five year support period you get
for things like Canonical&#39;s Ubuntu LTS releases. To put it one way,
Red Hat&#39;s move is not unique; <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110613666965100965">Canonical is monetizing Ubuntu too</a>.</p>

<p>The reality is that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110697536782034559">reliable backports of security fixes is
expensive</a> (partly
because <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/BackportsAreHard">backports are hard in general</a>).
The older a distribution version is, generally the more work is
required. To generalize somewhat, this work does not get done for
free; someone has to pay for it.</p>

<p>To date, this public good has broadly been provided for free for
various periods of time by Debian developers, Red Hat, Canonical,
and so on. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSStreamBigChanges">Red Hat&#39;s switch from &#39;CentOS&#39; to &#39;CentOS Stream&#39;</a> and now <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSUsageCases">their change to how Stream works</a> marks Red Hat ceasing to provide this public
good for free; it&#39;s now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110757392256002113">fairly likely</a> to be a more or
less private, for pay thing. Canonical has never provided this
public good beyond five years (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/UbuntuBugReportsUseless">and in practice only to a limited
extent</a>), and now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110613666965100965">there are signs they&#39;re
going to limit this in various ways</a> (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110614121219974149">also</a>). Debian has sort
of provided this only <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/DebianVsUbuntuForUs">semi-recently</a>, in the
form of <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">non-official five year support</a>
(and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Extended">extended paid support</a>).
I&#39;m not sure about the practical state of openSUSE but <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime">see their
lifetime page for the current claims</a>.</p>

<p>(Oracle claims to provide extended support for free but <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110697536782034559">I don&#39;t
trust Oracle one bit</a>.)</p>

<p>People using Linux distributions have for years been in the fortunate
position that companies with money were willing to fund a lot of
painstaking work and then make the result available for free. One
of the artifacts of this was free distributions with long support
periods. My view is that this supply of corporate money is in the
process of drying up, and with it will go that free long term
support. This won&#39;t be a pleasant process.</p>

<p>The whole thing is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110695820822065790">why I said that people who wanted a decade of
free support would need good luck</a>. Maybe a way can
be found to squeeze through the roadblocks that the people providing
the money are trying to throw in the way (and the money will keep
flowing, because one end game is that Red Hat and Canonical exit
the long term Linux distribution business).</p>
