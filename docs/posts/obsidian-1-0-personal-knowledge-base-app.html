                    <p>A brand new look. A fresh way to browse. An exciting new start.

                    <p>Obsidian 1.0 has been thoroughly redesigned on desktop and mobile.
                    </p>
                    <p>The new design is not only more beautiful to look at, it&#39;s also more
                        robust, accessible, and easier to theme.</p>

                    <p>You can now open notes in tabs! This makes it easier to
                        explore many ideas at once. Obsidian becomes a browser for your brain.</p>
                    <p>Tabs can also be stacked so you can glide through your thoughts with
                        ease.</p>

                    <p>Calling Obsidian &#34;1.0&#34; is a scary thing. It comes with a lot of
                        expectations and means both everything and nothing. It doesn&#39;t mean Obsidian is feature
                        complete, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bug-free. But it does still mark an important milestone. It means
                        we&#39;re proud enough to drop the word &#34;beta&#34;.</p>
                    <p>
                        We have grand plans to continue making Obsidian the best and most refined thought-processing app
                        for decades to come. Obsidian 1.0 is just the start.

                            <p>Does 1.0 mean Obsidian is feature complete?</p>

                                <p>No, we still want to add more core features to Obsidian.</p>
                                <p>1.0 doesn&#39;t mean Obsidian is feature complete, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bug-free. But it

                                <p>As we&#39;ve done from the start, we will continue to make Obsidian more useful and easier to
                                    use, while staying local-first and private.</p>
                                <p>We have some exciting features planned on our <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap">roadmap</a>. We don&#39;t have
                                    a timeline for them, they&#39;ll be ready when they&#39;ve reached our standard.</p>

                                <p>Nope. Our pricing model stays the same.</p>
                                <p>Obsidian is still free
                                    for personal use. You can purchase add-on services like Sync or Publish, get a
