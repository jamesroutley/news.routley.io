            <p>
                NOTE: Cyber is currently at (v0.1) and is unstable. Multithread features are still in the design phase.

            <pre><code>import m &#39;math&#39;

worlds = [&#39;World&#39;, &#39;世界&#39;, &#39;दुनिया&#39;]
worlds.append(m.random())

        <h3>Who&#39;s it for.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber wants to provide fast and delightful scripting.
            You can embed Cyber into your applications, games, and engines on desktop or the web.
            Cyber also comes with a CLI so you can do scripting on your computer.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber is fast on various benchmarks.
            See more <a href="https://cyberscript.dev/performance.html">Benchmarks</a>.
            The fast performance is due to careful design of the compiler, bytecode, and interpreter.
            Read about <a href="https://cyberscript.dev/performance.html#info">Performance</a>.
        </p>
<p><b>Bench Test: Fibers Start/Resume</b> <a href="https://github.com/fubark/cyber/blob/master/test/bench/fiber/fiber.cy">source</a>
</p>
<p>This tests spawning fibers and context switching.
Cyber does well since it&#39;s execution context requires very few save/restore ops.
Some languages like ruby and php have not optimized for fibers and are thus left out.</p>

        <h3>Concurrency.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber provides granular control over script execution with fibers.
            Cyber plans to add multithread support with actors and channels. 
            Read about <a href="https://cyberscript.dev/features.html#concurrency">Concurrency</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory safety.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber achieves memory safety through automatic reference counting instead of a tracing garbage collector.
            This gives Cyber scripts reliable performance in realtime applications. Read about <a href="https://cyberscript.dev/features.html#memory">Memory safety</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Gradual types.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber is dynamically typed by default with gradual typing to provide type checks and guarantees.
            Using types also helps the compiler create more efficient bytecode resulting in faster script execution.
        </p>
        <h3>FFI and embedding.</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber supports calling into C ABI compatible libraries.
            You can also embed Cyber into your application, game, or engine.
