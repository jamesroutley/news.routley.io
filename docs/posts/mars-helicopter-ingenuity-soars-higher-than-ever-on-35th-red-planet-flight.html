<p>NASA&#39;s Ingenuity helicopter keeps raising the bar for Red Planet flight. </p><p>The 4-pound (1.8 kilograms) <a href="https://www.space.com/ingenuity-mars-helicopter-perseverance-rover">Ingenuity</a> soared 46 feet (14 meters) above Mars&#39; red dirt on Saturday (Dec. 3), setting a new altitude record on its 35th off-Earth flight.</p><p>The little chopper&#39;s previous record was 39 feet (12 m), achieved on three previous <a href="https://www.space.com/47-mars-the-red-planet-fourth-planet-from-the-sun.html">Mars</a> flights.

The helicopter soon deployed from the rover&#39;s belly and embarked on a campaign to show that powered flight is possible in the thin <a href="https://www.space.com/16903-mars-atmosphere-climate-weather.html">Mars atmosphere</a>.</p><p>That initial technology-demonstrating phase lasted less than a month and consisted of just five sorties. But NASA soon granted Ingenuity a mission extension, keeping the rotorcraft flying. Its current objectives center on pushing the envelope of Red Planet flight and performing reconnaissance for Perseverance.</p><p>The rover is searching for signs of ancient <a href="https://www.space.com/17135-life-on-mars.html">Mars life</a> on the floor of the 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero, which hosted a lake and a river delta billions of years ago. Perseverance is also collecting and caching a series of samples, which a joint NASA-European Space Agency campaign will return to Earth, perhaps <a href="https://www.space.com/perseverance-mars-sample-return-delay-2033">as early as 2033</a>.</p><p>Saturday&#39;s flight was the first for Ingenuity since Nov. 22 and just the second it has performed since a <a href="https://www.space.com/ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-34-new-software">major software update</a>. That update, which took several weeks to install, &#34;provides Ingenuity two major new capabilities: hazard avoidance when landing and the use of digital elevation maps to help navigate,&#34; mission team members wrote in a <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/420/flight-34-was-short-but-significant/" target="_blank" data-url="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/420/flight-34-was-short-but-significant/" rel="noopener">blog post late last month</a><span> (opens in new tab)</span>.</p><p>Ingenuity covered about 49 feet (15 m) of horizontal distance on Saturday&#39;s flight, which lasted 52 seconds. The helicopter has now traveled a total of 24,302 feet (7,407 m) and stayed aloft for 59.9 minutes on its 35 Mars sorties, according to the mission flight log.</p><p><em>Mike Wall is the author of &#34;</em><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=72128&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FOut-There-Scientific-Antimatter-Cosmically%2Fdp%2F1538729377%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dspace-us-1011031159882856200-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=72128&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FOut-There-Scientific-Antimatter-Cosmically%2Fdp%2F1538729377%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dspace-us-1709867603233049300-20" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=72128&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FOut-There-Scientific-Antimatter-Cosmically%2Fdp%2F1538729377%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-url="amazon.com" data-merchant-network="Amazon"><u><em>Out There</em></u></a><span> (opens in new tab)</span><em>&#34; (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.
