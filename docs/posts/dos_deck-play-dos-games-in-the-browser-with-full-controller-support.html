          <h2>Unlocking the Gaming Past with DOS_deck</h2>
          <p>
            In the modern era of gaming, we&#39;re spoiled for choice with instant access to games, thanks to game consoles and streaming services, all seamlessly controlled with our trusty gamepads. But let&#39;s rewind the clock. Long before these conveniences, there was an era where the gaming world was defined by the MS-DOS operating system, and it laid the foundation for what we enjoy today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1980 and 1995, MS-DOS reigned as the standard computer operating system. It was a period of innovation and creativity that introduced entirely new gaming genres. Wolfenstein pioneered the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, while Dune 2 set the stage for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Moreover, it was the birthplace of legendary franchises we adore today, including Grand Theft Auto, Fallout, Need for Speed and Warcraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as technology progressed, MS-DOS fell by the wayside, and in 2001, Microsoft ceased support for this iconic system. Many of these classic games became incompatible with modern versions of Windows, leaving a void in the hearts of gamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter a dedicated group of enthusiasts who weren&#39;t ready to let the classics fade into obscurity. They developed a PC emulator aimed at preserving the MS-DOS experience, and thus, <a href="https://dosbox.com" target="_blank">DOSBox</a> was born. This remarkable piece of software was the key to resurrecting the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOSBox allowed these classic games to run, but it required installation on a computer, limiting accessibility. Fortunately, the magic of modern web technology came to the rescue. Some ingenious individuals managed to make DOSBox run within a web browser, giving rise to the marvelous software package known as <a href="https://js-dos.com" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOS_deck is built upon the foundation of JS-DOS, which, in turn, relies on DOSBox. Together, they breathe new life into MS-DOS games by bringing them to your browser. However, there&#39;s a twist. Games from that era were designed for keyboard and mouse input, without established standards for interaction or control patterns. Here at DOS_deck, a tremendous effort was put into creating a seamless experience, enabling you to effortlessly navigate and play these games, ideally with the comfort of a controller in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rediscover a golden age of gaming with DOS_deck. It&#39;s the bridge between the past and the present, connecting you to a world of digital memories and timeless adventures.

          <h2>A few tips</h2>
          <p>
            Playing these games in a browser is a blast. But browsers behave a certain way and it&#39;s good to know a few things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Browsers only play sound effects and music after you&#39;ve &#34;interacted&#34; with the page at least once. So click or press a key once to activate audio.</li>
            <li>In many games, Escape activates a menu. But Escape also exits full screen in a browser. Therefore, you can press the equals key (&#34;=&#34;) to simulate Escape at all times.</li>
            <li>Some browsers require you to click on the game once before you can actually use the mouse or emulate the mouse with a controller.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Steam Deck Installation</h2>
          <p>DOS_deck runs great on Chrome or Edge on a Steam Deck, but it needs a few steps to activate the controller properly. By default, browsers cannot detect the controller. Instead, controller input is received by Chrome and Edge as if you pressed a keyboard key. So follow these steps to install DOS_deck in Steam Deck game mode:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Press the Steam button, select Power &gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
            <li>Open the Discover Software Center.</li>
            <li>Select Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Web Browsers.</li>
            <li>Find Chrome or Edge and select Install.</li>
            <li>Once it&#39;s installed, return to the Desktop. Select Application Launcher.</li>
            <li>Select Internet, right-click on Chrome or Edge and select Add to Steam.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to Chrome or Edge. Select Add Selected Programs.</li>
            <li>Back on the Desktop, open Application Launcher &gt; System &gt; Konsole (terminal window).</li>
            <li>Chrome or Edge needs access to the Steam Deck controller.</li>
            <li>Open Steam</li>
            <li>Navigate to Chrome or Edge, right-click and select Properties.</li>
            <li>Change the name to <b>DOS_deck</b></li>
            <li>Append this to launch options (after @@u @@):
              </li>
            <li>Restart your Steam Deck back into Game Mode</li>
            <li>Go to DOS_deck in your library and select Manage &gt; Controller Layout</li>
            <li>Select BROWSE CONFIGS &gt; Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad &gt; APPLY CONFIGURATION &gt; Done</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
