<p data-block-key="gselh">I&#39;m running a <a href="https://www.standupstandup.tech/">fundraiser</a> for <a href="https://866ourvote.org/about/">the Election Protection Hotline, 1-866-OUR-VOTE</a>. No matter your position on the 2024 US election, <b>I&#39;m guessing you want the votes counted fairly</b>. So I&#39;m trying to raise USD $25,000 for Election Protection.</p><p data-block-key="796uu"><a href="https://www.standupstandup.tech/">(A) Stand-up to Protect Our Vote:</a></p><p data-block-key="cr8ap">Not a US resident or US citizen? Hate all the major parties? No problem! You&#39;d be donating to <a href="https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/project/election-protection/">The Lawyersâ€™ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a>, a nonpartisan US nonprofit founded in 1963, which houses the Election Protection Coalition. Anyone, anywhere in the world, can donate.<br/></p><p data-block-key="6psra">Then, on Saturday Oct. 26th, expect 8 minutes of nerd jokes about open source software and how programming skews your brain, and none about politics. (Only 8 minutes because that&#39;s as long as a stand-up meeting should be.)</p><p data-block-key="19oi8">Please <a href="https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/adaptive-donor-form?formId=befedc4f-5e4d-46bb-be70-7cb59f8bb5b7&amp;envid=p-bMioWl36HU-N8RUoZ8vFIg&amp;zone=usa">donate</a>, and spread the word!</p>
