    <h1>Taking a break</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><strong>Monday, May  5, 2025</strong></p>

  <div><p>I&#39;ve been publishing at least one blog post every week on this blog for about 2.5 years.
I kept it up even when I was very sick last year with Lyme disease.
It&#39;s time for me to take a break and reset.</p>
<p>This is the right time, because the world is very difficult for me to move through right now and I&#39;m just burnt out.
I need to focus my energy on things that give me energy and right now, that&#39;s not writing and that&#39;s not tech.
I&#39;ll come back to this, and it might look a little different.</p>
<p>This is my last post for at least a month.
It might be longer, if I still need more time, but I won&#39;t return before the end of May.
I know I need at least that long to heal, and I also need that time to focus on music.
I plan to play a set at <a href="https://westphillyporchfest.com/pages">West Philly Porchfest</a>, so this whole month I&#39;ll be prepping that set.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along with my music, you can find it on <a href="https://atomicreeds.bandcamp.com/">my bandcamp</a> (only one track, but I&#39;ll post demos of the others that I prepare for Porchfest as they come together).
And if you want to reach out, my inbox is open.</p>
<p>Be kind to yourself.
Stay well, drink some water.
See you in a while.</p>
