    <h1>The Hobbit: Riddles in the Dark â€“ The Lost Version (2001)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In the foreword to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (specifically, Section
4, &#34;On the Finding of the Ring&#34;), J.R.R. Tolkien describes an alternate
version of the riddle-game with Gollum that appears in Chapter Five of <i>The
Hobbit.</i> He even goes so far as to describe Bilbo writing the
&#34;fabricated&#34; version in his memoirs, and the unwillingness of Frodo to
change it after he learned the truth.Â  In Chapter Two of <i>The Fellowship
of the Ring</i>, Frodo tells Gandalf that
Bilbo told him the &#34;real&#34; story of the finding of the ring,
specifically stating that it was <i>not</i> the same story that was in Bilbo&#39;s
book! Why all this emphasis on clearing up real versus false accounts of this
critical chapter in the history of the Ring?</p><p>In fact, the &#34;account that Bilbo
told the dwarves&#34; of the events is
what appeared in the first edition of <i>The Hobbit</i> in 1937. When the
character of Gollum was revised (and his history and motivations more
extensively explored) for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Chapter Five of <i>The
Hobbit</i> was subsequently
changed by Tolkien in later editions to reflect the version described in <i>LotR</i>.</p><p>The following is a side-by-side comparison of the two versions, presented in
order to provide insight as to how the smallest of details can affect the
overall themes of Tolkien&#39;s work. Of particular interest is the characterization
of Gollum, who in the revised version is much more malevolent and treacherous,
and yet also more pitiful, echoing the later role that he will play in the <i>Lord
of the Rings</i> trilogy.</p><p>Thanks to the kind people in the Special Collections room of the

        to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think what

        boat, and Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. But he had not.
        The hobbit was just thinking of going back up the passage—having had
        quite enough of Gollum and the dark water&#39;s edge—when he heard him
        wailing and squeaking away in the gloom. He was on his island (of which,
        of course, Bilbo knew nothing), scrabbling here and there, searching and
        seeking in vain, and turning out his pockets.</SPAN></td>

        Oh no! gollum!&#34;</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Never
        you mind,&#34; said Bilbo. &#34;A promise is a promise.&#34;</SPAN></p>

        yes it must. We can&#39;t go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get
        some things first, yes, things to help us.&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Well,
        hurry up!&#34; said Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He
        thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What
        was Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the
        dark lake? But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry
        now and hungry. And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he
        had a plan.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Not
        far away was his island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, and there in his
        hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful
        thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a
        precious ring.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;My
        birthday-present!&#34; he whispered to himself, as he had often done in
        the endless dark days. &#34;That&#39;s what we wants now, yes; we wants
        it!&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">He
        wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring
        on your finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight could you
        be seen, and then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and
        faint.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;My
        birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious.&#34; So he
        had always said to himself. But who knows when such rings were still at
        large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could not
        have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till it tired him; and then
        he kept it in a pouch next to his skin, till it galled him; and now
        usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always
        going back to look at it. And still sometimes he put it on, when he
        could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he was very,
        very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he would creep along dark passages
        looking for stray goblins. He might even venture into places
        where the torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he
        would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would
        see him, no one would notice him, till he had his fingers on their
        throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small
        goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw,
        but he wanted something softer.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Quite
        safe, yes,&#34; he whispered to himself. &#34;It won&#39;t see us, will
        it, my precious? No. It won&#39;t see us, and its nasty little sword will be
        useless, yes quite.&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">That
        is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from
        Bilbo&#39;s side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark.
        Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a while; for
        he had no idea how to find his way out alone.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Suddenly
        he heard a screech. It sent a shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing
        and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He
        was on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in
        vain.</SPAN></p></td>

      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo turned round and
        waited, wondering what it could be that the creature was making such a
        fuss about. this proved very fortunate afterwards. For Gollum came back
        and made a tremendous spluttering and whispering and croaking; and in
        the end Bilbo gathered that Gollum had had a ring—a wonderful,
        beautiful ring, a ring that he had been given for a birthday present,
        ages and ages before in the old days when such rings were less uncommon.
        Sometimes he had it in his pocket; usually he kept it in a little hole
        in the rock on his island; sometimes he wore it—when he was very, very
        hungry, and tired of fish, and crept along dark passages looking for
        stray goblins. The he might even venture into places where the
        torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be

        that ring on your finger, you were invisible; only in the sunlight could
        you be seen, and then only by your shadow, and that was a faint and
        shaky sort of shadow.</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">I
        don&#39;t know how many times Gollum begged Bilbo&#39;s pardon. He kept on
        saying: &#34;We are ssorry; we didn&#39;t mean to cheat, we meant to give
        it our only only pressent, if it won the competition.&#34; He even
        offered to catch Bilbo some nice juicy fish to eat as a consolation.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo

        mustn&#39;t ask us,&#34; shrieked Gollum. &#34;Not its business, no,

        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Well

        the game, and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then
        go on with your looking!&#34; Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded,
        Bilbo could not find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling that
        anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be something good.
        &#34;Come along!&#34; he shouted.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;No,

        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;But

        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Never
        guessed!&#34; said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp
        hiss. &#34;What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell
        first.&#34;</SPAN></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">He was thinking hard,
        and the idea came to him that Gollum must have dropped that ring
        sometime and that he must have found it, and that he had that very ring
        in his pocket. But he had the wits not to tell Gollum.</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Finding&#39;s
        keeping!&#34; he said to himself; and being in a very tight place, I
        daresay, he was right. Anyway the ring belonged to him now.</SPAN></p>
        <p><a name="93"></a><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Never
        mind!&#34; he said. &#34;The ring would have been mine now, if you had

        one condition.&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Yes,
        what iss it? What does it wish us to do, my precious?&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Help
        me to get out of these places,&#34; said Bilbo.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Now
        Gollum had to agree to this, if he was not to cheat. He still very much
        wanted just to try what the stranger tasted like; but now he had to give
        up all idea of it. Still, there was the little sword; and the stranger
        was wide awake and on the look out, not unsuspecting as Gollum liked to
        have things which he attacked. So perhaps it was best after all.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">That
        is how Bilbo got to know that the tunnel ended at the water and went no
        further on the other side where the mountain wall was dark and solid. He
        also learned that he ought to have turned down one of the side passages
        to the right before he came to the bottom; but he could not follow
        Gollum&#39;s directions for finding it again on the way up, and he made the
        wretched creature come and show him the way.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">As
        they went along up the tunnel together, Gollump flip-flapping at his
        side, Bilbo going very softly, he thought he would try the ring. He
        slipped it on his finger.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Where
        iss it? Where iss it gone to?&#34; said Gollum at once, peering about
        with his long eyes.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Here
        I am, following behind!&#34; said Bilbo slipping off the ring again,
        and feeling very pleased to have it and to find that it really did what
        Gollum said.</SPAN></p></td>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">As
        far as Bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not
        tell. Gollum&#39;s mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally,
        for Gollum had brooded for ages on this one thing, and he was always
        afraid of its being stolen. But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay. After
        all, he had won the game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk.
        &#34;Answers were to be guessed not given,&#34; he said.</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;But it wasn&#39;t a
        fair question,&#34; said Gollum. &#34;Not a riddle, precious,
        no.&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Oh
        well, if it&#39;s a matter of ordinary questions,&#34; Bilbo replied,
        &#34;then I asked one first. What have you lost? Tell me that!&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;What
        has it got in its pocketses?&#34; The sound came hissing louder and
        sharper, and as he looked towards it, to his alarm, Bilbo now saw two
        small points of light peering at him. As suspicion grew in Gollum&#39;s
        mind, the light of his eyes burned with a pale flame.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;What
        have you lost?&#34; Bilbo persisted.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">But
        now the light in Gollum&#39;s eyes had become a green fire, and it was
        coming swiftly nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly
        back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his
        heart that no sword had any more terror for him.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo
        could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw that
        all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in
        time he turned and ran blindly back up the dark passage down which he
        had come, keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;What
        has it got in its pocketses?&#34; he heard the hiss loud behind him,
        and the splash as Gollum leapt from his boat. &#34;What have I, I
        wonder?&#34; he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. He
        put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly
        slipped on to his groping forefinger.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">The
        hiss was close behind him. he turned now and saw Gollum&#39;s eyes like
        small green lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to run faster,
        but suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat
        with his little sword under him.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">In
        a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover
        his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking
        no notice of him, cursing and whispering as he ran.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">What
        could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. bilbo could see the light
        of his eyes palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got up, and
        sheathed his sword, which was now glowing faintly again, then very
        cautiously he followed. There seemed nothing else to do. it was no good
        crawling back down to Gollum&#39;s water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum
        might lead him to some way of escape without meaning to.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Curse
        it! curse it! curse it!&#34; hissed Gollum. &#34;Curse the Baggins!
        It&#39;s gone! What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my
        precious. He&#39;s found it, yes he must have. My birthday-present.&#34;</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo
        pricked up his ears. He was at last beginning to guess himself. He
        hurried a little, getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, who was
        still going quickly, not looking back, but turning his head from side to
        side, as Bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;My
        birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that&#39;s
        it. When we came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young
        squeaker. That&#39;s it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages
        and ages! It&#39;s gone, gollum!&#34;</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Suddenly
        Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound
        horrible to listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the
        tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He
        seemed to be having an argument with himself.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;It&#39;s
        no good going back there to search, no. We doesn&#39;t remember all the
        places we&#39;ve visited. and it&#39;s no use. The Baggins has got it in its

        guesses, precious, only guesses. We can&#39;t know till we find the nassty
        creature and squeezes it. But it doesn&#39;t know what the present can do,
        does it? It&#39;ll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn&#39;t know, and it
        can&#39;t go far. It&#39;s lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn&#39;t know
        the way out. It said so.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;It

        know a way out, yes. It&#39;s off to the back-door. to the back-door, that&#39;s
        it.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;The
        goblins will catch it then. It can&#39;t get out that way, precious.</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Ssss,
        sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it&#39;s got the present, our precious
        present, then goblinses will get it, gollum! They&#39;ll find it, they&#39;ll
        find out what it does. We shan&#39;t ever be safe again, never, gollum! One
        of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see him. He&#39;ll be
        there but not seen. Not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and
        he&#39;ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!&#34;</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Then
        let&#39;s stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone
        that way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!&#34;</SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#0000FF">With
        a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo
        hurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of
        tripping on another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a
        whirl of hope and wonder. It seemed that the ring was a magic ring: it
        made you invisible! He had heard of such things, of course, in old old
        tales; but it was hard to believe that he really had found one, by
        accident. Still there it was: Gollum with his bright eyes had passed him
        by, only a yard to one side.</SPAN></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">Now on they went again,
        while Gollum counted the passages to left and right: &#34;One left, one
        right, two right, three right, two left,&#34; and so on. He began to
        get very shaky and afraid as they left the water further and further
        behind; but at last he stopped by a low opening on their left (going
        up)—&#34;six right, four left.&#34;</SPAN></td>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">On they went, Gollum
        flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind going as softly
        as a hobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo had noticed on
        the way down, side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began at
        once to count them.</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;One
        left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes,
        yes.&#34; And so on and on.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">As
        the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for
        he was leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting
        afraid. Goblins might be about, and he had lost his ring. At last he
        stopped by a low opening, on their left as they went up.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Seven
        right, yes. Six left, yes!&#34; he whispered. &#34;This is it. This is
        the way to the back-door, yes. Here&#39;s the passage.&#34;</SPAN></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF"><a name="94"></a>&#34;Here&#39;ss
        the passage,&#34; he whispered. &#34;It musst squeeze in and sneak
        down. We durstn&#39;t go with it, my preciouss, no we durstn&#39;t, gollum!&#34;</SPAN></td>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">He peered in and shrank

        down there. Lots of golinses. We smells them. Ssss!&#34;</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">So
        they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after
        all, but Bilbo could not get in! There was Gollum sitting humped up
        right in the opening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his head, as he
        swayed it from side to side between his knees.</SPAN></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">So Bilbo slipped under
        the arch, and said good-bye to the nasty miserable creature; and very
        glad he was. He did not feel comfortable until he felt quite sure it was
        gone, and he kept his head out in the main tunnel listening until the
        flip-flap of Gollum going back to his boat died away in the darkness.
        Then he went down the new passage.</SPAN></td>
      <td><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo crept away from
        the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and
        sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but menacingly. he
        could not see the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had other
        senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed to
        be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor, and his
        head thrust out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black
        shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was
        tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring.</SPAN>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Bilbo
        almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He
        must get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength
        left. He must fight. He must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill
        it. It meant to kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now.
        Gollum had no sword. Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or
        tried to yet. And he was miserable, alone, lost. A sudden understanding,
        a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo&#39;s heart: a glimpse of
        endless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone,
        cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash
        of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in another flash, as
        if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">No
        great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum&#39;s
        head he jumped, seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he
        known it, he only just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the
        passage.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Gollum
        threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but
        too late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his
        sturdy feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what
        Gollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at
        first, then it stopped. All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek,
        filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no
        further. He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he
        had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo&#39;s heart to his
        mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as an echo, but menacing, the
        voice came behind:</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">&#34;Thief,
        thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for
        ever!&#34;</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#0000FF">Then
        there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. &#34;If
        goblins are so near that he smelt them,&#34; he thought, &#34;then
        they&#39;ll have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way
        will lead you to worse things.&#34;</SPAN></p></td>
