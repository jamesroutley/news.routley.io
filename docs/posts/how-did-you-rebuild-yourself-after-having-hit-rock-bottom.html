    <h1>Ask HN: How did you rebuild yourself after having hit rock bottom?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I [28M] got broken up with by my partner of almost 4 years a couple weeks ago. I thought she was the love of my life and I would marry that woman. I&#39;m also in the last year of my PhD in a sub-field I have never envisioned myself in and somehow slipped into due to Covid and my own passiveness and weak sense of self. The PhD is also not going super well and I&#39;m stressed about not having enough research to finish in time. I also grew up in a dysfunctional family environment (toxic parent relationship, some narcissistic/borderline traits in them) and have been struggling with the consequences of that on my development and mental health. I also don&#39;t have a large social circle, and some of my friends are scattered internationally.</p><p>As you can see, I feel like I&#39;ve hit rock bottom. On the outside I look all successful, in shape and doing a PhD in a prestigious research group. But most of the time in my life I&#39;ve felt empty, doubting myself and struggling with a weak sense of self and unhealthy thought/behavioural patterns that are hard to shed off. I feel like I&#39;ve lost any passion for anything, and don&#39;t know what I want or need.</p><p>I&#39;ve read tons of psychology/philosophy/self-help over the past 10 years and it helped to some extent. I&#39;ve also started therapy 2 months ago, but it&#39;s going slow and it hasn&#39;t been very useful yet. The advice so far has boiled down to &#34;do things you like&#34;.</p><p>I would be grateful for any of your advice or shared life stories. At the moment I feel like standing in front of a massive pile of broken glass.</p></div></div></div>
