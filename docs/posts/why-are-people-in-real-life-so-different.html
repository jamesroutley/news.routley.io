      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Aside from the trolling and otherwise immature behaviour we see in certain online communities (usually ones with a lot of very young people), I&#39;ve actually observed that people in real life seem so much more complacent and uncritical compared to people online.<p>Maybe there&#39;s a sample bias because of the online communities I visit (like HN) and the real world that I live in, but in general, I&#39;ve observed that people in real life seem overly concerned about keeping things &#34;harmonious&#34;, with all the small-talk, the lack of real listening, talking past each other, not voicing differing perspectives, etc. They also seem to lack patience in various things, whether that&#39;s discussing or examining something (can&#39;t think of examples right now), and would rather &#34;go back to their own lives&#34;. In contrast people online seem so much more generous.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing this is partially because &#34;being on the internet&#34; naturally filters people. But what else is there? What&#39;s your experience with people online vs in real life? Why do you think this is the case?</p></td></tr>
