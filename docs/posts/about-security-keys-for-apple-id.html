<p>A security key is a small external device that looks like a thumb drive or tag, which can be used for verification when signing in with your Apple ID using two-factor authentication.</p>

            <h2>Security Keys for Apple ID</h2>
            <div><p>Security Keys for Apple ID is an optional advanced security feature designed for people who want extra protection from targeted attacks, such as phishing or social engineering scams. </p>
<p>With two-factor authentication — which is designed to make sure that you&#39;re the only one who can access your Apple ID account — you need to provide two pieces of information to sign in with your Apple ID to a new device or on the web.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first piece of information is your Apple ID password.</li>
<li>A security key can act as the second piece of information, instead of the six-digit verification code that is normally used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you use a physical key instead of the six-digit code, security keys strengthen the two-factor authentication process and help prevent your second authentication factor from being intercepted or requested by an attacker.</p>
<p><span>You&#39;re responsible for maintaining access to your security keys. If you lose all of your trusted devices and security keys, you could be locked out of your account permanently.</span></p>

            <h2>What&#39;s required for Security Keys for Apple ID</h2>
            <div><ul>
<li>At least two FIDO® Certified* security keys that work with the Apple devices that you use on a regular basis.</li>
<li>iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, or macOS Ventura 13.3, or later on all of the devices where you&#39;re signed in with your Apple ID.</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication set up for your Apple ID.</li>
<li>A modern web browser. If you can&#39;t use your security key to sign in on the web, update your browser to the latest version or try another browser.</li>
<li>To sign in to Apple Watch, Apple TV, or HomePod after you set up security keys, you need an iPhone or iPad with a software version that supports security keys.</li>

            <div><ul>
<li>You can&#39;t sign in to iCloud for Windows.</li>
<li>You can&#39;t sign in to older devices that can&#39;t be updated to a software version that supports security keys.</li>

            <h2>Choose the right security keys</h2>
            <div><p>Security Keys for Apple ID works with any FIDO® Certified security key. Some good examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>YubiKey 5C NFC (works with most Mac and iPhone models)</li>
<li>YubiKey 5Ci (works with most Mac and iPhone models)</li>
<li>FEITAN ePass K9 NFC USB-A (works with older Mac models and most iPhone models)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose a different security key, you should choose security keys that are FIDO® Certified, and have a connector that works with the Apple devices that you use on a regular basis.</p>

            <h2>Use Security Keys for Apple ID</h2>
            <div><p>When you use Security Keys for Apple ID, you need a trusted device or a security key to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in with your Apple ID on a new device or on the web</li>
<li>Reset your Apple ID password or unlock your Apple ID</li>
<li>Add additional security keys or remove a security key</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your security keys in a safe place, and consider keeping a security key in more than one place. For example, keep one key at home and one key at work. If you&#39;re traveling, you might want to leave one of your security keys at home.</p>

<p>You need a passcode or password set up on the device that you use to add security keys.</p>
<p><span>During set up, you&#39;re signed out of inactive devices, which are devices associated with your Apple ID that you haven&#39;t used or unlocked in more than 90 days. To sign back into these devices, update to compatible software and use a security key. If your device can&#39;t be updated to compatible software, you won&#39;t be able to sign back in.</span></p>
