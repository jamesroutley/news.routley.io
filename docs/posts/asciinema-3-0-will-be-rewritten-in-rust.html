      <p dir="auto">This is the initial work for the upcoming 3.0 release, which will be based on full rewrite in Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">I&#39;ve contemplated this, but I didn&#39;t have as many good reasons to justify it in the past. However, there&#39;s plenty of good reasons for me to do a Rust rewrite now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Amongst other things the rewrite will:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/avt">avt</a> (which is written in Rust) to implement things like conversion to pure text, and give asciinema insight into what is actually happening in a terminal, enabling many more features</li>
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/tst">tst</a> (which is written in Rust) to implement terminal live streaming</li>
<li>allow easy integration of <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/agg">agg</a> (which is written in Rust) so one doesn&#39;t need to install a separate tool</li>
<li>make startup faster - desired when automatically recording all shells/terminal tabs</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Last but not least, I enjoy working with Rust much much more than with Python :)</p>
