<p>Efficient backpropagation (BP) is central to the ongoing    
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearning.html">Neural Network (NN) ReNNaissance and &#34;Deep Learning.&#34;</a> 
Who invented it? 

</p><p> BP&#39;s modern version (also called the reverse mode of automatic differentiation) was first published in 1970 
by Finnish master student <b>Seppo Linnainmaa</b> <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a> <a href="#R7">[R7]</a>. <b>In 2020, we celebrated BP&#39;s half-century anniversary!</b>
A precursor of BP was published by Henry J. Kelley in 1960 
<a href="#BPA">[BPA]</a>—in 2020, we celebrated its 60-year anniversary.

</p><p>In the 2020s, it was still easy to find misleading accounts of BP&#39;s history <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a><a href="#T22">[T22]</a><a href="#DLP">[DLP]</a><a href="#NOB">[NOB]</a>. I had a look at the original papers from the 1960s and 70s, and talked to BP pioneers. Here is a summary based on my  award-winning
<a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html">2014 survey</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a>
which includes most of the references mentioned below.

</p><p>The minimisation of errors through gradient descent (Cauchy 1847 <a href="#GD&#39;">[GD&#39;]</a>, Hadamard, 1908 <a href="#GD&#39;&#39;">[GD&#39;&#39;]</a>) in the parameter space of complex, nonlinear, differentiable, multi-stage, NN-related systems has been discussed at least since the early 1960s,
e.g., Kelley (1960) <a href="#BPA">[BPA]</a>; Bryson (1961) <a href="#BPB">[BPB]</a>; Pontryagin et al. (1961); Dreyfus (1962) <a href="#BPC">[BPC]</a>; Wilkinson (1965); Tsypkin (1966) <a href="#GDa">[GDa-b]</a>; Amari (1967-68) <a href="#GD2">[GD2,GD2a]</a>; Bryson and Ho (1969); initially within the framework of Euler-LaGrange equations in the Calculus of Variations, e.g., Euler (1744). 

</p><p>Steepest descent in the weight space of such systems can be performed (Kelley, 1960 <a href="#BPA">[BPA]</a>; Bryson, 1961 <a href="#BPB">[BPB]</a>) by iterating the chain rule (<a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/leibniz-father-computer-science-375.html">Leibniz</a>, 1676 <a href="#LEI07">[LEI07-10]</a><a href="#DLH">[DLH]</a>; L&#39;Hopital, 1696) in Dynamic Programming style (DP, e.g., Bellman, 1957 <a href="#BEL53">[BEL53]</a>). A simplified derivation (Dreyfus, 1962 <a href="#BPC">[BPC]</a>) of this backpropagation method uses only the <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/leibniz-father-computer-science-375.html">Leibniz</a> chain rule  <a href="#LEI07">[LEI07]</a>.

</p><p>The systems of the 1960s were already efficient in the DP sense. However, they backpropagated derivative information through standard Jacobian matrix calculations from one &#34;layer&#34; to the previous one, without explicitly addressing either direct links across several layers or potential additional efficiency gains due to network sparsity. 

</p><p>Explicit, efficient error backpropagation (BP) in arbitrary, discrete, possibly sparsely connected, NN-like networks was first described in a 1970 master&#39;s thesis (Linnainmaa, 1970, 1976) <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a><a href="#R7">[R7]</a>, albeit without reference to NNs. This kind of BP is also known as the <em>reverse mode of automatic differentiation</em> (e.g., Griewank, 2012 <a href="#BP5">[BP5]</a>), where the costs of forward activation spreading essentially equal the costs of backward derivative calculation. See early BP FORTRAN code (Linnainmaa, 1970) <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a> and closely related but slightly later work by Ostrovskii et al. (1971) <a href="#BP1a">[BP1a]</a> (apparently the <em>first journal publication</em> on backpropagation). As of 2020, all modern software packages for NNs (such as Google&#39;s Tensorflow) are based on Linnainmaa&#39;s method of 1970.

</p><p>BP was soon explicitly used to minimize cost functions by adapting control parameters (weights) (Dreyfus, 1973). This was followed by some preliminary, NN-specific discussion (Werbos, 1974, section 5.5.1) and a computer program for automatically deriving and implementing BP in differentiable systems (Speelpenning, 1980).
The first NN-specific application of efficient BP as above was apparently described by  Werbos in 1982 <a href="#BP2">[BP2]</a> (but not yet in his 1974 thesis, as is sometimes claimed). 


</p><p> However, already in 1967, Amari suggested to train deep multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with many layers in non-incremental end-to-end fashion from scratch by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) <a href="#GD1">[GD1]</a>, a method proposed in 1951 <a href="#STO51">[STO51-52]</a>.
Amari&#39;s implementation <a href="#GD2">[GD2,GD2a]</a> (with his student Saito) learned <em>internal representations</em> in a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers <a href="#DLH">[DLH]</a><a href="#NOB">[NOB]</a>, which was trained to classify
non-linearily separable pattern classes. Back then compute was billions of times more expensive than today. 

</p><p>Compare the first deep learning MLPs called GMDH networks (Ivakhnenko and Lapa, since 1965) whose layers are incrementally grown and trained by regression analysis <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a><a href="#R8">[R8]</a><a href="#DLH">[DLH]</a><a href="#NOB">[NOB]</a>. These were  actually the first deep NNs that learned to create hierarchical, distributed, <em>internal representations</em> of incoming data. 

</p><p> Additional work on backpropagation was published  later (e.g., Parker, 1985; LeCun, 1985). 
By 1985, compute was about 1,000 times cheaper than in 1970 <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>, and 
the first desktop computers 
became accessible in wealthier academic labs. 
An experimental analysis of the known method <a href="#BP1">[BP1-2]</a> by Rumelhart et al. then demonstrated that backpropagation can yield useful internal representations in hidden layers of NNs <a href="#RUM">[RUM]</a>. At least for supervised learning, this tends to be more efficient than Amari&#39;s above-mentioned deep learning through the more general SGD method (1967), which learned useful internal representations in NNs about 2 decades earlier <a href="#GD1">[GD1-2a]</a>.


</p><p> Some ask: <em> &#34;Isn&#39;t backpropagation just the chain rule of <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/leibniz-father-computer-science-375.html">Leibniz</a> (1676) <a href="#LEI07">[LEI07-10]</a> &amp; L&#39;Hopital (1696)?&#34;</em>  No, it is the efficient way of applying the chain rule to big networks with differentiable nodes—see <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/scientific-integrity-turing-award-deep-learning.html#XII">Sec. XII</a> of <a href="#T22">[T22]</a><a href="#DLH">[DLH]</a>). (There are also many inefficient ways of  doing this.) It was not published until 1970 <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>.

</p><p> It took 4 decades until the backpropagation method of 1970 <a href="#BP1">[BP1-2]</a> got widely accepted as a training method for deep NNs. Before 2010, many thought that the training of NNs with many layers requires <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training</a>, a methodology introduced 
<a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/very-deep-learning-1991.html">by myself in 1991</a> <a href="#UN">[UN][UN0-3]</a>, and later championed by others (2006) <a href="#UN4">[UN4]</a>. In fact, it was claimed <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a><a href="#DLP">[DLP]</a>  that &#34;nobody in their right mind would ever suggest&#34; to apply plain backpropagation to deep NNs. However, in 2010, our team with my outstanding Romanian 
postdoc Dan Ciresan 
<a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010-end-to-end-deep-learning-breakthrough.html">
showed that deep FNNs  
can be trained by plain backpropagation and do not at all require unsupervised
pre-training for important applications</a> <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1-3]</a><a href="#MOST">[MOST]</a>.

<em>Sadly, the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 for Hopfield &amp; Hinton is a Nobel Prize for plagiarism. They republished methodologies for artificial neural networks developed in Ukraine and Japan by Ivakhnenko and Amari in the 1960s &amp; 1970s, as well as other techniques, without citing the original papers. Even in later surveys, they didn&#39;t credit the original inventors (thus turning what may have been unintentional plagiarism into a deliberate form). None of the important algorithms for modern Artificial Intelligence were created by Hopfield &amp; Hinton.

This work describes unsupervised layer-wise pre-training of stacks of <em>feedforward</em> NNs (FNNs) 
called <em>Deep Belief Networks</em> (DBNs).
However, this work neither cited the original layer-wise training of deep NNs by Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa (1965)<sup><small><small><a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a></small></small></sup> nor
the 1991 unsupervised pre-training of stacks of more general <em>recurrent</em> NNs (RNNs)<sup><small><small><a href="#UN">[UN0-3]</a></small></small></sup> 
which  introduced
<a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/very-deep-learning-1991.html">the first NNs shown to solve very deep problems</a>.
The 2006 justification of the authors was essentially the one Schmidhuber used for the 1991 RNN stack: 
each higher level tries to reduce the description length 
(or negative log probability) of the data representation in the level below.<sup><small><small><a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a><a href="#T22">[T22]</a><a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a></small></small></sup>
