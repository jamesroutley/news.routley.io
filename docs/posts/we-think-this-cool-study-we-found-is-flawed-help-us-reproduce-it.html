  </div><div id="slide-8"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We think the findings of the study are at the mercy of a single decision the researchers made to filter out questionable responses. To us, this meant the participant either misunderstood the instructions, or intentionally subverted the experiment.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-9"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This filtering decision was the difference between results that lead to intriguing headlines, and those that produce no trend and no paper. To be clear, this wasn’t about negligence or malicious intent, but rather the unavoidable personal opinions that inform methodologies. Our opinions diverge at this point, so we wanted to break down its consequences more deeply.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-10"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Let’s dive in. Here is the wording of the instructions from in the original study:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-11"><figure><blockquote><p>Click on a number between one and six as randomly as possible to produce the kind of sequence
      you’d get if you really rolled a die, so that if another person is shown your sequence of
      digits from 1 to 6, he/she should not be able to tell whether these numbers were produced by a
      real die or just “made up” by somebody.

  </div><div id="slide-14"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Do you think the questionable response looks genuinely random and satisfies the instructions? We don’t.

  </div><div id="slide-19"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The study was peer-reviewed, but to our knowledge it hasn’t been reproduced. This is typical, since reproduction takes a significant amount of time and effort on the part of other scientists busy conducting their own research.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-20"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We aren’t peers, but here is our review: There are two camps around the decision to filter out questionable responses. We believe that there are obvious responses that are candidates for removal that make the data more true. The researchers believe that you can only analyze the raw responses because, statistically, any sequence is equally likely to occur, so where do you draw the line? To them, filtering any data would be tampering with the results.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-21"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What do you think about these two takes on the decision? Regardless of your opinion (or ours or theirs), we wanted to make it explicit that no study is black-and-white, and it is always worth exploring those gray areas.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
  </div><div id="slide-22"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The experiment at the start of this story was our attempt at our own abridged reproduction. Here are the live results of that process from <mark></mark> reader responses.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

But our hypothesis is that it is basically a straight line,  especially after filtering out the uniform responses. If we are right, we aren’t seeing evidence supporting a correlation between age and randomness. If not, then the researchers were definitely on to something!<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

</p><div id="slide-26"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The moral of the story: just because you read a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/science/random-unpredictable-behavior-age-25.html" target="_blank">New York Times headline</a> about a study doesn’t mean that its findings are replicable, so stay curious.

<div id="methods"><h4><strong>Our Methods</strong></h4>
  <p><small><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The calculation of algorithmic complexity is done using the <a href="https://www.complexitycalculator.com/HowItWorks.html" rel="external">CTM method</a>. In practice, we use a <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/sixty/blob/main/src/utils/computeComplexity.js" rel="external">custom implementation</a> of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acss/index.html" rel="external">acss R package</a> to obtain this complexity for given user inputs and compute an overall score.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></small></p><p><small><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->For the task level data, we use the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmicnaturelab/HumanBehavioralComplexity" rel="external">original dataset</a> of the study and use a cutoff of non-uniform responses to remove questionable ones. Since there are many kinds of uniform responses, we use a specific z-score of complexity for each task below which all responses are uniform.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></small></p><p><small><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We then overlay this data with a trend line calculated using the LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) method. The analysis presented in the paper used the LOESS function from R with no robustness iterations (the default) resulting in sensitivity to outliers. Using a LOESS function with even one robustness iteration results in a similar flattening of the trend line as presented in this article.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></small></p><p><small><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The original study asked users to perform five tasks, but since the results are basically the same across the board, we decided to reduce our experiment to three tasks because of attention spans (not yours, it is exceptional if you are reading this).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></small></p><p><small><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Here is <a href="https://github.com/the-pudding/data/" rel="external">the data</a> from our experiment if you want to explore it yourself.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></small></p></div>
