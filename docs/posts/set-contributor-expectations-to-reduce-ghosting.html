<h3 data-block-key="nksmg">Why this happens</h3><p data-block-key="apjlb">Let&#39;s say I send you an email to ask you for something or make a suggestion. To a lot of us, in most of our lives, <b>if</b> <b>you are silent, that&#39;s a soft &#34;no.&#34;</b> It&#39;s a diplomatic, conflict-softening way of indicating that you are not interested.</p><p data-block-key="3urpd">And so a lot of open source contributors seem to react accordingly, especially if they&#39;re new to the project. The more days they have to wait, the greater the chance that they will assume rejection and mentally move on. Some data: the 2014 study <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hsJLv1ieSqtXBzd5YZusY-mB8e1VJzaeOmh8Q4VeMio/edit#slide=id.g53613720b_029">&#34;Measuring Engagement: Recommendations from Audit and Analytics&#34; by David Eaves, Adam Lofting, Pierros Papadeas, Peter Loewen of Mozilla</a>, particularly pp. 18, 20 and 26-29 of the slide deck. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020153915/https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/analysis">Wayback machine capture of context from Mozilla&#39;s now-defunct wiki</a>.) Their analysis:</p><blockquote data-block-key="9er4h">Contributors who received code reviews within 48 hours on their first bug have an exceptionally high rate of returning and contributing.</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="430je">Contributors who wait longer than 7 days for code review on their first bug have virtually zero percent likelihood of returning.</blockquote><p data-block-key="u24n">But maintainers of open source projects know that <b>delay in open source often doesn&#39;t mean &#34;no,&#34; it means &#34;maybe&#34; or &#34;yes if&#34;.</b> Because: something perfect, we can quickly accept. Something utterly terrible or off-base, we can quickly reject. <b>What takes longer than &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; is to thoughtfully and diplomatically respond with a probable maybe.</b> Maybe it&#39;s the wrong architectural approach, a bad implementation of a good idea. Or: maybe it&#39;s ahead of its time, and we know that integrating it properly requires us to implement some other infrastructure first. Or maybe there&#39;s something we need to fix privately, like a security vulnerability, before we can publicly discuss this new contributor&#39;s idea.</p><p data-block-key="9m1cq">Since maintainers often feel pressed for time, we end up taking days or weeks to say &#34;maybe&#34; or &#34;yes if&#34;. By then, they&#39;ve likely read the signals they think we&#39;re sending, and mentally moved on and made alternate plans. So they won&#39;t have the time available to task-switch back to this context, revise their contribution, and compose a well-written note about their change. And, unless you&#39;ve taken care to be appropriately encouraging in your &#34;please revise and resubmit&#34; note, a longer delay is more likely to make them think &#34;what&#39;s the point&#34; and to infer that the project is unenthusiastic about collaborating with them.</p><p data-block-key="a77v1">In general, different contributors, and different <i>kinds</i> of contributors, often expect different paces and rhythms in open source work. (I discussed this further in <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/managing-cadence-shear-my-upstream-2022-talk/">my piece on cadence shear</a>, and in <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/reluctance-to-process-contributions-and-tips-from-innersource/">a related piece on things we can learn from InnerSource</a>.) The less a specific contributor knows and understands the usual rhythm of your team&#39;s work, and the less they feel socially able to escalate or ask &#34;how long is this going to take?&#34; without ruffling feathers, the more likely they are to silently decide this isn&#39;t going to work out. So <b>this problem significantly affects your ability to build a more diverse contributor base</b>. People in marginalized groups often learn that they get punished for asking an authority figure what&#39;s up. But also, I&#39;m talking about diversity across work cultures -- academics, salespeople, military veterans, entrepreneurs, political activists, and manual laborers are likely going to be used to different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance">power distances</a> and different expectations about when they should speak up, to someone above them in a hierarchy, about something blocking their work.</p><p data-block-key="ealni">And even when we do reply, if we&#39;re asking them to do more work, that can be a big surprise. Because, especially if they&#39;re new to open source and/or haven&#39;t been a senior developer on a team before, <b>they often don&#39;t realize that submitting a patch or pull request is the</b> <b><i>start</i></b><b> of a collaboration</b>. They often think, basically, that the maintainer is going to either accept or reject the PR -- that&#39;s it -- or treat it as raw material for the <i>maintainer</i> to improve.</p><p data-block-key="3t72d">In other words: can we really say they&#39;re ghosting if neither side of the collaboration has a clear, explicit expectation about how responsive the other side is supposed to be?</p><p data-block-key="egch0">And: People vanish from volunteer opportunities and obligations in all sorts of settings, outside of open source, in different ways and and for many reasons. <a href="https://buttondown.email/Changeset/archive/maintainer-skills-workshops-an-early-book-excerpt/">I&#39;ve discussed this in detail in my newsletter; read the section &#34;Helping unreliable colleagues&#34;.</a> But <b>the structures and incentives of open source projects are a conveyor belt that turn reliable colleagues into overwhelmed overcommitters.</b> We have ambiguous expectations about who&#39;s in charge of what, how fast things should happen, what constitutes a commitment, and so on.</p>
