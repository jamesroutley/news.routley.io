<h2>Frequently asked questions.</h2><p>The City of London has a handy <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath">webpage</a> with information about weddings, filming, learning, event applications and more - that will be your best bet for up to date answers. You can also contact the City of London with queries about permits, permissions to host events etc at <a href="http://hampstead.heath@cityoflondon.gov.uk" target="_blank">hampstead.heath@cityoflondon.gov.uk</a>. </p><h3>DO I NEED PERMISSION TO HOST AN EVENT ON THE HEATH? CAN I HIRE HIRE A PART OF THE HEATH?</h3><p>If it’s a big ‘event’ kind of an event, or if you want to cordon something off or hire a venue, then yes you will need permission. You can apply for permission to host an event on the City of London website <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/events-applications-at-hampstead-heath">here</a>. You don’t need permission for something smaller and informal, like someone’s birthday picnic.</p><p>The Pergola is a popular spot for photo shoots and weddings - you can find information about using the venue for those purposes <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/where-to-go-at-hampstead-heath/hill-garden-and-pergola">here</a>. </p><p>Please contact the City of London with any questions, I really can’t help any further than to give you these links. I received an email this year asking if an artist could hire part of the Heath to create the Northern Lights, to which I wished I could reply YES, but sadly couldn’t.</p><h3>DO I NEED A PERMIT TO FILM ON THE HEATH?</h3><p>Individuals and groups do require permits for filming, yes. You can find information about that on the City of London’s website <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/filming-and-photography-at-hampstead-heath">here</a>, or contact them with any further questions.</p><h3>DO YOU HAVE MERCH/ GIFTS/ ANYTHING I CAN BUY MY FRIEND WHO GOT ENGAGED ON THE HEATH?</h3><p>I do now, yes! You can find it <a href="https://www.hampsteadheath.net/shop">here</a>.</p><h3>ARE THE PONDS AND THE LIDO OPEN DURING LOCKDOWN?</h3><p>Not during proper lockdowns, no. They were open during the summer and autumn with a booking system, and with the lower tiers in the ‘Tier’ system. The most recent update I have on this site will be on the <a href="https://bobcat-sprout-h378.squarespace.com/swimming-ponds">Swimming Ponds page</a>, but the rules do change as we move between restriction levels so I don’t always have the latest. You can find the most up to date information on the City of London’s <a href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/activities-at-hampstead-heath/swimming-at-hampstead-heath">website</a>, or via <a href="https://twitter.com/CityCorpHeath">@CityCorpHeath</a> on Twitter.</p><h3>AM I ALLOWED TO BBQ ON THE HEATH?</h3><p>To the sorrow of some and the pleasure of others, BBQs are banned anywhere on the Heath.</p><h3>CAN I USE SOME OF YOUR PHOTOS?</h3><p>It depends which ones, unfortunately. New photos, absolutely, provided they’re mine or have been shared by readers for public use (with credit and permission) on the site. For the old ones, I could share files with you, but it would be up to you to sort out the rights to use them. Let me know which ones you’re talking about when you get in touch.</p><h3>CAN I VOLUNTEER ON THE HEATH?</h3><p>You can! With Heath Hands. At least, usually you can, Covid has disrupted volunteering somewhat, but you can read about volunteering opportunities <a href="https://www.hampsteadheath.net/volunteering">here</a>.</p><h3>MY FAVOURITE BENCH HAS DISAPPEARED, DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT WENT?</h3><p>Alas, no, I’m afraid I don’t.</p><h3>WILL THE HEATH STILL BE OPEN WHILE BIG EVENTS LIKE THE KENWOOD HOUSE CONCERTS ARE ON?</h3><p>Yes, absolutely, those events are limited to specific areas of the Heath (particularly Kenwood). The rest of the Heath will be ‘open’ as usual.</p><h3>WILL THE HEATH BE OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY / BANK HOLIDAYS / ANOTHER DAY I’M WORRIED ABOUT?</h3><p>Yes, many of the gates around the Heath never close - the Heath is always ‘open’.</p><h3>DO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE SEQUOIA (REDWOOD) TREE?</h3><p>Two people have asked me this and I am grateful to three of my readers who answered my call here for the answer! Ruth and Michael have both said it’s next to the Vale of Health pond - it’s a Coastal Redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, says Michael. However, another reader, Scott from the States, was looking out for it on his run through the Heath and believes he found one on the south west edge of Wood Pond (in the grounds of Kenwood). Perhaps there are two?</p><h3>CAN I ADVERTISE ON YOUR WEBSITE?</h3><p>Potentially, yes, just <a href="https://www.hampsteadheath.net/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
