        <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about supplementing another language to Python for some time – mainly to cope with areas Python struggles with, or is a pain to use (which I&#39;ll go over in a minute).</p><p>I had used C/C++ some years ago, but don&#39;t want to go back to them. C is great for embedded work, but I wouldn&#39;t use it for anything else. C++ is a monster, everything from<em> C-with-classes</em> to whatever the latest version is with fancy new smart pointers.</p><p>I looked at Rust, and while I understand the sentiment and reasoning, I felt I was constantly fighting the compiler/borrow checker/whatever. I just want to write some code, dammit :)</p><p>I had heard of Go for many years, but never stuck with it; it gets constant negative press on Hacker News/Reddit– every top post is: <em>Why I gave up G</em>o with reason 37 being iT dOesNT hAve gEneRIcs (yes, we got generics this year, I want to put in a rude joke about virgins and not enough sex but I guess I&#39;m a family-friendly / my new employer-friendly blog now).</p><p>Last few months, I slowly picked up Go again, and this time stuck with it.</p><h3 id="problems-with-python">Problems with Python</h3><p>I have <a href="https://new.pythonforengineers.com/blog/python-in-2021-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">written about this before </a>(and gotten hate), but let me give the tldr:</p><ul><li>Python code is great if you control the machine. It&#39;s a pain if you want to share your code with others</li></ul><p>That&#39;s it– my main complaint. Sharing your code is even pain with colleagues even if they are using the same operating system, mainly because the Python requirement file doesn&#39;t pin dependencies, which means 2 people installing from the same requirements file can get different dependency versions (that said, Poetry fixes this problem, and is an awesome tool. I&#39;m never using plain virtual envs every again).</p><p>A few months ago, I rediscovered Go (using the great <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36800891-head-first-go">Head First Go</a> book) and rediscovered the joy of Go.</p><h3 id="go-the-good">Go: The Good</h3><ul><li>The code just works! You can compile for any platform (like compile for Windows from a Linux machine) and have it just work without messing with virtual environments or installing libraries</li><li>It is fast– no doubt, mainly because it&#39;s a compiled language.</li><li>Unlike Python web apps, which need Wsgi (or something similar) in addition to Nginx, Go apps can run directly on a server with nothing extra needed. I did use a server for https, but the tool I used (Caddy, a great tool) comes with a Go library so you can get https directly in your Go code!</li></ul><h3 id="go-the-bad">Go: The Bad</h3><p>Sometimes, you just want to try some code or a new library. You don&#39;t care about it being perfect.</p><p>But Go has a very <em>school-teacher-like </em>attitude to this– the smallest warning (unused import) and your code won&#39;t compile. Everything must be perfect, all i&#39;s dotted and t&#39;s crossed.</p><p>The libraries for Go aren&#39;t as good as for Python– certainly, the documentation is lacking. For Python, you can find a dozen good libraries for anything you can think of; with Go, as soon as you get off the main <em>Server coding Highway</em>, libraries are hard to find, often abandoned, and usually without good docs.</p><p>I especially struggled with the DynamoDb library for Go; so much so I wrote a Python script to query Dynamodb, and called it from Go. However, that might be due to poor documentation on Amazon&#39;s side. That said, the official Python libs for Dynamo weren&#39;t that hot either, but I did find great 3rd party libs that worked. And that&#39;s my point: This is easier for Python than Go.</p><p><em>Minor quibble</em>: I found the Go mod system confusing, but that just may be my own inexperience. I hate how it forces to you create a module everytime. I just want to try something out, why are you forcing me to create a module o_O</p><p>There is a way to turn if off but  it is non-intuitive and I only found it by chance.</p><h3 id="final-words">Final Words</h3><p>Overall, I really like Go– it&#39;s a great companion to Python. I die a little when I have to install a library, and it wants me to install Python or Node, as I know I&#39;ll be struggling with versions. Node is worse, as I find I have to constantly change the Node versions to get libs to work, they all seem to be built with different versions.</p><p>Compared to this, Go programs are a joy. One executable, and it just executes without you having to jump thru hoops. </p><p>If I ever build a tool I need more than 2 people to use, I would prefer Go. Go just works.</p>
