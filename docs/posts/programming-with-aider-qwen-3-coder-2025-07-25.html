<p>I only used it for part of a day, but I literally spent a total of $0.10 on Q3C
to do 5 small tasks for about 300 lines of changes.</p>

<p>As far as I can recall it didn&#39;t take much back-and-forth or prompt tweaking to
get those tasks done, but I didn&#39;t keep clear notes.g</p>

<p>It&#39;s so slow that several times I thought it was hung.
Like, waiting minutes for anything at all. Maybe it was just a bad day?</p>
<p>I first suspected, based on the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-coder/providers" rel="nofollow">provider status page</a> at the time,
that it was the Deepinfra provider
struggling, since I seemed to get automatically routed there (at the time of writing this it
was by far the cheapest provider), and they seemed a bit on fire.</p>
<p>But even after I removed that provider from my config, I got very slow
responses; sometimes 5-10 minutes to respond with a 50-line diff.</p>
<p>At one point, I hit <code>Ctrl-C</code> and said &#34;looks like you were hung, try again&#34;; I&#39;m
not sure, but this <em>may</em> have been what got us into a state where it nuked most of the
content of the file it was trying to work on, and committed that (without asking
me)! It took me a minute to realize that had happened and get the code back...</p>
<p>Overall, Q3C seems to do a fine job at tasks where I&#39;m content to walk away and
do something else while it works, or even go to sleep and see what happened in
the morning.</p>
<p>But for interactive use, it&#39;s just not usable.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a (blurry) ~ 6 minute demo gif, where I told it to fix a github issue (about adding
permalinks to various parts of a SPWA). 
I actually manually paused this recording many times while nothing was visually
updating... the actual elapsed time was about 20 minutes!</p>
