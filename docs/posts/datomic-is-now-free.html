			<p><em>27 April 2023</em></p>

			<p>Nubank is excited to announce today that we are making all editions of Datomic available free of licensing fees. The Datomic binaries are being released under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0</a> license and will be readily available for direct download and use via Maven Central - no signup required. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-otb76awcrb7aa?ref=vdr_rf">Datomic Cloud</a> will be available on AWS Marketplace with no additional software cost.</p>
<p>We are doing this to make Datomic more useful to more people in more situations, and look forward to expanding the Datomic and Clojure community as a result.</p>
