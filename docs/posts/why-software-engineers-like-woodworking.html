    <h1>Why software engineers like woodworking</h1>

						<p>The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool. My toddler was happily sanding her own block off to the side.</p><p>Woodworking was a new hobby I&#39;d picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly.</p><p>A surprise <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-Junior-Workbench-Workshop-Realistic/dp/B0016DE80I">gift</a> laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices. It was time to rekindle the flame.</p><p>A few youtube videos and a HomeDepot run later, it was time to pause my side coding projects and foray into a new world.</p><p>Except it wasn&#39;t that different from the old one! </p><p>Woodworking felt strangely familiar. Even its dopamine hits triggered the same spots that programming would.</p><p>Turns out, the best parts of woodworking aren&#39;t actually that different from software engineering:</p><p>The best software engineering moments are when you building your own tools. That&#39;s work with purpose.</p><p>Woodworkers do it too. They call such tools &#34;jigs&#34;.  Some jigs might be built to meet niche needs (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1tqN65yRaQ">drilling straight holes</a>). Others, just to save money.</p><p>As always, you have to decide what&#39;s the value of your engineering time.</p><p>There are mind boggling varieties of woodworking tools out there, each optimized for a slightly different situation. Want to saw wood with the grain? Against the grain? Need a quick but ugly cut? Need a smooth cut and don&#39;t mind it taking longer? What about curved cuts? And that&#39;s just for saws! </p><p>Each one is optimized for a specific use case, but unless you have an infinite budget you&#39;ll need to decide which ones are actually required for what you want to do.</p><p>Anyone who&#39;s had to choose a storage layer on AWS knows what it&#39;s like to understand your tools, figure out what they&#39;re best for, and which one most closely matches your needs.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="880" height="668" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png 880w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="3-finite-non-monetary-budget">3. Finite (non-monetary) Budget</h2><p>Money isn&#39;t the only thing you budget. </p><p>Any limited resource needs to carefully doled out. With software, the budgets might cover hardware constraints (CPU/memory), networking bandwidth, latency targets, engineering man-hours, etc.</p><p>Turns out, there&#39;s one inflexible budget with woodworking: Physical space!</p><p>There&#39;s only so much room in my garage (even after I cleaned it). Whatever tools I get have to fit in there along with my work bench. I have to be really picky about what I spend my storage budget on, and some beloved items, like a razor sharp table saw, are simply not possible.</p><h2 id="4-design-first-build-later">4. Design first, build later</h2><p>In both worlds, sketching out your designs before building pays huge dividends. You get a clearer picture of what you&#39;ll make and you figure out how the different parts will interact.</p><p>Otherwise, you might have to throw away days worth of work because you took a slightly wrong turn.</p><h2 id="5-waiting">5. Waiting<br/></h2><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/compiling.png" alt="Compiling" loading="lazy" width="413" height="360"/></figure><p>Except with woodworking, you yell &#34;The glue&#39;s drying!&#34;</p><p>On the plus side, it lets you work on multiple projects at once.</p><h2 id="6-you-have-users-">6. You have Users!</h2><p>Once my wife learned of my plans, the requests for custom pieces started rolling in.  Knowing that whatever I build has an eager recipient awaiting it is rocket fuel for motivation.</p><p>And since it&#39;s my wife asking for it, it&#39;s easier to justify buying the tools I &#34;need&#34;.</p><h2 id="one-big-difference">One big difference</h2><p>With woodworking you actually get to hold your creations.</p><h2 id="intrigued">Intrigued?</h2><p>Woodworking has the same highs as software engineering (and even more if you spend enough time around glue).</p><p>You get the same fast feedback loops, close interaction with your users, while avoiding some of the more tedious aspects of software engineering. Plus you&#39;re never on-call.</p><p>I can see why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/2mu7i4/how_many_of_you_guys_have_quit_your_day_job_to/cm7pppq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">these</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24541964">guys</a> gave up software. </p><p>That&#39;s not my path though, programming is too near to my heart and my day job lets me do more than <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/">just write code</a>.</p><p>But it does help answer a question I&#39;ve asked myself a lot:</p><p><em>What would I do if I was born a hundred years ago, before computers were invented?</em></p><p>And the answer is now clear:</p><p>Find something to build.</p><p><em>I write a weekly <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/newsletter/">newsletter</a> sharing insights on how to leverage lessons from across industries to become a better software engineer.
