    <h1>Linux on the Fujitsu Lifebook U729</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This post describes my experience using Linux on the <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/my/products/computing/pc/ap/notebooks/lifebook-u729/">Fujitsu Lifebook
U729</a>. The tl;dr is that it’s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs
flawlessly, and all the hardware things I’ve needed run OOTB. The only
difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it,
which I explain below.</p>

<p>From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I
broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it
as a desktop most of the time, this didn’t affect me much. After some
flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and
more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it’s the 2000s,
when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space,
rather than following everyone around.</p>

<p>Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers—a
Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a
desktop—and none of them were portable. When I went to <a href="https://rustforgeconf.com/">RustForge 2025</a> I
just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo
night or math club or some such, I didn’t have a laptop to bring with me.</p>

<p>So I needed a new laptop. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Tahoe">Tahoe release</a> of macOS was so ugly
(see e.g. <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1968813221025865868">1</a>, <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1979654314244403272">2</a>, <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1971719256980312211">3</a>) it made me boot up the old Linux
desktop, and start playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS">NixOS</a> again. And I fell in love
with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it
affords you.</p>

<p>So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/x1-extreme-g4/22tp2x1x1e4">ThinkPad X1</a> some years ago and it was
terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its
price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly,
I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop.</p>

<p>The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for
250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops should be small and
lightweight. But the thing that got me, in all honesty, was the brand. “Fujitsu
laptop” sounds like colour in a William Gibson novel: “crawling into the
avionics bay, Case took out a battered Fujitsu refurb, and stuck a JTAG port in
the flight computer—”. I already use NixOS and a <a href="https://elecomusa.com/products/deft-trackball-wireless-copy">trackball</a> and a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07B8J6C3C">mechanical keyboard</a>, so a laptop that’s even more obscure than a
ThinkPad is perfect for me. And it was only 250 AUD. So I got it.</p>

<p>The only problem I had was disabling Secure Boot in order to install
Linux. Otherwise: I love it. It’s small and lightweight, feels solid, the
keyboard is good, all the hardware works out of the box with NixOS, and the
battery life is pretty good.</p>



<p>This section describes the problems I encountered.</p>

<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>

<p>I tried to install Linux the usual way, when I was greeted by this:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/secureboot.webp" alt="A photograph of the laptop screen showing an error message, red text on white: &#39;secure boot is failed **access denied**&#39;."/></p>

<p>Going into the BIOS, the option to disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot">Secure Boot</a> was greyed out. I
tried a bunch of random bullshit: wiping the TPM, disabling the TPM. That didn’t
work.</p>

<p>What did work was this:</p>

<p>First, install Windows 11. This came with the laptop. And the installation makes
installing Linux feel easy: I had to do so many weird tricks to avoid having to
create an account with Microsoft during the installation.</p>

<p>Once Windows is installed, go into Windows Update. Under “Advanced Options &gt;
Optional Updates”, there should be an option to install Fujitsu-specific
drivers. Install those. And for good measure, do a general Windows update.</p>

<p>There should be a program called DeskUpdate on the Desktop. This is the Fujitsu
BIOS update tool. Run this and go through the instructions: this should update
the BIOS (the ordering seems to be important: first update the Fujitsu firmware
through Windows Update, then the BIOS through DeskUpdate).</p>

<p>Reboot and go into the BIOS (F2). You should have a new BIOS version. In my
case, I went from BIOS 2.17 to 2.31 which was released on 2025-03-28:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/bios.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing BIOS version information."/></p>

<p>You now have the option to disable Secure Boot:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/secureboot-disable.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing the option to disable Secure Boot."/></p>

<p>After this, I was able to install NixOS from a live USB:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/nixos.webp" alt="A photograph of the laptop, showing the NixOS installer."/></p>

<h2 id="spyware">Spyware</h2>

<p>The laptop comes with this corporate spyware thing called <a href="https://www.absolute.com/platform/persistence">Absolute
Persistence</a>. It’s some anti-theft tracking device. Since the Lifebook is
typically an enterprise laptop, it makes sense that it comes with this type of
thing.</p>

<p>I only noticed this because I was searching the BIOS thoroughly for a way to
disable Secure Boot. The good news is disabling it is pretty straightforward:
you just disable it in the BIOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/ap.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing the Absolute Persistence options."/></p>

<p>As I understand it, Absolute Persistence requires an agent running in the OS, so
the BIOS support, by itself, doesn’t do anything once disabled.</p>



<p>The following work flawlessly OOTB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WiFi</li>
  <li>Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Sound (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PipeWire">PipeWire</a>)</li>
  <li>Display brightness control (using <a href="https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl">brightnessctl</a>)</li>
  <li>Touchscreen (I didn’t realize the screen was actually a touchscreen until I
touched it by accident and saw the mouse move)</li>
  <li>Webcam (not winning any awards on quality, but it works)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I have not tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microphone</li>
  <li>Fingerprint sensor</li>
</ul>



<p>To enter the BIOS: smash <code>F2</code> until you hear the beep. No need to hold down the
<code>Fn</code> key.</p>

<p>To enter the boot menu: as above but with <code>F12</code>.</p>
