    <h1>Tell HN: My early access eBook over iOS made $120k in 1 year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hey HN -<p>I mostly stay in the shadows here, but for the one year anniversary of my first (ebook project)[1] I figured I&#39;d write a blurb in case it&#39;s interesting to anyone.</p><p>I&#39;m terrible at launching things, and take years to ship my own apps. After my last app was acquired, I wanted to fulfill a &#34;moon shot&#34; goal of mine - write a book in any form. I settled on adapting one of my more popular [blog posts][2] that I keep updated through each version of iOS into a five book series (one for each topic of accessibility, design, UX, APIs and a catch all bonus one). So far it has sold 1,534 copies and has made over $124,000. Now that things have settled, it makes about $2k a month on average.</p><p>I learned from my own launch history and decide to launch it in &#34;early access&#34;, otherwise I&#39;d never finish it. Launching it went great and was a day I&#39;ll never forget, as to that point - I had never made close to that much money in one day.</p><p>CONS:
It&#39;s not all rainbows and sunshine though. I used to read posts like this and my heart rate would shoot up, thinking &#34;What the heck - I could do that too!&#34; and make some good money. While it is true that the project has been great for me financially (I have a stay at home wife and three kids), honestly life is not any different. I just save most of it, spend it on the 1,000 school activities my kids have or whatever life throws at me. I didn&#39;t make any splurge purchase.</p><p>I&#39;ve also realized the real, grating reality of opportunity cost. At the one year mark, this book series is only half way done. I can&#39;t put into words how much I miss making software, because now - all I do is write. That has been my main takeaway through all of this - your time is valuable, and I cosigned a ton of mine away the moment I decided to embark on this.</p><p>PROS:
On the positive side, I get messages from people starting out on iOS and veterans alike who are really enjoying the books. It&#39;s hard to put into words how motivating that is, to fell like you are doing a tiny little thing that somewhat matters to some people. I also love teaching and writing, so the project does appeal to me - but I&#39;ve learned I need a better balance. When I shipped apps, all I wanted to do was write. Now, the opposite is true.</p><p>Anyways, if you are considering launching a digital downloads type of product, I&#39;d say go for it. Tech-wise, it was trivial to get started:</p><p>Gumroad for sales
Netlify for deploys
Made the site from scratch using Tailwind
Ulysses to write</p><p>I think in a world where there is a lot of &#34;grifting&#34; going on with courses, ebooks, etc - you can actually stand out if you stick to your word and show authenticity. For example, I promised updates every two weeks - and I&#39;ve stuck to that, a year in.</p><p>TL&#39;DR:
Launching your own thing and making money is neat, but at the end of the day life doesn&#39;t really change at all. Consider your time investments. Try to truly help people.</p><p>Happy to answer any questions if you have any.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.bestinclassiosapp.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.bestinclassiosapp.com</a>
