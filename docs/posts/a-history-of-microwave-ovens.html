<p>People started seriously thinking about heating things with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency">radio</a> waves
<a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">circa 1940</a>.</p>

<p>Some molecules (notably water) are tiny magnets. Waves and magnets interact in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism">spooky ways</a>. Certain radio
wave frequencies cause molecules to spin; spin is angular velocity is kinetic
energy is heat. Many smart people call this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating">&#34;dielectric heating&#34;</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of cool radar technology (e.g. the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>) was
developed for WWII. After the war, some military technology was reimagined for
commercial/domestic use.</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/Raytheon%20model%201132.jpg" alt="Raytheon model 1132"/></p>
<p><strong>1947:</strong> The Radarange 1132 was the first commercially available microwave
oven. That behemoth provided 1600W output
<a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">via a water-cooled permanent-magnet magnetron</a> -- obviously
not a domestic machine.</p>
<p>But Raytheon&#39;s basic idea was simple: put food in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">Faraday cage</a> and blast it with 2.4
GHz radio waves to spin the water molecules.</p>

<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2540036A/en?q=(microwave+oven+door)&amp;assignee=raytheon&amp;before=priority:19600101"><img src="https://taylor.town/US2540036-drawings-page-1.png" alt="Percy Spencer&#39;s 1948 patent for &#34;food cooking&#34;"/></a></p>
<p>At the time, it wasn&#39;t clear if dielectric heating was a good fit for food.
Wetter foods cook at higher intensities, which is surprisingly unintuitive. Even
worse, regions of non-homogeneous foods (i.e. mostly everything) cook unevenly,
which is generally undesired behavior in culinary arts.</p>

<p>General Electric was secretly in the kitchen too, experimenting with similar
technology at lower frequencies (~915 MHz).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics">Due to science,</a> longer
wavelengths penetrate deeper, but shorter wavelengths carry more energy. To be
specific, Raytheon&#39;s 2,450 MHz penetrates ~1.5cm, while GE&#39;s 0.915 GHz
penetrates ~4cm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the FCC was establishing a frequency allocation procedure, Raytheon
and GE both petitioned the FCC for a microwave-oven frequency-Raytheon
favoring S-band or 2450, and GE L-Band/UHF or 915 MHz. It was argued by
Raytheon that the higher frequency permitted better coupling to small loads
like a frankfurter and the greater number of modes in a given cavity permitted
better randomization (uniformity) of heating patterns. GE argued the
advantages of penetration and less thermal runaway in defrosting. The net
result was the allocation of two frequencies by FCC, 915+25 MHz and 2450+50.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">A History of Microwave Heating Applications</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, it turned out that 2.4GHz devices were cheap to manufacture and worked
great for food (even when frozen). Today, all consumer microwaves ovens use
2.4GHz, but many industries still use 915MHz ovens for specific applications
that demand longer wavelengths.</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/Radarange%201161.png" alt="Radarange 1161"/></p>
<p><strong>1954</strong>: The Radarange 1161 is 1600W like the previous model, but now
completely air-cooled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The air in commercial kitchens is usually hot, grease laden, and frequently
full of lint. … Cooling air, therefore, is drawn in at the front, where the
air is most apt to be cool and free of grease … and forced over the
electrical components and out through openings in the back of the cabinet.</p>

<p>Microwaves cook meat well. At the time of writing, you, dear reader, are
unfortunately
<a href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">made of meat</a>.
It is therefore of utmost importance that the box keeps microwaves inside the
box, while also offering a convenient door to open the box.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cooking chamber is similar to a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from
coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal
contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act
like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent
leakage.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an additional layer of protection, opening the oven oven door breaks the
magnetron&#39;s power circuit. This pretty much guarantees that microwaves stay
inside the metal box, where they belong.</p>
<p>Speaking of heating meat--</p>

<p>Meanwhile, weird microwave experiments
<a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">continued throughout the fifties</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They ranged from economically unfeasible applications, like sterilization of
soil, through many food applications, like blanching mushrooms, to specialized
jobs, like warming frozen horse serum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, sorry, back to the ovens.</p>
<p>Note that in 1954 the microwave oven already has a nifty window for creeping on
your food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of
conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding.
Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the
microwaves&#39; wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation
cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter
wavelength) can.</p>

<p><img src="https://taylor.town/radarange-mar-1955-popular-electronics-3.jpg" alt="Radarange 1170"/></p>
<p><strong>1955:</strong> The Radarange 1170 is a 800W air-cooled countertop model.</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/radarange-diagram.jpg" alt="Radarange diagram"/></p>

<p>By the mid 1950s, the major components of the modern microwave oven have been
established: it&#39;s a ~2.4GHz magnetron plus wave-scatterers on a ventilated metal
box with a fancy door.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.si.edu/es/object/nmah_1088040"><img src="https://taylor.town/Tappan%20RL-1.jpg" alt="Tappan RL-1"/></a></p>

<p><strong>1955:</strong> With Raytheon&#39;s licensed technology, the Tappan RL-1 became the first
consumer microwave oven on the market
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-brief-history-of-the-microwave-oven">for $1,295</a>
(~$15k today).</p>

<p>But what&#39;s with the extra knobs?</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/more%20Tappan%20RL-1.jpg" alt="more Tappan RL-1"/></p>

<p>The RL-1 had a &#34;browning element&#34; AKA &#34;thing that gets really hot&#34; AKA &#34;broiler&#34;
AKA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilling">upside-down grill</a>.</p>

<p>As intuition suggests, microwaves rarely brown/caramelize foods. This is because
microwave ovens do not excite water molecules hot enough to produce
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard reactions</a> (and other
chemistry).</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just water -- microwaves
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven">make fats/oils really hot</a>.
Dishes with sufficient fat content can emulate some oil-based browning methods.</p>

<p><img src="https://taylor.town/R-10.jpg" alt="Sharp R-10"/></p>
<p><strong>1962:</strong> Sharp mass-produces the R-10, their first major microwave oven.</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/Sharp%20R-600.jpg" alt="Sharp R-600"/></p>
<p><strong>1966:</strong> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/microwave-oven">For only ¥200K</a> (~$6k USD
today), the Sharp R-600 is the first microwave oven with a spinning plate to
heat food more uniformly.</p>

<p>To this day, that spinning plate remains a hot debate. Luckily, you can compare
ovens&#39; spinning/stirring strategies with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FhwTelc5Tg">thermal paper</a> and/or
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/appliance-science-experiments-mapping-your-microwave-hot-spots/">toast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave oven can be mapped out
by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven: When the water-saturated
paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause
the dye to be darkened which can provide a visual representation of the
microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a
sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many
store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily
done at home.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>1965:</strong> Raytheon acquires Amana Refrigeration to manufacture a consumer
microwave oven for the US market. With the help of New Japan Radio Company,
Raytheon <a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">prototyped a cheap magnetron</a> for use in the new
ovens.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/hot-food-fast-home-microwave-oven-turns-50-180962545/"><img src="https://taylor.town/Amana%20RR-1.jpg.webp" alt="Amana RR-1"/></a></p>
<p><strong>1967:</strong>
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-brief-history-of-the-microwave-oven">For $495</a>
(~$4.5k adj.), the Amana RR-1 is an overwhelming success.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the oven&#39;s adoption incurred many accidents. Although &#34;you
can&#39;t put metal in the microwave&#34; has now attained meme status, it was very
unintuitive at the time (and remains easy to forget).</p>

<p>In reality,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven">you <em>can</em> put metal in the microwave</a>,
but you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for
example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking.
Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microwave_metal_shelf.JPG">(see illustration)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond being a fire hazard, many people feared the microwave oven for leaking
harmful radiation.</p>
<p><strong>1968:</strong> Congress passes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Control_for_Health_and_Safety_Act_of_1968">the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll spare you <a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">the boring details</a> -- microwave ovens were
doled stringent constraints, and <a href="https://taylor.town/microwaves.pdf">10%-30% of older models</a> had
to be retrofitted to comply with the new law. This harmed public opinion of
microwave ovens and their manufacturers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While uncommon today, combination microwave-ranges were offered by major
appliance manufacturers through much of the 1970s as a natural progression of
the technology. Both Tappan and General Electric offered units that appeared
to be conventional stove top/oven ranges, but included microwave capability in
the conventional oven cavity. Such ranges were attractive to consumers since
both microwave energy and conventional heating elements could be used
simultaneously to speed cooking, and there was no loss of countertop space.
The proposition was also attractive to manufacturers as the additional
component cost could better be absorbed compared with countertop units where
pricing was increasingly market-sensitive.</p>

<p><img src="https://taylor.town/more%20Amana%20RR-4D.jpg" alt="more Amana RR-4D"/></p>
<p><strong>1974:</strong> The Amana RR-4D is the first microwave oven with an &#34;auto-defrost&#34;
mode, which switches the magnetron on/off every few seconds.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice">solid water molecules</a> are
practically immune to dielectric heating at this frequency, it&#39;s better to use
lower power for longer durations. This causes the excited water to
slowly/uniformly thaw neighboring ice and eventually slow-cook the whole meal.</p>
<p>But why does the magnetron switch on/off to achieve &#34;lower power&#34;? It&#39;s all
about photons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody shares the same airspace. Government agencies (e.g. FCC) coerce
manufacturers into cooperative strategies that minimize photon pollution.</li>
<li>Microwave oven manufacturers are only allowed to use specific photon
power-levels (e.g. 2450MHz).</li>
<li>Power is &#34;energy-per-second&#34;. To make a lower-power &#34;defrost&#34; mode with those
assigned photons, engineers simply have to send fewer photons per second.</li>
<li>Historically, the cheapest/easiest way to tune photons-per-second has been to
switch the magnetron on/off at different intervals. This remains true until
the introduction of <em>inverters</em> -- but more on that later.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/Amana%20RR-6.jpg" alt="Amana RR-6"/></p>
<p><strong>1975:</strong> The Amana RR-6 is the first microwave oven with a digital interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://taylor.town/corning-browning.jpeg" alt="CorningWare microwave dish"/></p>
<p><strong>1977:</strong> The popularity of the microwave spawned secondary markets for
specialized tools and methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made by Corning Glass Works for Amana, they had browning surfaces coated with
tin oxide. The dishes had to be preheated empty in the Radarange. The coating
would absorb the microwaves, causing the surface to become hot and turn
yellow. Food pressed onto these surfaces would brown in 1 to 2 minutes, and
then you’d flip it to brown the other side. Sure, you could achieve the same
results in a skillet on your stove, but you have to admire the ingenuity at
work here.</p>
<p>Included in all the cookware booklets are recipes. I love experimenting with
recipes from old cookbooks, but some of these seem like a stretch. Would you
really use your Amana Radarange Popcorn Popper to make popcorn, which you then
grind up and add to meatloaf, which you then cook in your Amana Radarange?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A variant of the conventional microwave oven is the convection microwave oven.
A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave oven and
a convection oven. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned
or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwave ovens are more
expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwave
ovens—those with exposed heating elements—can produce smoke and burning odors
as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating
elements. Some ovens use high speed air; these are known as impingement ovens
and are designed to cook food quickly in restaurants, but cost more and
consume more power.</p>

<p><strong>2009:</strong> Panasonic&#39;s inverter tech turns the microwave oven world
<em>upside-down</em>! Improvements to the magnetron power supply enable the oven to
more consistently heat foods at lower power levels (i.e. defrosting).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inverter means it uses a solid state switching power supply to control the
magnetron vs the old steel core transformer and a relay. An older microwave
can only switch the full power ON/OFF with slow (10s of seconds) variable duty
cycle (ratio of on/off time) whereas the inverter can vary the output power in
smaller gradients which has a less detrimental effect to foods with thin skins
or constrained areas (like eggs). The result is less popping, bursting,
spitting and splatter, fewer hot spots.</p>

<p>One downside of inverters is that they thoroughly trounce nearby Wi-Fi networks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conventional transformer ovens do not operate continuously over the mains
cycle, but can cause significant slowdowns for many metres around the oven,
whereas inverter-based ovens can stop nearby networking entirely while
operating.</p>

<p><strong>2015:</strong>
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7173133">Advances in solid-state RF technology</a>
prompt a new wave of sleek concept ovens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solid-state microwave ovens offer improved energy distribution and cooking
precision compared to magnetron-powered ovens. Frequency agility allows for
more uniform energy distribution across the load by using frequency variations
of ±50 MHz around 2.45 GHz, optimizing energy patterns. In multichannel
systems with multiple power amplifiers and antennas, phase shifters modify the
field distribution for greater homogeneity. Both frequency and phase agility
adjust RF power to match load conditions, ensuring high efficiency (over 90%)
even for small loads. High-resolution RF power control prevents overcooking,
especially for delicate foods, and forward/reflected power measurement enables
precise energy delivery and consistent cooking results.</p>

<p><strong>2017:</strong> Panasonic brings back browning elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some foods cooked in a microwave can have soft, soggy crusts. The Panacrunch
Pan accessory crisps and browns pizzas, quiches, pies, and breaded products
like a conventional oven. The Panasonic Panacrunch Pan works in three ways: it
heats the pan by absorbing microwaves, heats the food directly with
microwaves, and heats the food through the grill. The pan’s base absorbs
microwaves and transfers them into heat, which is then conducted to the food.
The non-stick surface maximizes the heating effect.</p>

<p>The source (oscillator) energy is then amplified using Laterally Diffused
Metal Oxide Semiconductor (LDMOS) technology to a level of approximately 300
watts (54.8 dBm). A Smart Tuning Unit (STU) adjusts the operation of the unit
to best match the properties of the selected food within the defrost chamber.</p>

<p><strong>2018:</strong> Amazon sells a very affordable microwave with voice-controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The microwave does simplify things enough so you can say, “Alexa, microwave
one potato” or walk over to the microwave, tap the button, and say, “one
potato.” Alexa will say, “Okay,” and the microwave will automatically be set
for six minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>… The difference is that a normal microwave will ask how heavy your potato
is, but Alexa strangely doesn’t ask.</p>
<p>Amazon’s microwave also has a popcorn replenishment feature you can opt into
that’s powered by the company’s Dash service. You can set how many bags of
popcorn you have at home, and Alexa will note when you’ve microwaved a bag of
popcorn and deduct the count, prompting an automatic shipment of popcorn to
the address you’ve selected.</p>

<p><img src="https://taylor.town/midea.jpg" alt="Midea-made microwaves dominate the US market."/></p>
<p><strong>2020:</strong> NYT publishes a viral story about Midea-manufactured microwaves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We confirmed w/ Midea that it makes &amp; sells Toshiba, Comfee, &amp; Black+Decker
ovens. We’re also confident that GE, Whirlpool, Breville, Insignia, &amp; others
also sell microwaves that were built &amp; likely designed by Midea, though all
parties that we contacted declined to comment.</p>
<p>Galanz (a 30-min drive away from Midea) has a big foothold worldwide, but a
small share of the US market</p>
<p>LG &amp; Samsung make their own microwaves</p>
<p>Panasonic makes its own mid-range &amp; high-end units, but budget models seem to
be made by Midea</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, NYT&#39;s tweets were not investigative -- Midea&#39;s production volume
was already notable in the 1990s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Midea, which started producing microwave ovens in 1999, had seized 9.5 per
cent of the market share by the end of 2001, joining the country&#39;s top three
in the sector.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the China Household Electrical Appliances
Association, in the first four months of the year, Galanz led the market with
a share of 56 per cent, with LG following next with 23 per cent.</p>
<p>US brand Whirlpool announced in April it would move its two microwave oven
product lines from Sweden to Shunde, a city in Guangdong Province, and
increase investment by US$6 million to expand its annual production volume in
Shunde from 1.3 million sets to 2 million sets.</p>
