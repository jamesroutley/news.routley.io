    <h1>Show HN: VSC â€“ An open source 3D Rendering Engine in C&#43;&#43;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">&#34;I might have to wait, I&#39;ll never give up. I guess it&#39;s half timing, and the other half is luck...&#34; -Michael Buble</p>
<p dir="auto">VSC (VOUGA-SHREINER-CANTH) Verified is A real-time 3D rendering engine written entirely using software with the intention of being portable.
Inspired by DoomGeneric with its rather novel approach to separating the backend from the frontend.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a rasterizer. It uses computational techniques to approximate the reality of lights, shadows, textures, and materials.</p>

<p dir="auto">Everything in here is based on the book Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics (Third Edition) by Eric Lengyel, as well as various other resources including CS354H (UT Austin Computer Graphics Honors) and other online resources on graphics.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mathematics for 3d Game Programming will be dubbed as the &#34;Skeleton Book&#34; because of its cover. All files were written primarily by NormalExisting using the Skeleton Book (et al.) as basis and inspiration.</p>

<p dir="auto">Etienne Vouga (Graphics Professor at UT Austin, some of his teachings influences this work)</p>
<p dir="auto">VSC Verified is a community-made level created and completed (&#34;verified&#34;) by player nSwish in the game Geometry Dash, intended to be a joke but also happens to be extremely challenging. It uses the song &#34;Haven&#39;t Met You Yet&#34; by Michael Buble as the background music, and requires several perfectly timed inputs to various rhythms presented by the song.</p>

<p dir="auto">Look in the <code>examples</code> folder for some example runner code. Or you can modify <code>main.cpp</code> as the runner. The Makefile provided is a template that builds and runs <code>main.cpp</code> and then the <code>render.py</code> which renders the contents of the output buffer (The buffer to render is to be specified in <code>render.py</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also code in <code>ESP32</code> that makes this compatible with your ESP32.</p>
<p dir="auto">Be aware that the API is constantly changing as this is in development. However the changes should not need to be too severe.</p>

<p dir="auto">Follow the Skeleton book until the end of chapter 5. Some linear algebra background is recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is a document named <code>NOTES.md</code> that holds notes that might be useful. It&#39;s like playing a game of Super Metroid.</p>
