<p>Austrian rail operator OeBB on Saturday unveiled its new generation of sleeper trains—a response to demands from travelers for less pollutant alternatives to planes and petrol or diesel cars.
                                              </p>
                                                                                
<p>Night trains are starting to make a comeback in Europe thanks to their low-carbon footprint and after years of neglect, operators are now investing heavily to replace their aging rolling stock.
</p><p>State-owned OeBB, which operates 20 rail routes across Europe, has been a pioneer in reviving such services.
</p><p>The company has Europe&#39;s largest fleet of sleeper trains and hopes to double the number of its overnight passengers from 1.5 million to three million by 2030.
</p><p>The new trains feature a modern design, more privacy and more shower facilities.
</p><p>The first of 33—ordered from German conglomerate Siemens in 2018 for a total investment of 720 million euros ($760 million at current value)—will come into service on December 10.
</p><p>It will connect the Austrian cities of Vienna and Innsbruck to the German port of Hamburg.
</p><p>Between then and 2028, it will be phased in on other routes in Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
</p><p>&#34;France will have to wait a bit because this requires new approvals from the national railroad authority,&#34; OeBB CEO Andreas Matthae told AFP.
</p><p>&#34;Unfortunately, we are not yet a unified Europe in the railroad sector.&#34;
</p><p>Environment Minister Leonore Gewessler told AFP: &#34;Every kilometer (mile) by train is a kilometer for climate protection and... a contribution to a better future.&#34;
</p><p>Since 2018 OeBB said all its trains &#34;run on electricity generated exclusively by hydropower, solar and wind power... a milestone for climate protection in Austria&#34;
</p><p>&#34;I still remember the old sleeping coaches, which were so dark—the small window, the bunk beds and a curtain,&#34; said 69-year-old retiree Rosemarie, who declined to give her full name, as she examined OeBB&#39;s sleek new night train on Saturday.
</p><p>Compared to the old sleeper trains, &#34;this is crazy—pure luxury&#34;, she laughed.
</p><p>OeBB&#39;s Berlin-Paris night train service is to return on December 11, nine years after it was canceled.
