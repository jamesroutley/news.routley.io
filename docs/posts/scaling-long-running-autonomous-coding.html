<p><strong><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents">Scaling long-running autonomous coding</a></strong>. Wilson Lin at Cursor has been doing some experiments to see how far you can push a large fleet of &#34;autonomous&#34; coding agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post describes what we&#39;ve learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ended up running planners and sub-planners to create tasks, then having workers execute on those tasks - similar to how Claude Code uses sub-agents. Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.</p>
<p>In my predictions for 2026 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise">the other day</a> I said that by 2029:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose &#34;building a web browser from scratch&#34; as their test case for their agent swarm approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender">the source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with <a href="https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/">unsurprising skepticism</a>, especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.</p>
<p>It looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/README.md#build-requirements">latest README</a> includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
cd fastrender
git submodule update --init vendor/ecma-rs
cargo run --release --features browser_ui --bin browser
</code></pre>
<p>This got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:</p>
<p><img alt="The browser chrome is neat but has a garbled tab name at the top. The Google homepage looks mostly correct but the buttons are not styled correctly and the Google Search one has a huge plus icon floating near it." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-google.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="My blog looks mostly correct, but the right closing quotation mark on a quotation (which is implemented as a background image on the final paragraph) is displayed incorrectly multiple times." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/cursor-simonwillison.jpg"/></p>
<p>Honestly those are very impressive! You can tell they&#39;re not just wrapping an existing rendering engine because of those very obvious rendering glitches, but the pages are legible and look mostly correct.</p>
<p>The FastRender repo even uses Git submodules <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/tree/main/specs">to include various WhatWG and CSS-WG specifications</a> in the repo, which is a smart way to make sure the agents have access to the reference materials that they might need.</p>
<p>This is the second attempt I&#39;ve seen at building a full web browser using AI-assisted coding in the past two weeks - the first was <a href="https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave">HiWave browser</a>, a new browser engine in Rust first announced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1q4xfm0/over_christmas_break_i_wrote_a_fully_functional/">in this Reddit thread</a>.</p>
<p>When I made my 2029 prediction this is more-or-less the quality of result I had in mind. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see projects of this nature compete with Chrome or Firefox or WebKit any time soon but I have to admit I&#39;m very surprised to see something this capable emerge so quickly.</p>
