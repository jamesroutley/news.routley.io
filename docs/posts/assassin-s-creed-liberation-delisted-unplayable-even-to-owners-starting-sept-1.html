    <h1>Assassin’s Creed Liberation delisted, unplayable even to owners starting Sept 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you own <a href="https://mp1st.com/tag/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a> Liberation on Steam and have yet to finish it, you might want to do so soon, as the game isn’t just being delisted on the platform, it will even be inaccessible to everyone starting September 1!</p><p>This notice was posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/260210/Assassins_Creed_Liberation_HD/">Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD Steam page</a> where the following was posted:</p><p><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/1a4c0692339d269c6fda810d1904a3b4.png"/></p><p>Yep, this means that even if you already own the game, you won’t be able to play it on Steam to complete it, which sucks, given, y’know, people paid for the game and all. </p><p>While hardly the jewel in the franchise’s long list of releases, AC Liberation was originally released on the PlayStation Vita back in 2012, and ties into Assassin’s Creed 3. It featured a black female protagonist, which is a first for the franchise, and saw an HD re-release on consoles and PC in 2014. </p><p>Here’s a description of the game over on Steam:</p><blockquote><p>Introducing Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD, the striking chapter of the pre-American Revolution Assassin’s Creed saga which arrives for the first time on HD consoles and PC. With improved gameplay, a deeper story, and HD graphics, Liberation is an immersive and full Assassin’s Creed experience.</p></blockquote><p>This is yet another reason why owning digital games is frowned upon by some consumer groups, as you technically never own the game themselves given this thing can happen. While it’s fairly common for games to be delisted on digital storefronts, the title being unplayable completely is not. Let’s hope this isn’t the start of a trend, as it’ll seriously put a dent in anyone’s digital games library.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Ubisoft regarding this, and whether there’s a workaround planned or something. Also, whether the Assassin’s Creed 3 Remastered bundle that includes Liberation will be affected.</p><p>Thanks, !</p></div></div>
