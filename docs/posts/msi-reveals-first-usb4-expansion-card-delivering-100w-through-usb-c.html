 <p id="why-it-matters"><strong>Recap:</strong> Computex 2023 exhibitors have showcased forward-looking prototypes covering various areas of personal technology, such as Wi-Fi, cooling, and displays. MSI&#39;s exhibit featured an updated look at USB4 integration via PCIe, which could allow users to expand their charging and display connectivity options. </p>
 
 
 
 <p>MSI <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Rolls-Out-a-Series-of-New-Products-A-Strong-Showing-Starts-at-COMPUTEX-2023-141864">revealed</a> the world&#39;s first USB-4 add-in board at Computex this week. The PCIe expansion card includes two DisplayPort connections and two USB-C outputs, one of which can deliver up to 100W of power. Although the company did not demonstrate the MS-4489 in action, it stated that the primary USB-C port can deliver fast charging.</p>

<p>The 100W power output should be sufficient to charge some laptops, not to mention smaller devices such as tablets or handheld gaming consoles. TechPowerUp got a good look at the card at the event, revealing that the second USB-C port delivers 27W.</p>

<p>Both ports can transfer data at a rate of 40Gb/s, the standard specification for USB4 1.0 and Thunderbolt 3. MSI confirmed to <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/309532/msi-first-motherboard-maker-to-offer-usb4-add-in-card-with-100-w-usb-pd">TechPowerUp</a> that the MS-4489 uses the same host controller as Thunderbolt cards – ASMedia&#39;s ASM4242.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt and USB4 have been closely linked since the debut of USB4 1.0, which is based on Thunderbolt 3. Last year, both standards <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/96383-next-gen-thunderbolt-can-sometimes-reach-120gbps-like.html">showcased</a> their next-generation specifications, which should at least double their transfer speeds. USB4 2.0 and the as-yet unnamed next-generation Thunderbolt can deliver 80Gb/s in both directions. However, the latter also has the option to transmit at 120Gb/s while receiving at 40Gb/s.</p>

<p>MSI&#39;s new card receives power through a 6-pin connector, similar to a graphics card. Its physical PCIe slot is x8 but is only wired for x4. The high-power USB-C and DisplayPort connections should make the MS-4489 useful for those needing additional capacity for high-end display equipment.</p>

<p>Another notable product from the company at Computex is the new <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/98904-msi-showcases-new-prestige-16-laptops-powered-meteor.html">Prestige 16 laptop</a>, which provides an early glimpse of Intel&#39;s forthcoming Meteor Lake CPUs. While MSI did not specify which processor the system includes, it has 22 threads and could be the same processor that Intel showcased at the event.</p>

<p>Other bleeding-edge MSI exhibits include a new Z790 motherboard with Wi-Fi 7 support, a voice-changing application, a 6GB/s mesh router, new RTX 4060 Ti GPUs, a 49-inch 240Hz QD-OLED monitor (its resolution is unclear), and more. The company also showed off a PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD that, like <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/98901-adata-unveils-14gbs-ssd-enormous-liquid-cooling-system.html">Adata&#39;s new NeonStorm</a>, manages 12/10GB/s read/write speeds and includes a gigantic heatsink.</p>
