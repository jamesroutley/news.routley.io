But her legacy has lived on, and she continues to fascinate people worldwide.</p><p>&#34;It was one of the great <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/phenomena-science-cant-explain-2019-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">mysteries of the 20th century</a> and still now into the 21st century,&#34; Cochrane told The Journal. &#34;We&#39;re all hopeful that the mystery will be solved.&#34;</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><h2>The dateline theory</h2><p>Romeo believes he&#39;s taken a massive step toward answering vital questions surrounding the famous pilot&#39;s disappearance after scouring decades of clues and potential leads to her location, including the &#34;dateline theory.&#34;</p><p>The theory, which Romeo relied on partly to guide his search, suggests that when Earhart crossed over the international dateline during her 20-hour flight, her navigation system became inaccurate and misdirected her by about 60 miles, potentially leading to a tragic end.</p>
