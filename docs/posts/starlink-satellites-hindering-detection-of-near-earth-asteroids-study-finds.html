</figure> <p>Przemek Mr√≥z, a University of Warsaw astronomer and the study&#39;s lead author, said that Starlink satellites were responsible for 5,301 streaks on telescope imagery between November 2019 and September 2021 alone. </p> <p>He also explained how the number of &#34;twilight images&#34; affected rose from 0.5% to 20% between 2019 and 2021. </p> <p>&#34;We don&#39;t expect Starlink satellites to affect non-twilight images, but if the satellite constellation of other companies goes into higher orbits, this could cause problems for non-twilight observations,&#34; he said. </p> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>Given SpaceX&#39;s intention to continue expanding their Starlink fleet, astronomers predict that soon every twilight image from the ZTF will have at least one streak. </p> <p>In 2020, SpaceX responded to astronomers&#39; concerns by attaching visors to the new satellites. </p> <p>However, given the study&#39;s continued detection of streaks in 2021, that did little to quell the concerns. </p> <p><b><i>For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking </i></b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220120172234/https://www.dailystar.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/" target="_blank" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p> <reach-mpu data-ad-unit="mpu">  </reach-mpu> <reach-adyoulike data-ad-unit="adyoulike">  </reach-adyoulike> <section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true" data-istail="true">   </section> <reach-taboola data-ad-unit="taboola">  </reach-taboola> <reach-converse data-ad-unit="converse">  </reach-converse> <reach-adyoulike data-ad-unit="adyoulike">  </reach-adyoulike><!-- Article End--></div></div>
