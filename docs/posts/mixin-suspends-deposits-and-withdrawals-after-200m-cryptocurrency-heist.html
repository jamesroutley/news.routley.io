    <h1>Mixin suspends deposits and withdrawals after $200M cryptocurrency heist</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Mixin Network confirmd on Monday that it has &#34;temporarily suspended&#34; all deposit and withdrawal services after hackers broke into a database and stole about $200 million in funds from the Hong-Kong based cryptocurrency firm. </p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/MixinKernel/status/1706139175018529139">statement</a> posted on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, the digital biz said the incident happened early Saturday morning, when &#34;the database of Mixin Network&#39;s cloud service provider was attacked by hackers. After initial verification, the funds involved are approximately US$200 million.&#34;</p>
<p>Mixin, which is a decentralized exchange, did not identify the cloud service provider. </p>

    

<p>The statement said the firm had contacted Google and blockchain security company SlowMist to help with the investigation. SlowMist <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1706133260869468503">confirmed</a> its role, and the amount stolen, in a separate social media post. And Google-owned Mandiant confirmed to <em>The Register</em> that its incident responders were assisting with the cleanup.</p>

        


        

<p>&#34;After discussion and consensus among all nodes, these services will be reopened once the vulnerabilities are confirmed and fixed,&#34; the Mixin statement promised. &#34;During this period, transfers are not affected. Regarding how to deal with the lost assets, the Mixin team will announce the solution afterward.&#34;</p>
<p>The crypto firm also noted that Mixin founder Feng Xiaodong will discuss the breach in a Mandarin livestream on Monday, which will be summarized in English after the broadcast.</p>

        

<p>&#34;We will try our best to minimize the losses and deeply apologize for this,&#34; the cryptocurrency exchange said.</p>

</ul>
<p>Mixin&#39;s platform uses open-source software and its wallet supports 48 public blockchains, according to its website. It also claims a million users and about $1 billion in assets, although presumably less now.</p>
<p>The heist highlights &#34;inherent vulnerabilities&#34; in open-source banking, KnowBe4 Security Awareness Advocate James McQuiggan told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>&#34;With open-source banking, cybercriminals will always go after the money, whether a crypto or natural currency,&#34; McQuiggan said. &#34;When a breach occurs, the effects can run deep. Not only do they face immediate financial repercussions, but the damage focuses on the erosion of trust, which can take years to rebuild.&#34;</p>
<p>The Mixin intrusion comes about a week after Elliptic <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/how-the-lazarus-group-is-stepping-up-crypto-hacks-and-changing-its-tactics">blamed</a> North Korea&#39;s Lazarus Group for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/18/sk_hynix_vicechair_denies_selling/">$54 million CoinEx heist</a> against another Hong Kong exchange earlier this month. Over the previous 104 days, the criminals stole almost $240 million from five separate hacks, according to the blockchain analysis firm.</p>

        

<p>Victims included <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/08/lazarus_link_atomic_wallet/">Atomic Wallet</a> ($100 million) CoinsPaid ($37.3 million), Alphapo ($60 million), and Stake.com ($41 million), some of which attacks have also been linked to the North Koreans. </p>
<p>And in August, the FBI issued an alert that the same gang of government-backed cryptocurrency thieves may try to liquidate a stash of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/fbi_dprk_cyber_crooks/">stolen Bitcoin</a> worth more than $40 million from several recent robberies. ®</p>
