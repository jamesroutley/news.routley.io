<p><span>10 May 2024</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Update: The official format definition is now online here: <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000624.shtml">Portable Embosser Format</a>. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a> directly to the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The Portable Embosser Format (PEF) is a document type that represents braille pages in digital form, “accurately and unambiguously; regardless of language, location, embosser settings, braille code and computer environment” (<a href="(https://braillespecs.github.io/pef/pef-specification.html)">source</a>).</p>

<p>Not a lot of info online about this one. It’s based on XML and Unicode. There’s a <a href="https://braillespecs.github.io/pef/pef-specification.html">public draft</a> from 2011. There’s also several dead or noted-as-unmaintained websites. It was initially developed by the Swedish Library for the Blind and so there’s a good bit of usage in Scandinavia, but seems like it never got a lot of uptake in the States.</p>

<p>The challenge of this format was that the online information was so sparse – you can check out the FDD above to see how I fared when juggling limited information and uptake!</p>
