    <h1>Ask HN: Risk of unsafe software in automobiles?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I may buy a car (new or used) soon and am a little worried about all the software in cars these days. Software can control pretty much every aspect of a modern vehicle, and so the idea of bugs in a vehicle&#39;s software scares me from a safety perspective. Poor software engineering has been implicated in automobile safety incidents in the past[1].</p><p>I&#39;m aware of the NASA/JPL rules for developing safety-critical software[2] but I&#39;m not sure if any car manufacturers follow anything similar.</p><p>Does anyone here have any knowledge of the software development practices of any automakers and what they do to ensure safety and reliability? And is there anything else I can do to mitigate this risk (short of buying a very old car, which would have other safety downsides)?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration</a>
