<p>Once upon a time, microcomputers were simple and easy to understand. So simple in fact that a kid like me, with no computer experience whatsoever, could actually understand them, build them, program them, and put them to work in his very own projects!</p>

<p>The COSMAC 1802 was created in the 1970&#39;s at the dawn of the microcomputer revolution, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weisbecker">Joseph Weisbecker</a> of RCA Corporation. It used their new CMOS fabrication process, which had very low power consumption, very high noise immunity, and was very simple to use. It was intended for military and aerospace; applications too tough for other microcomputers to survive.</p>

<p>But Joe was a hacker at heart. He wrote a series of articles starting in the August 1976 issue of Popular Electronics magazine called &#34;Build the COSMAC ELF&#34;. It described a simple low-cost computer, using the 1802 microprocessor. At the time, microcomputer systems cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. (Hmm... they still do today!) But Weisbecker&#39;s ELF cost about $80! Yet, it was an honest-to-goodness real live computer, able to do anything its much bigger cousins could do -- albeit a bit slower and cruder.</p>

<p>It was the ideal computer trainer. Hobbyists built thousands of ELFs, learning about computer design, construction, and programming in the process. A dozen companies produced versions of the ELF, also selling for low prices. It was the &#34;Legos&#34; of computers; a simple building-block computer that could be assembled many ways to become almost anything, limited only by your imagination.</p>

<p>I learned about computing on my ELF. It put me on a career in engineering, as it did for thousands of others. 1802&#39;s got designed into all sorts of amazing things; video games, music synthesizers, auto engine controllers, military weapon systems, and even NASA missions such as the Galileo spacecraft. Eat stardust, PCs and Macs!</p>

<p>Today&#39;s computers are far more powerful than the 1802. But they have also become so complicated that virtually no one can build them or truly understand how they work. We depend on someone else to make them for us, and to provide us with the megabytes of pre-written software needed to do anything with them. You can&#39;t learn the basics if there is nothing &#34;basic&#34; to learn on! I decided to do something about it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Membership Card</strong> is a reproduction of the original Popular Electronics Elf computer, repackaged to fit in a pocket-sized Altoids(R) tin. It is entirely built with 1980&#39;s parts and technology, using only common low-cost through-hole parts (no custom ICs or surface-mount assembly). To use it, you don&#39;t need a modern PC, or megabytes of proprietary software. Now you can learn about computers right from the ground up, and <u>really</u> understand how they work!</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>A complete computer in a pocket-sized package
</li><li>Build it yourself with ordinary soldering skills and tools
</li><li>Self-contained; no PC needed to program or use
</li><li>A real front panel to load, examine, and run programs
</li><li>Micropower operation; runs up to a year on AA batteries
</li><li>Learn how computer hardware and software actually works
</li><li>Includes standard serial and parallel I/O ports
</li><li>Now control your world! Blink lights, sense switches, make noises, turn things on and off
</li></ul>

<h3>What&#39;s inside?</h3>

<p>There are two circuit boards, each the size of a credit card. One is the <strong>Membership Card</strong> itself. It has the 1802 microprocessor, up to 64k bytes of memory, 22 bits of I/O, clock, reset, and power supply circuits, plus a supercapacitor to maintain memory contents without power. It can be used by itself as a microcontroller for projects like the Parallax BASIC Stamps or Arduino microcontrollers.</p>

<p> All power, control, input, and output signals are available on the 30-pin header along the bottom. The 6-pin header in the lower right corner provides power and serial I/O connections with a USB-serial adapter (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9718">Sparkfun #9718</a> or equivalent). The photo shows it with the optional 32k memory upgrade installed, with a monitor, BASIC, and Adventureland game.</p>
