    <h1>Ubisoft cancels six games including Prince of Persia and closes studios</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><b>Ubisoft has cancelled six video games - including its long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - as part of a &#34;major reset&#34; of its operations.</b></p><p>The French developer and publisher, known for popular games such as Assassin&#39;s Creed, Far Cry and Just Dance, has closed two studios and delayed seven titles as part of its changes.</p><p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said the move would &#34;create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth&#34;.</p><p>The firm&#39;s shares plunged by 33% on Thursday morning following the announcement.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The move comes at a time when studios are increasingly turning to video game remakes and remasters, with new versions of Super Mario Galaxy, Oblivion and Metal Gear Solid 3 proving popular in 2025.</p><p>So the decision to bin the remake of Sands of Time - which sold millions of copies in 2003 - has left many fans scratching their heads.</p><p>Ubisoft has not specified which titles it has discontinued alongside the Prince of Persia remake.</p><p>But it says among them are four unannounced titles, including three based on new intellectual property, and a mobile game.</p><p>Ubisoft has closed its studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Halifax, Canada as part of the move, which will include restructuring three others.</p><p>The developers were working on a new intellectual property (IP) and mobile titles for Assassin&#39;s Creed, respectively.</p><p>The closure of Ubisoft Halifax was previously announced in January - the same week the studio formed a union. </p><p> &#34;While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organisation over the long term,&#34; Guillemot said.</p><p>&#34;Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term&#34;.</p><p>Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the move indicated the firm was trying to mitigate risk.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s less risky to maintain scale by investing in existing big franchises such as Assassin&#39;s Creed and Rainbow Six than launch entirely new IPs and that&#39;s reflected in the cancellation of a number of games based on new IPs,&#34; he said.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>It is the second restructure from Ubisoft in subsequent years, after the firm cut 185 jobs across Europe in 2025.</p><p>In the UK, it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jxzjgpplo">closed its office in Leamington</a> and restructured another in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p><p>Guillemot said the new move was in part due to a competitive market for triple-A games - blockbuster titles which cost millions to develop and dominate large studios&#39; offerings.</p><p>&#34;On the one hand, the triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,&#34; he said <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">in a statement on Wednesday<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a>.</p><p>Such big offerings are increasingly facing delays - with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwypgvd9j8qo">Grand Theft Auto VI pushed back for a second time to November 2026</a>.</p><p>But Guillemot said despite these hurdles, successful blockbuster games could bring &#34;more financial potential than ever&#34;.</p><p>&#34;In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time,&#34; he said.</p><p>Ubisoft will now focus on developing open world adventure games - which let players freely navigate vast environments - and live service games which seek regular payments from players.</p><p>The firm said its subsidiary Vantage Studios, created after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4l4y0yd03o">a €1.25bn ($1.25bn; £1bn) investment from Chinese tech giant Tencent</a>, would aim to turn Assassin&#39;s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six &#34;into annual billionaire brands&#34;.</p></div></div></div>
