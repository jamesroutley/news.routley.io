    <h1>W9 - Declaring writing bankruptcy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2099300">
    
      <div><p>I had been behind on writing blog posts, and I took notes to write out in full when I find the time. I now declare ‘writing bankruptcy’, but I’d still like to share my notes.<br/></p>
<p>A theme I’ve been coming across recently is “software is eating the world, but now AI is eating software”. It reminded me of this quote.</p><blockquote><p>Technological advance is an inherently iterative process. One does not simply take sand from the beach and produce a Dataprobe. We use crude tools to fashion better tools, and then our better tools to fashion more precise tools, and so on. Each minor refinement is a step in the process, and all of the steps must be taken.</p></blockquote>
<p>I spoke to a few early-stage startup founders, and I wondered how they thought about building a team around them. Cue Hank Paulson.</p><blockquote><p>There is no perfect leader. Everyone is flawed and their strengths are usually the opposite of a weakness. The key ingredient I found for any of these CEOs that was just essential to success is the team they put around them. I called it &#34;the right people in the right seats&#34;. You needed to play to your strength but you need to put people around you who you listen to, who can compensate for your weaknesses. If you didn&#39;t these big jobs always uncover your weaknesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had been at law school in the early 2010s, and one summer I met up with a lawyer friend in London. I shared with her my disappointment in not getting an internship in corporate law.<br/></p>
<p>Instead of offering words of comfort, she said something along the lines of “you have a tendency to speak your mind but as lawyers we often need to err on the side of being diplomatic; I’m not sure you missing out on internships is a necessarily a bad thing.”<br/></p>
<p>Now I can tell her, she’s right. Working with software is not without its quirks, but I’ve yet to see someone describe their experience in the vein of the following excerpt.</p><blockquote><p>There’s a saying out here. Every man has three hearts. One in his mouth for the world to know. Another in his chest, just for his friends. And a secret heart buried deep where no one can find it.</p></blockquote></div>
