    <h1>Getting Burnt by Business Expansion</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/08/dangers_business_expansion.jpg" alt="Getting Burnt by Business Expansion"><p>We&#x2019;re publishing two cases this week, both taken from the history of skincare conglomerate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Est%C3%A9e_Lauder_Companies?ref=commoncog.com">The Est&#xE9;e Lauder Companies</a>. The first is about the <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/cases/clinique-launch/">launch of Clinique</a>, whilst the second is about <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/cases/estee-lauder-prescriptives/">Prescriptives</a> &#x2014; both the second and third brands Est&#xE9;e Lauder created from scratch, respectively. These two cases are interesting because Clinique and Prescriptives were pretty much brands that laid the foundation for Est&#xE9;e Lauder&#x2019;s eventual acquisitive strategy, and they are also illuminating because the Lauders made different mistakes with each. The two cases happen to be the first cases for the <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/concepts/branding/">Branding</a> concept sequence. </p><p>I want to highlight something that has stayed with me from the first case, on Clinique. It has to do with the dangers of expansion &#x2014; something that every businessperson seems to learn ... eventually.</p>
