<p>I spent some time (in Fall 2023) reading about solar deployment. Some facts that struck me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solar deployment is now running at about $500 billion per year, which means that about 0.5% of global GDP is being spent on solar deployment. This figure is up an improbable 43% Y/Y. <i>Source: <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/renewable-energy-investment-hits-record-breaking-358-billion-in-1h-2023/">BloombergNEF</a></i>

</li>

<li>If one takes at face value the estimate that the world will deploy 300–400 GW of solar in 2023 (<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-june-2023/executive-summary">IEA</a>), and that 1 MW of solar =~ 5 acres, we&#39;re deploying roughly 3–4 acres of solar per minute.</li>

<li>54% (29.1 GW) of the new electricity generation capacity in the US in 2023 will be solar. The next biggest category is battery storage. We&#39;ll add more than 4x more solar than natural gas, the leading fossil fuel-based category. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55419">EIA</a></i>
<ul><li>
    As of September, the estimate <a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2023/09/2023-will-be-the-biggest-installation-year-for-solar-in-the-united-states-ever/">increased</a> to 32 GW, representing a 52% increase over 2022.
</li></ul>
</li>

<li>In the EU, solar additions in 2022 (41 GW) were up 47% from 2021 (28 GW). <i>Source: <a href="https://www.solarpowereurope.org/press-releases/new-report-reveals-eu-solar-power-soars-by-almost-50-in-2022">SolarPower Europe</a></i></li>

<li>At peak, renewables provide up to ~90% of California&#39;s electricity. Of renewable sources in California, solar is by far the largest. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/caiso">GridStatus.io</a></i>

<li>In Spain, electricity provided by solar increased 8 percentage points Y/Y, from 16% to 24%. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/solar-power-rescue-europes-energy-system-weathers-extreme-heat-2023-08-07/">Reuters</a></i></li>
