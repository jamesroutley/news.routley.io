    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">i was at bombay airport. some dude was watching reels on full volume and laughing loudly. asking nicely doesn&#39;t work anymore. me being me, didn&#39;t have the courage to speak up.</p>
<p dir="auto">so i built a tiny app that plays back the same audio it hears, delayed by ~2 seconds. asked claude, it spat out a working version in one prompt. surprisingly WORKS.</p>
<p dir="auto">discussion - <a href="https://x.com/the2ndfloorguy/status/2011734249871954188" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/the2ndfloorguy/status/2011734249871954188</a></p>

<p dir="auto">something something auditory feedback loop something something cognitive dissonance. idk i&#39;m not a neuroscientist. all i know is it makes people shut up and that&#39;s good enough for me.</p>
