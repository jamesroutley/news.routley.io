<p>The new Kindle Scribe begins shipping on December 4 and starts at $399.99. This is a hefty increase over the first Scribe&#39;s $339.99 starting price, though the new Scribe does include the Premium Pen accessory by default. The old Scribe came with a cheaper Basic Pen accessory instead.</p>

<p>The Kindle Paperwhite has been the mainstream default-choice Kindle since the very first one came out in 2012, and the new model continues in that tradition. It has a 7-inch screen, slightly increased from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/review-bigger-screen-and-better-lighting-make-for-a-nearly-perfect-kindle-paperwhite/">the previous-generation 2021 Paperwhite&#39;s 6.8 inches</a>, with improved contrast thanks to &#34;an oxide thin-film transistor.&#34; Amazon also says page turns should be 25 percent faster than on the previous model.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite also inherits other niceties from older models: waterproofing, a USB-C port, and an even front light with adjustable brightness and color temperature.</p>
<p>The regular Paperwhite starts at $159.99 for 16GB of storage and is now available. This is a $20 increase over the 2021 model, though it also doubles the storage. Amazon will continue to offer a Signature Edition of the Paperwhite starting at $199.99 with 32GB of storage, a sensor for automatic brightness and color temperature adjustments, and wireless charging.</p>

    <p><span>The base Kindle, despite costing $10 more than its predecessor, comes with fairly modest improvements like boosted speed, contrast, and screen brightness. </span>

<p>The basic Kindle may be the least upgraded of the three. Most of the core specs remain the same as they were for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/review-amazons-100-kindle-is-lightweight-and-cute-and-it-nails-the-basics/">the overhauled 2022 refresh</a>: a 6-inch 300 PPI screen, a weight of just 5.56 ounces (158 g), and a USB-C port with basic water intrusion detection. It&#39;s still not waterproof, but Amazon says the new version offers faster page turns, better contrast, and a 25 percent brighter front light that can now match the Paperwhite&#39;s brightness (though not the number of LEDs, the warm light, or the automatic brightness or color temperature sensors).</p>
<p>The basic Kindle still has 16GB of internal storage and offers &#34;weeks&#34; of battery life. Like the Paperwhite, it&#39;s available to order today, and it&#39;s getting a small price increase, from $100 to $109.99.</p>
<p>Both the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite also come in Kindle Kids editions with two-year warranties, colorful cases, and a six-month subscription to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?ref_=ftu_kindle_friendly">Amazon&#39;s Kids+ service</a>. These upgrades usually add $20 to the prices of both models.</p>
