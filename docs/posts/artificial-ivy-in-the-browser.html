          This page simulates a biologically-inspired system with a few simple
          rules. It begins with a single cell. Over time, cells repeatedly
          decide whether to <i>grow</i> and/or <i>split</i>. The nearby sliders
          adjust the probability of each action occurring.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p><label for="growChanceRange">Grow chance: <span id="growChanceLabel"></span>%</label>
            
          </p>
          <p><label for="splitChanceRange">Split chance: <span id="splitChanceLabel"></span>%</label>
            
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          When a cell splits, it creates a new cell pointed in a slightly
          different direction. Decreasing the maximum turn angle causes cells to
          grow in straighter lines.
        </p>

        

        <p>
          Only the youngest cells get to grow or split. After a certain age,
          cells become dormant. This threshold age is defined as a percentile on
          the distribution of cell ages at any given time. Increasing the
          threshold means more cells will be active.
        </p>

        

        <p>
          Cells leave a signal in the location they were created. This effectively
          broadcasts their presence so that others won&#39;t grow or split on top of
          them. Increasing the decay rate enables faster regrowth, but also makes
          it more likely that cells will grow on top of each other.
        </p>

          <p><label for="showSignalsCheckbox">Show signals</label>
            
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          When cells reach a fixed maximum age, they die.
