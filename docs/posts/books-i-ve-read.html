<h2><a href="https://sive.rs/book/ListeningBook">The Listening Book - by W.A. Mathieu</a></h2>
<p><small>Date read: 2021-09-03. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small></p><p>Everyone should read this book of little essays about listening. It teaches your ears to pay more attention. It calls your attention to sounds you hadn’t noticed. It’s beautifully written, and makes your life better. I read it twice, 24 years ago, and reading it again this week, it was even better than I remembered.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2021-08-30. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small></p><p>A nonfiction comic book, by an economist, about unrestricted immigration. What? Yeah. Everyone should read it. This fun easy read of a single well-argued point will change your mind no matter what your previous stance. Brilliant illustration by Zach Weinersmith helps make the topic stick. NOTE: Don’t try to read it on a little black-and-white Kindle. It really is a comic book and needs to be read full-size in color.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2021-08-02. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small></p><p>I’ve read this book three times since 1999, and gifted it many times to others. It’s changed the way I look at buildings. I read it again now because I’m building a new house. Its main idea is that all buildings are predictions, and all predictions are wrong, so design to make them easy to change. I think of it metaphorically in life: assuming my predictions about what I want will probably be wrong, so make my life easy to change. Get the paper book because the photos are crucial.</p>

The framework is inspiring for anyone: coming up with 40 different answers to any one question. But they’re also just brilliant ideas and powerful little fables.

<p><small>Date read: 2010-09-26. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>10</strong>/10</small></p><p>Almost too personal for me to give an objective review, because I found when reading it that the quirky philosophy I&#39;ve been living my life by since 17 matches up exactly with a 2000-year-old philosophy called Stoicism. Mine was self-developed haphazardly, so it was fascinating to read the refined developed original. Really resonated.</p>

Fascinating implications of each. Because I&#39;m so future-focused, reading this book helped me understand people who are very present-focused. Also great advice on shifting your focus when needed. I read it 7 years ago, but still think about it almost every day.</p>

I first read it after 10 years of successfully running my company, and was still blown away and totally humbled by its wisdom. Re-reading it today, I&#39;m amazed how my view of business was completely changed by this one little book. See my notes for examples, but definitely read the book itself to get the real impact.</p>

I love autobiographies that distill lessons from their success. Similar to “Total Recall” by Schwarzenegger. I love reading the mindsets of the super-ambitious. Knowing Mark Manson’s writing so well, it’s fascinating to notice where it subtly changes voice from Will to Mark. Great insights. Really an ideal autobiography.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2021-03-28. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>9</strong>/10</small></p><p>The 2nd-best and most-radical book about great writing. It tells you to focus entirely on the sentence, an approach that was already my favorite, which is why I bought this book. It recommends you boldly eliminate transitions and conjunctions, split compound sentences, don&#39;t save your point for the end, and revise by deleting.  This is the first book I&#39;ve seen printed as one sentence per line — a way I&#39;ve been writing for many years, and now printed in my book “How to Live”.</p>

One of the most interesting books I&#39;ve ever read. If you haven&#39;t read much of AI yet, start with “Surviving AI” as an intro, then read this as a deep-dive. His perspective is amazingly thorough. Defining terminology was a great way to start. For example life is a “process that can retain its complexity and replicate”. Intelligence is the “ability to accomplish complex goals”. That keeps it broad enough to define future technology as alive and intelligent.</p>

More surprisingly interesting ideas than almost any book I&#39;ve ever read. Extremely thoughtful, but occasionally abruptly concludes with an unsupported point.

<h2><a href="https://sive.rs/book/Sapiens">Sapiens - by Yuval Noah Harari</a></h2>
<p><small>Date read: 2017-08-15. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>9</strong>/10</small></p><p>I resisted reading this popular history of mankind, because it came out when I had just finished “Guns, Germs, and Steel” and “Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches”, on the same subject. But wow - this book is at its best when the author is sharing his personal perspective about binding myths, humanism, and other ways that “truths” are not true. And you get an interesting history of the world along with it. Strange mix of history and philosophy.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2017-03-05. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>9</strong>/10</small></p><p>Brilliant and profound yet totally entertaining philosophy book by one of my favorite people. Gives an approachable overview of past philosophies and shows how they apply to your life today better than the harmful pop-self-help-positivity stuff. Amazing perspectives on desires, death, relationships, anger, and how being present doesn’t matter as much as the story you tell yourself afterwards. He has a fun writing style that’s not reflected in my notes here. Get the book.</p>

Seth is moving from talking about business to talking about being an artist in the broad sense of anyone who creates (and ships!) something daring and new.

Anyone with any money to invest (or already invested) please read this book. Such clear thinking, using only facts, and using numbers not guesses.

<p><small>Date read: 2009-11-10. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>8</strong>/10</small></p><p>Brilliant book with one clear message: our emotional brain is faster and usually smarter than our logical brain. Our emotions are trained by years of logic and experience, retaining it all for real wisdom. Many decisions are better made by going with the gut feeling. Gets a little too technical with deep brain/neuro/cortex talk, but brings it back to usable points.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2017-10-07. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>7</strong>/10</small></p><p>Wow. So dense with wisdom that I wanted to highlight almost every paragraph. Instead, I skipped Part 1, about his background, because in the intro he recommends you skip it. I also skipped Part 3, about work principles, since they were all collaborative group-stuff, and I’m not working with anyone now. So here are my notes just from Part 2, “Life Principles”, which were so good I’ll probably re-read this book again next year. Caveat: it’s mostly so high-level — (“Decide what is true, then decide what to do about it.”) — that they’re more like koans to spark your own thoughts, instead of specific “do this” type advice.</p>

But I&#39;ve already loved “The Talent Code”, “The Little Book of Talent”, “Moonwalking with Einstein”, “Talent is Overrated”, and “Little Bets”, which are all about this same field. So I didn&#39;t get much new out of it, but if you haven&#39;t already read those, maybe start here at the horse&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2008-06-01. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>4</strong>/10</small></p><p>Autobiography of his life from childhood through 2004. Interesting how he was always over-leveraged and how that drove him forward. Amazing how he negotiated Necker Island from £3 million down to £180k.</p>

It’s just some thoughts on our present and near future. Not so different from what you find in every-day articles. I’m personally averse to news commentaries, so I shouldn’t have read this. Still, some interesting ideas, and the last chapter was great.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2017-09-02. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>2</strong>/10</small></p><p>A fine summary of the other books on the subject of performance, deliberate practice, mastery, willpower, etc. But I’ve read all the books that this one references, so this had nothing new for me. If you haven’t read those others, this would be a good starting book for you.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2016-08-04. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>2</strong>/10</small></p><p>Though it has some great information and mindset advice, holy crap it&#39;s so damn verbose - 688 pages! - which keeps me from recommending it.  But it might be worth skimming to find specific things you&#39;re looking for.  I had never heard of annuities or private placement life insurance.  (That said, I don&#39;t want them.)  What a weird mix of for-dummies and super-sophisticated advice.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2016-03-02. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>2</strong>/10</small></p><p>Cute stories about surprising research on curious aspects of everyday life. I loved these stories the first time I heard them : in everyone else&#39;s books. If I would have read this book first, I might have loved it. This author is the one who did the original studies, but his work has been so quoted by others that I found myself quickly skimming through, too familiar.</p>

I recently heard he wrote a major update to it shortly before he died, that some say is much better.  I guess my tastes have changed because though this book has good intentions, and might have made a big impact on me long ago, now I found it almost unreadably vague and had to stop.

I should have previewed the book before buying, because it’s a long-winded story of every person involved in the journey of discovery and development of CRISPR. What they look like, where they grew up, what they said, who they met and when, on and on and on. When I was done with the book, I watched a 15-minute Kurzgesagt video about CRISPR and learned better than I did from this long story-telling book.</p>

I couldn&#39;t finish it.</p>

<h2><a href="https://sive.rs/book/DoSomethingDifferent">Flex: Do Something Different - by Ben Fletcher and Karen Pine</a></h2>
<p><small>Date read: 2014-09-15. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>0</strong>/10</small></p><p>I give the basic idea a 9-out-of-10 rating: that we shouldn&#39;t declare and hold to a personality type (“I&#39;m an introvert! I&#39;m adventurous!”), but rather should adapt to the situation. Halfway through the book I gave up because I got the idea and didn&#39;t like the writing style.</p>

<h2><a href="https://sive.rs/book/CambodiaCurse">Cambodia&#39;s Curse - by Joel Brinkley</a></h2>
<p><small>Date read: 2011-10-05. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>0</strong>/10</small></p><p>Cambodia&#39;s political history from 1978 to 2009 or so. Appalling, horrible, infuriating, disgusting, etc. I hated this book. I was hoping to learn more about Cambodia and its culture, but this only gives chapter after chapter detailing the horrible things the people in government did, and nothing else. No bright side. No other insights. Just horror.</p>

<p><small>Date read: 2009-11-24. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>0</strong>/10</small></p><p>Yet another Rich Dad book shat out for the usual audience of those who don&#39;t read. Often so bad it hurts, but with the occasional useful sentence. He always seems to go out of his way to avoid giving any usable info - only generalities. Does he care? Is he trying to write great books? Are these things just machine-generated or something?</p>

<h2><a href="https://sive.rs/book/ThinkBigManifesto">The Think Big Manifesto - by Michael Port and Mina Samuels</a></h2>
<p><small>Date read: 2009-05-12. How strongly I recommend it: <strong>0</strong>/10</small></p><p>One of the few books I&#39;ve actively disliked. Ever read the introduction to a book? Where they say “what you hold in your hands here is something that could change the world”, and blah blah blah? I kept reading, wondering when the introduction was going to be over. Over halfway through the book, I realized this was it: just broad general encouraging unuseful nothings for the entire book.</p>
