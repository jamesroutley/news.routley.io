    <h1>He Chunhui&#39;s Tiny386 Turns an ESP32-S3 into a Fully-Functional 386-Powered PC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p>Developer He Chunhui has turned the humble Espressif ESP32 microcontroller into a fully-fledged &#39;90s personal computer with Tiny386 — a resource-efficient emulator capable of running Microsoft Windows 95 and a range of 16- and 32-bit software packages on the low-cost chip.</p><p>&#34;Tiny386 is a x86 PC emulator written in C99,&#34; Chunhui explains of the project. &#34;The highlight of the project is its portability. It now boots Windows 9x/NT on MCU [Microcontroller Units] such as [the Espressif] ESP32-S3. The core of the project is a built-from-scratch, simple and stupid [Intel] i386 CPU emulator. Some features are missing, e.g. debugging, hardware tasking, and some permission checks, but it should be able to run most 16/32-bit software.&#34;</p><figure><figcaption>What once took a shiny new desktop computer can be achieved with a low-cost microcontroller — thanks to Tiny386. (📹: He Chunhui)</figcaption></figure><p>The 80386, more commonly known as the 386 and later rebadged as the i386, was released in 1985 as the successor to the best-selling 80286, expanding the nascent x86 architecture&#39;s capabilities with a six-stage instruction pipeline and support for 32-bit operation with an on-board memory management unit. It was, at the time, a powerful chip and found a home in desktops, laptops, and even servers of the era.</p><p>The Espressif ESP32-S3, by contrast, is a low cost — but nevertheless highly capable — microcontroller, available for a fraction of the price of the 386 in its heyday and drawing considerably less power. Despite this, it&#39;s also a lot more powerful: the 386 was available in clock speeds of 12MHz up to 40MHz; the ESP32-S3 features a pair of Tensilica Xtensa LX7 cores running at 240MHz. That gap in power means, somewhat surprisingly, it&#39;s possible to emulate a mostly-functional 386 PC using just the ESP32-S3 plus some external pseudo-static RAM.</p><p>The Tiny386 runs on the microcontroller itself — though is designed for portability to other platforms, with Chunhui releasing a demo that runs in-browser — and, despite having some functionality stripped out, can run a wide range of software including, naturally, Id Software&#39;s 1993 classic first-person shooter Doom. The project borrows peripherals from other emulators to flesh out the system, adding VGA graphics capabilities, an emulated Ethernet network interface, and even a choice of three sound devices: PC speaker, Adlib OPL2 synthesis, and Creative Labs&#39; SoundBlaster 16.</p><div><div><p><span>The emulator can run both 16- and 32-bit software, and even Linux kernels thanks to the addition of selected 486 and Pentium instructions.

There is also an optional x87 FPU [Floating-Point Unit] emulator. For firmware, the BIOS/VGABIOS comes from [the] SeaBIOS [project]. Tiny386 also supports booting [the] Linux kernel directly, without traditional BIOS.&#34;</p><p><span>Full source code for the project is available </span><a href="https://github.com/hchunhui/tiny386" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a><span> under the permissive BSD three-clause license, with Chunhui having demonstrated success booting it on the low-cost Guition JC3248W535 ESP32-S3-based LCD development board.
