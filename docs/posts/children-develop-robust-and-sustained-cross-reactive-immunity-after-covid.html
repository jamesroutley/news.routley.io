Here we compare antibody and cellular immunity in children (aged 3–11 years) and adults. Antibody responses against spike protein were high in children and seroconversion boosted responses against seasonal Beta-coronaviruses through cross-recognition of the S2 domain. Neutralization of viral variants was comparable between children and adults. Spike-specific T cell responses were more than twice as high in children and were also detected in many seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses to seasonal coronaviruses. Importantly, children retained antibody and cellular responses 6 months after infection, whereas relative waning occurred in adults. Spike-specific responses were also broadly stable beyond 12 months. Therefore, children generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 with focused specificity for the spike protein. These findings provide insight into the relative clinical protection that occurs in most children and might help to guide the design of pediatric vaccination regimens.</p></div></section>

In total, 47% of children and 59% of adults were seropositive (Supplementary Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.recurse.com/articles/s41590-021-01089-8#MOESM1">1</a>).

It is interesting to speculate whether this may provide insight into the pathophysiology of PIMS-TS/MIS-C, where B cell activation drives a hyperinflammatory syndrome. Lack of pre-existing immunity to hCoV is a risk factor for PIMS-TS/MIS-C and may indicate a protective influence from a previous cross-reactive memory B cell pool<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Consiglio, C.

We found that the virus-specific T cell response was higher in children compared to adults and this mirrored the humoral response in that responses against the spike protein were markedly increased compared to nucleocapsid and envelope proteins. Virus-specific T cell responses in children also showed a differential cytokine response with markedly reduced production of IL-2. This may suggest a more highly differentiated profile in children compared to adults, which is in line with the enhanced magnitude of the response. Indeed, the spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool in children at 6 months after primary infection was dominated by an IL-2<sup>−</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup> phenotype. As such, further long-term characterization of the T cell response in children, and the potential mechanisms that may act to drive T cell activation, are required.</p><p>We also observed that cross-reactive CoV-specific T cells are present in many children, both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Moreover, we also found that children maintained higher antibody and cellular immune responses at this time point compared to adults with no loss of humoral response compared to loss in 7% of adults. There is increasing confidence in the relative stability of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cell and antibody responses but studies of antibody waning after natural infection are now difficult to perform in adults due to the widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines. Spike-specific antibody responses were also largely maintained in children at 12 months, whereas responses against nucleocapsid showed waning. T cell responses were broadly stable; it is important to consider that ELISpot analysis will only detect effector populations and a long-term memory subset is likely to have been established by this point. We could not compare 12-month values to the adult population because this latter group had undergone COVID-19 vaccination before this time point.</p><p>We also found that children possessed enhanced binding of antibodies to spike and RBD from viral VOC<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Bates, T.

However, levels of neutralizing antibodies in live and pseudo-virus neutralization assays were comparable between adults and children. This suggests that children and adults develop comparable neutralizing antibody responses against the spike S1 domain but the increased antibody response in children results from antibodies targeting non-neutralizing epitopes within S1 and S2. These antibodies could still have important effector potential through mechanisms such as antibody-directed cell cytotoxicity; further studies to examine the specificity and function of the SARS-CoV-2 B cell repertoire in children after natural infection or vaccination would be of value.
