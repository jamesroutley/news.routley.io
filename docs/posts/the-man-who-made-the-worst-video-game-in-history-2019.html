    <h1>The man who made the “worst” video game in history (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    


<p>On April 25, 2014, a bulldozer ripped into a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, and unearthed a trove of 30-year-old Atari video games.</p>



<p>As a dust storm swept across the desert plains, a small gathering of intrepid nerds huddled by a chain-link fence to survey the find. They were there to get a glimpse of <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em> — a game so bad that it was blamed for toppling the $3.2B video game industry in 1983.</p>



<p>For the game’s creator, Howard Scott Warshaw, it was an excavation of his past.</p>



<p>Once the most highly coveted game developer — a hit-maker with the Midas touch — he had been immortalized as the man who created <em>E.T.</em>, the “worst” video game in history.</p>



<p>But Warshaw’s story, like that of Atari, is a parable about corporate greed and the dangers of prioritizing quantity over quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Not a computer guy</strong></h2>





<p>Growing up, Warshaw was the kind of kid who wrote his own sets of rules for board games like <em>Monopoly</em> and <em>Risk</em>.</p>



<p>As a teenager in the early 1970s, he witnessed the birth of the commercial video game industry — including the rise of wildly popular arcade games like Atari’s <em>Pong</em> (1972) and the release of the first home console, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey">Magnavox Odyssey</a>.</p>



<p>When he was introduced to computers as an economics student at Tulane University, he fell in love — mostly because the coursework didn’t require him to read books or write long papers. He went on to earn a master’s degree in engineering, then settled into the workforce as a multi-terminal programmer at Hewlett-Packard.</p>



<p>But Warshaw soon found himself wanting more.</p>



<p>A self-proclaimed “wild guy,” he wasn’t crazy about the tame lifestyle at HP. At the suggestion of a friend, he decided to apply to Atari.</p>

<p>Founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, Atari had grown from an arcade game maker into what was then the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/business/the-game-turns-serious-at-atari.html">fastest-growing company</a> in US history — a $2B-per-year ($6.2B in 2019 dollars) behemoth with 80% market share.</p>



<p>Warner Communications, which had purchased Atari in 1976, was thirsty for more.</p>



<p>At the time, video games were in the midst of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games">golden age</a>. Driven by hits like Space Invaders (1978), Asteroids (1979), and Pac-Man (1980), the coin-op arcade industry was, by the early ‘80s, more profitable than Hollywood and the pop music industry combined.</p>



<p>The holy grail was in replicating these arcade games in a play-at-home console. Atari, which had recently released its VCS (later renamed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>), was well-poised to dominate its competition.</p>



<p>To attract the best programming talent, Atari cultivated a work culture that included <a href="https://kotaku.com/sex-pong-and-pioneers-what-atari-was-really-like-ac-1822930057">hot tub meetings</a>, frequent keggers, and lots of weed. For Warshaw, it was the promised land — the perfect combination of adventure and innovation.</p>



<p>On January 11, 1981, he left HP, took a 20% pay cut, and joined Atari as a $24k-per-year programmer.</p>



<h2><strong>The hit-maker</strong></h2>





<p>Despite having no game development experience, Warshaw, 24, was tasked with building new play-at-home games on microchips using real-time computer programming.</p>



<p>“I thought, ‘What am I going to do to truly make a contribution here?’” he told <em>The Hustle</em> in a recent interview. “I wanted my games to be the biggest games anyone had ever seen.”</p>



<p>Soon, Warshaw’s wish would come true.</p>

<p>His first game, <em>Yars’ Revenge</em> — a story about mutated houseflies under siege — took him 7 months to develop, and went through another 5 months of rigorous play-testing. When it hit the shelves in May of 1982, it became Atari’s biggest 2600 game of all time, selling more than 1m copies.</p>



<p>The success of this game netted Warshaw a high-profile follow-up assignment: the video game adaptation of the Steven Speilberg film, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.</p>



<p>Released in November of 1982 after 10 months of development, this, too, was a 1m-copy seller.</p>



<p>Warshaw soon became known as the game designer with the golden touch — and his success earned him rockstar status. According to press reports, he <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-14-fi-28063-story.html">purportedly</a> pulled in $1m a year and was “hounded for autographs by a devoted cult following of teenagers.”</p>



<p>But in mid-1982, Atari had also begun to shift its business strategy in the games department.</p>



<p>In its earlier days, Atari gave programmers ample time (5-10 months) to create and develop innovative games. But that window closed when the company realized that the real road to riches was in licensing the rights to films.</p>



<p>When <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> saw success, Atari’s culture shifted from one led by engineers to one dominated by sales and marketing employees tasked with rushing games to the market.</p>

<p><em>Warshaw’s first game, Yars’ Revenge, was a smash hit, selling over 1m copies in 1982 (via eBay)</em></p>



<p>“The theory was that if you got a super hot license, you could put anything out there and it would make a lot of money,” said Warshaw. “Licenses were a whole new world at the time… Atari didn’t believe you could have a negative backlash over a video game. They had an attitude that you could do no wrong.”</p>



<p>But that new philosophy would challenge Warshaw’s hot streak.</p>



<h2><strong>The making of </strong><strong><em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em></strong></h2>





<p>Speilberg’s <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em> premiered at theaters in June 1982. It was a smash hit, grossing <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/1982/top-grossing-movies">$322m</a> in one year — at the time, the highest figure the film industry had ever seen.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, a month-long bidding war erupted to license to the video game. When the dust settled, Warner shelled out a purported $20-25m ($52–65m in today’s dollars) for the rights.</p>



<p>On July 27, Warshaw got a call from Atari’s then-CEO, Ray Kassar.</p>



<p>“Kassar called me on a Tuesday afternoon,” recalls Warshaw. “He said ‘On Thursday morning at 8 am, there will be a Learjet waiting for you at San Jose International Airport; you’re going to come to Burbank and present your design to Steven Speilberg.’”</p>



<p>Atari wanted to roll out the game for Christmas, which meant it would have to be done by September 1st.</p>

<p>The typical game took 1k hours’ worth of work over 6 months. Warshaw had less than 36 hours to come up with a concept to present to Hollywood’s hottest director.</p>



<p>Worse yet, he had just 5 weeks to finish the game — a task that one <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-14-fi-28063-story.html">reporter</a> called “the computer equivalent of simultaneously composing and playing a minute waltz in under 30 seconds.”</p>



<p>“The reason a game takes 6 months is there’s a lot of tuning and tweaking; you work on the game until you have a good one and the variable is time,” said Warshaw. “In this case, it was an inversion of that: Instead of starting with the goal of making a good game, it’s, ‘OK I have 5 weeks — let’s see how good of a game I can make.’”</p>



<p>Warshaw’s only option was to create a small, simple, replayable game — something with few moving parts that he could implement quickly.</p>



<p>Less than 2 days later, he was standing in a conference room in Burbank, pitching his design to Spielberg: The player would guide <em>E.T.</em> through a landscape filled with pits, and collect pieces of a phone while evading FBI agents.</p>



<p>“He just looked at me and said, ‘Can’t you just do something like Pac-Man?’” recalls Warshaw. “But eventually, he approved it.”</p>

<p>Over the next 35 days, Warshaw holed himself up in his house working 14-hour days. Over 5 weeks, he estimates he put 500 hours of work into the game, doing everything he could to make something halfway decent in the time he was given.</p>



<p>In December of 1983, some <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/five-million-et-pieces/">5m</a> <em>E.T.</em> cartridges hit shelves across America. Atari had high hopes that it would be one of the best-selling games of all-time.</p>



<p>But fate had something else in store.</p>



<h2><strong>In the pits</strong></h2>





<p>Initially, the <em>E.T.</em> video game sold well.</p>



<p>An extra-terrestrial craze had gripped the nation, and parents, desperate to buy their kids anything E.T.-related, bought thousands of copies, wrapped them, and put them under the tree. But in early 1983, when kids actually started playing the game, things quickly turned sour.</p>



<p>It became clear that <em>E.T.</em> had committed what Warshaw calls “one of the fundamental sins” of video game design: It <em>disoriented</em> the player.</p>



<p>The specific complaint centered around the pits, which players couldn’t seem to avoid falling into: “If you take a step in any direction, you fall into a hole,” said one reviewer. “And if you get out of the hole, you fall right back down.”</p>



<p>“A video game needs some level of frustration, or else there is no satisfaction in the win,” said Warshaw. “But there’s a difference between frustration (‘I know what I’m trying to do, I’m just falling short’) and disorientation (‘I’m suddenly in a world I don’t understand, and I don’t know how I got there’).”</p>



<p>Initially priced at $38, the game was soon on sale for $7.99. Millions of copies went unsold, and thousands more were returned.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="600" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/price-drop.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Ads from 1982 and 1983 show the decline in the price of the E.T. video game (assorted clippings, via newspapers.com)</em></p>



<p>Unfortunately for Warshaw, the flop of <em>E.T.</em> coincided with a much graver event: The <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/us/64579/the-1983-videogame-crash-what-went-wrong-and-could-it-happen-again">video game crash of 1983</a>.</p>



<p>A flood of low-quality, hastily created games, coupled with the rise of the personal computer, led to a moment of reckoning: In the 2 years following the release of <em>E.T.</em>, the video game industry saw its revenue fall from $3.2B to just $100m — a 97% decline.</p>



<p>By the end of 1983, Atari reported $536m in losses. Over a 12-month period, the company went from 10k to 2k employees, and its stock slid from $60 to $20. In mid-1984, Warner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/03/business/warner-sells-atari-to-tramiel.html">sold</a> the ailing company for $50 cash and $240m in stock.</p>



<p>In the wake of this crisis, <em>E.T.</em> became a symbol of everything that was wrong with gaming. Analysts blamed it for sending the gaming industry into a “decades-long death spiral.”</p>



<p>But true insiders knew that <em>E.T. </em>was merely a symptom — not the cause — of the crash.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t<em> E.T.</em>,” Nolan Bushnell, a co-founder of Atari, later said of the crash in a 2014 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-Game-Over-Ernst-Cline/dp/B07DJDJC49/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=atari+game+over&amp;qid=1576094421&amp;sr=8-1">documentary</a>. “It was a combined effect of a lot of missteps in technology, deployment, marketing… [but] a simple answer that is precise will always have more power than a complex one that is true.”<br/></p>



<p>“Any time a tragedy happens,” said Warshaw, “you need a face to tell a story.”</p>



<h2><strong>E.T.: The great unearthing</strong></h2>





<p>At some point during Atari’s fall in 1983, the company loaded up <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/460833495/?terms=%22E.T.%2Bthe%2BExtra-Terrestrial%22%2B%22Atari%22">20 truckloads</a> of games — including thousands of unsold copies of <em>E.T.</em> — and dumped them in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. History, the company hoped, would be forgotten.</p>



<p>Over the years, the burial became something of an urban legend. But 31 years later, in April of 2014, a crew excavated the site and uncovered 1.3k games. At auction, the <em>E.T.</em> cartridges, which have since developed a cult following, fetched as much as $1.5k.</p>



<p>For Warshaw, it was a vindication of sorts.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1000" height="564" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/final.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Warshaw, with all 3 of his Atari games (courtesy of HSW)</em></p>



<p>After Atari crumbled, his outsized role in the video game crisis earned him a scarlet letter in the industry. He found work as a real estate broker and spent nearly 2 decades soul searching before discovering his true passion: psychotherapy.</p>



<p>Today, he spends his time working on “a much more sophisticated piece of hardware:” the human brain — particularly those of Silicon Valley techies.</p>



<p>But on that day in 2014, when <em>E.T.</em> was resurrected from the dead amid a crowd of cheering fans, Warshaw felt a strange sense of pride.</p>



<p>“Now, I kind of prefer it when people call <em>E.T.</em> the worst game ever,” he says. “<em>Yars’ Revenge </em>is considered one of the best games, so as long as <em>E.T.</em> is the worst, I have the greatest range of any designer in history.”</p>
