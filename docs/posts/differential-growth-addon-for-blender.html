<p>People have always been attracted to organic forms, as is evidenced by an endless number of various design elements found in human craft and art since prehistoric times; the ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù has always been a source of inspiration and symbolism for people throughout the globe. The desire to contemplate and reflect upon the organic processes seems to be an inherent part of human nature.</p>
<p>In search for beauty people have come up with a large number of tools and ways to produce organic patterns.</p>
<p>Today I‚Äôm proud to introduce my humble contribution to the generative art ecosystem ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/inca/blender-differential-growth">Differential Growth Addon</a> for <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Fully in-line with Blender Manifesto, it‚Äôs open source, completely free to use and built with tons of love.</p>
<p>A few examples follow.</p>
