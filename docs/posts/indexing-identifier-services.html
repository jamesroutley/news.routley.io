    <h1>Indexing Identifier Services</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Where do you look for identifiers?</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a URI, the IANA has a <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">registry of
schemes</a>, like <code>https</code>, <code>mailto</code>,
and <code>tel</code>.</p>
<p>These days, to resolve an identifier, you generally use the <code>https</code> scheme, which has an <code>authority</code>
component in its URI format. You can go with content addressing like <a href="https://ipld.io/glossary/#cid">IPLD
CIDs</a>, but that doesn’t solve where to look – it solves knowing that
you found the thing (or that you already have the thing).</p>
<p>Authority is hard to persist. So people and organizations pool efforts towards generic authority
under the <code>https</code> URI scheme, like <code>hdl.handle.net</code>, <code>doi.org</code>, <code>n2t.net</code>, <code>identifiers.org</code>,
<code>purl.org</code>, <code>w3id.org</code>, <code>wikidata.org</code>, etc. Or they pool towards authority with narrower scope,
like <code>orcid.org</code>, <code>ror.org</code>, <code>igsn.org</code>, etc. Or they just pursue lasting authority with a new
<code>.org</code> or through a trusted <code>.gov</code>, etc.</p>
<p>How do you index identifiers from various sources? There are efforts like
<a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/">LOV</a> for vocabularies, and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> and <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> for DOIs.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> is setting a nice example of collecting identifiers from
various systems and connecting them, along with descriptive metadata.</p>
<p>What about collecting identifier services? Is this of interest? Is it a fool’s errand due to the
rise and fall of authority? Or is tracking and using the rising and falling of reputation and
reliability, Google-PageRank-style, a way to shepherd researchers to robust persistence of
identifiers?</p>
