			With great power comes great accessibility. Graphite is built on the belief that the best creative tools can be powerful and within reach of all, from students to studios.
		</p>
		<p>
			Graphite is designed with a friendly and intuitive interface where a delightful user experience is of first-class importance. It is available for free under an open source
			<a href="http://shapr.github.io/license" target="_blank">license</a>
			and usable
			<a href="https://editor.graphite.rs">instantly through a web browser</a>
			or an upcoming native client on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
		</p>
		<p>
			It&#39;s easy to learn and teach, yet Graphite&#39;s accessible design does not sacrifice versatility for simplicity. The node-based workflow opens doors to an ecosystem of powerful capabilities catering to
			casual and professional users alike.

				<h2>Non-destructive editing, powered by nodes.</h2>

				<p>While working in Graphite, your edits are saved into the <em>Node Graph</em>. Its <em>nodes</em> represent operations and effects like Magic Wand selection and Blur. Node <em>parameters</em> can be altered anytime, helping you iterate faster. The graph is organized into layers and folders, and a layer panel provides a simpler, compact view of the graph.</p>

				<h2>Raster and vector art, crisp at any resolution.</h2>
				<!-- <div class="graphic">

				</div> -->
				<p>Just like <em>vector</em> artwork, which is based on curves instead of pixels to preserve quality at any scale, Graphite&#39;s <em>raster</em> paintbrushes, generators, and other tools
					work the same way. A <em>resolution-agnostic</em> render engine lets you zoom infinitely and export at any size.</p>

				<h2>Procedural superpowers, part of your art pipeline.</h2>

				</div> -->
				<p>Graphite aims to be the ultimate 2D tool for every technical artist. From procedural artwork to data viz and automation, it is designed from the ground up to fit into studio content
					pipelines. You can also integrate Graphite&#39;s render engine into your game, app, or server.</p>

			Always on the bleeding edge and built to lastâ€” Graphite is written on a robust foundation with Rust, a modern programming language optimized for creating fast, reliable, future-proof
			software.
		</p>
		<p>
			The underlying node graph engine that computes and renders Graphite documents is called Graphene. The Graphene engine is an extension of the Rust language, acting as a system for chaining
			together modular functions into useful pipelines with GPU and parallel computation. Artists can harness these powerful capabilities directly in the Graphite editor without touching code.
			Technical artists and programmers can write reusable Rust functions to extend the capabilities of Graphite and create new nodes to share with the community.

						<p>Graphite is a professional 2D graphics editor for photo editing, image manipulation, graphic design, illustration, data visualization, batch processing, and technical art. It is designed to run on a variety of machines, from mobile hardware like iPads or web browsers on midrange laptops up to beefy workstations with dozens of CPU cores and multiple GPUs.</p>
<p>To provide a responsive user experience, its architecture is made to support the use of distributed computation to make up for deficiencies in local compute power. Resulting productivity benefits will scale for users on hardware ranging from low-end mobile devices up to high-end workstations because documents and use cases can grow to great complexity.</p>
<p>This article explores the current thinking about the problems and potential engineering solutions involved in Graphite and Graphene for building a high-performance distributed computing runtime environment. We are only just embarking on the graph engine implementation, meaning this post describes theoretical approaches to theoretical challenges. The aim is to shed light on what will need to be built and what we currently believe is the trajectory for this work. We hope this post prompts discussions that evolve the concepts and approaches described herein. If this topic sounds interesting and you have feedback, please <a href="http://shapr.github.io/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

						<p>Graphite is an open source, cross-platform digital content creation desktop and web application for 2D graphics editing, photo processing, vector art, digital painting, illustration, data visualization, compositing, and more. Inspired by the open source success of Blender in the 3D domain, it aims to bring 2D content creation to new heights with efficient workflows influenced by Photoshop/Gimp and Illustrator/Inkscape and backed by a powerful node-based, nondestructive approach proven by Houdini, Nuke, Blender, and others.</p>
<p>The user experience of Graphite is of central importance, offering a meticulously-designed UI catering towards an intuitive and efficient artistic process. Users may draw and edit in the traditional interactive (WYSIWYG) viewport with the Layer Tree panel or jump in or out of the node graph at any time to tweak previous work and construct powerful procedural image generators that seamlessly sync with the interactive viewport. A core principle of the application is its 100% nondestructive workflow that is resolution-agnostic, meaning that raster-style image editing can be infinitely zoomed and scaled to arbitrary resolutions at a later time because editing is done by recording brush strokes, vector shapes, and other manipulations parametrically.</p>
