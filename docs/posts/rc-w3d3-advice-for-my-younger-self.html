    <h1>RC W3D3 - Advice for my younger self</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1947682">
    
      <div><p>I had an in-person coffee chat with <a href="https://github.com/Per48edjes">Ravi Dayabhai</a>, and I believe it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve met a fellow Recurser in person! We had a fun chat across a wide range of topics. The part that stuck with me was talking about CS courses. I did a lot of them at Bradfield, more recently with David Beazley (maybe wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/EzzeriEsa/status/1622017395236937728">too much code</a> implementing Raft), and I would be the first to say it&#39;s better to run rather than sit still. To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/davidbalbert">David Albert</a>, &#34;When in doubt, code&#34;.</p><p>That being said, if I was able to talk to my younger self, I would tell him to spend a bit of time thinking what he finds fun and how to find work that extends that. That way what you learned through &#39;joy of learning&#39; gets reinforced and compounds. Maybe it doesn&#39;t exist, and that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s a helpful exercise to think about it, even if it&#39;s 10 minutes every year.</p></div>
