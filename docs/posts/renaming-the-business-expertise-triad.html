    <h1>Renaming the Business Expertise Triad</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/07/renaming_business_expertise_triad.jpg" alt="Renaming the Business Expertise Triad"><p>Cedric here, with a short note. </p><p>Two months ago I <a href="https://commoncog.com/setting-business-expertise-series-free/">released</a> the <a href="https://commoncog.com/business-expertise-series/">Business Expertise Series</a> for free. The series covered NDM researcher Dr Lia DiBello&#x2019;s work on the expertise of business, and introduced the concept of a) cognitive agility, and b) a three sided &#x2018;triad&#x2019; mental model of business expertise. </p><p>The triad model consists of:</p><ul><li>Supply &#x2014; or factors related to company operations.</li><li>Demand &#x2014; or factors related to the market. </li><li>Capital &#x2014; or factors related to capitalisation. </li></ul><p>To be somewhat reductive about it, good businesspeople know how to make things, know how to sell the things they&#x2019;re making, and know how to finance the making and selling of things. (Ha!) More importantly, DiBello&#x2019;s research argues that the best businesspeople understand the interactions between all three legs of the triad for their specific industry. </p><p>So: cool triad, great categorisation scheme. But there was one problem: a sizeable percentage of Commoncog&#x2019;s readers struggled with the <em>names </em>of the three sides of the triad. After a number of individual complaints, I started a thread on Twitter and in Commoncog&#x2019;s <a href="https://forum.commoncog.com/t/renaming-the-business-expertise-triad/1434?u=cedric">private member forums</a> asking for opinions, and found that half of the responses saying they were ok with the original nomenclature of &#x2018;supply, demand and capital&#x2019;, and about half asking for a change. Finally, one of Commoncog&#x2019;s members pointed out to me that the folk who were good with the &#x2018;Supply/Demand/Capital&#x2019; name were either a) investors, or b) comfortable with academese. The business operators in the blog&#x2019;s audience tend to have to translate &#x2018;Supply&#x2019; and &#x2018;Demand&#x2019; in their heads, on the fly &#x2014; it was simply too theoretical.</p><p>That made me think. Commoncog is <em>supposed</em> to be written for the business operator. Getting people to do a one-step translation in their heads is no way to be reader friendly.</p><p>Going forward, I&apos;m going to refer to the three legs in the triad as <a href="https://commoncog.com/operations/">Operations</a> (formerly Supply), <a href="https://commoncog.com/market/">Market</a> (formerly Demand), and <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital/">Capital</a>. Commoncog&#x2019;s site design has been updated accordingly. </p><p>I&#x2019;ll be updating blog posts throughout the site to reflect this name change, and adding links to this explainer post where necessary. </p><p>I hope that makes things easier!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/07/business-expertise-triad-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Renaming the Business Expertise Triad" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/business-expertise-triad-1.png 600w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/business-expertise-triad-1.png 1000w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/07/business-expertise-triad-1.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
