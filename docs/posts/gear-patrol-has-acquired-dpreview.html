<p><em>In anticipation of your questions:</em></p>
<h4><strong>When will Gear Patrol become the owner of DPReview?</strong></h4>
<p>The transaction closed today, and Gear Patrol is now the owner of the DPReview business.</p>
<h4><strong>Will customer accounts be automatically transferred to Gear Patrol? What if I don’t want to transfer my account or content?</strong></h4>
<p>We have worked hard to minimize any impact to our users, and your account has been transferred to Gear Patrol so that you can continue to access the same great content from DPReview. Gear Patrol’s website <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/misc/termsandconditions" target="article-8298318614">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/misc/privacypolicy" target="article-8298318614">Privacy Policy</a> will govern your use of the DPReview website starting today. We encourage you to review this information to understand how the website will be run by Gear Patrol and how your personal information will be collected, used, and protected going forward. If you wish to delete your account, you should follow the steps on the DPReview website <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/delete-account" target="article-8298318614">here</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Will all DPReview staff join Gear Patrol?</strong></h4>
<p>Our current core editorial, tech, and business team is moving forward with DPReview. Gear Patrol is committed to continuing DPReview’s industry leading journalism, and we look forward to collaboratively investing in the site’s future moving forward.</p>
<h4>Will DPReview change its editorial coverage or site features as a result of this?</h4>
<p>The site will continue to operate as it was before, with all editorial coverage and site features remaining the same, and all historical content accessible. That being said, we are excited to begin a new chapter working within and alongside an editorial company like Gear Patrol and expect to continue evolving DPReview based on customer feedback and the rapidly changing state of the publishing industry.</p>
<h4>Will Gear Patrol’s differing editorial focus impact DPReview?</h4>
<p>Gear Patrol is at its heart a brand focused on helping people find the best products for their needs, so they are a strong supporter of DPReview’s core mission of enabling anyone to tap into their creativity by breaking down the complexities of gear, technology, processes, and techniques used for creating photos, videos, and mixed media. Looking ahead, our vision is to provide an unparalleled combination of inspiration, insight, education, and community that unlocks and amplifies our customers’ potential to create.</p>
