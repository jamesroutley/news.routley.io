    <h1>Most people don&#39;t care about quality</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
				<p>My friend, the <a href="https://paulclarke.com/">photographer Paul Clarke</a> has an uncanny eye for detail. Every single shot he publishes is beautiful - they capture life in a way that I don&#39;t have the language to describe. I&#39;m quite content to point my phone at someone, use the default settings, and grab a snap. My photos lack composition, clarity, focus, <i lang="fr">mise-en-scène</i>, proper lighting and a thousand-and-one details that I&#39;ve never even thought of.</p>
				<p>Paul has published <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulclarke6_new-appointment-photos-set-a-tone-sometimes-activity-7215046537209393152-vo92">an essay about official photographs of politicians</a>. In it, he expertly points out the various deficiencies of some of them and where they show a distinct lack of quality.</p>
				<p>But, here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t think anyone other than a photographer would notice or care about those &#34;problems&#34;.</p>
				<p>If you&#39;re a website designer, you&#39;re always noticing &#34;jank&#34; on other sites. Your skin crawls at the poor kerning, the FOUT, the lack of keyboard navigation, improper contrast ratio, and a dozen other flaws. 99% of users just don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t impact them in any meaningful way.</p>
				<p>A decade ago, I ranted about how <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2013/01/are-designers-crazy/">designers were chasing a perfection which would never be noticed by non-experts</a>. You may take pride in your craft, but the majority of people <em>physically</em> cannot notice the difference between good and bad design. Not even subconsciously.</p>
				<p>I include myself in this maddening desire for unnoticeable perfection. I&#39;ve got several <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/rant/">rants about things most people would find inconsequential</a>. There are things which I <em>know</em> to be important in terms of technical correctness, but which most people couldn&#39;t give a shit about.</p>
				<p>There&#39;s a brilliant essay by Will Tavlin called &#34;<a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/">Casual Viewing - Why Netflix looks like that</a>&#34;.</p>
				<p>In it, the author (correctly and fairly) skewers Netflix&#39;s model of producing huge amounts of low-quality content for an undiscerning audience. The creatives recoil in horror and the æsthetic choices, poor scripting, and lack of creative pizazz. Everything is mediocre at best and that&#39;s destroying the creative industries.</p>
				<p>But, much like designers fretting about <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/11/the-myth-of-the-pixel-perfect-grid/">getting things Pixel Perfect</a> or photographers complaining about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulclarke6_watch-your-background-youll-see-this-activity-7153041835630759936-x0gv">background composition</a> or musicians ranting about <a href="https://www.musicianwave.com/the-loudness-war/">the loudness wars</a> - the <i lang="gr">hoi polloi</i> just don&#39;t care.</p>
				<p>And, frankly, who can blame them? Take this quote from the Netflix essay:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The difference between Netflix and its predecessors is that the older studios had a business model that rewarded cinematic expertise and craft.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Bluntly, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley_on_film_and_television#Film">the amount of movies Elvis was in</a>. A couple of good ones, sure. But the majority are literally just &#34;This demographic will pay a dollar to see Elvis on screen; so put him on screen&#34;. You only need to look at the various lists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films">highest grossing movies</a> to see that the viewing public don&#39;t necessarily reward expertise and craft.</p>
				<p>In an essay called &#34;<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3kn4p9v2">Fraught Pleasures: Domestic Trauma and Cinephilia in American Culture</a>&#34;, the author points out that in the movie &#34;Scream&#34; (a movie ostensibly about movies) nobody goes to the cinema. Their entertainment is schlocky VHS tapes of low-budget and low-quality horror films. The nearest they get to discussing the quality of movie making is when one character recommends renting &#34;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085154/">All The Right Moves</a>&#34; because:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>If you pause it at just the right place, you can see [Tom Cruise’s] penis!</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Quality!</p>
				<p>Netflix, so the essay argues, has perfected the art of designing content for &#34;casual viewing&#34;. Something you can have on in the background while cooking, playing a game, or doom-scrolling.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Several screenwriters who’ve worked for the streamer told me a common note from company executives is “have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So? Not everything should be hard work. After a long day, most people don&#39;t <em>want</em> to work for their leisure. People don&#39;t want to expend cognitive energy on interpreting what a story means. <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/05/forget-subtext-people-dont-even-get-surtext/">Forget Subtext - People Don&#39;t Even Get Surtext</a>.</p>
				<p>We also have the problem that close to 100% of culture is now readily available to us. Why take a risk on something new when you could watch something <em>guaranteed</em> to be good? An executive at Amazon&#39;s streaming division recalls receiving an email which said:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>‘here are the one hundred movies that people are watching most on Amazon SVOD today by the minute.’ It was always a lot of Tom Cruise sci-fi movies, action movies from the ’90s and aughts, and Talladega Nights.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>You want to get everyone dancing at your party. Do you put on some experimental music that no one has heard of? No - you stick on ABBA and watch the dance-floor fill up.</p>
				<p>Want something with a guaranteed number of chuckles-per-minute? Friends is there for you.</p>
				<p>When you visit Paris, do you go to some little art gallery showcasing new artists or do you visit Le Louvre? You, like everyone else, bask in front of the <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/06/how-i-became-leonardo-da-vinci-on-the-blockchain/">Mona Lisa</a>.</p>
				<p>Finally, we reach the inevitble endgame of Netflix. Cut out the authors, actors, directors, make-up artists, sound designers, and the hundreds of other unionised parasites involved in making a modern show. Go straight to AI and create an infinite and endless stream of algorithmically-designed crowd-pleasing content.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Streaming platforms are the only place where this [AI Generated] garbage makes any sense — a place where it would never be watched at all.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Hard disagree. Not because I think AI slop is good; but because the audience doesn&#39;t care. Most people don&#39;t notice the wires on the special effects. They can&#39;t see that the lighting is wrong on the CGI shot. The <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/10-worst-accents-cinema-history/">lead actor&#39;s shitty accent</a> passes without comment.</p>
				<p>I&#39;m not trying to slur people when I say that the majority are unsophisticated - because I include myself amongst them.</p>
				<p>Audiophiles complain about MP3 compression and crappy headphones. Most of us just want to listen to our tunes, not listen to the equipment.</p>
				<p>Cinephiles complain about poorly calibrated projectors and or motion smoothing on TVs. Most of us just want to crunch popcorn and see big explosions.</p>
				<p>Fact-checkers complain about <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/04/who-do-you-think-you-are-kidding-mr-feynman/">fictional quotes from famous people</a>. Most of us just want a daily dose of something that sounds like wisdom.</p>
				<p>Pornographers <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/quotes/?item=qt0304288&amp;ref_=ext_shr_lnk">complain about the move from gorgeous celluloid to low fidelity videotape</a>. Most of us just want to rent a VHS rather than visit a cinema for our extra-special-personal-time.</p>
				<p>Fashionistas <a href="https://putthison.com/when-i-was-young-there-were-beatniks-hippies/">decry the homogeneity of modern dress</a>. Most of us think jeans and a t-shirt are basically fine.</p>
				<p>Is the quality of pizza better from a tiny restaurant hidden away in an Italian village using only fresh ingredients? I&#39;m sure it is. But Domino&#39;s delivers something good enough, cheap enough, and hot enough.</p>
				<p>Next year, your pizza will be topped with <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/01/restaurant-review-3d-printed-redefine-meat-unity-diner/">cheap 3D printed &#34;meat&#34;</a> and, while chefs will decry it as an affront to culinary perfection, it&#39;ll be cheap and tasty. Besides, you&#39;re munching on it while chatting to friends and watching something dopey on Netflix. Call it the rise of &#34;Casual Eating&#34;.</p>
