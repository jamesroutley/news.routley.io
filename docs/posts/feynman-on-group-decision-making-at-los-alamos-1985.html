    <h1>Feynman on group decision-making at Los Alamos (1985)</h1>

  One of the first interesting experiences I had in this project at
  Princeton was meeting great men.  I had never met very many great men
  before.  But there was an evaluation committee that had to try  to help
  us along, and help us ultimately decide which way we were going to
  separate the uranium.  This committee had men like Compton and Tolman
  and Smyth and Urey and Rabi and Oppenheimer on it.  I would sit in
  because I understood the theory of how our process of separating
  isotopes worked, so they&#39;d ask me questions and talk about it.  In
  these discussions, one man would make a point.  Then Compton, for
  example, would explain a different point of view.  He would say it
  should be <em>this</em> way, and he was perfectly right.  Another guy
  would say, well, maybe, but there is this other possibility that we
  have to consider against it.
  </p>

  <p>
  So everybody is disagreeing, all around the table.  I am surprised and
  disturbed that Compton doesn&#39;t repeat and emphasize his point.
  Finally, at the end, Tolman, who&#39;s the chairman, would say, &#34;Well,
  having heard all these arguments, I guess it&#39;s true that Compton&#39;s
  argument is the best of all, and now we have to go ahead.&#34;
  </p>

  <p>
  It was such a shock to me to see that a committee of men could present
  a whole lot of ideas, each one thinking of a new facet, while
  remembering what the other fella said, so that, at the end, the
  decision is made as to which idea was the best---summing it all
  up---without having to say it three times.  These were very great men
  indeed.
