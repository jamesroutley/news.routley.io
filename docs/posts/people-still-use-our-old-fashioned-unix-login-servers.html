	<p><small>July 12, 2025</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often I think about random things, and today&#39;s random thing
was how <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">our</a> environment might
look if it was rebuilt from scratch as a modern style greenfield
development. One of the obvious assumptions is that it&#39;d involve a
lot of use of containers, which led me to wondering how you handle
traditional Unix style login servers. This is a relevant issue for
us because we have such traditional login servers and somewhat to
our surprise, they still see plenty of use.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">We</a> have two sorts of login
servers. There&#39;s effectively one general purpose login server that
people aren&#39;t supposed to do heavy duty computation on (and which
uses per-user CPU and RAM limits to help with that), and four
&#39;compute&#39; login servers where they can go wild and use up all of
the CPUs and memory they can get their hands on (with no guarantees
that there will be any, those machines are basically first come,
first served; for guaranteed CPUs and RAM people need to use <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SlurmHowWeUseIt">our
SLURM cluster</a>). Usage of these servers has declined
over time, but they still see a reasonable amount of use, including
by people who have only recently joined the department (as graduate
students or otherwise).</p>

<p>What people log in to our compute servers to do probably hasn&#39;t
changed much, at least in one sense; people probably don&#39;t log in
to a compute server to read their mail with their favorite text
mode mail reader (yes, we have Alpine and Mutt users). What people
use the general purpose &#39;application&#39; login server for likely has
changed a fair bit over time. It used to be that people logged in
to run editors, mail readers, and other text and terminal based
programs. However, now a lot of logins seem to be done either to
SSH to other machines that aren&#39;t accessible from the outside world
or to run the back-ends of various development environments like
VSCode. Some people still use the general purpose login server for
traditional Unix login things (me included), but I think it&#39;s rarer
these days.</p>

<p>(Another use of both sorts of servers is to run cron jobs; various
people have various cron jobs on one or the other of our login
servers. We have to carefully preserve them when <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ReinstallVersusUpgrade">we reinstall
these machines as part of upgrading Ubuntu releases</a>.)</p>

<p>PS: I believe the reason people run IDE backends on our login servers
is because they have their code on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">our fileservers</a>, in their (NFS-mounted) home
directories. And in turn I suspect people put the code there partly
because they&#39;re going to run the code on either or both of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SlurmHowWeUseIt">our
SLURM cluster</a> or the general compute servers. But in general we&#39;re
not well informed about what people are using our login servers for
due to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/CSDeptSupportModel">our support model</a>.</p>
