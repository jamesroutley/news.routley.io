				<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
				<b>Remember</b> -the 
loudspeaker connected to your computer has the ability to produce the low notes 
from C2 to C4 but a chime may not radiate those sounds.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN size="5">
Calculates length and hang point for tubes or rods unrestricted at both ends.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">What&#39;s the difference between a 
pipe and a tube; the way it’s measured and the way is is 
applied for use. Pipes are passageways while tubes are for structural builds like 
hand railing, bicycles and lawn chairs. For the purpose of tubular bell chimes we consider them the same. The important 
parameters are the outside diameter, the inside diameter and the type of metal.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">On the other hand, a rod is a solid metal cylinder that can produce a very 
different sound compared to a tube. The DIY calculators on this website can predict the resonant frequency for a tube or a circular rod and their hang 
point location. If you want to design and build a chime set using rods rather 
than tubes all you have to do is set the inside diameter to zero and enter the 
outside diameter and type of metal into the DIY calculator. </SPAN>  </p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">If you are trying to decide between using a tube or a rod as the chime element, 
one important difference is the sustain time of the musical note. Typically a 
rod will have a much longer sustain time and in some environments this maybe 
desirable but annoying in others.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Another difference between 
tubes and rods is their length for a given note. A rod is shorter than a tube to 
strike the same note for the same metal.Â  For example, a 1 inch steel rod for 
middle C, (C4) is 26 1/4 inch while it is 32 7/8 inch for a 1 inch steel EMT tube. In 
addition to smooth surface metal rods, I have tested  
steel rebar and the sound was awesome. Because of the hardness, rebar exhibited 
a wonderful sustain time which helped to hold on to the overtones. I did not test 
the accuracy of the DIY calculator but I suspect it will be close. I would 
suggest selecting your notes based on steel, and while the notes probably will 
not be completely accurate, the ratio among the notes should remain the same.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Two additional issues to 
consider are the weight and loudness difference. Rods typically have a relative 
small diameter offering a smaller radiating surface producing a quieter chime, 
but on occasion the longer sustain time can offset the reduced loudness and 
sound quite acceptable.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">1. Select the number of chimes (typically 3 to 10) for your set 
	and the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Note Selection">musical notes.</a> It is 
	helpful to understand the limitations for effective note selection as 
	discussed in the section on 
	<a target="_parent" href="#The_1st_chime_category">the bell-like chime</a>. 
	Keep in mind the physical size for the set. Whether you use pre-calculated 
	dimensions or a DIY calculator, observe the length for the longest 
	chime as a guide for overall size. Remember to include extra length for the 
	wind sail that hangs below the chimes. <b>

<a target="_parent" href="#A_Must_Read_Caution:">
<span>Read 
	this caution</span></a></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000">.</SPAN></b></SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">3. Cut each chime to the length provided by the pre-calculated 
	table or the DIY calculator. Best to cut slightly long (about 1/8”) to allow 
	for smoothing and de-burring the ends to final dimensions. </SPAN> </p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">4. Smooth the ends to remove sharp edges and to provide a 
	professional appearance. Place an old towel or cloth on a table to protect 
	the chime from scratches. Roll the chime back and forth as you file or sand 
	the ends smooth. Slightly chamfer or round the outer edge. </SPAN> </p><p>

		a V-block, center the block before drilling by lowering the drill bit to 
		the bottom of the vee and then clamp the block to the drill table.</SPAN></p><p>
		<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">How to drill the 
		support holes without a drill press or V-block: Using card stock or 
	a manila folder cut a strip about ½” by 8” or so, wrap it around the tube and tape 
	it so that you now have what looks like a “Cigar Band.” Remove the band and 
		lay it on a table. Flatten the band so a crease forms at both ends. Example: say that the 
	instructions ask for a hole 10 ½ inches from the end of the tube. Slide the “Creased Cigar 
	Band” down the tube to the 10 ½” inch mark. Position one crease at your mark 
		and then rotate the tube over to the second crease and mark that 
		location. Now you have drilling marks exactly opposite each other.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">6. Deburr the support holes in 
	preparation for your support line. Using a drill bit larger than the hole, 
	place the bit on the outside of the hole and rotate by hand. This is 
	generally enough to chamfer the outside hole.</SPAN></p><div>

<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Thanks to Dennis Offner for a 
tip about deburring. An alternate approach for deburring could be the deburring 
tools available from the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cogsdill.com/">
Cogsdill Tool Company</a>.Â They manufactures several types of deburring 
tools that deburr the outside then collapse to pass through the hole and then 
expand to deburr the back side of the hole. Using an electric drill, a set of 
chime tubes can be deburred in just a few minutes.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">7. Select the method or style for the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Support_Plate">top support disk or ring</a> and the material to be used. 
	</SPAN> 
	</p>
	<p>
	<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">For a long time, my 
	favorite material has been treated lumber used for decking, although it did need 
	a weatherproofing sealer. Also, white, or red cedar works well coated with a 
	weatherproof sealer. The engineered wood for decks makes an excellent 
	support plate and striker. If you know of someone installing a new deck 
	using engineered wood, perhaps you can get a few scraps. One board is 
	expensive and may not be worth the cost, but scraps are useful. Also, a 
	half-inch thick nylon cutting board (old or new) works well. Some people 
	will shop flea markets for that special circular disk made of most anything 
	from metal to plastic plates, etc. In addition, wandering the aisles of Home 
	Depot, Lowe&#39;s, Target, Mendelssohn&#39;s and your local drugstore have produced 
	some surprising circular disk that can be drilled and are long lasting in 
	the weather.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">8. Select the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Support_Plate">top support disk cutout 
	pattern</a> for your specific tubing size and number of chimes in the set. 
	Download the support disk and striker patterns from the website and just 
	print the page specific to your tubing size and number of chimes in the set. 
	You may need to print two copies, one for the support pattern and hole 
	locations, and one for the striker pattern. 
				
				
				
				To assist the wind striking all chimes use a fishing spinner for 
support. This allows the wind to slightly rotate the chime set. (Thanks to Terry 
for the suggestion.)</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">9. Select either a circular striker, a radial star striker, or a 
	striker-keeper, all are included in theÂ 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/documents/Wind_Chime_Support_Disk_and_Striker_Patterns.pdf">Wind Chime

<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">10. Select and print a pattern for the wind sail from selections 
	in 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Wind_Catcher">Patterns for Wind 
	Sails/Catchers</a> available on the website, or design your own design. 
</SPAN> 
			</p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">11. Weather protect the top support disk or ring, the striker and 
	the sail with a UV protective finish. Decorate the chime tube as desired.
	<a target="_parent" href="#Decorating_the_Chime">A few suggestions here.</a></SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">12. Select the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Support_Line">line, cord or chain</a> 
	for supporting both the chime tube and the top support disk. </SPAN> </p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">13. Select the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Strike_Zone">style for hanging the chime 
	tubes</a>, i.e. top aligned, center aligned or bottom aligned. Bottom 
	aligned is best because it allows the striker to easily contact the bottom 
	edge of all chimes, the ideal strike location. Top aligned may have a more 
	aesthetic appeal and on occasion some like center alignment. </SPAN> </p>
	<p>
	<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">Also, you want to keep the 
	distance between the chimes and the support desk quite short, no matter how 
	they are aligned.</SPAN>  </p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">14. Select the 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Chime_Location_Sequence">sequence for locating the 
	chimes</a> on the support disk or ring. </SPAN> </p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">15. Attach the support line or chain to the chime using a 
	<a target="_parent" href="#Jigs_to_position_chime_attaching_support_line">simple jig you can make.</a>Â  
	You can use an appropriately sized darning needle for threading line through 
	the top support holes and tubes during assembly. </SPAN> </p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">16. In your workshop, temporally hang the support disk 
	or ring just above eye level. Depending on your alignment selection (top, 
	bottom or center) hang each chime according to both the
<a target="_parent" href="#Chime_Location_Sequence">alignment requirement and 
	the chime sequence diagram. </a>Â Or you can use an 
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/documents/Chime_Support_Line_Jig.pdf">alignment jig as described 
	here.</a></SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">17. Hang the striker according to the alignment diagram and 
	avoid striking exact dead center for any chime. All three locations work 
	well when you keep the striker away from the center dead zone for the first 
	overtone. Don&#39;t worry about killing the first overtone with center 
	placement. The first overtone dead zone is very narrow and easily overcome 
	with a slightly off-center strike.</SPAN></p>

safe choice by many wind chime suppliers has been the pentatonic 
scale (C D E G A). An enhancement to that scale can be the C9 Chord (C E G B<sup>b</sup> 
and D) which has a wider note separation for a good sound both close in and at a 
distance from the chime.</SPAN>
<SPAN size="5">You can also select a chord to you liking to maximize the useable 
tubing in standard hardware store lengths. See this website to 
view all the piano chords <b> 
<a href="https://www.pianochord.org/">
www.pianochord.org</a></b>, Thanks to site visitor Lewis for this suggestion.</SPAN></p>
				
			<p><SPAN size="5">With that in mind, we have 
<a target="_self" href="#DIY_Calculators">DIY calculators</a> for 
all musical notes or for specific scales such as the pentatonic or the C9 Chord. 
You select the metal and the tubing 
size (ID and OD) and the calculator will provide the correct length and hang point for each 
note. 

			The longer the chime the lower the notes will sound. So if a specific 
tuning like WestminsterÂ  traditionally begins in the C3 octave, like 
B3-E4-F#4-G#4, feel free to begin an octave lower, like C2, which would look 
like this, B2-E3-F#3-G#3.</SPAN>

			</SPAN><b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">WALKING or TRAVELING CHIMES</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5"> Walking Chimes are chimes mounted on a stationary support, typically in a 
straight line, allowing the walker to strike each chime in sequence thus playing 
a song.
<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FwI3u_h8fS4">
Here is an example</a> by 
Carol Raedy</SPAN><p>
		<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Space the chimes so when the player 
walks at a steady pace it plays the song. Each word and dash represents a beat. 
You can use any length for the beat but it must be consistent. You could begin 
with one beat = 12 inches and modify from there.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">For instance: “Joy” counts as one beat, so you will 
measure six lengths from where you hang the “joy” bell (Joy plus five beats) and 
then hang the “to” bell. Measure one length from “to” to “the” and from “the” to 
“world” since there are no beat between these words. Measure eight lengths from 
“world” to “all” (world plus 7 more beats) and so. The beats at the end are only 
if you want to make it in the round.</SPAN></p>

			<SPAN face="Arial">

<SPAN size="5">Site visitor Carol Raedy graciously provided the following note patterns for 
each song.</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<b><SPAN size="5">Joy to the World by Hoyt Axton</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5"> Joy(E5) _ _ _ _ _ to(D5) the(C5) world(C5) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ </SPAN><p>

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Â If the musical scale doesn&#39;t seem logical to you, you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not logical 
to most of us non musicians. An octave is from C to the key just prior to the 
next C, which would be B. Below is a graphical diagram that may help clarify 
this.</SPAN>

</b>
			<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Ending your project with a successful and pleasing sound is 
important and setting the right expectations will allow that to happen. 
Selecting musical notes for a chime is <b>NOT</b> like selecting notes on a 
piano or other string instrument, or reed instrument. When you strike C2 on a 
piano that is indeed what you hear but <b>Not</b> true for a chime cut for C2.

			</SPAN>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Tuning implies 
exactness and exact tuning cannot happen when you do not hear the 
fundamental note for the chime. When a piano key for C2 (65.4 
Hz) is struck, you will indeed hear that note, 65.4 Hz. When a C2 chime is struck you 
will NOT hear 65.2 Hz. In fact. you will not hear the first overtone at 180 
Hz and can barely hear the second overtone at 352 Hz. Most prominent will be the 
third overtone at 582 Hz which, on a piano, sounds like D5, but is not D5 because 
the mixing for all the overtones produces a completely new sound. The new sound 
is melodious, it sounds wonderful, but what note is it? </SPAN>  </p>
			
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Tuning charts on 
this site list dimensions for notes ranging from C1 to C9, that imply exactness, 
which you now understand can not happen with a chime when you can&#39;t hear the 
fundamental note. Read more about the 
<a target="_parent" href="#The missing fundamental">missing fundamental here. 
</a>Why this 
happens is discussed in the section &#34;<a target="_parent" href="#The_Science_of_Chiming">The Science of Chiming</a>&#34;. 
			</SPAN>  
 
			
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">For example, an orchestra grade chime that is physically cut for 
C2 will actually sound about like C5. To see a visual representation for what a 
chime is apt to sound like, see this 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/300-3K.htm">chart.</a> On the 
other hand, will the strike note for a chime sound pleasing and bell-like? Yes, 
absolutely, because of the large complement of overtones, even though the 
fundamental is missing. </SPAN>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Selections from about C2 to C4 sound the most bell-like 
but will <b>not</b> adequately radiate the fundamental tone.
Unfortunately this effect complicates note selection if you are trying to strike 
exact notes lower than about C5. Above C5 the strike 
note will actually be the fundamental and you can expect to hear the selected note, 
but less bell-like than the C2 to C4 range. In fact, for that reason, orchestra grade chimes 
typically only cover 1 ½ octaves beginning at C5 and 
extend to about G6.</SPAN></p>

<b><SPAN color="#333333">Strike a note or strike a chord?</SPAN><br/>
</b>Over the years much effort by many well-intentioned people has 
been placed on exactly what is the best chord for a set of wind chimes? While a 
musical chord can be pleasing to the ear, the effort to simultaneously strike 
all the notes in a chord using the traditional circular shaped striker/clapper 
has been a waste of time. The striker only contacts one, maybe two 
chimes simultaneously. 

			</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN color="#000000" size="5">
			<p><SPAN size="5">This concept of sequencing and giving chime sets a 
			name like Corinthian Bells, Winchester or Pentatonic is a marketing 
			exercise to sell more chime sets. They do not play in sequence and 
			the listener will likely never identify what the random sounds from 
			a chime set really represent. They&#39;re just notes. Selling chimes 
			with an advertised famous sequence is marketing and advertising on 
			steroids, in my opinion.

			</SPAN>

			</p>
			<p><SPAN size="5">The good news is that with some of our innovative striker 
designs we can now almost strike a chord. More on this in the 
<a target="_parent" href="#The Striker:">striker section</a>. 

			</SPAN>

			</p>
			<p><SPAN size="5">Also, if you dedicate a striker to each chime tube 
(internal or external to the chime) that configuration can ring several chimes 
at nearly the same time and approximate a chord.
When using the traditional round striker it is much better to 
select notes that have a fair amount of separation allowing the ear to easily 
discern a variety of notes. 

			</SPAN>

			</p>
			<p><SPAN size="5">Often a traditional choice has been the pentatonic 
scale (C D E G and A.) This choice can sound pleasant close to the chime set but 
not so good at a distance. 

			</SPAN>

			</p>
			<p><SPAN size="5">The C9 chord (C E G B<sup>b</sup> and D) can be used to 
widen the note separations for a five-chime set. The problem at a distance is the ear has difficulty discerning the closely spaced notes of the pentatonic 
scale.

				<a name="Caution_at_a_distance">Caution at a distance</a></SPAN></b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
I often hear the comment, &#34;I have a set of chimes on my deck and they sound 
great. However, I was over to my neighbor’s the other day and the chimes did not 
sound so good. In fact, they sounded out of tune. </SPAN>

			</p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
Why is this?&#34; The answer lies 
in the conditions that make up the notes for the chime. As mentioned in the 
science section, a chime note is a combination of the fundamental strike 
frequency and the many overtones. Some of the overtones attenuate more rapidly 
than others at a distance. The original combination of strike frequency and 
overtones are not the same at a distance. </SPAN>

			</p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
Remember, not always does the 
fundamental frequency contribute to the note and not always are there many 
overtones for a given note.

 
			The actual note depends on exactly where in the musical scale the 
chime is operating. When you have a chime that contains a larger number of 
overtones that are located in the higher frequencies, and mostly missing the 
fundamental, you can get this distance effect. </SPAN>

			</p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
High frequency sounds attenuate 
more quickly in the atmosphere than do the lower frequencies. At a distance you 
are not hearing the same sound you hear close in. Some of the high frequency 
sounds can be greatly attenuated or missing. The chime can sound completely 
different under these conditions.</SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
Â Typically this occurs when you select notes in 
the lower part of the scale.
If your interest is making the chimes sound good at a distance of 
say 80-100 feet or more, consider increasing the diameter of the tubing from the 
traditional sizes ranging from half inch thru two inches, up to at least 3 inch 
or more; 4 to 6 inches are better. </SPAN>

			</p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
A set of chimes designed for the C2 to the C3 
octave have good acoustic radiation properties close to the set but not so good 
far away because of this distance effect. Additional information later on this 
page 
<a target="_self" href="#Loudness_limits">HERE</a>.

			</SPAN></p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">
			<p><b>Quieting the chime set</b>: Chimes can easily become annoying so maintaining 
a subtle sound is important, particularly in high winds. Softening the striker 
often helps in addition the use of the keeper-striker. Typical striker materials 
are a rubber hockey puck or other soft rubber coverings found in the plumbing 
section of the local hardware store.Â  Here are a couple examples.Â  

			</p>
			<p>The 
first example uses plastic aquarium tubing to cover the inside diameter of the 
keeper striker. 

			</p>
			<p>The second uses a 3 inch and a 4 inch section cut from of a PVC 
plug. for 3 or 4 inch PVC pipe.</p>

healing and therapy arts, or you because of the 
anticipated lower frequency sounds, similar to a large diameter gong, or because 
you have a commission for an artistic display in a public location, building 
big may not accomplish all your goals. 

			</SPAN></p><SPAN size="5">
			<p>Certainly, a set of long, large 
diameter chimes as shown to the right (built by Chris from Wisconsin) will 
sound awesome, but a few words of caution before you head in that direction.
Since you read the caution statement above about the missing fundamental and the 
issues with the small radiation surface area for a chime tube, you can 
better understand how the insensitivity of the human ear at low frequencies 
contributes to our inability to adequately hear the low notes, mostly below 
about C4. 

			</p>
			<p>I am often contacted from the website when someone wants to <i>Build 
Big</i>.Â  After completion of their large chime set they write to say, &#34;My 
new chime set sounds wonderful, but not as low as I expected.&#34;Â  
 

			</p>
			</SPAN><p><SPAN size="5">Beginning 
withÂ  the right expectations will help you move successfully along the 
design path. Large diameter long chime sets are definitely worth the effort. Be 
mindful of annoying nearby neighbors since this sound travels far.
Below is an attempt to demonstrate loudness and note selection at a distance.</SPAN>

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Most often the chime designer considers cost, weight and aesthetics. Your budget 
may not approve the cost of copper and aluminum may be more favorable than steel 
because of weight. Chimes from EMT (electrical conduit) are galvanized and 
resist rust but not the support hole or the ends. Rust could be an issue long 
term for EMT. For the purposes of chime design use the steel selection in the 
calculator if you&#39;re EMT (thin wall conduit)..</SPAN></p>

<p>
<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">What metal sounds best?</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
			After the issues above are considered we can move to the 
question of what metal sounds best for a tubular chime? The short answer is the 
thicker the wall and the larger the diameter, the better they sound, not 
necessarily the type of metal. </SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
			However, what sounds best is a personal choice 
and I have not found a good answer for everyone. Some like a deep rich sound and 
other like the tinkle tinkle sound. </SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> 
			Copper chimes have a different timbre than 
steel chimes. The best I can advise is to visit a chime shop and test-drive a 
few chimes of different metals and different sizes.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">When selecting tubing size and 
you&#39;re undecided between two sizes, select the tubing with more mass. More mass 
will produce a better sustain time. This selection may be the chime with a 
thicker wall or a larger diameter. </SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">On small diameter chimes (about 1/2 to 1 1/4 
inch) do not use tubing with an unusually thick wall. When the wall thickness is 
large compared to the diameter, the extra stiffness can actually inhibit sustain 
time. </SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Always test the sound of tubing before deciding, particularly if you are 
evaluating several sizes. Support the tube at the 22.4% location using a string, 
and strike with something like a heel of a hard rubber shoe or a wood mallet.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">You may hear someone say they like aluminum best or copper best. To better 
understand the difference in metals let’s build two 5-tube sets of 
chimes using the C9 chord beginning with the C2 octave. One set from aluminum, 
2” OD with a 1/8” wall thickness, and the other set from steel, 2” OD with a 
1/8” wall thickness. While each set will have different calculated lengths, they 
will both strike the same fundamental note, but sound completely differently. Why is 
that?</SPAN></p>
			<p>
			<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Contrary to intuition there are 
			only two variables that control the sound of a chime, i.e. the 
			density andÂ  elasticity of the metal. Those two variables control 
			the specific length dimensions to achieve a desired note for a given 
			tubing size and wall thickness. </SPAN></p>
			<p>
			<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">From the chart below you can see that aluminum has the lowest density and the lowest 
			modulus of elasticity (deforms easier than the others) , while 
			copper has the highest density but is only midrange for elasticity.</SPAN></p>
			<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">What does all this have to do with what metal sounds best? The 
			differences among metals cause a difference in timbre for the same 
			note.</SPAN></p><table>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">On occasion you may hear someone say they like aluminum chimes 
best. That likely occurs because the lower modulus of elasticity for aluminum 
requires less strike energy for resonant activation and for a given input of 
strike energy. The aluminum chime can be louder and have an increased sustain 
time. However, the difference among metals does not make one metal good and 
another bad. There are no bad sounding chimes when the notes are properly 
selected, teh tubes are properly tuned and properly mounted. It&#39;s impossible to have a set of chimes for the 
same note range made from aluminum sound the same as a set made from steel or 
any other metal, because of their difference in density and elasticity.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">If you want the smallest possible chime set for a given note range use brass. 
Opposite to brass, EMT will provide the largest physical set for a given note 
range. For example, see the table below organized smallest to largest for 
middle C (C4).</SPAN></p>

<SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">A 45° cut at the bottom or top of the tube can add a nice 
aesthetic touch; however, the tuning for each chime tube 
will change considerably from the 90° cut value. The shorter the chime the more the tuning will 
change. For example, here are the changes for a 5-chime set made from 
2 inch OD aluminum with a wall of .115 inch. The set was originally cut for the 
pentatonic scale (CDEGA)Â beginning at C6 using 90° 
cut tubing. After a 45° cut at the bottom end of each tube, 
the tuning increased from about 5% to 9% depending on length. Unfortunately, the 
rate of change was not linear, but a value 
specific to each length of tubing. Tuning increase was C6 =+5.5%, D =+6.6%, E 
=+7.5%, G =+7.6% and A=+8.8%. Your notes may change more or less than these.</SPAN></SPAN></p><SPAN face="Arial">

			<SPAN size="5">Additional testing was performed for a number of 
different diameters and different lengths using aluminum, copper and steel 
tubing. The results were very consistent. Short thin-walled tubing of any 
diameter changed the most and long thick-walled tubing of any diameter changed 
the least. Short tubing (around 20 inches) could increase the tuning by as much 
as 9 to 10%. Long tubing (35 to 40 inches or more) could change as little 
as 2%. It was impossible to predict the change other than the trend stated above 
for short vs. long. This was not surprising because shorting a tube will 
naturally increase the note frequency.</SPAN></SPAN>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">If you want to maintain exact tuning using a 45° cut, cut the 
tube longer than the value suggested by the DIY calculator or the pre-calculated 
tables, and trim to final value using your favorite tuning method. If exact tuning is not required or important, cut the 
tubing to the suggested length by the calculator to pre-calculated chart, and trim the end at 45°.</SPAN></p>

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">If you are attempting to create exact notes for an orchestra setting, exact 
tuning is required and the use of an electronic tuning device or a good tuning 
ear is necessary. On the other hand, if you desire a good sounding set of chimes 
but do not need orchestra accuracy, then carefully cut and finish to the 
length suggested by the

			Non linearity of the human ear and a chime&#39;s non-harmonic overtones are two 
reasons.</SPAN><SPAN face="Arial" size="5"></SPAN><SPAN size="5" color="#000000" face="Arial"></SPAN></p><SPAN size="5" color="#000000" face="Arial">

Chromatic tuners listen and display sound as it is being produced on a linear 
basis for both amplitude and frequency, but our brain process the same 
information using <i>fuzzy logic</i>. Why is this a problem? </SPAN> </p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Unfortunately, the human ear is 
no doubt the most non-linear and narrowband 
sound listening device we know of. Similar to other percussion instruments, 
chimes do not produce fundamental frequencies and pure harmonic 
frequencies like string instruments, wind tubes and reed instruments, for which 
chromatic tuners are intended. </SPAN>  </p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Instead, there are numerous non-harmonic overtones present which (depending on 
their individual frequency and amplitude) can be predominant to a tuner or 
analyzer, but make little or no difference to the human ear. A chromatic tuner 
may display the predominant amplitude and frequency, but that may not be what 
the ear actually perceives. Because of the brain&#39;s &#34;fuzzy logic&#34; characteristic, 
the many overtones associated with a particular chime fundamental frequency, 
combine to produce a musical note the brain recognizes, but may not be 
recognized by a chromatic tuner.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">It is difficult to provide an exact recommendation when to use the tuner to 
measure a chime&#39;s note, but in general, I find most any note below C4 difficult 
to measure and on occasion below C5. Long, low frequencies tubes, mostly measure 
incorrectly because of the &#34;missing fundamental effect&#34; and the preponderance of 
high amplitude overtones. Thick-walled tank chimes/bells can measure with 
surprising accuracy because of a single pure tone above C4 that is not cluttered 
with unimportant sidebands. However, thin-walled tank chimes/bells seem not to 
do as well and they may be impossible to measure accurately.</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">In addition, poor quality tubing exhibiting dual fundamentals, will 
cause the chromatic tuner to constantly switch between the two fundamentals, 
both of which are incorrect. If you are not displaying the note you expected, 
try moving the chime further away from the tuner to help minimize unimportant 
frequencies. </SPAN>  </p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">If you get a good steady 
reading that is not what you expected, the tuner is 
listening to a predominant overtone, so just ignore that measurement. Using the 
values for length provided by the tables and DIY calculators on this page will 
get you very close to the exact note. If the tuner cannot make a believable 
measurement, use the calculated length for the chime.</SPAN></p>

				The ideal chime support location to allow for a lengthy sustain time is 
positioned at either of two locations; at the fundamental frequency node located 
22.42% from either end, or at the very end using a string or cable threaded 
through an end cap. 
 
 

				</SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				If sustain time is not a requirement (which makes a tubular chime, a bell 
sounding chime) such as for orchestra chimes pictured to 
the right, then support can be through horizontal holes near the end of the 
tube. A chime supportedÂ in this manner reduces most of the sustain 
time. I do NOT recommend this method of support to achieve a great sounding set 
of Â chimes.
</SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				You may see commercial wind chimes supported in this manner, but they 
cannot support the tradition bell-like sound that you may be expecting. 
Incorrect support ranks as the number one mistake made by some commercial chimes 
sets on the internet and in stores. They will produce a strike 
note but lack the rich resonant bell-like sound that results from proper 
support. </SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				<b>The 
first support</b><SPAN size="5">
method for a bell-like sustain time uses the traditional fundamental

mode diagram at the right.
		

				An important objective for a bell-like chime is to preserve the resonance of the 
chime as long as possible. 
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				Accurate placement for the support holes helps to 
assure the high quality (Q) or hang-time or sustain time for the chime. A hole 
size of 1/16 inch can be drilled directly on the location mark but for larger 
holes, try to place the top of the hole so it aligns with the location mark.
If you&#39;re curious about other support locations, it is possible to support the 
chime at the first, second or third overtone node, but not recommended. </SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				All 
charts and calculations on this page are for the support line to be located at 
the fundamental frequency node which is 22.42 % from either end and is the 
optimum location.
If you happen to have a background in both mechanical vibration 
and acoustic vibration, it is easy to confuse overtones and harmonics. Overtones 
= Harmonics -1, or Harmonics = Overtones + 1. </SPAN></SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">

				This acoustic harmonic 
relationship has no connection to the radio frequency definition of harmonics.

making this nice steel 10-chime set, site visitor David, made a good video

vibration nodes and a small pile of sand. See his video here

I place a copper wire into a copper pipe and threaded it thru one of the hanging

tube), and the same for the other hanging hole. Now I have 2 copper wires coming 
out the inside top of the pipe. I chuck them up to a drill motor and twist, 
being careful not to kink the wire. Twisting will center the wires in the tube 
and leave a good looking single wire coming out the center of the pipe. This 
also would work with steel tubing. This seems to work okay andÂ it looks

<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">End Cap, the second support location </SPAN> </b> 
			<SPAN size="5"><SPAN face="Arial">is when the chime tube is supported by a cable or cord through a hole in an end 
cap. 
</SPAN>
</SPAN>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial" size="5">It is important to understand that the end cap lowers the fundamental 
frequency and some associated overtones from values calculated by the DIY 
calculator or Pre-calculated charts. For 1/2 inch copper tubing type L, the 
fundamental is lowered by about 3% to 6% from calculated values on this page. 
For 3/4 inch type L copper tubing the fundamental is lowered by about 11% to 12%. 
</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial" size="5">The good news is that the end cap noticeably increases the duration for the 
first overtone and the chime has a much more bell-like sound. Look at these two 
spectral waterfall displays and specifically compare the hang time of the 1st 
overtone for each. You will notice a considerable increase in sustain time for 
the end cap supported tube.

	end. The end cap is a special case that allows resonance to exist without 
	seriously reducing the sustain time. But adding a screw eye or any amount of 
	mass to the end can kill the sustain time for a rod. The easy solution that 
	works very well is to drill a small hole in the end of the rod and epoxy a 
	50 pound (22 Kg) woven fishing line into the hole. First tie a knot at the end prior to 
	inserting the line into the hole. This low mass and flexible connection do

			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> This fun and easy DIY project has a couple of important 
	requirements.Â  </SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> First, mounting follows the same requirement as above, 
	i.e. locate the support holes 22.4% from both ends. Rubber grommets help to 
	minimize the reduction of sustain time caused by a firm mounting, but are 
	not absolutely necessary for this application. </SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> Rubber has a tendency to 
	deteriorate over time and the use of a nylon or plastic sleeve would be a 
	good alternate. </SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> Firm and strong mounting is definitely a requirement for the 
	playground environment, but we need to prevent squeezing the tube at the 
	mounting location. Careful adjustment, when tightening bolts, can prevent 
	this squeeze.</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> Â Keep the mounting somewhat firm to prevent the undesirable 
	BUZZ caused by loose mounting. Flexible grommets allow a firm mounting that 
	will prevent the buzz.</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5"><b>A better arrangement</b> is to insert the the 
			bolt into one side of the chime, no all the way through. This 
			prevents squeezing the chime while maintaining a firm mount to 
			withstand playground play.</SPAN></p>

	<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Keep the distance between the chimes and the support disk shortÂ  no matter how they are aligned.
	This is to assist alignment during high winds. If they dangle too far below 
	to the support disk, they can bump into each other and occasionally get 
	mixed up. A few inches would be best. </SPAN>  </p>
	<p>
	<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Longevity for a chime is important and careful attention to 
	the support lines and thru holes should be considered. Rapid wind changes 
	and UV light can quickly deteriorate support lines, not to mention the many 
	freeze/thaw cycles.</SPAN></p>
	<p>
	<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Non metallic support line:</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> Make sure the line is UV 
	resistant. Choices include fishing line (either 80 pound braided or 30-50 
	pound 
	monofilament), braided nylon line, braided plumb line, braided Dacron kite 
	line, string trimmer/weed eater line (.065 inch), 
	awning cord, and braided electrical conduit pull line.</SPAN></p>

	<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Metallic support line:</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> thin wire, decorative chain 
	(zinc plated, brass plated, or painted), 1/32 or /16 inch stainless steel cable (rust 
	resistant), small aircraft control line cable.</SPAN></p>
	<p>
<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">De-burring: </SPAN> </b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">depending on where the support line exits the 
	chime, from the inside or outside, one or the other sharp edges 
	of the thru hole require de-burring. An easy method to de-burr the outside 
	edges of the thru hole is to use a larger drill bit to slightly chamfer the 
	outer edges. If the inside edge of the thru hole is of concern, first remove 
	the burr using a long round file or sandpaper on a stick.</SPAN></p>
	<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">By hand, insert the smooth shaft end of the drill bit or other 
	hardened steel rod into the hole and rotate in a circular motion, careful 
	not to break the drill bit. This motion will tend to further chamfer the 
	outside edge and help to burnish the inner edge of the hole. </SPAN>  </p>
	<p>
<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Grommets/Eyelets: </SPAN> </b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">are mostly for protecting the outside edge of the thru 
	hole.<b> </b> Rubber, plastic or metal (grommets or eyelets) are encouraged, 
	but small sizes can be a challenge to locate. Small eyelets can often be 
	located at your local hobby store in the sewing department or at shoe repair 
	store. You can also use the outer shell of an 1/8 inch or 3/16 inch aluminum 
	pop rivet. Remove the nail-like center and just use the rivet.</SPAN></p>

chimes, of course, need a human to strike the chime and a rawhide-covered rubber 
mallet works well. A rawhide-covered baseball or softball can work well for wind 
chimes, but only in an extremely high wind environment where there is ample strike 
energy from the sail. An orchestra chime is struck with gusto, but a 
wind chime often has little strike energy. Typically there is little 
strike energy from normal winds so preserving and applying that energy is the 
challenge. Design considerations below include single or multiple strikers, the 
shape, weight, material, suspension, motion, and strike 
location.

location will assure that all possible overtones are energized to the maximum. 
This should not be surprising since orchestra chimes are struck at the end. </SPAN> </SPAN>
	
			
	</p>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">An 
easy solution to assuring the strike occurs at the very end of the chime is to 
use bottom alignment and a tapered striker as shown in

			</SPAN> </SPAN>
	
			
	</p>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">Often you will see the center selected as the strike location for a tubular bell 
wind chime, perhaps for aesthetic reasons. When the exact center of the chime is 
struck the odd numbered overtones can fail to energize, and the resulting sound 
can be very clunky even though the even numbered overtones were well energized. 
			</SPAN> </SPAN>
	
			
	</p>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">While I recommend striking the end of the chime, there are good aesthetic 
reasons to align the chimes for a center alignment or a top alignment. The ideal 
strike zone is about 1 inch from the end, or about an inch below the center, 
line as pictured below. All three locations work okay when you keep the striker 
away from dead center, which is a dead 
zone for the first overtone. </SPAN> </SPAN>
	
			
	</p>
			<p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5">Don&#39;t worry much about killing the first overtone 
with center placement. The first overtone dead zone is very narrow and easily 
overcome with a slightly off-center strike.

			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>Striker Weight:</b> A heavy striker for large chimes and a 
lighter weight striker for smaller chimes, is mostly true. Depending on yourÂ  
typical wind there may be occasions when you need a light weight 
striker for large chimes. </SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Near the seashore, winds can be rather strong and you 
may need to soften the strike with a light weight striker or switch to a 
rawhide-covered baseball or softball. Considerable strike energy can be achieved 
by using an oak disk machined to a knife-edge and loaded with a 1oz weight. See
<a href="#Striker_Suggestions">striker suggestions </a>
below.</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>Striker Distance from Chimes</b>: It is difficult to predict the optimum 
distance from the edge of the striker to the chime for a new design and often 
requires experimentation. Additional factors effecting overall performance are 
striker weight, wind sail size, sail weight and average wind conditions in the 
area. 

			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">I generally begin with a 1-inch separation and begin testing. Then maybe 
change the separation and/or the sail size.</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Â Don&#39;t hesitate to abandon your 
original striker or sail and try a different separation or a different wind 
sail. 

			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Your effort will be rewarded when you hit that magic combination. Often, I 
will try about three strikers and two or three sails before finding the perfect 
combination.

<img src="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/graphics/top.gif" width="50" height="50"/></a></b> <b>Striker Material: </b>
The choice of material depends somewhat on the note 
selection. If there is good movement from the wind sail, then a circular disk 
striker (soft sided but heavy) can be used for the larger diameter chimes (say 
above 2 inches), particularly for lower frequency 
chimes. Some choices are a hockey puck, redwood, red cedar, treated lumber or a 
1/4 inch nylon cutting board. 
 
 

			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>Bullet Nose Edge: </b>
If you want a rounded over edge for the circular wood 
striker and don&#39;t have access to a router then you can easily accomplish that 
task with a drill press or hand drill. Mount the striker in a drill press via a 
center bolt and then spin it at a high speed to sand it round and round over the 
edge. You could use a hand drill but it&#39;s a little more awkward.
			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>
Note:</b> when drilling a center hole in the hockey 
puck, the drill bit wants to grab and force its way through the rubber and may 
drill off-center. My experience is to slow down the drill and secure the puck to 
a surface so it can’t move, then drill very slowly. A drill press woks best but 
again, secure the puck.
			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">If the wind is quite strong and gusty, you may need to soften the striker even 
further by using a rawhide-covered baseball/softball. The rawhide helps to 
produce a very mellow strike in a strong wind. Smaller diameter higher frequency 
chimes benefit from a harder wood like white oak, teak or Osage-orange aka 
hedge-apple. Be sure to coat the striker with a UV resistant coating.
			</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">On the other hand, a well performing star-striker should be from 
a relatively hard material, yet light weight, allowing for a quick response to 
circular movements.</SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Â The loudness of chimes struck with a star striker is 
reduced, compared to the circular striker, because the strike energy has been 
distributed among the various chimes, and a harder material is required for a 
strong strike. 1/8 inch soft aluminum, sheet plastic or a 1/4 inch nylon cutting 
board works well to accomplish 
both goals. </SPAN></p>
			<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>
			Keep it Clean:
			
			</b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">A dirty strike can energize a host of 
unwanted spurious sideband frequencies as demonstrated by the steel striker in 
the blueÂ spectrum display below. A most melodious bell sound is achieved with a 
softer strike that energizes overtones without spurious sidebands, as shown in 
the purple spectrum display below.</SPAN></SPAN></p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Both strikers

hides a lead or steel striker on the inside the chime for large diameters chimes, mostly 
above two inches as pictured left and right. 
</p>
			<p>
This technique is seldom used 
unless the chime set is large or becomes annoying, caused by the traditional disk 
striker in high winds. Because the distance is insufficient for the striker to 
gain momentum and strike with gusto, the inside striker could be a good solution 
to quieting chimes in high winds. 
</p>
			<p>
If you&#39;re looking for a muted sound from a 
large set, maybe 4 inches and above, this technique is useful. The striker can 
be a steel ball or a lead weight, normally 
used as a sinker for fishing, and can be any of the following: a cannon ball 
sinker, a bell sinker, a bank sinker or an egg sinker. 
</p>
			<p>
Wrap the sinker 
with about two layers of black electrical tape to prevent the harsh sound from a 
metal strike yet still provide a strong but muted strike. Support for the 
striker string or line from can be from the same point you use to support the 
chime tube.
</p>
			<p><b>Striker Motion:</b> I happen to live in 
a wooded area with little wind and have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/chime_pic/striker_resonance.jpg">
<img src="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/chime_pic/striker_resonance_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="chime_pic/striker_resonance.jpg" title="WIND CHIME STRIKER RESONANCE" title="WIND CHIME STRIKER RESONANCE"/></a>struggled to achieve good strike energy 
from low winds. With that in mind, 
I set out to improve the low wind performance of the striker.
			</p>
			<p>The objective is to maximize striker movement with little input 
energy from the sail. The easy solution was to resonant the support line that 
supports both the striker and the sail using the second mode bending principle. 
			</p>
			<p>This resonance will help to amplify and sustain the motion of the striker with 
little input energy from the sail. Even though the sail moves in the wind, 
it will act as an anchor for the resonant movement of the striker.
</p>
			<p>You can easily recognize this movement by using both hands to 
hold a string vertically and have a second person pluck the center of the 
string. The natural resonance of the string will cause the center to vibrate. If 
you position the striker at the exact center between the top and the sail you 
can achieve this resonance.
									Â 
</p>
			<p>It is difficult to provide an exact ratio between the weight of 
the striker and the weight of the sail. Depending on the actual weight for both 
the ratios can be quite different. In general, when you attempt to resonant the 
striker line, I suggest the striker not exceed the weight of the sail and 
ideally the striker should be about 1/2 the weight of the sail. </p>
			<p>I realize that 
if you use a CD as the sail, a lighter weight striker can be difficult to 
achieve. A heavy striker is difficult to resonant regardless of the weight 
for the sail.</p>
			<p>Â Once you have a striker you like then a little experimenting with 
the sail maybe required to achieve good resonance.
On the other hand, for medium to high winds and for a 
non-resonant mounting, the wind catcher/sail should have a weight less than 25% 
of the striker.
When resonance is working well you will notice as the sail comes 
to rest, the striker will continue to bounce off the chimes for a few more 
strikes, an indication the striker is dissipating the stored energy from 
resonance. </p>

the support line in the hole of the CD and tie to the line an object larger than 
the hole such as a shot piece of dowel rod or colorful section of cloth. Now you

from a single support line as pictured to the right. The very nature of the wind

Yes, there is a condition when 
excessive pendulum movement of the sail is useful and not sufficiently supplied 
by the tradition wind sail. With the development of the keeper-striker or the 
radial-striker, both of which are very effective in striking a musical chord, 
there is a need for a robust movement of the striker.

The radial striker 
produces a more muted sound because the strike energy is simultaneously 
distributed among all the chimes by moving in a circular motion. Thus the need 
for a more robust strike.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p><p><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5"><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5"><SPAN size="5">

Long and large diameter chimes present a considerable surface area to the wind

sail. In addition, the large diameter striker, often associated with a large 
chime set, can capture adequate wind for a good strike. </SPAN>

Depending on the distance 
between the striker and the chime tube, not all chime sets require a sail.

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Out of service compressed gas/air cylinders, scuba diving tanks 
or fire extinguishers are often cut and used as a chime or bell. Based on 
physical measurements can we pre-determine a musical note for these tanks? To 
the best of my research I do not find a mathematical method for calculating a 
musical note for these tanks. Both the neck-end and the base-end seriously alter 
the vibration performance of the cylinder rendering existing formulas useless. 
			</SPAN>  
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">However, once the tank has been cut to your desired length it is 
easy work to determine the fundamental frequency using an analysis program like
<a target="_blank" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>®, a free, open 
source, cross-platform software for recording and editing sounds.

			</SPAN>  
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Energizing all the overtones and avoiding the harsh sound when 
using a metal striker can be a challenge. A golf ball or baseball can work well 
but requires a robust strike to properly energize the overtones. I have 
not had good success using a wood striker unless it&#39;s a really robust strike not 
typically possible with a normal wind sail.</SPAN>

<b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Tank Length Matters or Maybe Not?</SPAN></b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> A most perplexing situation 
can exist for some tank lengths. We tested five sets of tank chimes, sets A, B, 
C, D, and E pictured to the right. All chimes for sets D and E sounded distinctly 
different and each had a different height, and a different fundamental frequency 
and overtone structure; however, not true for sets A, B, and C. </SPAN> </SPAN> 
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">In comparison, each chime in set A sounded exactly the same and 
had nearly identical fundamental frequencies and nearly identical overtones, but 
represented three different lengths. The same was true for sets B and C. There 
was a slight difference in timbre among the bells, but a considerable difference in length for each 
set. </SPAN> </SPAN>

has both a neck-end and a base-end chime from a compressed-gas cylinder. While 
both chimes strike almost exactly the same fundamental frequency (295 Hz vs. 290 
Hz), they are of different lengths and have a slightly different timbre but 
sound mostly the same. Tank B was more melodious than tank A but not a lot The difference in overtone structure is pictured to the right.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">I investigated circular mode resonance which is a function of 
just material type, OD and wall thickness, and not length, as a possible 
explanation for this effect. Unfortunately the circular mode resonance was 
considerably lower than the observed resonance and offered no correlation to the 
actual measurements. The calculated vs. observed resonances were as follows: 
Calculated circular mode resonance were Set A = 35.4 Hz vs. 133 Hz; Set B= 29.7 
Hz vs. 290 Hz; Set C= 71.7 Hz vs. 354 Hz. The formula was provided by 
Chuck from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/chuckchimes/">Chuck&#39;s Chimes </a>and is: F = 
(T/(2*D^2))*SQRT(E/Density) where F = frequency, E = modulus of elasticity, D = 
mean diameter, and T = wall thickness. </SPAN>
			</SPAN> 
			
			

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">I remain a bit perplexed on exactly why length appears to have 
little effect on the fundamental frequency and the overtones structure above 
some critical length point. Clearly this was not a rigorous scientific test, but 
enough to cause concern and points to need for further investigation.</SPAN>

			<SPAN size="5">What is a Tubular Bell Chime</SPAN></a></SPAN><SPAN size="5">?</SPAN>
<br/>
</SPAN>

</b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Tubular chimes date to prehistoric times for a number of cultures, back nearly 
5,000 years. Tubular bells chimes were developed in the 1880&#39;s when using 
regular bells in an orchestra setting became impractical. Tubular bells closely 
imitate church bells and the practice of using a resonant tube as a bell soon 
flourished and became the traditional orchestra bell.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Traditional church bells or tubular bells can be characterized by their strike 
note. That bell-like strike note can be expanded to include the overtone 
structure, sustain time and loudness. That sounds simple enough, but imbedded in 
that explanation are two definitions. The firstÂ  definition is when a 
chime, properly designed and constructed, can imitate a bell, and the second 
definition is that a chime may not imitate a bell. Our objectives is to assist 
you to achieve the most bell-like sound as possible.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Compared to a string or brass musical instrument, designingÂ  a tubular bell 
chime presents a unique challenge not experienced elsewhere. Although unique, 
building a great set of tubular bells can be easily understood and implemented. 
Ending your project with a successful and pleasing sound is important and 
setting the right expectations will allow that to happen. The information below 
may help you to better set realistic expectations. </SPAN>  Â </p><div>

</b></SPAN><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"> One of the largest differences between a chime and other 
musical instruments is loudness. Loudness depends on the physical size of the 
chime i.e. the radiating surface area. Compared to a string instrument where a 
sounding board is used to amplify the vibration of the string, or compared to a 
brass instrument that is fitted with a flared tube to amplify the loudness, a 
chime has no amplifying assistance, other than the inherent surface area of the 
chime tube. Overall, this loudness limitation for a typically sized chime-set 
will provide serious limitations for the available range of effective note 
selection.</SPAN><p>

the really large mega chimes, then good loudness is easily achieved. For 
example, shown left is a large chime-set from
Sandra 
Bilotto.</SPAN></p><p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">An exception is when the resonant frequency of the tube matches the air column 
resonance for the tube, as described by Chuck from <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/chuckchimes/home">Chuck&#39;s Chimes</a>. 
Assistance from the energized air column adds a small amount of loudness.</SPAN></p></div>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">The second limitation for loudness from a tubular chime 
depends on the location of the selected note compared to the natural sensitivity 
of the human ear. You can view the loudness sensitivity range vs. frequency of 
the ear by viewing the Fletcher/Munson <a target="_blank" href="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/documents/Acoustics226-2003.pdf">Equal Loudness Curves</a>. 
The ear has more sensitivity in the range from about 300 Hz to about 4 KHz, than 
at other frequencies and helps to explain why we can not always hear all the 
overtones, even if they are present. This loudness limitation will have a direct 
affect on what notes work best for a chime.</SPAN></p><p>

<b>The 
3<sup>rd</sup> chime category (non bell-like)
</b>has a note range from about C6 through the C8 octave. Not unlike other 
percussion instruments this category is characterized by an audible fundamental 
strike frequency (a noticeable pure tone) with overtones mostly absent. 
Overtones have minimal contribution to the perceived musical note. This note 
range may not be particularly pleasing to the ear but should not be ignored as a 
pure tone, and is definitely a non-bell sounding chime. In addition, the 
loudness is typically low caused by the short length of the chime causing a low 
radiating surface for the higher notes. The rapid attenuation of high 
frequencies in the environment causes this note range to quickly diminish at a 
distance.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p><p><SPAN size="5"><SPAN face="Arial"><SPAN size="5"><SPAN color="#333333"><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Clearly there is more to a chime than I had anticipated and I am sure I have not 
learned all that there is to know about the physics of a chime. This was 
originally a Christmas present for my daughters and not a focused research 
project.Â </SPAN><p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">I am convinced that it is not necessary to hand tune a set of bell-like 
chimes designed for musical notes from fundamental C2 through C4 because the 
formula achieves the desired frequency well within 1 Hz. Tuning to achieve an 
accuracy closer than 1 Hz was a waste of time. </SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial">However, for a fundamental note 
from C5 and up, good tuning is required. Good physical measurements are 
important to achieve the calculated accuracy.</SPAN>
			My favorite design has changed over the years and is currently an 
end cap supported chime with the striker contacting the tube at the very bottom 
of the chime using either a tapered striker or a star striker, and having the 
wind rotate the chime set using a single line support for the support disk. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I know of no formula for calculating the length of a chime tube 
with an end cap. I begin with a length from standard calculations on this page 
and then tune by trimming off the length. End caps lower the frequency by as 
much as 8% to 15%, which requires removal of material to raise the tuning back 
to the correct vale. </p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s a lot of work if you want exact tuning for a 
tapered end!
On occasion I have added an end cap to the calculated value 
for an open end tube in order to gain a more bell-like sound, but not adjusted 
the length to regain accurate tuning. </p>
<p>For the most part, it has been difficult 
to acoustically tell the difference between the un-tuned chime set with an end 
caps and a set of tuned chimes without end caps. Perhaps I have been lucky or 
maybe the natural shift caused by the end cap is consistent for all five tubes 
and they remain mostly in tune.
			</p>
<p>Your particular type of wind (single-direction or turbulent) and 
wind speed will determine the best choice for both the wind sail and for the 
chime striker. Rotating the chime-set works well to solve the dingdong sound 
caused from low velocity single directions winds.</p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Another phenomena we observed, but did not have time to 
investigate, was the simultaneous production of sound from the natural bending 
mode of the chime coinciding with the resonance of the air column for the tube.

<SPAN face="Arial">
<SPAN size="5" color="#008000">Answer</SPAN><SPAN size="5">: </SPAN> </SPAN> </b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">An excellent question and you read 
correctly. The chime will produce the C2 note at 65.4 Hz, no problem, but the 
ear will not hear it? To hear 65.4 Hz we need to move a lot of air, thus the 
need for woofers used in sound systems. If you place your ear about an inch 
from the long tube &#34;Surprise&#34; you hear the 65.4 Hz, it’s actually there. But, back up two feet and you won’t 
hear it. </SPAN> </SPAN>  </p>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">What you actually hear is a chime note missing both the fundamental (65.4 Hz) 
and the first overtone (180 Hz). You hear the remaining overtones.</SPAN></p>

<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
So what to do? You can still make the long tubes cut for the C2 octave. The 
larger size will enhance the overtones (second overtone, 353 Hz and up) and you 
will hear lower notes than without using long tubes, but it will not be the 
actual C2 note.Â  If you happen to have a small public address amplifier and 
microphone, place the microphone about an inch from the tube. Again C2 is 
actually there, but it needs amplification to be audible.

treated lumber. If that is inadequate try hard maple or oak. Also, the size of 
the wind sail is important here. Try different sizes until you achieve the sound

<b>Can I use nickel-silver tubing?</b>
Is there a 
way to calculate the hang points based on your tables? ID on one tube is 0.5 
inch, the other 2 are 5/8 inch. My son, in the marching band, believes his 
trombone is a weapon of mass destruction. After 3 rebuilds, I have tubing from 
the leftover parts that I wish to turn into a wind chime. I asked the mechanic 
about the composition of the tubing (brass or ?) and he said it was 
nickel-silver. Sure enough, it has a pleasant high-pitched ring despite the long 
(30 inch) length. However, the hang points don&#39;t seem to correspond to the brass 
or aluminum columns in your table. </SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">
<b><SPAN color="#008000">Answer</SPAN>:
</b>Only two issues effect the sound from one metal to another, density and 
elasticity. The density of nickel-silver is 0.31 Lbm / in<sup>3</sup> and 
the elasticity is 18,500,000 psi. You can see from the chart at the right,Â  
nickel-sliver is very close to copper. I would suggest using the copper charts 
for the pre-calculated measurements or use copper in the DIY calculator. The

<b>
I am working on a Mark Tree chime set</b> (bar 
chimes, used by percussionists and drummers, pictured right). I checked on the 
commercial ones and they all use the same hang point on the bars. It may be 
because it is cheaper and quicker to make them this way and they look good, but 
will not sound as good as the 22.4% hanging point method? I&#39;d like to hear your 
opinion about this topic! 
</SPAN></p>
<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
As a footnote, my neighbor (a very practical engineer) built a xylophone and did 
some experimenting with support points for the bars. He did not know bout the 
22.4% rule. His choice was 22% from 
each end because that location provided the best sustain time and the best 
sound. I completely agree with his findings (22.4%).

<b>Chimes not Chiming!<br/>
</b>I recently bought two, not cheap, wind chimes – and they do not chime in the 
absence of hurricane gale winds! Is there anything we can do to get them to 
catch any breeze that happens by? Would the CD section in your article be all he 
needs? I have spent a long time on the internet looking for some quick fix but 
can’t find anything. The power company recently cut down all the shrubs we have 
been carefully tending for years and now we have dreadful road noise. The chimes 
are an optimistic detraction to that new situation.</SPAN></p>

<b>
<SPAN face="Arial">
<SPAN size="5" color="#008000">Answer</SPAN><SPAN size="5">: </SPAN> </SPAN> </b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Yes, there are several options. You describe a common condition 
where the sail is either too small or too heavy to supply a good jerk to the 
striker. Without seeing the set of chimes directly, I suggest you replace 
the wind sail with something larger and lighter weight. As a test, I use an old 
CD for a temporary sail, just to make the point that it needs to be light weight 
and fairly large in size. Often an old CD is not large enough. You can use 
anything that pleases your eye that meets the size and light weight requirements 
from your testing. </SPAN>   </p>

<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
<b>
<SPAN color="#008000">
Answer: </SPAN> </b>Yes, the chime can be mounted for a fixed support using a 
number of methods. Any method should locate the support at 22.4% from both ends. 
</SPAN>  
</p>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">The noninvasive method uses the traditional one wrap string method for 
supporting an orchestra grade chime or bar, as shown right, courtesy of 
Woodstock Chimes. Locate the chime above or below the line, either method works equally 
well. </SPAN>  </p>

<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
An invasive and more rugged mount can be from a stud on one or both sides of the 
mounting location as shown left. A locking nut on the outside of the chime will 
secure the stud in place and allow attachment to the supporting structure, as 
often found in playground chimes. I would avoid inserting a bolt through the 
chime tube, because tightening nuts on both sides can stress the tube causing it 
not to resonate or reduce the sustain time.

<img src="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/chime_pic/chime%20pin%20support.jpg"/><b><SPAN color="#008000">Answer</SPAN>:
</b>Hold the tube horizontal with the support pin also horizontal. Tilt the tube 
to be mostly vertical, but not quite. Feed the line down the tube on the bottom 
side, passing one side of the pin and out the other end. You may need to attach 
a small weight to the end of the line, like a pinch-on fishing line sinker, to 
provide sufficient weight so the line will feed all the way through. You can 
also blow on the tube or use compressed air to force the line out the other end.
</SPAN>

</p>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Next, rotate the tube 180 degrees and starting from the other end, feed the line 
back down the tube, passing the opposite side of the pin. Pull both ends of the 
line up to the pin from the top end, and tie a slip knot. Pull the knot taught 
around the pin as shown to the right. You may need to adjust the line to be in 
the center of the pin using a coat hanger wire or other handy utensil.  
</SPAN>  
</p>

<p>
<SPAN face="Arial" size="5">
It may be difficult to see inside a dark tube. Place a white paper on the floor 
and hold the tube above the paper as you peer into the tube. This generally 
allows enough light in to see the location for the line centered on the pin.

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">
<img src="https://www.julipode.net/2024/04/21/chime_pic/bullet_nose.jpg"/><b><SPAN color="#008000">Answer</SPAN>:
</b>My preference is a bullet nose edge for large tubes. Heavy chimes need a 
robust strike and a rounded edge striker last longer, and can be simple to 
fabricate. Regarding the weight, I would start with a 1.5 inch thick section of 
treated lumber, not any thicker, ¾ inch could work. </SPAN>  </p>

<p>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">There is a close 
relationship between a striker’s weight and the ability of the sail to 
adequately jerk the striker. Because of that relationship, I cannot suggest an 
exact weight but I do suggest experimentation.Â  I often find myself making 
two or three strikers before I am satisfied with the overall performance from 
both the striker and the sail. You could take a scrap of wood and approximate 
the size and weight of your wind sail and hang it where you intend to place the 
chimes. Then watch it for a few days to judge its movement.</SPAN></p>

<b>I saw chimes on a tropical island made from sticks of coral.<SPAN color="#336699">
</SPAN>(</b>worn staghorn coral on the beach, which was there by the millions of tons due 
to hurricanes.) So I brought back a bunch of sticks of coral. But trying to get 
maximum wind chime effect is hard, especially on the first try. The coral is 
much heavier than metal, but it does have a sort of ceramic waterford ring to 
it. I cannot find any specific plans, but I was leaning towards orienting many 
of the pieces horizontally for maximum instability and strikes. I also wanted to 
stay with natural materials and make the top support out of maybe two longer 
pieces of coral in an X configuration. </SPAN>   </p>
<p>
<b>
<SPAN face="Arial">
<SPAN size="5" color="#008000">Answer</SPAN><SPAN size="5">: </SPAN> </SPAN> </b>
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">My first attempt would be to carefully measure down from each end 
22.4% (.224) and tie a monofilament fishing line or perhaps a braided fishing 
line at those points for support, then test their sound by carefully striking 
the coral with the sole of a hard rubber shoe. I have no experience with coral chimes but 
they should follow the basic laws of physics. They will probably need a robust 
striker because of their small size, depending on how easily they break. Also 
try a striker with more rigidity, like a plastic plate.

I prefer thin aluminum

the chime compared to heavier material like wood or plastic. It more depends on

Yes, there are two answers.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p> 
</SPAN>
<SPAN color="black">
<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">
<p>
First, drill a small hole at the tips of the star striker and thread small 
monofilament fishing line around the circle. That will contain each chime in the 
star.</p><SPAN color="#008000">

</b><SPAN size="5" face="Arial" color="black">drill a tiny hole through each chime at the same horizontal location 
from the bottom and thread a monofilament plastic line through each chime all 
around all the chimes. See attached picture. You may have to experiment with 
various lines to find one that works. Maybe a small weed trimmer line. As you do 
this, tie aÂ  knot on the outside of each chime to prevent the chime from 
s<SPAN size="5">lipping along the line. This will keep the chimes evenly spaced and from 
separating in high winds, preventing escapement of the striker. </SPAN>

<b>I am building a

That should work okay but I would first experiment. I would suggest you cut the 
first tube little long and weld on the washer. Then test it to make sure the 
sustained time is adequate. The one thing that gets fussy is that the weld needs 
to be very uniform around the circumference. If not, it will completely kill the 
chime. I have had good success with this technique using solder so welding 
should be just fine. If your test is not successful, then you can trim off the 
world and use the traditional approach.</SPAN><SPAN size="5" color="#FF0000">

<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">Yes, there are numerous ways to chamfer the ends. 
Many do it in a metal lathe. As you suggest I have laid a clean towel on the 
worktable and by hand, roll the chime back and forth as you file or use an 
orbital sander to produce the bevel. I typically begin with a sander to remove 
most of the material and finish with a file to produce a perfect looking

<SPAN size="5">The calculator will NOT work 
for square tubing but the overall ratios will probably be similar, For example, 
say you&#39;re using the C9 scale or the pentatonic scale, calculate the length as 
if it were round tubing and the ratio from one note to the other should closely 
track as if it were round tubing.Â  <b>Caution</b>, not all square tubing 
will resonate. Cut your first tube, drill the support holes at the 22.4% 
location and hang the tube. Using the sole of a hard rubber shoe strike the 
chime and determine if you like the sound.

there are any chime configurations that require 7 tubes. I didn&#39;t see one in the

									me: I am a retired electronics engineer with 
									a passion for investigating technical 
									issues, occasionally surrounded with mystery 
									andÂ  often bridging several fields of 
									technology. In 2001, when building 
									chime-sets for my daughters as Christmas 
									presents, I asked what makes a chime a good 
									chime. </SPAN></p>
<p>
																		<SPAN size="5" face="Arial">
																		Little did I know what I was getting 
									into when I asked that question. While I 
									would not consider myself an expert by any 
									definition, these findings can be valued for 
									the understanding of tubular bell chimes. My 
									experience with this project has evolved 
									over time and is presented to help you 
									design and build a great set of tubular bell 
									wind chimes. Updates continue almost monthly 
									as development goes forward.</SPAN></p>
