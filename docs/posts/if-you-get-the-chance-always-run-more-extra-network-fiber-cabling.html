</div><div><p>Some day, you may be in an organization that&#39;s about to add some
more fiber cabling between two rooms in the same building, or maybe
two close by buildings, and someone may ask you for your opinion
about many fiber pairs should be run. My personal advice is simple:
<strong>run more fiber</strong> than you think you need, ideally a bunch more
(this generalizes to network cabling in general, but copper cabling
is a lot more bulky and so harder to run (much) more of). THere is
an unreasonable amount of fiber to run, but mostly it comes up when
you&#39;d have to put in giant fiber patch panels.</p>

<p>The obvious reason to run more fiber is that you may well expand
your need for fiber in the future. Someone will want to run a
dedicated, private network connection between two locations; someone
will want to trunk things to get more bandwidth; someone will want
to run a weird protocol that requires its own network segment (did
you know you can run HDMI over Ethernet?); and so on. It&#39;s relatively
inexpensive to add some more fiber pairs when you&#39;re already running
fiber but much more expensive to have to run additional fiber
later, so you might as well give yourself room for growth.</p>

<p>The less obvious reason to run extra fiber is that every so often
fiber pairs stop working, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/NetworkCablesGoBad">just like network cables go bad</a>, and when this happens you&#39;ll need to replace
them with spare fiber pairs, which means you need those spare fiber
pairs. Some of the time this fiber failure is (probably) because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/MachineRoomRaccoon">a raccoon got into your machine room</a>, but
some of the time it just happens for reasons that no one is likely
to ever explain to you. And when this happens, you don&#39;t necessarily
lose only a single pair. Today, for example, <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">we</a> lost three fiber pairs that ran
between two adjacent buildings and evidence suggests that other
people at the university lost at least one more pair.</p>

<p>(There are a variety of possible causes for sudden loss of multiple
pairs, probably all running through a common path, which I will
leave to your imagination. These fiber runs are probably not important
enough to cause anyone to do a detailed investigation of where the
fault is and what happened.)</p>

<p>Fiber comes in two varieties, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_optical_fiber">single mode</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber">multi-mode</a>.
I don&#39;t know enough to know if you should make a point of running
both (over distances where either can be used) as part of the whole
&#39;run more fiber&#39; thing. Locally we have both SM and MM fiber and
have switched back and forth between them at times (and may have
to do so as a result of the current failures).</p>

<p>PS: Possibly you work in an organization where broken inside-building
fiber runs are regularly fixed or replaced. That is not our local
experience; someone has to pay for fixing or replacing, and when
you have spare fiber pairs left it&#39;s easier to switch over to them
rather than try to come up with the money and so on.</p>

<p>(Repairing or replacing broken fiber pairs will reduce your long
term need for additional fiber, but obviously not the short term
need. If you lose N pairs of fiber, you need N spare pairs to get
back into operation.)</p>
