<p>
The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
Internet Application Suite (see below).
Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla,
and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates
to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email &amp; newsgroup client
with an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and
corporate users.
</p>

<p>
Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source code
which powers such products as <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net">
Thunderbird</a>. Legal backing is provided by the SeaMonkey Association
(SeaMonkey e.V.).

<h4>November 14, 2023</h4>
<p><strong>SeaMonkey 2.53.18 Beta 1 released</strong></p>

<p>
The SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.53.18 Beta 1: The new
beta test release of the all-in-one Internet suite is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/releases/2.53.18b1">available for free download now</a>!
</p>
<p>
2.53.18 will be an incremental update on the 2.53.x branch and incorporates a
number of enhancements, changes and fixes to the application as well as those
from the underlying platform code. Support for parsing and processing newer
regexp expressions has been added helping with web compatibility on more than a
few sites. Crash reporting has been switched over to
<a href="https://www.bugsplat.com/">BugSplat</a>. We also added many fixes and
backports for overall platform stability.
</p>
<p>
<b>Before installing the new version make a full backup of
your profile and thoroughly read and follow the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/releases/seamonkey2.53.18/">Release Notes</a></b>. We encourage

</p>
    
<h4>November  6, 2022</h4>
<p><strong>SeaMonkey and macOS Ventura</strong></p>

<p>
Attention macOS users! The current SeaMonkey release crashes during startup
after upgrading to macOS 13 Ventura. Until we have a fix we advise you not to
upgrade your macOS installation to Ventura. No usable crash information is
generated and this might take a bit longer than usual to fix. This is not a
problem with Monterey 12.6.1 or any lower supported macOS version so might even
be an Apple bug.
</p>
<p>
The problem is tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1797696">Bug 1797696</a>.

<h2>The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite</h2>
<p>
SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the original
Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on the modern,
cross-platform architecture provided by the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/doc/features#browser">Internet browser</a> at the core of
  the SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and
  application platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
  browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find as you
  type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web experience.</li>
<li>SeaMonkey&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/doc/features#mail">Mail and Newsgroups</a> client
  shares lots of code with Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail
  filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple
  accounts, S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
  private and corporate use.</li>
<li>Additional components include an easy-to-use
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/doc/features#composer">HTML Editor</a>, the ChatZilla IRC chat
  application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector.</li>
<li>If that&#39;s still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
  <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/seamonkey/">Add-Ons</a> that provide
  additional functionality and customization for a complete Internet
  experience.</li>
</ul>
