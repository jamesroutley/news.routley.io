The need for icebreaking vessels will remain even as climate change reduces the extent of sea ice: paradoxically, as new polar routes become accessible and sea ice becomes more mobile, the demand for icebreakers is likely to increase. Russia has an aging fleet of more than </span><a href="https://www.ponarseurasia.org/russias-icebreakers-north-sea-route-and-invasion-of-ukraine/" rel="">40 icebreakers</a><span>, with several under construction. China has somewhere between 5 and 7 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_icebreakers#China" rel="">icebreakers</a><span> (depending on exactly how you define “icebreaker”), with more </span><a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-unveils-its-fourth-research-icebreaker" rel="">under construction</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The U.S., on the other hand, has allowed its icebreaking capabilities to wither. The Coast Guard has handled all U.S. icebreaking since 1966, and estimates that it needs 8-9 polar icebreakers (4-5 heavy and 4-5 medium) to fulfill its needs. But it currently has only two: the heavy icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>, and the medium icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Healy" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. The U.S. hasn’t built a heavy icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">since 1976</a><span>. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">no existing U.S. shipyard</a><span> has built a heavy polar icebreaker since before 1970. A </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24834/acquisition-and-operation-of-polar-icebreakers-fulfilling-the-nations-needs" rel="">2017 National Academies</a><span> report stated that “The nation is ill-equipped to protect its interests and maintain leadership in these regions and has fallen behind other Arctic nations, which have mobilized to expand their access to ice-covered regions.”</span></p><p><span>And while the U.S. is trying to remedy this with a </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to build a series of new heavy polar icebreakers (to be followed by a series of medium icebreakers), the program is going poorly. When the contract was first awarded in 2019, the plan was to have the first icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">completed by 2024</a><span>. But as of July this year, the design of the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/us-coast-guard-icebreaker-update" rel="">ship was still incomplete</a><span>. If and when the ships are completed (currently 2029 for the first vessel at the earliest), they are expected to cost $1.7-1.9 </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">billion apiece</a><span>, roughly four to five times what a comparable ship would cost to </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">build</a><span> elsewhere. Icebreakers, then, are another unfortunate example of the costs inflicted by binding national interests to an inefficient shipbuilding industry.</span></p><p><span>An icebreaker is exactly what it sounds like; a ship designed to break up ice, either to create a passage for itself or to create a channel for other ships to follow. A ship might be designed primarily for icebreaking (like the </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>) or designed for icebreaking and other duties. The French </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/a-successful-commercial-icebreaker" rel="">Le Commandant Charcot</a></em><span> is a cruise ship with icebreaking capabilities. Modern icebreakers </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Class" rel="">are rated</a><span> based on their ability to break through ice and operate in various ice conditions. Higher-rated icebreakers can continuously break through ice nearly 10 feet thick, and can ram through even thicker ice.</span></p><p><span>Breaking ice requires a host of specific design features. Traditional icebreakers pair high-powered engines with specially shaped hulls designed to create downward pressure over the top of the ice, breaking it apart under high tensile forces, as ice is weak in tension. For particularly thick ice, or ice ridges, the entire front of the icebreaker may be driven up onto the ice, breaking the ice beneath it. The hull and ship structure must be strong enough to withstand the impact of ice, and a heavily reinforced “</span><a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/naval-architecture/design-and-construction-of-ice-class-ships-part-2/" rel="">ice-belt</a><span>,” often made of special high-strength steel, is installed near the level of the waterline. Things like </span><a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/stories/breaking-ice-ease" rel="">air bubbler systems</a><span> (which blow bubbles of air up around the ship from beneath the water) and </span><a href="https://www.international-marine.com/en/products/intershield-163-inerta-160" rel="">low-friction paint</a><span> reduce friction as the ship forces its way through the ice. Traditional icebreaking hull shapes, while well suited to breaking through ice, perform poorly in open ocean operations; the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> has been dubbed “</span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/23053/life-aboard-a-polar-roller-americas-last-heavy-icebreaker" rel="">The Polar Roller</a><span>” due to its tendency to roll constantly.</span></p><p><span>The development of rotatable “azimuth” thrusters in the late 1980s, sometimes known as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azipod" rel="">azipods</a><span>, changed the mechanics of icebreaking. Icebreaking ships with azimuth thrusters are often designed to break ice by moving backwards, using the propellers to break ice from below and to flush the hull with water to reduce friction. Not only does this reduce the power required to break ice, but it allows for the front (bow) of the ship to be designed for better open water performance. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltika_(icebreaker)" rel="">Some modern icebreakers</a><span> are designed to use azimuth thrusters to move forward at an oblique angle to create an especially wide channel.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" width="600" height="399" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:399,&#34;width&#34;:600,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Azimuth thrusters.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The specialized design requirements and equipment make icebreaker ship design and construction a specialized field of expertise. A relatively small number of shipbuilders are responsible for the lion’s share of icebreaker design and construction. By far the most experienced icebreaker builder in the world is Finland.

As a result, Finland has developed unrivaled expertise in icebreaker construction. </span><a href="https://www.businessfinland.fi/48d56b/globalassets/finnish-customers/02-build-your-network/arctic/maritime-and-offshore-from-finland/2018-icebreaker-brochure.pdf" rel="">Finnish firms</a><span> have designed roughly 80% of the world’s icebreakers and built 60% of them.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png" width="1242" height="586" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:586,&#34;width&#34;:1242,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59ad72f9-9a9e-4635-bf2e-ca84905137c9_1242x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Hypothetical hull structure for an icebreaking vs non-icebreaking ship, via GAO.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Ships designed to break up ice became possible with the advent of steam power.

When the Polar-class ships launched, the U.S. had five icebreaking ships. And as the Wind-class ships continued to retire, this number fell. By 1989, the U.S. had just two icebreakers.</span></p><p><span>In the 1990s, funding was allocated for another icebreaker, the medium icebreaker </span><em>Healy</em><span>, which was completed in 1999. Since then, no new polar icebreakers have been built in the U.S. Both the </span><em>Polar Sea</em><span> and the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> continued to operate until 2010, when the </span><em>Polar Sea</em><span> suffered a catastrophic breakdown of its engines. Since then, it has been in drydock, acting as a source of spare parts for the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span>, as many of those parts are no longer manufactured. The </span><em>Polar Star </em><span>is far past its original service life, and it must spend nearly all its time between McMurdo Station missions being repaired. During a major refurbishment of the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> in 2010, the head of the Coast Guard stated that “it’s a little uncertain to me how many more years we can get out of her in her current condition.” That was 14 years ago; today the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> remains America’s only heavy icebreaker, and the only U.S. ship that can clear a path through the ice to resupply McMurdo Station.</span></p><p><span>To replace its aging icebreakers with a new, larger fleet of ships, in 2013 the Coast Guard initiated its </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Security_Cutter_program" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to construct a series of new heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard solicited bids in 2017, and the first contract was awarded in 2019, to VT Halter Marine, with an expected delivery date of 2024 for the first ship. But the program has gone poorly. While most icebreakers are custom designed using proven concepts, the team of </span><a href="https://navalarchitects.us/" rel="">TAI</a><span> and Halter Marine used a German icebreaker that has yet to be built as a ‘parent design’, intending to modify it for Coast Guard needs. After five years, this modification still isn’t complete; as of July 2024 the design was only 59% done, and construction has not yet started. While the original delivery date for the first ship was 2024, that has now been pushed back to 2029.</span></p><p><span>In a report and testimony, the GAO </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">described</a><span> some of the problems during the program:</span></p><ul><li><p><em>U.S.-based designers and shipbuilders generally lacked experience designing and building heavy polar icebreakers.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The ship design is complex, including that it used a specialized steel alloy that required technical study and development of new welding procedures before use.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The shipbuilder overestimated the extent to which it could leverage the original design and had to make significant design changes to meet government specifications, according to program officials. The shipbuilder also made some design errors, such as selecting the wrong height for the lowest deck of the ship, which required significant, late redesign to correct.</em></p></li><li><p><em>COVID-19 restrictions limited the extent to which the shipbuilder could collaborate and consult with its domestic and international partners.</em></p></li></ul><p><span>Notably, VT Halter Marine lost $256 million between 2017 and 2021, after which it was bought for a song (just $15 million) by </span><a href="https://news.usni.org/2022/11/14/bollinger-closes-15m-acquisition-of-halter-marine-new-name-bollinger-mississippi-shipbuilding" rel="">Bollinger</a><span>, which took over the icebreaker contracts.</span></p><p><span>Originally, the Polar Security Cutters were expected to cost $800-$900 million per ship ($1.1-$1.3 billion in 2024 dollars), but current cost estimates are closer to $1.7-1.9 billion, and given that construction hasn’t started yet, this is likely to rise. And it’s unclear if that 2029 date will be hit either. The </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105949.pdf" rel="">GAO report</a><span> notes that “the shipyard is completing, on average, approximately three percent of functional design and six percent of transitional design every six months. At that design completion rate, it would take the shipyard approximately eight years to complete functional design.”</span></p><p><span>By contrast, a Finnish shipyard can build a heavy icebreaker for just a few hundred million dollars, and deliver it within two years, instead of 10 or more. However, the Coast Guard opted not to pursue a foreign manufacturer, instead choosing a U.S. shipyard. The culprit here isn’t the Jones Act, but another protectionist shipbuilding law that requires Naval and Coast Guard ships to be built in U.S. shipyards. It’s possible to waive this requirement via </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/yes-the-us-coast-guard-can-build" rel="">presidential authorization</a><span>, but there hasn’t appeared to be much interest in this. Waiving this requirement and allowing the Coast Guard to buy icebreakers from Finland would likely save over a billion dollars per ship, as well as years of construction time.</span></p><p><span>Barring acquiring Finnish icebreakers, the next best option for the U.S. icebreaker program would have been awarding the contract to a team that had icebreaker experience. Finnish shipbuilding firms previously assisted during the design and construction of the </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. Of the three bids submitted for the Polar Security Cutter program, two were from U.S. shipyards partnered with European firms that had previously designed and built icebreakers. The winning bid from VT Halter was, bizarrely, the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">only bid without an experienced partner</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The U.S. has made some gestures to try and improve its icebreaker construction with the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-polar-partnership-ice-pact-alongside-finland-and-canada/" rel="">ICE Pact</a><span>, a non-binding agreement to collaborate and share information on icebreaker design and construction. But experts </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/ice-pact-update" rel="">appear skeptical</a><span> as to whether this will have much impact, as it’s predicated on attracting foreign orders for U.S.-built icebreakers that aren’t likely to materialize.</span></p><p><span>With icebreakers, we see a microcosm of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships" rel="">the broader problems we looked at</a><span> in U.S. shipbuilding. Icebreakers are far more expensive to build (and take much longer to build) in the U.S. than in foreign shipyards, and it’s only a series of protectionist laws that drive any icebreaker construction here at all. </span></p><p><span>We also see the same cultural issues that we saw with American shipbuilding more broadly. There seems to be a lack of motivation to take maritime issues seriously or treat them as important. For decades, the U.S. has been willing to accept an undersized icebreaker fleet – complaints about insufficient icebreakers </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11753/polar-icebreakers-in-a-changing-world-an-assessment-of-us" rel="">date back to the 1980s</a><span>. There appears to be little interest in trying to ameliorate this by acquiring foreign icebreakers, even though that would be comparatively simple, far cheaper, and far faster. And the Coast Guard apparently did not think icebreakers were important enough to select a team for building them that had icebreaker experience, even though it’s a niche, specialized area of marine construction.</span></p><p><span>As a result, icebreaking can be added to the list of things like </span><a href="https://reason.org/commentary/the-foreign-dredge-act-increases-costs-and-slows-the-key-bridge-cleanup/" rel="">dredging</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/jones-act-helps-sink-new-jersey-offshore-wind-project" rel="">offshore wind turbine </a><span>installation: areas that have been shackled to America’s inefficient shipbuilding industry and have inflicted costs on the country in the process.</span></p><p><em><span>Much of this information comes from Peter Rybski’s substack, </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/" rel="">60 Degrees North</a><span>, which I highly recommend if you’re interested in learning more about icebreakers and icebreaker policy.
