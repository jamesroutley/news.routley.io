                    <h2>What is Deduce?</h2>
                    <p>Deduce is an automated proof checker meant for use in education to help students:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ease their way into proving the correctness of programs.</li>
                        <li>Deepening their understanding of logic.</li>
                        <li>Improve their ability to write mathematical proofs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Who can use Deduce?</h2>
                    <p>The intended audience is students with (roughly) the following background knowledge and skills:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic programming skills in a mainstream language such as Java, Python, or C++</li>
                        <li>Some exposure to logic, as one would learn in a course on Discrete Mathematics</li>
                    </ul>
