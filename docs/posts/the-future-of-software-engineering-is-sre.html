    <h1>The future of software engineering is SRE</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>When code gets cheap operational excellence wins. Anyone can build a greenfield demo, but it takes engineering to run a service.</p>
<p>You may be wondering: With all the hype about agentic coding, will we even need software engineers anymore? Yes! We&#39;ll need more.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SRE about to become the most hired job in engineering</p>— Swizec Teller (@Swizec) <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/2011141998426931250">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote>
<p>Writing code was always the easy part of this job. The hard part was keeping your code running for the long time. <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-software-engineering-at-google/">Software engineering is programming over time</a>. It&#39;s about how systems change.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-no-code-and-spreadsheets-era"><a href="#lessons-from-the-no-code-and-spreadsheets-era"></a><a href="#lessons-from-the-no-code-and-spreadsheets-era">Lessons from the no-code and spreadsheets era</a></h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take no-code and spreadsheets as an example of the kind of software people say is the future – custom-built, throwaway, built by non-experts to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>Joe Schmoe from accounting takes 10 hours to do a thing. He&#39;s does this every week and it feels repetitive, mechanical, and boring. Joe could do the work in his sleep.</p>
<p>But he can&#39;t get engineering resources to build a tool. The engineers are busy building the product. No worries, Joe is a smart dude. With a little Googling, a few no-code tools, and good old spreadsheet macros <strong>he builds a tool</strong>.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Joe&#39;s tool is a little janky but his 10 hour weekly task now takes 1 hour! 🎉 Sure, he finds a new edge case every every week and there&#39;s constant tinkering, but he&#39;s having a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Time passes, the business changes, accounting rules are in constant flux, and let&#39;s never talk about timezones or daylight savings ever again. Joe is sick of this bullshit.</p>
<p>All he wanted was to make his job easier and now he&#39;s shackled to this stupid system. He can&#39;t go on vacation, he can&#39;t train anyone else to run this thing successfully, and it never fucking works right.</p>
<p>Joe can&#39;t remember the last time running his code didn&#39;t fill him with dread. He spends hours carefully making sure it all worked.</p>

<p>The problem with computers is that you tinker. Automating things is fun! You might forget you don&#39;t need to 😆</p>
<p>The part that&#39;s not fun is <em>running</em> things. Providing a service. Reliably, at scale, for years on end. A service that people will hire to do their jobs.</p>
<h2 id="why-operational-excellence-is-the-future"><a href="#why-operational-excellence-is-the-future"></a><a href="#why-operational-excellence-is-the-future">Why operational excellence is the future</a></h2>
<p>People don&#39;t buy software, they <em>hire a service</em>.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t care how iCloud works, you just want your photos to magically show up across devices every time. You don&#39;t care about Word or Notion or gDocs, you just want to write what&#39;s on your mind, share it with others, and see their changes. And you definitely don&#39;t care how a payments network point of sale terminal and your bank talk to each other, you just want your $7 matcha latte to get you through the week.</p>
<p>Good software is invisible.</p>
<p>And that takes work. A lot of work. Because the first 90% to get a working demo is easy. It&#39;s the other 190% that matters.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s your uptime?</li>
<li>Defect rate?</li>
<li>How quickly do you recover from defects?</li>
<li>Do I have to reach out or will you know before me?</li>
<li>Can you own upstream dependencies?</li>
<li>When a vendor misbehaves, will you notice or wait until your users complain?</li>
<li>When users share ideas, how long does it take?</li>
<li>How do you keep engineers from breaking each other&#39;s systems?</li>
<li>Do you have systems to keep engineers moving without turning your app into a disjointed mess?</li>
<li>Can you build software bigger than fits in 1 person&#39;s brain?</li>
<li>When I&#39;m in a 12 hour different timezone, your engineers are asleep, and there&#39;s a big issue ... will it be fixed before I give up?</li>
<li>Can you recover from failures, yours and upstream, or does important data get lost?</li>
<li>Are you keeping up with security updates?</li>
<li>Will you leak all my data?</li>
<li>Do I trust you?</li>
<li>Can I rely on you?</li>
<li>How can you be so sure?</li>
<li>Will you sign a legally binding guarantee that your software works when I need it? 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the ~~fun~~ hard engineering challenges. Writing code is easy.</p>
