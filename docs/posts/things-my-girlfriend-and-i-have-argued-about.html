                <ul>
                  <li> The way one should cut a Kiwi Fruit in half (along its
                    length or across the middle).</li>
                  <li> Leaving the kitchen door open (three times a day that
                    one, minimum).</li>
                  <li> The best way to hang up washing.</li>
                  <li> Those little toothpaste speckles you make when you brush
                    your teeth in front of the mirror.</li>
                  <li> I eat two-fingered Kit-Kats like I&#39;d eat any other
                    chocolate bars of that size, i.e., without feeling the need
                    to snap them into two individual fingers first. Margret
                    accused me of doing this, &#39;deliberately to annoy her&#39;.</li>
                  <li> Which way - the distances were identical - to drive round
                    a circular bypass (this resulted in her kicking me in the
                    head from the back seat as I drove along).</li>
                  <li> The amount of time I spend on the computer. (OK, fair
                    enough.)</li>
                  <li> First Born&#39;s name (Jonathan). Then, when that was
                    settled...</li>
                  <li> How to<i> pronounce</i> First Born&#39;s name.</li>
                  <li> Our telephone number.</li>
                  <li> Which type of iron to buy (price wasn&#39;t an issue, it was
                    the <i>principle</i>, damnit). </li>
                  <li> Where to sit in the cinema. On those occasions when we a)
                    manage to agree to go to the cinema together and, b) go to
                    see the same film once we&#39;re there. (No, really).</li>
                  <li> Whether her cutting our son&#39;s hair comes under
                    &#39;money-saving skill&#39; or &#39;therapy in the making&#39;.</li>
                  <li> Shortly after every single time Margret touches my
                    computer, for any reason whatsoever, I have to spend twenty
                    minutes trying to fix crashes, locked systems, data loses,
                    jammed drives, bizarre re-configurations and things stuck in
                    the keyboard. There then follows a free and frank exchange
                    of views with, in my corner, &#39;It&#39;s your fault,&#39; and, in
                    hers, &#39;It&#39;s a curious statistical anomaly.&#39; </li>
                  <li> Margret enters the room. The television is showing <i>Baywatch</i>.
                    Margret says, &#39;Uh-huh, you&#39;re watching <i>Baywatch</i>
                    again.&#39; I say, &#39;I&#39;m not watching, it&#39;s <i>just on</i>.&#39;
                    Repeat. For the duration of the programme.</li>
                  <li> She wants to paint the living room yellow. I have not the
                    words.</li>
                  <li> Margret doesn&#39;t like to watch films on the TV. No, hold
                    on - let me make sure you&#39;ve got the inflection here:
                    Margret doesn&#39;t like to <i>watch</i> films on the TV. She <i>says</i>
                    she does, but years of bitter experience have proven that
                    what she actually wants is to sit by me <i>while I narrate
                      the entire bleeding film to her</i>. &#39;Who&#39;s she?&#39;, &#39;Why
                    did he get shot?&#39;, &#39;I thought that one was on their side?&#39;,
                    &#39;Is that a bomb&#39; - &#39;JUST WATCH IT! IN THE NAME OF GOD, <i>JUST
                      WATCH IT</i>!&#39; The hellish mirror-image of this is when
                    she furnishes me, deaf to my pleading, with <i>her</i>
                    commentary. Chair-clawing suspense being assaulted
                    mercilessly from behind by such interjections as, &#39;Hey!
                    Look! They&#39;re the cushions <i>we&#39;ve</i> got.&#39;, &#39;Isn&#39;t she
                    the one who does that tampon advert?&#39; and, on one famous
                    occasion, &#39;Oh, I&#39;ve seen this - he gets killed at the end.&#39;</li>
                  <li> Margret thinks I&#39;m vain because... I use a mirror when I
                    shave. During this argument in the bathroom - our fourth
                    most popular location for arguments, it will delight and
                    charm you to learn - Margret proved that shaving with a
                    mirror could only be seen as <i>outrageous</i> narcissism
                    by saying, &#39;None of the other men I&#39;ve been with,&#39; (my, but
                    it&#39;s all I can do to stop myself hugging her when she begins
                    sentences like that) &#39;None of the other men I&#39;ve been with
                    used a mirror to shave.&#39;</li>
                  <li> <b>The TV Remote</b>. It is only by epic self-discipline
                    on both our parts that we don&#39;t argue about the TV Remote to
                    the exclusion of all else. It does the TV Remote a
                    disservice to suggest that it is only the cause of four
                    types of argument, but space, you will understand, is
                    limited so I must concentrate on the main ones. </li>
                  <li> We&#39;re staying at a German friend&#39;s flat in Berlin and he
                    brings out the photo album, as people do when conversational
                    desperation has set in. It&#39;s largely pictures of a holiday
                    he went on with Margret and a few friends several years
                    previously. And consists pretty much entirely of shots of
                    Margret naked. &#39;Hah! So, here&#39;s another photo of your
                    girlfriend nude! Good breasts, no?&#39; I sat on the sofa for
                    hours of this - I think I actually bit through my tongue at
                    one point. Fortunately, though, everything turned out all
                    right because Margret, me and one careful and considered
                    exchange of views revealed it was, &#39;...just (<i>my</i>)
                    hang-up.&#39; Great. I&#39;m <i>sooooo</i> English, apparently.</li>
                  <li> See if you can spot the difference between these two
                    statements: </li>
                  <li> She keeps making me carry tampons around - &#39;Here, have
                    these, just in case.&#39;</li>
                  <li> She really over-reacts whenever she catches me wearing
                    her underwear.</li>
                  <li> Now, what you have to realise is that this was <i>from
                      nowhere</i>, OK? Don&#39;t think there were previous
                    conversations or situations that put this in context. Oh no.
                    Just imagine the, &#39;What the <i>f</i>...?&#39; moment you&#39;d have
                    been standing in if <i>your</i> partner had said this to
                    you, because you&#39;d have had as much preparation as I did.
                    So, it&#39;s just after Christmas and Margret&#39;s moaning about
                    her present (I forget what it was, a Ferrari, I think - but
                    in the wrong colour or something), um, actually, let me come
                    back to this, that reminds me...</li>
                  <li> Presents. Before every birthday, Christmas or whatever
                    I&#39;ll say, &#39;What do you want?&#39; And Margret will say,
                    &#39;Surprise me.&#39; And I&#39;ll reply, &#39;Noooooo, just tell me what
                    you want. If I guess it&#39;ll be the wrong thing, it&#39;s <i>always</i>
                    the wrong thing.&#39; And then she&#39;ll come out with that, &#39;No,
                    it won&#39;t. It&#39;ll be what you chose, and a surprise, that&#39;s
                    what&#39;s important,&#39; nonsense. And I&#39;ll say, &#39;Sweetest, you
                    say that <i>now</i>, but come Christmas morning it&#39;ll be,
                    &#34;What the hell were you thinking?&#34; again, won&#39;t it?&#39; And she
                    replies, &#39;No. It. Won&#39;t.&#39; And I say, &#39;Yes, it will.&#39; And she
                    says, &#39;Don&#39;t patronise <i>me</i>.&#39; And the neighbours
                    freeze in their seats for a moment next door, before jumping
                    up and removing anything they have on the shelves on the
                    adjoining wall. And, in the end, Margret gets her way. And I
                    hunt around in utter desperation for two months for
                    something before finally finding the one item that will work
                    at 7.30pm on Christmas Eve for a cost of
                    twenty-three-and-a-half thousands pounds. And on Christmas
                    morning it&#39;s, &#39;What the hell were you thinking?&#39; But anyway.</li>
                  <li> Back at the previous item, it&#39;s just after Christmas and
                    Margret&#39;s going on about her present, which was, you&#39;ll
                    recall, a necklace of a single diamond suspended on a
                    delicate chain of white gold and sapphires. And this is what
                    I hear come out of her mouth - &#39;Why didn&#39;t you get me a
                    wormery, <i>I dropped enough hints</i>?&#39; You <i>what</i>?</li>
                  <li> I get accused of hoarding things by Margret. Now, this is
                    entirely unfair - electrical items never die, you see, I am
                    merely unable to revive them with today&#39;s technology. In the
                    future new techniques will emerge and, combined with the
                    inevitably approaching shortage of AC adapters and personal
                    cassette players, my foresight will pay off and the grateful
                    peoples of the Earth will make me their God. Anyway, never
                    mind that now, because the real point is that it&#39;s Margret
                    who fills our house with crap. And I&#39;m not talking about
                    doing so by the omission of crap-throwing-away here, but by
                    insane design. While sorting out the stuff in the boxes,
                    these are some of the things I&#39;ve discovered that Margret
                    actually <b><i>packed away at our last house and brought to
                        our new one:</i></b></li>
                  <li> Look, if you don&#39;t understand the rules of <i>Robot Wars</i>
                    by now then I&#39;m just not going to continue the conversation,
                    OK?</li>
                  <li> Damn, damn, damn washing up. Now, in the normal course of
                    things I do all the cooking and washing up. (This is partly
                    due to a tactical error I made in an argument many years
                    ago. You know when you&#39;re <i>so</i> angry you start
                    blurring the line between masochistic hyperbole and usefully
                    hissing threat? &#39;Well, maybe I&#39;ll just <i>microwave</i> all
                    my CDs - look, look, there goes my Tom Robinson Band - feel
                    better now?&#39; Been there? Splendid. So, several years ago
                    we&#39;re having this argument and somehow I found myself
                    inhabiting a place where saying, &#39;OK, OK, OK - I&#39;ll do <i>all</i>
                    the cooking <i>and</i> all the washing up <i>all</i> the
                    time, then!&#39; seemed like a hugely cunning gambit. In fact,
                    though, this is not too bad a deal. You see, if Margret is
                    cooking turkey (unstuffed, three-and-a-half-hours) and oven
                    chips (20 minutes, turn once), then she&#39;ll begin putting
                    them in the oven <i>at precisely the same time</i>. If
                    Margret&#39;s preparing tea, then its style will be her
                    variation on Sweet &#39;n&#39; Sour that runs Burnt Beyond
                    Recognition &#39;n&#39; Potentially Fatal.) Can <i>you</i> remember
                    what I was saying before I opened those brackets? Hold on...
                    ah, right - washing up. Now, the thing is, if you&#39;re an
                    English male, what you do when you leave home is go to the
                    shop nearest to your new place, buy a Pot Noodle (Chicken
                    and Mushroom), feast on its delights slumped on the sofa in
                    front of the TV, swill out the plastic carton it came in,
                    then use this carton for all your subsequent meals until you
                    get married. There&#39;s a beauty of economy to it. Thus, when I
                    cook a meal for four, the aftermath left in the sink as I
                    carry the gently steaming plates to the table is a single
                    saucepan and, if I&#39;ve pulled out the all stops to dazzle
                    visiting Royalty, perhaps a spoon. Margret cannot make
                    cheese on toast without using every single saucepan, wok,
                    tureen and colander in the house. Post-Margret-meal, I walk
                    into the kitchen to discover a sink teetering with utensils
                    holding off gravity only by the sly use of a spätzle glue.</li>
                  <li> Arguments. There are many arguments we have over
                    arguments. &#39;Who started argument x&#39;, for example, is a old
                    favourite that has not had its vigour dimmed by age nor its
                    edge blunted through use. Another dependable companion is, &#39;<i>I&#39;m</i>
                    not arguing, I&#39;m just talking - <i>you&#39;re</i> arguing,&#39;
                    along with its more stage-struck (in the sense that it
                    relishes an audience - parties, visiting relatives, Parent&#39;s
                    Evenings at school, in shops, etc.) sibling, &#39;Right, so
                    we&#39;re going to get into this argument <i>here</i> are we?&#39;
                    An especially frequent argument argument, however, is the
                    result of Margret NOT STICKING TO THE DAMN ARGUMENT, FOR
                    CHRIST&#39;S SAKE. Margret jack-knifes from argument to
                    argument, jigs direction randomly and erratically like a
                    shoal of Argument Fish being followed by a Truth Shark. It&#39;s
                    fearsomely difficult to land a blow because by the time
                    you&#39;ve let fly with the logic she&#39;s not there anymore. A row
                    about vacuuming gets shifted to the cost of a computer
                    upgrade, from there to who got up early with the kids most
                    this week and then to the greater interest rates of German
                    banks via the noisome sexual keenness of some former
                    girlfriend, those-are-<i>hair</i>-scissors-don&#39;t-use-them-for-paper
                    and, &#39;When was the last time you bought me flowers?&#39; all in
                    the space of about seven exchanges. &#39;Arrrrrrgggh! <i>What</i>
                    are we arguing about? Can you just decide what it is and <i>stick
                      to it</i>?&#39;</li>
                  <li>The key to a successful relationship is communication.
                    That&#39;s the First Rule. Margret&#39;s corollary to the First Rule
                    is the Timing clause. This states that the best time to
                    initiate a complex and lengthy talk about, say, exactly how
                    we should go about a loft conversion is (in reverse order of
                    preference):</li>
                  <li> When Margret used to go shopping and she&#39;d see, for
                    example, a pair of jeans in a department store, do you know
                    what she used to do? Try them on. I think you&#39;re all with me
                    here, but just for anyone who&#39;s joined us late, I don&#39;t mean
                    she&#39;d <i>go to the changing rooms and try them on</i>. That
                    would be a preposterous idea wouldn&#39;t it? No, she&#39;d just get
                    undressed there in the middle of the sales floor to try them
                    on. It took me some considerable time to persuade her that
                    this wasn&#39;t normal behaviour in Britain, despite what she
                    might have seen on Benny Hill. Even then, she only stopped -
                    amid much eye-rolling and, &#39;You and your silly social
                    conventions,&#39; head shaking - to humour me. It rubs a tiny
                    circle from the misted-up window through which you can view
                    the tormented, horizonless landscape that is My World to
                    mention that I&#39;d entirely forgotten about all this until
                    someone sent me a email yesterday that accidentally exhumed
                    the memory. With Margret this kind of thing just gets
                    drowned out by the general noise. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised
                    if, a few months from now, I&#39;m here writing, &#39;Ahhh - that
                    reminds me of Margret&#39;s role in the John Lennon shooting...&#39;</li>
                  <li> Wherever I&#39;m standing is where Margret needs to be
                    standing, and vice versa. Doesn&#39;t matter where we are - the
                    kitchen, the bathroom, Scotland - we each infuriatingly
                    occupy the space where the other one wants to be, urgently.
                    Over the years we&#39;ve developed signals for this situation.
                    Mine is to stand behind her and mutter under my breath.
                    Margret&#39;s is to shoulder-charge me out of the way.</li>
                  <li> Margret flooded the kitchen last week. Turned the taps
                    on, put the plug in the sink, and utterly forgot about it
                    (because she&#39;d come upstairs and we&#39;d got involved in an
                    unrelated argument). She goes back downstairs, opens the
                    door and - whoosh - it&#39;s Sea World. The interesting thing
                    about this is, if <i>I&#39;d</i> flooded the kitchen, it would
                    have been a bellowing, &#39;You&#39;ve flooded the kitchen, <i>you
                      idiot</i>!&#39; and then she&#39;d have done that thing where I
                    curl up in a ball, trying to protect my head, and she kicks
                    me repeatedly in the kidneys. As it was, however, there&#39;s a
                    shout, I run downstairs and stand for a beat in the doorway
                    - taking in the scene, waves lapping gently at my ankles -
                    and she turns round and roars, &#39;Well,<b> help me then</b> -
                    can&#39;t you see I&#39;ve flooded the kitchen, <i> you idiot</i>?&#39;</li>
                  <li> There are certain verbal shortcuts to a lot of our
                    arguments. Sure, we <i>could</i> ease into things, build up
                    momentum slowly, but that&#39;s so wasteful when you can fit in
                    three arguments in the time the slow-burn approach would
                    take to brew only one. So, we often favour more of a
                    dragster-style, zero-to-argument in 1 second approach. Thus,
                    over the years, ways of ensuring a spitting, scratching row
                    with just one sentence have been polished to a high shine.</li>
                  <li> Margret&#39;s four-hundred-and-fifty-second most annoying
                    habit is to stealthily turn off the central heating (then
                    light the gas fire in the room she&#39;s in, natch). I&#39;ll
                    suddenly notice that, sitting typing at the keyboard, I can
                    see my own breath while from the bedroom one of the kids
                    will call out, &#39;Papa, I can&#39;t feel my legs...&#39; And I&#39;ll
                    shiver down the stairs to find the central heating set to
                    &#39;Summer/Hypothermia/Cryogenic Suspension,&#39; and Margret in

                    morning to have a shower. I took my clothes off, innocently
                    pulled back the shower curtain and <a href="https://thelabyrinth.substack.com/p/things/lover.html" target="_blank">This</a> is what I saw. (Fortunately, the

                    think I make this stuff up. Damn you.) Now, tell me, is
                    Margret placing it there the act of a rational human being?</SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4">I know from the emails I get that a fair
                    number of you are holed up in Wyoming basements surrounded

                    filled with analysis of the Book of Revelations you&#39;ve
                    recorded off talk radio. If you have a moment, go and look
                    in your freezer. <i>That&#39;s</i> how Margret stocks our
                    freezer too. She doesn&#39;t buy one of anything. She waits
                    until she finds it, &#39;Buy Two - Get One Free,&#39; and then she
                    buys nine. Moreover, she can&#39;t manage to suppress an
                    indulgent smile - as though I&#39;m a father telling my teenage
                    daughter that her skirt might give boys all the wrong
                    signals - when I suggest that checking to see how full the
                    freezer is before she starts buying extra stuff for it might
                    be a good idea. Beyond the simply obvious - they&#39;ll have
                    terraformed Mars before our family runs out of oven chips,
                    for example - there is another consequence of this. The
                    sheer volume of food that needs to be crammed into the

                <li><SPAN size="4"> Our sink is blue and we&#39;re not talking about
                    it. It happened over a week ago; I was leaning over the
                    sink, brushing my teeth, when I noticed that there was a
                    sort of lazuline patina that had seeped over most of the
                    surface. Margret hasn&#39;t mentioned anything about this. Why
                    she hasn&#39;t is that she&#39;s obviously tried to clean the sink
                    with, well, I don&#39;t know, some fluid used for stripping
                    entrenched cerriped colonies from the hulls of submarines or
                    something (they were probably offering three bottles of the
                    stuff for the price of two at Aldi). She is waiting for me
                    to mention it. But I am a wily fox, and will be doing

                    blindness&#39;. Allow me to give you a case study for diagnostic
                    purposes:</SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4"> Last Friday was Margret&#39;s birthday. I bought
                    her this oriental, geisha-style pyjama thing (Margret -
                    &#39;Hey! I could have a go at that massage they do; I could
                    jump on your back.&#39; Me - <i>&#39;Walk</i>, they <i>walk</i> on
                    your back.&#39; Close call there.) while I was down in London.
                    She liked it. Simple. Clearly, I&#39;ve been a fool and all I
                    needed to do to get Margret a present she likes was make
                    sure I asked nearly every single woman who works for The
                    Guardian newspaper what the hell I should buy. It wasn&#39;t her
                    favourite birthday present, though, not by a long way. There
                    were almost tears of delight when her best friend turned up
                    at the birthday party and surprised her with two bags full
                    of horse manure. I mean, it seems so obvious now, of course.</SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4"> The Terror Of Lids: Yes, the rewards are
                    high, but it&#39;s a game where the price of defeat is savage.
                    Sometimes Margret, after grunting with it herself for a
                    collection of &#39;hnggh&#39;s, will hand me a bottle or a jar that
                    has a screw top along with an impatient, &#39;Open that for me.&#39;
                    If the gods lie content in the skies above England at that
                    moment, then what follows is a rapid flick of my wrist, a
                    delightful &#39;click-fshhhh&#39; gasp of surrender, and my handing
                    the thing back to her FEELING LIKE A HERO OF NORSE LEGEND.
                    Generally, though, what happens is that I strain for a while
                    and strip the skin off the palm of my hands. Then I wrap the
                    lid in a tea towel and strain some more to equal effect. At
                    this point I&#39;m on to using the jamb of the door as a vice to
                    hold the lid while I twist at the container; Margret will be
                    saying, &#39;Give it back here, you&#39;ll wreck the door,&#39; and I&#39;ll
                    be swearing and twisting and saying, &#39;I&#39;ll repaint that bit
                    in a minute.&#39; The fear is upon me. If it&#39;s a fizzy thing,
                    you can sometimes puncture the lid to relieve the pressure
                    and then get it open, but you&#39;re not often that lucky. &#39;Give
                    it back,&#39; Margret repeats, reaching around me, trying to
                    take the item from my hands. I swivel away - &#39;Just a minute&#39;
                    - and desperately twist at the lid again, now not even
                    attempting not to squint up my face as I do so. At last,
                    though, Margret will manage to get the thing back. This is
                    the darkest moment. If she tries again and it remains
                    fastened, then I am saved. &#39;It&#39;s just <i>completely</i>
                    stuck,&#39; I&#39;ll say, &#39;It is. Stop trying now. Stop. Stop it.&#39;
                    However, there are times - and my stomach chills now, even
                    as I write this - when she gets it back and, with one last

                <li><SPAN size="4"> Hanging Things. Margret simply cannot stop
                    hanging things from every defenceless lampshade, rail or
                    drawing pin-able piece of ceiling space. Mobiles built from
                    small, wooden, peasant figures, baskets of plants or
                    vegetables or toiletries, angular crystals or tiny, twirling
                    shards of coloured glass, wind-chimes - oh, pale, waltzing
                    Lord, the wind chimes. Not just those tubular bells that
                    generate a sound like a modern jazz orchestra rolling
                    biscuit tins of ball-bearings down a stairwell either. No,
                    she actually found some evil outlet that sold her a
                    suspended helix of hollow clay doves. This produces an
                    arpeggio of dull, ceramics clungs when it&#39;s struck. And it&#39;s
                    struck, many times a day, by my forehead, whenever I pass
                    into the living room. My head is a Somme of wing-shaped
                    indentations. Where does she get this Drive To Hang?
                    Admittedly, I&#39;ve sometimes looked at an empty bit of wall in
                    my computer room in the attic and thought, &#39;Mmm... Winona
                    Ryder would look good there.&#39; Occasionally even, &#39;Mmm... A
                    poster of Winona Ryder would look good there.&#39; - but that&#39;s
                    a hugely sensible distance from a compulsion to attach
                    dangling bits of pointlessness to everything, house-wide. I
                    have, for many years, tried to work out what lies behind her
                    behaviour in this area, but it wasn&#39;t until recently that I
                    was sure I&#39;d found the reason for it. Thankfully, though, I
                    have now identified its cause: She&#39;s nuts.</SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4"> One of the many things I love about Margret
                    is her zest. You probably won&#39;t have picked up on this, but
                    in actual fact I am a sullen, cynical kind of character
                    (honestly, it&#39;s true), while Margret hisses with energy and
                    finds taut excitement in everything that passes through her
                    field of vision. Perhaps this is why, in a Garden Centre, I
                    just shuffle around sighing, &#39;Red pot, blue pot; whatever
                    you want - can we go home now?&#39; yet Margret only has to walk
                    through the doors at Sainsbury&#39;s Homebase to achieve orgasm.</SPAN><SPAN size="4"> <br/>
                  </SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4"> The quality with which I am identified most
                    closely is probably fairness. There&#39;s an almost breathless
                    speed about my disposition, when appropriate, to say,
                    &#39;Margret, I am clearly in the wrong here. Please smash up my
                    stuff.&#39; However, there are times when the Shield Of Justice
                    gleams on my arm and all of Margret&#39;s shouted accusations
                    merely strike it and fall, lifeless, to the ground. Averted
                    eyes and a slowly shaking head tell that I am in a place
                    where she cannot touch me. Yes, as you ask, I am thinking of
                    something specific.</SPAN><SPAN size="4"> <br/>

                <li><SPAN size="4"> When I&#39;m driving the car, Margret reaches
                    across and operates the indicator. How annoying is that,
                    ladies and gentlemen? At the distance from the turn that she
                    considers to be appropriate, she&#39;ll lean over and flick the
                    indicator lever on. Be honest now, would any one of you
                    prefer to be in a car with someone who did that over, say,
                    being trapped under rubble for four days with a person who
                    writes the verses for greetings cards? It&#39;s rumoured, in
                    fact, that certain people are working on the <i>Being In A
                      Car With Margret Experience</i> so that it can be
                    recreated in the punishment wing of Alabama jails.</SPAN><SPAN size="4"> </SPAN></li>

                    Guess which one of us hung <i>that</i> up at some point on
                    Friday, and which one of us walked into the bedroom sometime
                    later and said, &#39;Wow, that&#39;s really good. I&#39;ve often thought
                    how not at all irritating it would be to have a bunch of
                    feathers dangling just in front of my face all night, and
                    I&#39;ve also frequently been overcome with a sudden sadness
                    that I had no means of a casual arm wave as I slept somehow
                    entangling itself in ribbons and a suspended hoop so as to
                    bring a halogen lamp crashing down onto my sleeping face.
                    Yet, I&#39;ve <i>never thought of bringing the two together</i>
                    - now, <i>that&#39;s</i> genius.&#39;</SPAN></li>

                    Apparently the casual notion that his fringe was too long
                    and didn&#39;t look sufficiently wicked strolled through his
                    head, so - without the use of anything as lame as a mirror,
                    naturally - he got a pair of scissors and cut his own hair;
                    he now looks like a tiny Howard Devoto. Except blond. And
                    without the spectacles. (<i>&#34;So, not very much like Howard

                <li><SPAN size="4"> We have shower issues. Today I had a shower
                    and she&#39;s put out some kind of weird cosmetic soap. I flinch
                    at the idea of guessing how much this soap must have cost
                    because it&#39;s utterly rubbish, which is usually a good
                    indication of knee-buckling expense (Cotton flannel - 50p,
                    Skin-lacerating wad woven from dried bark and nasal hair by
                    Amazonian tribeswomen who will use whatever money they make
                    from the sale to buy cotton flannels - £12.50). This soap
                    did not wash, but instead covered me in an iridescent film
                    of grease - and, sadly, I&#39;d made a last minute change of
                    plans and decided to spend today sitting in front of the TV
                    rather than swimming The Channel. Tch - irony, eh? Anyway, I
                    had to have <i>another wash</i> to remove this oleaginous
                    soap from me. This was the Third Thing. I&#39;ll come to the
                    Second Thing in a moment, but the First Thing is the
                    ferocity of our shower. British showers are risible, this is
                    a fact. Most people&#39;s noses run faster than the average
                    British shower and one of Margret&#39;s longest held desires has
                    been to get a shower like those in Germany. Thus, she got
                    one fitted when we moved to the new house here and it is,
                    indeed, German. Now, as much as I&#39;m against the feebleness
                    of British showers, I must ask if it&#39;s entirely necessary
                    that a shower should <i>hurt</i>? This thing has a setting
                    called &#39;massage&#39; and it&#39;s not a massage. A massage involves
                    relaxation, the soft, enquiring hands of a 22-year-old
                    Scandinavian woman, and possibly an exchange of cash. The
                    setting on this shower ought more accurately to be labelled
                    &#39;Jumped By Thugs&#39;, you could mount the thing on top of a
                    truck and use it to crush riots. This is all the more
                    horrific when we approach the Second Thing. Because not only
                    does Margret leave our shower set to maim, she also leaves
                    it on cold.</SPAN><SPAN size="4"> </SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4">It&#39;s getting worse. I&#39;ve mentioned this, in
                    passing, before, but it&#39;s getting worse. We were watching
                    Hannibal on DVD the other week, and Margret was sitting
                    beside me, looking at the screen, right from the moment I
                    hit &#39;play&#39;. This, incidentally, is because before we watch
                    any DVD or video we have this ritual.</SPAN></li>
                <li><SPAN size="4">What Margret and I have, essentially, is a
                    Mexican stand-off with love instead of guns. OK, yes,
                    sometimes there are guns too. The important thing is the
                    mindset, though. Sure, people can argue about important
                    issues, that&#39;s fine, good luck to them I say. But where, I
                    ask you, are those people when you take away the meaningful
                    sources of disagreement? Lost. Utterly lost. Let me

                    Kinji Fukasaku know how to tell a love story or what?).
                    Around 8.30pm I came downstairs from putting the kids to bed
                    and started flicking through video cassettes. Margret, on
                    the sofa, lowered the magazine she was reading on to her lap
                    and asked suspiciously, &#39;What are you doing?&#39;</SPAN></li>

                    at the weekend. They&#39;d just been on a skiing trip and took a
                    digital camera with them. Many of you will know what the
                    first thing you do with a digital camera is. Well, let&#39;s put
                    that aside; you can go off to the newsgroups if you want to
                    look at that kind of thing. The <i>second</i> thing you do
                    with a digital camera, though, is take pictures of just <i>everything</i>.
                    You know you&#39;re not going to have to pay to get the photos
                    developed, so you snap away constantly. Our friends had
                    taken loads of pictures. Huge vistas of oscilloscope-trace
                    mountain ranges misting into the distance, people hissing
                    down the piste at precarious speeds, glistening snow settled
                    into creamy piles on the aching branches of trees, and so

                    it into the house (Margret will discover it eventually, of

                    which - one day, I&#39;m sure - will be the end of the

                    happens upon me, or pushing batteries into one of the

                    It&#39;s like living with Mork. It&#39;s not even as if I can use

                  <p><SPAN size="4">I was watching <i>Mission Impossible</i>
                      and it was making me uneasy. Tom Cruise was doing
                      something - infiltrating, probably, you know what he&#39;s
                      like - and he was continuously describing the situation to
                      his distant support buddies via his headset radio. For a
                      while, I naturally assumed that it was simply Tom Cruise&#39;s
                      big nose that was unsettling me and tried, using soothing
                      visualisations and breathing exercises, to move myself,
                      mentally, to a place where it wasn&#39;t an issue. But then -
                      the realisation freezing my arm and abruptly halting a
                      crisp&#39;s journey from bag to mouth - I had a small
                      epiphany: &#39;Lawks,&#39; I thought, &#39;This is my girlfriend.&#39;</SPAN></p>

                      rocks, fire, etc. - has a spirit, that <i>everything</i>
                      is, in some way, &#39;alive&#39;? Isn&#39;t that believed by some
                      people? &#39;Yes,&#39; you say, &#39;mad people.&#39; Well, I certainly
                      can&#39;t argue with you there (and don&#39;t wish to debate the
                      theory with any Californians who are reading either,

                      we&#39;re looking for a mystic answer, she certainly regards

                  <p><SPAN size="4">Margret was away with her friends the other
                      weekend. It was a hen party thing. I hesitate to mention
                      that, as English women on hen nights are quite the most
                      repellent spectacle it&#39;s possible to encounter - if we
                      happen across a group of hen night women when we&#39;re out
                      together, Margret will invariably point at them and dare
                      me to defend a culture that has incubated such an
                      embarrassment. So, let me stress that, though it was <i>technically</i>
                      a hen weekend, it wasn&#39;t the whooping, cackling, &#34;Look! We
                      have a huge inflatable penis and an openly desperate
                      desire to have you think we&#39;re fearless unfettered rebels
                      so don&#39;t let the fact that we clearly all work at a local
                      building society and are trying <i>way</i> too hard!&#34;
                      kind of affair that you&#39;ll often see congoing through
                      Brannigans in ill-advised skirts. It was still hen,
                      though, there&#39;s no escaping that. I stayed here with the
                      kids; if they asked where she was, I had planned - to
                      avoid inflicting on them the psychological damage of
                      knowing their mother was at a hen weekend - to say that
                      she was simply away serving a short sentence for
                      shoplifting. </SPAN></p>

                      Surprisingly, I&#39;m not being metaphorical. I mean we had an
                      actual earthquake: in the geological rather than the
                      emotional sense. It happened at about one o&#39;clock in the
                      morning, we were pretty close to the epicentre, and it was
                      4.8 on the Richter scale. Now, I&#39;m depressingly aware that
                      all you Californians are right now glancing up from your
                      crystals and pausing mid-mantra to snort, &#39;4.8? Poh.
                      That&#39;s not an earthquake, that&#39;s just someone slamming a
                      door.&#39; Well, yes, I suppose it&#39;s all relative, but here in
                      England where tectonics is less brash and showy, 4.8 is
                      easily vulgar enough to stand out. </SPAN></p>

                      were around at the point when my memory was jogged but,
                      before you start whining that you&#39;ve heard me mention this

                      sentence by now, wouldn&#39;t you?). I can&#39;t remember what we

                      in today&#39;s lesson we&#39;re focusing on style, not content.
                      Say we were arguing about, oh, lettuce (even if we

                      not to provide warmth or woo the eyes or give employment
                      to jacket makers. The purpose of this jacket was to
                      demonstrate to me my place in the world. To provide a
                      medium through which I might gain knowledge - much like
                      the rustling of the leaves at the Oracle of Dodona being a
                      means for discovering the will of Zeus. Only, you know,
                      except with lots more polyester. Margret bought this
                      jacket and placed it on a hanger in the hallway. Later
                      that day, when she judged I had approximately 1,285 things

                      cards at the moment, and Margret asked if I&#39;d print out a
                      family photo to include with them. (I have many photos of
                      us, taken during every season and in numerous different
                      locations - <i>all</i>, however, show precisely the same
                      pose: Margret - beaming smile; Mil - solemn resignation;
                      First Born - looking down at a Game Boy; Second Born -
                      tongue out at camera, fingers pulling up to expose inside
                      of nostrils.) Now, I&#39;m aware that including a family photo
                      with a Christmas card is not at all unusual in America,
                      and I don&#39;t want to appear to criticise this: I&#39;m sure
                      it&#39;s perfectly lovely when an American sends such a card
                      to another American. It&#39;s simply a tradition and no more a
                      cause for comment, in its context, than any other of the
                      fine customs unique to that country, like... um... like
                      pie eating competitions, say, or religious snake-handling.
                      As an English person, though, the notion of sending out
                      pictures of ourselves strikes me as narcissistically
                      brash. I mentioned this to Margret and, though she had
                      sympathy with the concept that (non-American) people who
                      send out photos of themselves might reasonably be assumed
                      to be utterly dreadful, she said she thought that
                      sometimes it was nice to get a picture. She thought it was
                      nice <i>for a very specific reason</i>. &#39;...because then
                      you can see what size they are.&#39; Now, this is clearly
                      nonsense - &#39;Oh, look - they&#39;re 8&#34;-by-4&#34;.&#39; - unless people
                      are sending out photographs of themselves next to an item
                      of known dimensions. A bit like those kidnap photos where
                      the victim is holding the day&#39;s paper: Bill, Emma, Helen,
                      Matt and Blackie ensure that they&#39;re posing by a
                      regulation, roadside telephone CAB box, with their arms
                      linked to avoid tricks of perspective. More pertinently,
                      though - what <i>the hell</i>? &#39;So you can see what size
                      they are&#39;? What on earth does that <i>mean</i>? Am I
                      expected to open a card, splutter out my mouthful of tea

                      well. As I think we&#39;ve established by now, providing
                      Margret with Christmas presents that evoke joy - rather
                      than massive, brutal retaliation - is something that must
                      be bought at a terrible cost. The fearful, Faust-blanching
                      price of this ability is to - quite literally - <i>listen
                        to everything that Margret says throughout the previous
                        year</i>. I mean, Kung Fu monks (according to the
                      omniscient well of knowledge that is popular 1970s
                      television) only had to do a decade or so of training then
                      carry a red hot metal bowl for a couple of meters with
                      their bare forearms. I have to <i>listen to everything
                        Margret says throughout the entire year</i>. Endless,
                      endless, <i>endless </i>hours of stuff about the
                      comparative aesthetic merits of different Ikea storage
                      units, just so I&#39;m there - prickling with alertness - on
                      those occasions when she slyly drops in a hint about what
                      she might like as a gift when the trial of buying one for
                      her confronts me again. As I say, though, last year,
                      twelve months worth of intelligence gathering paid off.
                      This Christmas morning she was so thrilled that she stared

                      Conan Doyle hit upon with Sherlock Holmes was, as you
                      know, Holmes&#39;s ability to infer a rich world into
                      existence using only the tiniest piece of evidence. A
                      chipped fingernail, a certain blend of tobacco or the
                      uneven wear on a heel would be enough for England&#39;s finest
                      consulting detective to arrive at an irrefutable and
                      revealing conclusion. Margret is rather like that. She too
                      can pick up a minuscule detail and tease a many-layered
                      story from it. In fact, the only real difference at all
                      between Margret and Sherlock Holmes is that all of
                      Margret&#39;s deductions are complete bollocks.</SPAN><SPAN size="4">. &#39;You started wearing T-shirts. You never used

                      the army - but I can&#39;t, as I have trouble with the bit
                      where I try to imagine them reading a book.) Now, in the

                      understood that saying this unambiguously positive thing
                      about my girlfriend is in no way a capitulation to the

                    her error - time and time again - until Margret finally

                    to the park, I will take the kids; if Margret takes them,
                    she will also take along four extra pairs of shoes, &#39;just in
                    case&#39;. (And while, during my trip, they will be careful,
                    during hers they will fall knee-deep into a fetid duck pond
                    six times.) Anyway, in the back seat, wedged in between all
                    the garments, are <a href="https://thelabyrinth.substack.com/p/pics/jonathan.wmv">First Born</a>

                    our drive, goes to the end of the road, and turns left.

                    found the kitchen on fire because I&#39;d left something under
                    the grill then I&#39;m prepared to bet my legs that her reaction
                    would not be to put the fire out or to call the emergency
                    services, but rather to march into the room where I was and
                    say, &#39;<i>Well</i>?&#39; I can&#39;t blink now. If Margret says, &#39;the
                    <i>kitchen</i>,&#39; then there&#39;s only one thing to reply.]</SPAN><SPAN size="4"></SPAN><SPAN size="4"> <br/>
