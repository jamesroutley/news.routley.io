Not a one was using a cart.&#34; </p><p>Women would say, &#39;No, we have pushed enough baby buggies around -- we are not going to push carts in stores,&#39;&#34; Goldman recalled in a 1972 letter. Men thought the carts would make them look weak.</p><p>&#34;Men customers would say, &#39;With my big arms I can carry my baskets, I am not pushing one of those things,&#39;&#34; he said.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_9A1CCB12-6CC9-B948-DEFC-B522A842F813"><h3>The arrival of supermarkets</h3></p><p>The adoption of shopping carts came just as supermarkets burst onto the scene in America.</p><p>Prior to supermarkets, shoppers would go to their local grocery store and a clerk would fill their orders over the counter or they would call them in for delivery.</p><p>But self-service supermarkets, which were first developed by Piggly Wiggly in Memphis in 1916 and allowed shoppers to pick items off shelves themselves, began replacing this model. </p><p>In the ensuing decades, as more Americans started driving, larger supermarkets with parking lots began opening in new suburbs.</p><div><div><div><p><img alt="How people shopped before carts arrived." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511202252-shopping-cart-1944-restricted-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>Yet despite shoppers having cars with trunks and new refrigerators at home to keep food fresh for longer, they were still carrying baskets as they browsed around stores and were unlikely to stock up.</p><div data-paragraph-id="paragraph_047046DD-337E-626A-0BA7-B8759497DAFD"><p>&#34;You start with self service with a basket. By the time people start driving cars, you want to buy more than you carry,&#34; said historian Susan Strasser, author of &#34;<a href="https://www.smithsonianbooks.com/store/history/satisfaction-guaranteed-making-american-mass-marke/" target="_blank">Satisfaction Guaranteed: The Making of the American Mass Market.&#34;  </a></p></div><p>A grocery chain in Texas offered carts in the early 1900s, but they didn&#39;t gain traction, in part because baskets were considered aristocratic. </p><p>&#34;There was a kind of embarrassment about asking customers to push carts around,&#34; Warnes said.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_E67F5B62-4A06-C35A-9E31-B92139839DE6"><h3>A folding chair on wheels</h3></p><p>Goldman, a supermarket pioneer in Oklahoma with Standard Food Markets and Humpty Dumpty stores, saw that customers would stop shopping once their basket was full or became too heavy. </p><p>His first solution was to direct store clerks to offer a second basket to customers and hold the full one at the checkout counter.</p><p>Then, in 1936, Goldman came up with an idea for a rolling cart. With the help of a handyman, he attached wheels to a folding chair and put a basket on top.</p><p>He also believed that offering shoppers a cart would lead them to buy more, increasing sales for the company.</p><p>&#34;If there were some way we could give that customer two baskets to shop with and still have one hand free to shop we could do considerably more business,&#34; he later recalled.</p><p>Goldman started the Folding Basket Carrier Co. (today called Unarco, owned partly by Berkshire Hathaway) and placed an ad in a local newspaper alerting customers to his new invention. </p><div><div><div><p><img alt="Sylvan Goldman, the father of the modern shopping cart." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512132549-sylvan-goldman-restricted-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>&#34;Can you imagine wending your way through a spacious food market without having to carry a cumbersome shopping basket on your arm?&#34; the ad read.</p><p>But few shoppers took to the carts at first. </p><p>To convince customers to use them, Goldman hired people to walk around the store with shopping carts and fill them up. </p><p>Customers began following these shills&#39; example and soon all of Goldman&#39;s stores were equipped with carts.

A few years later, he introduced a cart with a child seat.</p><p>The biggest change to the cart came in 1946, when Orla Watson in Kansas City patented the &#34;telescope cart&#34; -- allowing them to slide together in horizontal stacks to alleviate the storage dilemma.</p><p>Watson claimed that each of the new carts required only one-fifth as much space as Goldman&#39;s folding carts.</p><p>In response, Goldman patented a similar telescoping version of his own, the Nest Kart. &#34;No more basket carrier parking problem,&#34; an ad for Goldman&#39;s Nest Karts read.</p><p>Goldman and Watson got in a legal fight over the patent, but they reached an agreement in which Goldman won the right to license the telescoping version of the cart.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_2408F366-8666-7A8D-1850-B96811265FF4"><h3>Leaving the store</h3></p><div data-paragraph-id="paragraph_52DB0204-22DE-0C41-C6AF-AFAEB9BCC561"><p>The shopping cart&#39;s basic design hasn&#39;t changed much since then. Seatbelts were added to the child seats in the 1960s, although that hasn&#39;t prevented <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/article/new-concerns-over-rising-number-of-children-hurt-in-shopping-cart-accidents" target="_blank">thousands of shopping cart accidents involving children </a>each year.</p></div><p>&#34;It&#39;s difficult to improve upon it as a design,&#34; Warnes said. &#34;The metal is durable. The mesh system is transparent. The child seat is a brilliant solution for shopping with a small child. It&#39;s stackable so it&#39;s really easy for transporting&#34;</p><p>Perhaps the biggest development for shopping carts in later decades is how they wound up outside of stores. </p><div><div><div><p><img alt="Cities and towns have tried to crack down on stray shopping carts.
