      <span>Abstract:</span>  The weight matrix (WM) of a neural network (NN) is its program. The programs
of many traditional NNs are learned through gradient descent in some error
function, then remain fixed. The WM of a self-referential NN, however, can keep
rapidly modifying all of itself during runtime. In principle, such NNs can
meta-learn to learn, and meta-meta-learn to meta-learn to learn, and so on, in
the sense of recursive self-improvement. While NN architectures potentially
capable of implementing such behavior have been proposed since the &#39;90s, there
have been few if any practical studies. Here we revisit such NNs, building upon
recent successes of fast weight programmers and closely related linear
Transformers. We propose a scalable self-referential WM (SRWM) that uses outer
products and the delta update rule to modify itself. We evaluate our SRWM in
supervised few-shot learning and in multi-task reinforcement learning with
procedurally generated game environments. Our experiments demonstrate both
practical applicability and competitive performance of the proposed SRWM. Our
code is public.
