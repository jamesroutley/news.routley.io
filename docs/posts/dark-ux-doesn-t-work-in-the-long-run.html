<p>I was just feeling pretty goodâ€”I published <a href="https://www.pcloadletter.dev/blog/rss">my article about RSS</a> and it&#39;s being pretty well-received.</p>
<p>I decided a fitting way to celebrate was to head on over to Feedly and catch up on some reading! I clicked on an engineers blog feed to check out here latest couple posts. I notied an ad in the middle of the feed. That&#39;s fair: I am using a free version of Feedly so it only makes sense they&#39;d show me an ad.</p>
<p>I clicked &#34;X&#34; in the top corner of the ad. This is where things went sideways.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pcloadletter.dev/img/dark-ux.gif" alt="when clicking the X, I got a message telling me the only way to hide the add was a paid Feedly membership"/></p>
<p>Instead of dismissing the ad, Feedly shows me a popup/tooltip informing me that the only way to remove &#34;this module&#34; (read: advertisment) is to &#34;Back Feedly directly via Feedly Pro.&#34;</p>
<p>Again, I have no problem that Feedly advertises on its free tier, but providing a dismiss button that doesn&#39;t work is dark UX. I feel deceived. I&#39;m not going to pay for your service, I&#39;m not going to click on the ad.</p>
<h2 id="dark-ux-warning-signs" tabindex="-1">Dark UX warning signs <a href="#dark-ux-warning-signs">#</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to assume the best here: Feedly didn&#39;t know they had implemented dark UX and would readily fix it once pointed out. To help prevent such issues in the future, I&#39;m going to list some tips here to help recognize when you may be implementing dark UX. I&#39;m a web engineer, so that&#39;s where my focus will be. I&#39;m sure the principles apply to other engineering disciplines as well.</p>
<h3 id="the-action-doesn-t-match-the-event-handler" tabindex="-1">The action doesn&#39;t match the event handler <a href="#the-action-doesn-t-match-the-event-handler">#</a></h3>
<p>I can tell Feedly uses React so let&#39;s pretend they&#39;re using a React component library and this ad is being shown in a <code>FeedCard</code> component.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>function</span> <span>Feed</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
		<span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
			</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>FeedCard</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>First post</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>FeedCard</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
			</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>FeedCard</span></span>
				<span>onDismiss</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
					<span>showSubscribePopup</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
				<span>}</span><span>}</span></span>
			<span>&gt;</span></span><span>
				Ad content
			</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>FeedCard</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
			</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>FeedCard</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Second post</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>FeedCard</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
		</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
	<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice how our event handler is called <code>onDismiss</code>, yet when we call it, we&#39;re not dismissing the card. Instead, we&#39;re showing a popup asking people to subscribe. It should be clear from the <code>onDismiss</code> property name that the intended action here is dismissing the card, not showing some other UI.</p>
<h3 id="you-re-intercepting-events-and-doing-something-user-facing-solely-for-your-benefit" tabindex="-1">You&#39;re intercepting events and doing something user-facing solely for your benefit <a href="#you-re-intercepting-events-and-doing-something-user-facing-solely-for-your-benefit">#</a></h3>
<p>There are plenty of legitimate reasons to listen to events (it&#39;s why they exist!). But if you&#39;re intercepting a user&#39;s events and showing them something solely for your benefit, you&#39;re probably implementing a dark UX pattern.</p>
<p>A good example of this is listening to the scroll event and showing a popup when someone gets a certain distance down the page:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>window<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;scroll&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span>window<span>.</span>scrollY <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1000</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>showSubscribePopup</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>The user is just trying to scroll your website and <em>bam</em>, a popup to the face. I&#39;m actually surprised at how prevalent this pattern is these days given how unpleasant it is.</p>
<h3 id="someone-is-trying-to-leave-and-you-try-to-stop-them" tabindex="-1">Someone is trying to leave and you try to stop them <a href="#someone-is-trying-to-leave-and-you-try-to-stop-them">#</a></h3>
<p>This one is really rough. Browsers have done a decent job at tamping down <a href="https://javascript.info/onload-ondomcontentloaded#window.onbeforeunload"><code>unload</code> and <code>beforeunload</code> event abuse</a>, but there are still some ways to be obnoxious when someone is trying to leave your page. One common dark pattern right now is to show a popup when someone&#39;s mouse leaves the document.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>document<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;mouseleave&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>showSubscribePopup</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>When I find this happening, I&#39;m usually about to type something in the URL bar or close the tab. The &#34;Wait don&#39;t go yet&#34; popup is visually jarring.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is very different than if a user is editing a document on your web app and you prevent them from leaving because they may lose their work. As always, context is everything.</p>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-thumb-don-t-subvert-user-expectations" tabindex="-1">The rule of thumb: don&#39;t subvert user expectations <a href="#the-rule-of-thumb-don-t-subvert-user-expectations">#</a></h2>
<p>The rule of thumb when you&#39;re designing or engineering systems that users interact with is to not subvert their expectations. If there&#39;s a UI element (e.g., an &#34;X&#34; button) that has a common behavior, don&#39;t make your &#34;X&#34; button do something different. If someone is trying to use native browser functionality, don&#39;t override it (without really good reason that benefits the user).</p>
<p>Perhaps some of these dark UX patterns work in the short term. Maybe you get a couple extra email signups or some paid memberships. But longer term, I have to imagine this catches up with you: your website or brand&#39;s reputation takes a hit. Or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ll choose to believe to make myself feel better.</p>
