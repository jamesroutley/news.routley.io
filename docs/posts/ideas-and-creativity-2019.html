    <h1>Ideas and Creativity (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Developing ideas is <em>the</em> central aspect of many professions, including—but
certainly not limited to—academic research and software development.
It is my impression that we often consider ideas, or creativity in
general, to be some magical binary property: you either have ideas
and are a creative mastermind, or not. The purpose of this article
is to <em>challenge</em> this assumption and discuss aspects of ideation,
i.e. the process of coming up with ideas. We will look at some
all-too-common fallacies before taking a quick dive into time-tested
creativity techniques.</p>

<p>Many people believe that there is a line that separates ‘the creative ones’
from ‘the mundane ones’. This type of thinking is too restrictive.
While it <em>is</em> true that certain people are more creative than others,
the same could also be said about knowledge, for example: some people
are more knowledgeable (in certain subjects) than others, but just
as there are ways of increasing your knowledge, there are also ways of
increasing your creativity. We <em>all</em> have the potential to be creative;
if you do not believe this, think back to when you were younger, or, if
possible, watch toddlers playing with toys—their imaginations are
boundless and they are able to imbue even the most mundane objects with
a sense of wonder and magic.</p>

</div>
<p>If you consider this to be some pabulum, please do read on! This is
<em>not</em> one of the articles in which the author says that ‘we must be like
children’ again. I know perfectly well that toddlers are not primarily
known for their creative solutions to software design problems. I merely
want to illustrate that creativity appears to be something innate to
each of us, but over time, not many of are privileged enough to exercise
that particular muscle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The cliché that there are creative people and <em>others</em> has accompanied
our species for some time now. Even Shakespeare mentions this
incorrect (!) dichotomy in <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines are spoken by <em>Theseus</em>, the duke of Athens, and I am
reasonably sure that Shakespeare uses him as the voice of the
‘realists’, the ‘disgruntled ones’ that seem to watch the creative
process from the outside and, not being able to replicate it, scoffing
it for something that belongs to the realm of ‘madmen’. Yet, this quote
also contains a hidden remedy: the lover is able to see the beauty of
Helen of Troy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> in his beloved because of a <strong>shift in perspective</strong>.
As we shall see, these shifts—and playfulness—are precisely what drives creativity!</p>

<p>Before looking into some creative factors, I want to dispense with
another falsehood many people believe, viz. that a good idea has
to be ’entirely novel’. In academia, <em>novelty</em> (or the perceived lack
thereof) is the bane of every author—a reviewer may tell you that
your paper lacks clarity and you might just accept it, but the statement
<em>Your paper lacks novelty</em> can be soul-crushing. This quest for novelty
can lead to self-censorship in the worst case, because budding researchers
are stopping themselves from further developing their ideas.</p>
<p>However, in almost all scientific domains, many new discoveries are
achieved by <strong>combining existing ideas</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In some sense, almost <em>all</em>
new ideas are achieved by a combination or (small) extension of
existing ones. This is even reflected in the origins of some of the
words that we tend to use in these contexts. For example, the word
<em>cogitate</em> has its roots in the Latin word <em>cogitare</em>, which means ’to
consider something together with something else’. Similarly, the word
<em>intellect</em> comes from the Latin word <em>intellectus</em>, whose verb form
<em>intellegere</em> also has the meaning of ’to choose between’. We are rarely
aware of these surprising meanings that lurk under the surface of our
daily language<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/ideas_stacking.jpg" alt="A stack of rocks"/><figcaption>
      <p>Good ideas can also be generated by combining <em>existing</em> ones</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>Of course, not all potential combinations of ideas are worthwhile to
purse. A hallmark of creativity is the knowledge or intuition of picking
ideas that make suitable combinations. This intuition needs time and
exercise to grow, though. If we briefly adopt a reductionist
perspective, we see a manifold of examples around us that are created by
combinations—and sometimes, this reductionist perspective can be
helpful and strip away the veneer of ‘creative genius’ that we tend to
liberally apply<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A smartphone is ‘simply’ a combination of a myriad of other
devices that preceded it: a calculator, a music player,
a phone, …</li>
<li>A Swiss Army knife is ‘just’ a combination of several other small
tools, packed into a single unit.</li>
<li>An electrical car is ‘merely’ a car that is powered by a large
battery.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list goes on and on. A trite observation about machine learning, for
example, is that it is ‘just’ function optimisation with extra steps, or
‘just’ <em>curve fitting</em>. The many air quotes in this section are meant to
indicate that combining something in such a productive manner is <strong>absolutely
creative</strong> and requires enormous amounts of imagination. At the same time,
these examples also demonstrate that <em>novelty</em> can always be achieved,
even through the combination of that which exists.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/ideas_blank.jpg" alt="A blank paper notebook"/><figcaption>
      <p>The page is blank for now, but your mind is filled to the brim with ideas</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>However, do not fall into the trap of <strong>second-guessing</strong> every idea you have. If
your mindset is ‘this has all been done before’, you will already
decrease your chances because you approach the problem with a negative
angle. Instead, you should follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...">‘Yes,
and…’</a> approach of
improvisational comedy: take your initial idea and <em>expand</em> on
it—tweak some things, add some things, and generally play around
with it.</p>

<p>Our <em>unconscious</em> plays the crucial role in creativity and
problem-solving. Almost everyone encountered a situation in which they
were chipping away at a problem for hours and hours to no avail. Yet,
after taking a walk, a bath, or a good night’s sleep, suddenly the
solution presented itself. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy">G. H.  Hardy</a>, two of the most pre-eminent
mathematicians of the last century, allotted time for unconscious
processing in their daily routines: they only spent about four
hours (!) each day on mathematics as such; the rest was spent on
reading, correspondence, taking a walk, or sports. Even though not
everyone has the luxury of a four-hour workday, the role of our
unconscious is often not highlighted to a sufficient extent. If you have
a certain problem fully embedded in your mind and do something else,
your brain will chip away at the problem without you being aware of it.
The same is true for ideas—if you let your ideas simmer, they are
sure to bear fruit and germinate into something else.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/ideas_path.jpg" alt="A road flanked by trees"/><figcaption>
      <p>This is where your next idea might be born</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>Of course waiting for inspiration to strike while walking might seem
a little bit reckless. Luckily, there are also other strategies that
influence your creativity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>
stated that ‘In the fields of observation chance favours only the prepared mind’.
How can you prepare your mind? One way is to <em>read</em> a lot or in general,
to draw on many different sources for your inspiration. If you are
a researcher, try to read widely—both inside and outside of your
field. If you are a software developer, read a lot of code in a lot of
different languages. Whatever you do, do not restrict yourself by
narrowing down your focus too much<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. It is a mistake I often observe: in
the interest of being productive, time for inspiration and for
self-driven learning is cut down to almost nothing, leaving your mind
a barren wasteland that is desperately in need of inspiration. Drawing
inspiration from several different sources will also lead to more ideas
because you will be able to see <strong>connections between different
concepts</strong> more easily.</p>
<p>As a last point, I want to stress the need for <em>playful exploration</em>.
Whenever you encounter a new concept or a new article, you could scour
it for ideas and then start playing around with them. Above, I mentioned
that good ideas can be combinations of existing ones—the
converse can also be true. What happens to a concept if you <strong>take away
certain key characteristics</strong>? Do you end up with something more generic
or something that makes no sense at all? A very neat example would be
the car, which is what you get when you take a horse-drawn carriage and
remove the horses<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. As another classical and more mathematical
example, consider how the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space">hyperbolic
spaces</a> in mathematics
arose: researchers were wondering about the necessity of the axioms of
ordinary Euclidean geometry. Specifically, they <em>removed</em> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate">parallel
postulate</a><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and
found out that, against all common sense, the resulting geometries were
useful and fascinating.</p>

<p>I hope this little article demonstrated that <em>anyone</em> can
become (more) creative. If you feel ‘stuck’ at a problem, consider
the techniques mentioned above, or try out some others—there is
a plethora of different brainstorming techniques or ideation techniques
out there. As a starting point into this vibrant field, I would
recommend the book <em>Thinkertoys: A Handbook of Creative-Thinking
Techniques</em> by <a href="https://thinkjarcollective.com/members/michael-michalko">Michael Michalko</a>; his
website is also chock full of interesting exercises and short techniques
for getting your imagination running. For the mathematically-inclined,
I definitely also recommend reading the book <em>The Psychology of
Invention in the Mathematical Field</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard">Jacques
Hadamard</a> that was
already mentioned a few times in passing. To this day, it is a uniquely
interesting and timeless book, discussing a variety of creative techniques that are
used by leading mathematicians and physicists. Its contents are fully
accessible for any layperson, and I would urge all researchers to at
least skim it.</p>

<p>That being said, <strong>do not worry</strong> about your ideas too much—in time,
you will have lots of them, and we all know that having a good idea
requires having a lot of bad ideas first.</p>
