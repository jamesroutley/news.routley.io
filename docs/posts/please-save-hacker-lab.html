    Hacker Lab on R Street in Sacramento CA
  </a>

  

  <p>
    This is a humble plea to any potential <span>angel investors, philanthropists or
      socially-minded tech millionaires</span> out there to please save Hacker Lab, <span>a beloved world-class makerspace</span> in the heart of midtown Sacramento.
    According to the staff, barring any major financial assistance offers or opportunities they will begin
    <a target="new" href="https://hackerlab.org/en">closing at the end of July</a>.
  </p>

  <!-- <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">
  I worked at the Exploratorium for a long time and have tried to find affordable and functional makerspaces living in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. I can say with no reservations whatsoever that Hacker Lab is the most inspiring, professional and well-equipped makerspace that I have ever encountered.
</p> -->

  <p>
    I suspect I am not alone in saying that Hacker Lab is without a doubt <span>the most
      inspiring, professional and well-equipped makerspace that I have ever encountered</span>. I&#39;m a fairly new member
    and not an official representative of the space but as a remote tech worker and artist I&#39;m finding it nearly
    impossible to imagine Sacramento&#39;s tech or arts culture without it and I desperately want it to survive in some
    form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again the staff has expressed that <span>they are open to financial assistance</span>
    and alternatives to closing. <span>If you are able to help in any way</span> please
    reach out directly to the Hacker Lab team. Thank you for checking this out and passing it along if you can. üôè‚ú®

  <p>
    Hacker Lab has been <span>operating for the past decade</span> in Sacramento, at
    times with multiple branches in neighboring communities. During that time they&#39;ve <span>offered an enormous range of resources and services</span> that have helped to make
    Sacramento one of the most advantageous cities in California for aspiring artists, makers and creatively-inclined
    programmers.
  </p>

  <p>
    No other facility in Sacramento or any other city I&#39;ve personally lived in compares to the range of Hacker Lab&#39;s
    resources, and <span>for many members there are truly no alternatives</span> in terms
    of fulfilling the practical creative needs these represent.
  </p>

  <h2>Services &amp; Resources</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>memberships for <span>24 hour facility access</span></li>
    <li>open desks and benches in large shared work spaces</li>
    <li>clean and well-stocked shared kitchen area</li>
    <li>enormous <span>wood and metal shops</span></li>
    <li><span>ridiculously wide range of tools</span> and equipment</li>
    <li>separate photography room and <span>3D printer room</span></li>
    <li>public <span>training classes</span> for using equipment</li>
    <li>private shop lockers for personal equipment</li>
    <li>private <span>desk and office rentals</span> for small businesses</li>
    <li>devoted front desk and administrative staff</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">
  I worked at the Exploratorium in San Francisco for a long time and got to work in the fabrication shop at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles for a while as well.
</p> -->

  <p>
    When I first toured Hacker Lab I was legitimately shocked at the range of tools and equipment they had available. As
    someone who had moved to Sacramento relatively recently it was beyond inspiring and fundamentally changed my outlook
    for a future here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again they have announced that <span>they will be selling off this equipment</span>
    in some form and if anyone had the capital necessary this could represent <span>a
      unique opportunity to acquire all the hardware necessary to stock a world-class makerspace</span> in one sweep
    rather than piecemeal. Of course it would make infinitely more sense to also take advantage of the space and devoted
    staff that also already exist and have been maintaining this equipment and training people on it for the past 10
    years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below I&#39;ve tried to list out <span>Hacker Lab&#39;s major equipment</span> in the hopes
    of <span>illustrating what a truly amazing space this is</span>. In addition to all
    this there are innumerable smaller general purpose and niche tools available.

  <p>
    Again, Hacker Lab is undoubtedly <span>the most inspiring, professional and
      well-equipped space that I have ever worked in</span>. From the perspective of a remote tech worker and artist who
    is still relatively new to Sacramento the loss of Hacker Lab feels absolutely devastating. The tech and arts culture
    of this city will be a fundamentally different without the presence of this kind of makerspace.
