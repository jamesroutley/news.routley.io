				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>When payments giant Stripe </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/"><span>raised $600 million</span></a><span> at a $95 billion valuation in 2021, it made headlines for raising capital at the highest-ever valuation for a privately held startup.</span></p>
<p><span>Defending that valuation appears to be challenging. The fintech company has reportedly approached investors about raising more capital — at least $2 billion — at a valuation of $55 billion to $60 billion. According to The </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-01-26-2023/card/stripe-held-talks-for-new-funding-at-60-billion-valuation-aHC2sG3rw0wXjoTotK4S" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wall Street Journal</span></a><span>, Stripe would not use the money toward operating expenses but rather to cover a large annual tax bill associated with employee stock units. It is not clear if any discussions are ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span>That information came to light </span><span>on the same day that </span><span>Stripe was said to have told employees that it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/26/fintech-stripe-eyes-an-exit/"><span>set a 12-month deadline</span></a><span> for itself to either go public or </span><span>pursue a transaction on the private market.</span></p>
<p><span>TechCrunch reached out to Stripe, which responded with “no comment.”</span></p>
<p><span>The news comes after several months of apparent struggles at Stripe. In November, it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/stripe-cuts-14-of-its-workforce-ceo-says-they-overhired-for-the-world-were-in/"><span>laid off</span></a><span> 14% of its staff, or around 1,120 people, saying it had </span>“<span>overhired for the world we’re in.”</span> <span>And the company slashed its internal valuation more than once over the past year. Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that Stripe had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/stripe-internal-valuation-63-billion-409a/"><span>cut its internal valuation</span></a><span> to $63 billion. That 11% cut came after an internal valuation </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/14/stripe-fintech-payments-valuation-cut-28/"><span>cut that occurred six months</span></a><span> prior, which valued the company at $74 billion.</span></p>
<p>Raising more capital at a $55 billion to $60 billion valuation would certainly be characterized as a down round <span>—</span> but Stripe would hardly be the first large fintech to do so. Fellow European and BNPL behemoth Klarna last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/11/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b/">raised $800 million at a $6.7 billion valuation</a>, an 85% drop compared to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/">$45.6 billion</a> it was valued at in June of 2021.</p>
<p><span>In 2021, Stripe reportedly notched gross revenues of $12 billion and was EBITDA profitable, according to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2022/05/26/stripe-exclusive-interview-collison-brothers-95-billion-plan-to-stay-on-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Forbes</span></a><span>. The company’s products, in its own words, power payments for online and in-person retailers, subscriptions businesses, software platforms and marketplaces, “and everything in between.” It has not publicly revealed revenue figures since 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>Stripe is one of many highly valued fintech startups that have hit road bumps as of late. In December, decacorn </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/plaid-layoff-fintech/"><span>Plaid laid off</span></a><span> 260 employees, or about 20% of its workforce, saying it had “hired and invested ahead of revenue growth.” </span></p>
<p><span>Notably, the two companies had a bit of a public spat last year — despite being partners — when Stripe unveiled in May </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/04/from-partners-to-competitors-what-stripes-latest-move-means-for-plaid/"><span>a new product</span></a><span>, Financial Connections. That new product was designed to give Stripe’s customers a way to connect directly to their customers’ bank accounts, to access financial data to speed up or run certain kinds of transactions — exactly what Plaid has done historically. Plaid came out swinging months later, unveiling its own </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/fintech-plaid-names-former-meta-exec-as-its-new-payments-head/"><span>payments push</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Founded by Irish brothers John and his brother Patrick Collison (the CEO), Stripe has raised more than $2.2 billion in funding since inception from investors such as Allianz (via its Allianz X fund), Axa, Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst, Base Partners, GV and an investor from the founders’ home country, Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).</span></p>
