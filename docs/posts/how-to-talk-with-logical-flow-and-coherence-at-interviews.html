    <h1>Ask HN: How to talk with logical flow and coherence at interviews</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I have noticed that at interviews, I struggle to build a proper narrative and talk coherently. I live in UK and English is not my first language which doesn&#39;t help. Most of the times the flow of my conversation is not fluent and it feels like I am putting up sentences one after the another and there is a ot of &#34;mmmaa&#34;, &#34;mmmaa&#34; in my talking. Are there any practical resources to improve my conversation skills?</td></div></div>
