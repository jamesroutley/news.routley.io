    <h1>New York Times Election Day Crossword (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I recently read a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1843540894?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=crossunclu-21&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=2506&amp;creative=9298&amp;creativeASIN=1843540894" target="_blank">Pretty Girl In Crimson Rose (8)</a><sup>[1]</sup>, an autobiography interweaved with interesting stories about crosswords. One such anecdote is about a remarkable crossword puzzle published in the New York Times in 1996. I looked it up on the net and (bless Google) found the puzzle online.</p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the grid and clues: </p>  <p><img title="new-york-times-election-day-crossword" height="808" alt="new-york-times-election-day-crossword" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_nSevIC7GzYM/SWcyIAGHisI/AAAAAAAAAQM/XImfZ-Nl0yc/nyt-cwd%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="491"/> </p>  <p><SPAN size="1">Crossword Copyright 1996 New York Times</SPAN></p>  <p>The NYT puzzle is not a cryptic one; it has straight clues with the occasional pun or cryptic definition. You&#39;ll notice another dissimilarity with regular cryptic crosswords: the NYT clues do not mention solution lengths. This feature was put to ingenious use in the 1996 Election Day Crossword.</p>  <p>The special clue is the one cutting across the centre of the grid - 39A(+43A): </p>  <p><SPAN color="#970000"><strong>Lead story in tomorrow&#39;s newspaper (!) </strong></SPAN></p>  <p>The answer to the central clue corresponds with two 7-letter spaces. </p>  <p>This puzzle was published on 5th November 1996, the day of the Presidential Election in US in which Bill Clinton and Bob Dole were the prime candidates. The lead story in the next day&#39;s newspaper would naturally be about the result of the election.</p>  <p>The checking letters for 39A worked out as:</p> <SPAN color="#970000">39D  Black Halloween animal             CAT    </SPAN>    <p>The solution stood like this, then:  </p>  <p><SPAN color="#970000">Lead story in tomorrow&#39;s newspaper (!):</SPAN> <strong>CLINTON ELECTED</strong></p>  <p>BUT at the time the crossword was published, <em>the election result had not been declared.</em> There were loud protests from solvers – was NYT being so presumptuous as to predict the result?</p>  <p>What they did not realize was that another group of solvers were sniggering over NYT&#39;s massive faux pas, for they had answered the same clue as BOB DOLE ELECTED.</p>  <p>The beauty of this puzzle is that there are <em>two possible solutions</em>. The clues for the crossing words are deliberately ambiguous and allow a completely different set of valid answers. So, if you answered the crossing clues like this:</p> <SPAN color="#970000">39D  Black Halloween animal             BAT    </SPAN>  <p>You would get this solution:    </p>  <p><SPAN color="#970000">Lead story in tomorrow&#39;s newspaper (!):</SPAN> <strong>BOB DOLE ELECTED</strong></p>  <p>Very few solvers at the time realized that a solution different from theirs was possible. </p>  <p>The exclamation mark in clue 39A works like it does with cryptic clues – signalling that something other than the obvious is going on. Of course, the same device couldn&#39;t have been used in a standard cryptic crossword as word length breakup of solutions - (7, 7) vs (3, 4, 7) - would have given the game away.</p>  <p>This crossword was designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Farrell">Jeremiah Farrell</a>. The New York Times crossword editor, <a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2011/02/wordplay-dvd-review.html#will-shortz">Will Shortz</a>, calls it his favourite puzzle of all time. </p>  <p>[1]: As you can guess, the title of the book <a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2009/09/pretty-girl-in-crimson-rose-8.html">Pretty Girl In Crimson Rose (8)</a> is a cryptic clue. Can you tell what the answer is? </p>  <p><strong><SPAN size="3">You might also enjoy reading:</SPAN></strong></p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2008/10/cryptic-clue-in-jeffrey-archers-quiver.html" target="_blank">Killer Clue</a>: An ominous cryptic clue in a Jeffrey Archer short story </li>    <li><a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2009/02/silicon-valley-puzzle-day-2009.html" target="_blank">The Silicon Valley Puzzle Day 2009</a>: Cryptic crossword workshops held annually in California, US </li>    <li><a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2009/01/3-dimensional-crosswords.html">3-Dimensional Crosswords</a>: Crosswords with not just ACROSS and DOWN, but also AWAY clues. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2008/08/tackling-cryptic-crosswords-7-step_11.html" target="_blank">Cryptic Crosswords Guide</a>: An introduction to the world of cryptic crosswords </li> </ul>  <p><span><em><span>If you wish to keep track of further articles on Crossword Unclued, you can subscribe to it in a reader via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CrosswordUnclued/" target="_blank"><u>RSS Feed</u></a>.
