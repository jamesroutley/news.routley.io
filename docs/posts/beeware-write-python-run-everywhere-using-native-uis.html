    <h1>BeeWare – write Python, run everywhere using native UIs</h1>

      <h3>One codebase. Multiple apps.</h3>

<p>BeeWare allows you to write your app in Python and release it on multiple platforms. No need to rewrite the app in multiple programming languages. It means <strong>no issues</strong> with build tools, environments, compatibility, etc.</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>Python native tools...</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/python.png"/> </p><p>Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. Why shouldn&#39;t you be able to <strong>use Python everywhere</strong> that you need to tell a computer to do something? And shouldn&#39;t your tools <strong>exploit all the capabilities of Python</strong> as a language, not just the bits that map nicely to a C binding?</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>...on mobile &amp; desktop...</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/cross-platform.png"/> </p><p>Modern computing doesn&#39;t happen in an 80x25 console window. It happens on <strong>phones, tablets, and desktop machines</strong> with rich user interfaces. Shouldn&#39;t you be able to use Python in all those locations, and <strong>exploit the unique capabilities of those platforms</strong>?</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>...behaving natively.</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/native.png"/> </p><p>End users shouldn&#39;t have to care what language their tools are written in. And that starts with looking and behaving <strong>like completely native tools</strong>. Native appearance, native behavior, delivered in the way a native app is delivered. Why shouldn&#39;t your Python tools fit in just as well as a native tool?</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h2>This is BeeWare.</h2>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/brutus-97.png"/> </p><p>This is what BeeWare provides. Tools to help you write Python code with a rich, <strong>native user interface</strong>; and the libraries and support code necessary to get that code running on <strong>iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows, tvOS, and more</strong>.</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>Open source</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/opensource.png"/> </p><p>The Open Source development process has proven itself to be the most reliable way to develop robust and reliable software. That&#39;s why the entire BeeWare suite of tools are BSD licensed, and <strong>available for all to use and modify</strong>.</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>All contributions welcome</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/labhr.png"/> </p><p>But it&#39;s not just about code. A successful software project requires documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare community acknowledges that <strong>all contributions are important</strong> — not just the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.</p>

    </div>
    
    
    
    <div>
      <h3>From diversity comes strength</h3>

<p><img src="https://beeware.org/diversity.png"/> </p><p>A diverse community is a strong community. This means accepting people of all levels of experience, from all backgrounds, of all races, creeds, orientations and expressions. The BeeWare project is committed to <strong>developing and maintaining a diverse, welcoming community</strong>. We have an <strong>open offer to mentor anyone</strong> who wants to get involved as a contributor, backed up by a <a href="https://beeware.org/community/behavior/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>  that is rigorously enforced.</p>
