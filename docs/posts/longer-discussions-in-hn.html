    <h1>Ask HN: Longer Discussions in HN?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I follow posts from Hacker News using RSS, specifically <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://hnrss.github.io/</a>. It&#39;s great to consume posts at my own pace, but often a discussion is already dead when I participate.</p><p>It&#39;s an acceptable trade-off to me. But I wonder if others would also be interested in longer term discussions, and if there could be a way to have them. I thought about old forums, where old threads get bumped even if they were created years ago, and wondered if an hybrid model could be of interest to HN users.</p><p>Just a thought, I&#39;m glad to have this site as is. Enjoy your Sunday everyone!</p></div></div></div>
