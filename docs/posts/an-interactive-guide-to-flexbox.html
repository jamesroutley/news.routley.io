When we <em>truly</em> understand how it works, we can build dynamic layouts that respond automatically, rearranging themselves as-needed.</p><p>For example, check this out:</p><p>This demo is heavily inspired by Adam Argyle’s incredible <a href="https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/LYEegOO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“4 layouts for the price of 1”</a> codepen. <em>It uses no media/container queries.</em> Instead of setting arbitrary breakpoints, it uses <em>fluid principles</em> to create a layout that flows seamlessly.</p><p>Here&#39;s the relevant CSS:</p><pre></pre><p>I remember running into demos like this and being completely baffled. I knew the basics of Flexbox, but this seemed like absolute wizardry!</p><p><strong>In this blog post, I want to refine your mental model for Flexbox.</strong> We&#39;ll build an intuition for how the Flexbox algorithm works, by learning about each of these properties. Whether you&#39;re a CSS beginner, or you&#39;ve been using Flexbox for years, I bet you&#39;ll learn quite a bit!</p><p>Let&#39;s do this!</p><div><h2><a name="introduction-to-flexbox" id="introduction-to-flexbox" href="#introduction-to-flexbox"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Introduction to Flexbox</h2></div><p>CSS is comprised of many different layout algorithms, known officially as “layout modes”. Each layout mode is its own little sub-language within CSS. The default layout mode is <em>Flow layout</em>, but we can opt in to Flexbox by changing the <code>display</code> property on the parent container:</p><p>When we flip <code>display</code> to <code>flex</code>, we create a “flex formatting context”. This means that, by default, all children will be positioned according to the Flexbox layout algorithm.</p><p><img alt="Clippy, the helpful paperclip assistant from Microsoft Word" src="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/clippy.png"/><strong>Each layout algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem.</strong> The default “Flow” layout is meant to create digital documents; it&#39;s essentially the <em>Microsoft Word</em> layout algorithm. Headings and paragraphs stack vertically as blocks, while things like text, links, and images sit inconspicuously within these blocks.</p><p><strong>So, what problem does Flexbox solve?</strong> Flexbox is all about arranging a group of items in a row or column, and giving us a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of control over the distribution and alignment of those items. As the name suggests, Flexbox is all about <em>flexibility</em>. We can control whether items grow or shrink, how the extra space is distributed, and more.</p><p>As mentioned, Flexbox is all about controlling the distribution of elements in a row or column. By default, items will stack side-by-side in a row, but we can flip to a column with the <code>flex-direction</code> property:</p><p>With <code>flex-direction: row</code>, the <em>primary axis</em> runs horizontally, from left to right. When we flip to <code>flex-direction: column</code>, the primary axis runs vertically, from top to bottom.</p><p><strong>In Flexbox, everything is based on the primary axis.</strong> The algorithm doesn&#39;t care about vertical/horizontal, or even rows/columns. All of the rules are structured around this primary axis, and the <em>cross axis</em> that runs perpendicularly.</p><p><strong>This is pretty cool.</strong> When we learn the rules of Flexbox, we can switch seamlessly from horizontal layouts to vertical ones. All of the rules adapt automatically. This feature is unique to the Flexbox layout mode.</p><p>The children will be positioned by default according to the following 2 rules:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Primary axis:</strong> Children will be bunched up at the <em>start</em> of the container.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross axis:</strong> Children will stretch out to fill the entire container.</p></li></ol><p>Here&#39;s a quick visualization of these rules:</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/flex-row.svg?v=6"/><img alt="" src="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/flex-column.svg?v=6"/></p><p>In Flexbox, we decide whether the primary axis runs horizontally or vertically. This is the root that all Flexbox calculations are pegged to.</p><p>We can change how children are distributed along the primary axis using the <code>justify-content</code> property:</p><p>When it comes to the primary axis, we don&#39;t generally think in terms of aligning a single child. Instead, it&#39;s all about the <em>distribution of the group.</em></p><p>We can bunch all the items up in a particular spot (with <code>flex-start</code>, <code>center</code>, and <code>flex-end</code>), or we can spread them apart (with <code>space-between</code>, <code>space-around</code>, and <code>space-evenly</code>).</p><p><strong>For the cross axis, things are a bit different.</strong> We use the <code>align-items</code> property:</p><p>It&#39;s interesting… With <code>align-items</code>, we have <em>some</em> of the same options as <code>justify-content</code>, but there isn&#39;t a perfect overlap.</p><div><svg viewBox="0 0 450 300"><circle cx="325" cy="150" r="150" stroke-width="3" fill="var(--color-venn-1)" transform="scale(1)" fill-opacity="0.35"></circle><circle cx="125" cy="150" r="150" stroke-width="3" fill="var(--color-venn-0)" transform="scale(1)" fill-opacity="0.35"></circle></svg><div><p>justify-content</p><p>align-items</p></div></div><p>Why don&#39;t they share the same options? We&#39;ll unravel this mystery shortly, but first, I need to share one more alignment property: <strong><code>align-self</code></strong>.</p><p>Unlike <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, <code>align-self</code> is applied to the <em>child element</em>, not the container. It allows us to change the alignment of a specific child along the cross axis:</p><p><code>align-self</code> has all the same values as <code>align-items</code>. In fact, <strong>they change the exact same thing.</strong> <code>align-items</code> is <em>syntactic sugar</em>, a convenient shorthand that automatically sets the alignment on all the children at once.</p><p>There is no <code>justify-self</code><span></span>. To understand why not, we need to dig deeper into the Flexbox algorithm.</p><p>So, based on what we&#39;ve learned so far, Flexbox might seem pretty arbitrary. Why is it <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, and not <code>justify-<em>items</em></code>, or <code>align-<em>content</em></code>?</p><p>For that matter, why is there an <code>align-self</code>, but not a <code><em>justify</em>-self</code>??</p><p><strong>These questions get at one of the most important and misunderstood things about Flexbox.</strong> To help me explain, I&#39;d like to use a metaphor.</p><p>In Flexbox, items are distributed along the primary axis. By default, they&#39;re nicely lined up, side-by-side. I can draw a straight horizontal line that skewers <em>all</em> of the children, like a <span>kebab<span>?</span></span>:</p><span type="default"><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27727.5%27%20height=%27158%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></span><p>The cross axis is different, though. A straight vertical line will only ever intersect <em>one</em> of the children.</p><p>It&#39;s less like a kebab, and more like a group of <span>cocktail wieners<span>?</span></span>:</p><span type="default"><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27458%27%20height=%27285%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></span><p>There&#39;s a significant difference here. With the cocktail wieners, each item can move along its stick <em>without interfering</em> with any of the other items:</p><p>By contrast, with our primary axis skewering each sibling, a single item <em>can’t</em> move along its stick without bumping into its siblings! <strong>Try dragging the middle piece side to side:</strong></p><p><strong>This is the fundamental difference between the primary/cross axis.</strong> When we&#39;re talking about alignment in the <em>cross</em> axis, each item can do whatever it wants. In the <em>primary</em> axis, though, we can only think about how to distribute the <em>group</em>.</p><p><strong>That&#39;s why there&#39;s no</strong> <code>justify-self</code><strong>.</strong> What would it mean for that middle piece to set <code>justify-self: flex-start</code>? There&#39;s already another piece there!</p><p>With all of this context in mind, let&#39;s give a proper definition to all 4 terms we&#39;ve been talking about:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>justify</code> — to position something along the <em>primary axis</em>.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>align</code> — to position something along the <em>cross axis</em>.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>content</code> — a group of “stuff” that can be distributed.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>items</code> — single items that can be positioned individually.</p></li></ul><p><strong>And so:</strong> we have <code>justify-content</code> to control the distribution of the group along the primary axis, and we have <code>align-items</code> to position each item individually along the cross axis. These are the two main properties we use to manage layout with Flexbox.</p><p>There&#39;s no <code>justify-items</code> for the same reason that there&#39;s no <code>justify-self</code>; when it comes to the primary axis, <em>we have to think of the items as a group,</em> as content that can be distributed.</p><p>What about <code>align-content</code>? Actually, this <em>does</em> exist within Flexbox! We&#39;ll cover it a little later on, when we talk about the <code>flex-wrap</code> property.</p><p>Let&#39;s talk about one of the most eye-opening realizations I&#39;ve had about Flexbox.</p><p>Suppose I have the following CSS:</p><pre></pre><p>A reasonable person might look at this and say: “alright, so we&#39;ll get an item that is 2000 pixels wide”. <em>But will that always be true?</em></p><p>Let&#39;s test it:</p><div><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header><div><div><div><div><p><label><div><pre aria-hidden="true"><p><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.flex-wrapper</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.item</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2000</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>item</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>flex-wrapper</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>item</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></label></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>This is interesting, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Both items have the exact same CSS applied.</strong> They each have <code>width: 2000px</code>. And yet, the first item is much wider than the second!</p><p>The difference is the <em>layout mode</em>. The first item is being rendered using Flow layout, and in Flow layout, <code>width</code> is a <em>hard constraint</em>. When we set <code>width: 2000px</code>, we&#39;ll get a 2000-pixel wide element, even if it has to burst through the side of the viewport like the Kool-Aid guy.</p><p>In <em>Flexbox</em>, however, the <code>width</code> property is implemented differently. It&#39;s more of a suggestion than a hard constraint.</p><p>The specification has a name for this: the <em color="var(--color-secondary)">hypothetical size</em>. It&#39;s the size an element <em>would</em> be, in a perfect utopian world, with nothing getting in the way.</p><p>Alas, things are rarely so simple. In this case, the limiting factor is that the parent <em>doesn&#39;t have room</em> for a 2000px-wide child. And so, the child&#39;s size is reduced so that it fits.</p><p>This is a core part of the Flexbox philosophy. Things are fluid and flexible and can adjust to the constraints of the world.</p><div><h2><a name="growing-and-shrinking" id="growing-and-shrinking" href="#growing-and-shrinking"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Growing and shrinking</h2></div><p>So, we&#39;ve seen that the Flexbox algorithm has some built-in flexibility, with <em>hypothetical sizes</em>. But to <em>really</em> see how fluid Flexbox can be, we need to talk about 3 properties: <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code>.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at each property.</p><p>I admit it: for a long time, I didn&#39;t really understand what the <em>deal</em> was with <code>flex-basis</code>. 😅</p><p><strong>To put it simply:</strong> In a Flex row, <code>flex-basis</code> does the same thing as <code>width</code>. In a Flex column, <code>flex-basis</code> does the same thing as <code>height</code>.</p><p>As we&#39;ve learned, everything in Flexbox is <em>pegged to the primary/cross axis</em>. For example, <code>justify-content</code> will distribute the children along the primary axis, and it works exactly the same way whether the primary axis runs horizontally or vertically.</p><p><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> don&#39;t follow this rule, though! <code>width</code> will always affect the horizontal size. It doesn&#39;t suddenly become <code>height</code> when we flip <code>flex-direction</code> from <code>row</code> to <code>column</code>.</p><p><strong>And so, the Flexbox authors created a generic “size” property called <code>flex-basis</code>.</strong> It&#39;s like <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>, but pegged to the <em>primary axis</em>, like everything else. It allows us to set the <em>hypothetical size</em> of an element in the primary-axis direction, regardless of whether that&#39;s horizontal or vertical.</p><p>Give it a shot here. All 4 children have been given <code>flex-basis: 50px</code>, but you can tweak the first child:</p><p>Like we saw with <code>width</code>, <code>flex-basis</code> is more of a suggestion than a hard constraint. At a certain point, there just isn&#39;t enough space for all of the elements to sit at their assigned size, and so they have to compromise, in order to avoid an overflow.</p><p>By default, elements in a Flex context will shrink down to their minimum comfortable size along the primary axis. This often creates extra space.</p><p>We can specify how that space should be consumed with the <code>flex-grow</code> property:</p><p>The default value for <code>flex-grow</code> is 0, which means that growing is opt-in. If we want a child to gobble up any extra space in the container, we need to explicitly tell it so.</p><p><strong>What if <em>multiple</em> children set <code>flex-grow</code>?</strong> In this case, the extra space is divvied up between children, proportionally based on their <code>flex-grow</code> value.</p><p>I think it&#39;ll be easier to explain visually. Try incrementing/decrementing each child:</p><p>The first child wants <!-- -->1<!-- --> <!-- -->unit<!-- --> of extra space, while the second child wants <!-- -->1<!-- --> <!-- -->unit<!-- -->. That means the total # of units is <strong>2</strong> (<!-- -->1<!-- --> + <!-- -->1<!-- -->). Each child gets a proportional share of that extra space.</p><svg preserveAspectRatio="none" fill="none" style="width:100%;max-width:100px"><line x1="0" y1="0" x2="20" y2="10"></line><line x1="20" y1="0" x2="40" y2="10"></line><line x1="40" y1="0" x2="60" y2="10"></line><line x1="60" y1="0" x2="80" y2="10"></line><line x1="80" y1="0" x2="100" y2="10"></line></svg><p>In most of the examples we&#39;ve seen so far, we&#39;ve had extra space to work with. But what if our children are <em>too big</em> for their container?</p><p><strong>Let&#39;s test it.</strong> Try shrinking the container to see what happens:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><dl><dt data-prop="true">flex-basis</dt><dd>300<!-- -->px</dd><dt>Reduced by:</dt><dd>0<!-- -->%</dd></dl></span></p></div><div><p><span><dl><dt data-prop="true">flex-basis</dt><dd>150<!-- -->px</dd><dt>Reduced by:</dt><dd>0<!-- -->%</dd></dl></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Interesting, right? Both items shrink, <strong>but they shrink proportionally.</strong> The first child is always 2x the width of the second child.<span></span></p><p>As a friendly reminder, <code>flex-basis</code> serves the same purpose as <code>width</code>. We&#39;ll use <code>flex-basis</code> because it&#39;s conventional, but we&#39;d get the <strong>exact same result</strong> if we used <code>width</code>!</p><p><code>flex-basis</code> and <code>width</code> set the elements&#39; <em>hypothetical size</em>. The Flexbox algorithm might shrink elements below this desired size, but by default, they&#39;ll always scale together, preserving the ratio between both elements.</p><p>Now, what if we <em>don&#39;t</em> want our elements to scale down proportionally? <strong>That&#39;s where the <code>flex-shrink</code> property comes in.</strong></p><p>Take a couple of minutes and poke at this demo. <strong>See if you can figure out what&#39;s going on here.</strong> We&#39;ll explore below.</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><dl><dt data-prop="true">flex-basis</dt><dd>250<!-- -->px</dd><dt data-prop="true">flex-shrink</dt><dd>1</dd><dt>Reduced by:</dt><dd>0<!-- -->%</dd></dl></span></p></div><div><p><span><dl><dt data-prop="true">flex-basis</dt><dd>250<!-- -->px</dd><dt data-prop="true">flex-shrink</dt><dd>1</dd><dt>Reduced by:</dt><dd>0<!-- -->%</dd></dl></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><svg preserveAspectRatio="none" fill="none" style="width:100%;max-width:100px"><line x1="0" y1="0" x2="20" y2="10"></line><line x1="20" y1="0" x2="40" y2="10"></line><line x1="40" y1="0" x2="60" y2="10"></line><line x1="60" y1="0" x2="80" y2="10"></line><line x1="80" y1="0" x2="100" y2="10"></line></svg><p>Alright, so: we have two children, each with a hypothetical size of 250px.

Well, we can&#39;t stuff 500px worth of content into a 400px bag! <em>We have a deficit of 100px.</em> Our elements will need to give up 100px total, in order for them to fit.</p><p><strong>The <code>flex-shrink</code> property lets us decide how that balance is paid.</strong></p><p>Like <code>flex-grow</code>, it&#39;s a ratio.

It may be the single most helpful thing in this entire article!</p><p>Let&#39;s suppose we&#39;re building a fluid search form for an e-commerce store:</p><p>When the container shrinks below a certain point, <strong>the content overflows!</strong></p><p><em>But why??</em> <code>flex-shrink</code> has a default value of <code>1</code>, and we haven&#39;t removed it, so the search input <em>should</em> be able to shrink as much as it needs to! Why is it refusing to shrink?</p><p><strong>Here&#39;s the deal:</strong> In addition to the <em>hypothetical</em> size, there&#39;s another important size that the Flexbox algorithm cares about: <em>the minimum size</em>.</p><p>The Flexbox algorithm refuses to shrink a child below its minimum size. The content will overflow rather than shrink further, <em>no matter how high we crank <code>flex-shrink</code>!</em></p><p>Text inputs have a default minimum size of 170px-200px (it varies between browsers). That&#39;s the limitation we&#39;re running into above.</p><p>In other cases, the limiting factor might be the element&#39;s content. For example, try resizing this container:</p><p>For an element containing text, the minimum width is the length of the <em>longest unbreakable string of characters.</em></p><p><strong>Here&#39;s the good news:</strong> We can redefine the minimum size with the <code>min-width</code> property.</p><p>By setting <code>min-width: 0px</code> directly on the Flex child, we tell the Flexbox algorithm to overwrite the “built-in” minimum width. Because we&#39;ve set it to 0px, the element can shrink as much as necessary.</p><p>This same trick can work in Flex columns with the <code>min-height</code> property (although the problem doesn&#39;t seem to come up as often).</p><p>One of the biggest Flexbox quality-of-life improvements in recent years has been the <code>gap</code> property:</p><p><code>gap</code> allows us to create space <em>in-between</em> each Flex child, along the primary axis. This is great for things like navigation headers:</p><p><code>gap</code> is a relatively new addition to the Flexbox language, but it&#39;s been <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=gap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">implemented across all modern browsers</a> since early 2021.</p><p>There&#39;s one other spacing-related trick I want to share. It&#39;s been around since the early days of Flexbox, but it&#39;s relatively obscure, and it <em>blew my mind</em> when I first discovered it.</p><p>The <code>margin</code> property is used to add space around a specific element. In some layout modes, like Flow and Positioned, it can even be used to center an element, with <code>margin: auto</code>.</p><p>Auto margins are much more interesting in Flexbox:</p><p>Earlier, we saw how the <code>flex-grow</code> property can gobble up any extra space, applying it to a child.</p><p>Auto margins will <strong>gobble up the extra space, and apply it to the element&#39;s margin.</strong> It gives us precise control over where to distribute the extra space.</p><p>A common header layout features the logo on one side, and some navigation links on the other side. Here&#39;s how we can build this layout using auto margins:</p><div><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header><div><div><div><div><p><label><div><pre aria-hidden="true"><p><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>ul</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>gap</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>li</span><span>.logo</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>margin-right</span><span>:</span><span> auto</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>logo</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>/</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Corpatech</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Mission</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Contact</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></label></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Corpatech</strong> logo is the first list item in the list. By giving it <code>margin-right: auto</code>, we gather up all of the extra space, and force it between the 1st and 2nd item.</p><p>We can see what&#39;s going on here using the browser devtools:</p><span type="default"><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27386%27%20height=%27284%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="Screenshot showing the above playground with an orange rectangle representing margin between the first item and the others" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></span><p>There are lots of other ways we could have solved this problem: we could have grouped the navigation links in their own Flex container, or we could have grown the first list item with <code>flex-grow</code>. But personally, I love the auto-margins solution. We&#39;re treating the extra space <em>as a resource</em>, and deciding exactly where it should go.</p><p>Phew! We&#39;ve covered <em>a lot</em> of stuff so far. There&#39;s just one more big takeaway I want to share.</p><p>So far, all of our items have sat side-by-side, in a single row/column. The <code>flex-wrap</code> property allows us to change that.</p><p>Check it out:</p><p>Most of the time when we work in two dimensions, we&#39;ll want to use CSS Grid, but Flexbox + <code>flex-wrap</code> definitely has its uses! This particular example showcases the <a href="https://web.dev/patterns/layout/deconstructed-pancake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“deconstructed pancake”</a> layout, where 3 items stack into an inverted pyramid on mid-sized screens.</p><p>When we set <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>, <strong>items won&#39;t shrink below their hypothetical size</strong>. At least, not when wrapping onto the next row/column is an option!</p><p><strong>But wait!</strong> What about our kebab / cocktail weenie metaphor??</p><p>With <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>, we no longer have a single primary axis line that can skewer each item. Effectively, <strong>each row acts as its own mini flex container.</strong>  Instead of 1 big skewer, each row gets its own skewer:</p><span type="default"><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27426%27%20height=%27283%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></span><p>All of the rules we&#39;ve learned so far continue to apply, within this reduced scope. <code>justify-content</code>, for example, will distribute the two pieces on each stick.</p><p>But hmm... How does <code>align-items</code> work, now that we have multiple rows? The cross axis <em>could</em> intersect multiple items now!</p><p><strong>Take a moment to consider.</strong> What do you <em>think</em> will happen when we change this property? Once you have your answer (or at least an idea), see if it&#39;s right:</p><div><div><div><div><div><p><label>flex-start</label><label>center</label><label>flex-end</label><label>stretch</label></p></div></div></div></div></div><p>Each row is its own mini Flexbox environment. <code>align-items</code> will move each item up or down within the invisible box that wraps around each row.</p><p>But what if we want to <em>align the rows themselves</em>? We can do that with the <code>align-content</code> property:</p><p>To summarize what&#39;s happening here:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> gives us two rows of stuff.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Within each row, <code>align-items</code> lets us slide each individual child up or down</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Zooming out, however, we have these two rows within a single Flex context!

But we&#39;re also still talking about the cross axis! And so the property we want is <code>align-content</code>.</p></li></ul><p>So I want to acknowledge something: <strong>this has been a dense tutorial.</strong> We&#39;ve gone <em>way</em> down the rabbit hole, and unless you&#39;re already a Flexbox pro, I expect your head is spinning a bit. 😅</p><p>Like so much in CSS, Flexbox might <em>seem</em> simple when you first get started, but the complexity ramps up quickly when you get beyond the basics.</p><p>As a result, so many of us hit an early plateau with CSS. We know enough to get things done, but it&#39;s a constant struggle. The language feels rickety and unpredictable, like an ancient rope bridge that could give out at any second. When it snaps, we hurl random StackOverflow snippets at the problem, hoping something will help.</p><p>It&#39;s no fun. And that sucks, since CSS is a pretty big part of most front-end dev jobs!</p><p>The thing is, <strong>CSS is actually a deeply robust and consistent language.</strong> The problem is that most of our mental models are incomplete and inaccurate. When we take the time to build a proper intuition for the language, things start to click, and CSS becomes an <em>absolute joy to use</em>. ✨</p><p>Last year, I released a comprehensive course called <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS for JavaScript Developers</a>.</p><a href="https://css-for-js.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span type="default"><img src="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/the-importance-of-learning-css/css-for-js-banner.png" alt=""/></span></a><p>The course is “multi-modality”, meaning that it uses lots of different forms of media.
