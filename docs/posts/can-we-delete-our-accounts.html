    <h1>Ask HN: Can we delete our accounts?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was checking out a post yesterday that used stylometry to group HN accounts, potentially doxxing the authors:</p><p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33755016</p><p>Honestly, it was pretty concerning to be able to locate an old account of mine. Given the potential danger of being doxxed, it would be very nice to be able to delete our accounts and old comments. I think HN is one of the only sites that doesn’t allow you to do that in an automated fashion. Can we request that feature be implemented? I worry that people are building tools to reverse engineering people’s true identities and it seems like an important feature to keep users safe from physical and commercial harm.</p></div></div></div>
