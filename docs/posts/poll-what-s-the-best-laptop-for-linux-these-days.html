    <h1>Poll: What&#39;s the best laptop for Linux these days?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So, Apple recently stopped supporting the last version of OS X that would run on a 2012 15&#34; retina MacBook Pro. In case you missed it, this design was the last one influenced by Steve Jobs and was absolutely epic, untouchable for almost a decade, really not surpassed until the M1 MacBooks came out.</p><p>Odds of me getting away with not using OS X are slim to none. But, I do enjoy my old ThinkPads running Ubuntu and find myself wondering if there are any non-Lenovo options that are real contenders these days. Any recommended go-bys for set-up or feature selections would be especially appreciated. My quick review suggests the top choices are listed below, but of course write-ins are welcome.</p></div></div></div>
