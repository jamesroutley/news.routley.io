<p>We&#39;ve just resolved some critical issues in Inkscape 1.2 that were identified by our community. If you&#39;re currently using Inkscape 1.2 then this is an important update to install on your device.</p>

<p>It provides a fix for a number of critical bugs in the 1.2 release:</p>

<ol>
	<li>drawing data about filters, markers, gradients and more now saves to file after performing a simple sequence of copy-paste-undo with the Export dialog open;</li>
	<li>startup is smoother when many fonts are installed, and</li>
	<li>rasterized (filtered) objects now show up on any page of a multipage document exported to PDF.</li>
</ol>

<p>This release brings back the built-in ability to open PostScript/Encapsulated PostScript (.ps / .eps) files with Inkscape on macOS. Improvements were also made to user interface translations and documentation translations.</p>

<p>Linux users using the snap packaging format will once again be able to import and export images. Windows users will now see the correct Inkscape version image on install, while users of macOS 10.13-10.15 will be able to open extensions without them crashing.</p>

<p>We wish to thank Inkscape users and contributors for their support in identifying and flagging these critical issues for us through sending bug reports for our volunteer developers to examine and solve. This collaboration is vital for us to ensure that Inkscape releases are working properly.</p>

<p>Should you experience an issue while using Inkscape, please consider sending us a bug report. We&#39;ve put together <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-jHXlLAMjE">a step-by-step video</a> to help you post it on Gitlab.</p>
