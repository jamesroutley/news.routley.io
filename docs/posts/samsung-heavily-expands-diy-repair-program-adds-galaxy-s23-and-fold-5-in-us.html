<p>Samsung’s DIY repair program has been a significant improvement over the limited options customers had just <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/03/31/samsung-ifixit-galaxy-repairs/">prior to 2022</a>. With a new update to the list of eligible devices, Samsung has added the Galaxy S23, Fold 5, Flip 5, and even one of its projectors to the DIY repair program.</p>



<p>Announced in a <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fl8d5v">blog post</a>, Samsung officially listed out a few devices that would be coming to the self-repair program in the US. That program allows users to purchase parts and kits online through companies like <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/samsung">iFixit</a>. The parts are always genuine and have been provided through Samsung, ensuring that what you replace your screen or battery with is the real thing.</p>



<p>The list of added products is surprisingly long. As mentioned, the repair list includes last year’s flagship phone, the <a href="https://howl.me/cltYhMzqmEZ">Galaxy S23</a>, as well as some of Samsung’s more fragile devices, like the Galaxy Z Fold and Fip 5. What’s even more interesting and exciting is the addition of non-mobile phones to the list, including several TVs from 2023 and some of Samsung’s Galaxy Book laptops.</p>



<p>Samsung previously announced that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy S23 would be supported soon, but that announcement did not include the US. This most recent post is aimed at devices in the US.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>The full list of devices added to the DIY repair program from Samsung can be found at the bottom of this article.</p>



<p>According to Samsung, there are a few limitations in place for each device. When it comes to phones and tablets, the speakers, SIM tray, side key, and volume key can be replaced. On top of that,  parts of the display assembly, back glass, and charging ports are replaceable. In Samsung’s PCs, the left and right speakers, fans, and display can be switched out. So can the battery, power key, touchpad, rubber feat, and casing.</p>



<p>The extent of what you can do at home with Samsung’s new repair kits is growing. Currently, on iFixit, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Samsung_Galaxy_S22_Plus">Samsung Galaxy S22</a> can only receive a screen/battery, back glass, and charging port kit. Nowhere is there a button, speaker, or SIM tray repair kit available. This is a big improvement.</p>



<p>The new repair kits for the devices listed below, such as the Galaxy S23 or Fold 5, aren’t available on iFixit just yet. Samsung doesn’t give a timeline on when these DIY repair kits will be available, but it likely won’t take long before they begin popping up online.</p>
