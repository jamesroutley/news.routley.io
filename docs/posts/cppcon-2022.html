In comparison, C++23 is a lot smaller in scope: its primary mission is to complete C++20, to fill holes, and to fix issues. Nevertheless, some great new features made the cut this time around, both in the standard library and in the core language. This is even more remarkable considering that the entire feature design phase of C++23 took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, challenging the ISO C++ committee to completely reinvent how we work together.</em></p><p><em>This is not a firehose talk about C++23 that tries to cram as many additions and improvements as possible into one hour. Instead, we deliberately focus on just a handful of new features that are going to noticeably change and improve the experience of the everyday C++ programmer. We will talk about how `std::expected` improves error handling, the huge impact that `std::mdspan` will have on scientific computing, how deducing `this` greatly simplifies longstanding C++ idioms such as CRTP, and how `std::print` will forever change how we write “Hello, World”.</em></p><p>Timur is the Developer Advocate for C++ tools at JetBrains and an active member of the ISO C++ standard committee. As a developer, he worked many years in the audio and music technology industry and co-founded the music tech startup Cradle. Timur is passionate about building inclusive communities, clean code, good tools, low latency, and the evolution of the C++ language.</p><p><strong><a href="https://cppcon.org/registration/">Registration is now open</a></strong>.

Their preconditions are nontrivial, their postconditions are exacting, and they are deeply interconnected by mathematical theorems. I will address this challenge, presenting interfaces, theorems, and proofs in a lightly extended C++.</em></p><p><em>This talk takes its title from Bertrand Russell’s and Alfred North Whitehead’s logicist tour de force, Principia Mathematica. It echoes that work in developing arithmetic from first principles, but starts from procedural first principles: stability of objects, substitutability of values, and repeatability of operations.</em></p><p><em>In sum, this talk is one part formal interface design, one part tour of C++ integral arithmetic, one part foundations of arithmetic, and one part writing mathematical proofs procedurally.</em></p><p>Lisa Lippincott designed the software architectures of Tanium and BigFix, two systems for managing large fleets of computers.

We are planning a series of 10-minute mini-talks, and we would like you to present at the event! Please <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12k4WESukX1axeoA_nAZWSTcL0G49vlK2DUQhRv3Iro8" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12yf2dKOm0keOon4EKmnuHeiBvtm8qvSgY5bFsdlG8ek&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1660332214328000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ORj4dWFsG8S44j9Qk3CDI">submit your mini-talk proposal here</a> by 28 August 2022</strong>. You will be notified about the acceptance decision soon afterwards.</p><p>The 10-minute mini-talks should be relevant to our audience. While any proposals on the topic of diversity and inclusion in the C++ community are welcome, this year we would like to focus particularly on the empowerment of our attendees. For example, great topics would be anything from “What did I learn from my experience as a deaf software developer” to “How to negotiate to get a 30% raise” or “What’s the best way to get everyone’s input in a diverse team”. Feel free to share your experience, thoughts, and tips!</p><p>Whether you’d like to be a presenter, or just attend the Diversity Dinner, listen, and participate in the discussion, please make sure you <strong><a href="https://cppcon.org/registration/">register for CppCon</a></strong> and book your ticket for the Diversity Dinner.</p><p>We look forward to seeing many of you there!</p></div></article><nav role="navigation"></nav></main></div></div>
