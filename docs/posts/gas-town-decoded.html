    <h1>Gas Town Decoded</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>On January 1st, Steve Yegge published <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04">“Welcome to Gas Town,”</a> an introduction to his new AI agent orchestration tool written in a loose and chaotic mode, and accompanied by AI-generated images depicting a fictional industrial city populated with weasels (yes, really).</p><p>Reactions were swift, mostly agog at the scale and hubris of such a (self-admittedly) wasteful and obscenely <em>expensive</em> system, and alternately confused or amazed at the amount of new, <em>insular language</em> tailor-made to describe it.</p><p>In the interest of making Gas Town intelligible (because, despite the prose, the idea of agent orchestration it describes will be important), I’d like to share a quick decoder for the many new terms Steve introduces. His article itself offers definitions, but those definitions reuse his insular terms, making by-hand decoding tedious. Here, I’ve done the work for you.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Steve’s Term</th><th>Real-World Definition</th><th>Alternative Term</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Town</td><td>Top-level folder containing your individual projects. The <code>gt</code> binary manages projects under this folder.</td><td>Workspace</td></tr><tr><td>Rig</td><td>A project. It’s a folder tracked by a unique Git repository within your workspace.</td><td>Project</td></tr><tr><td>Overseer</td><td>The user (you). You have an “inbox” to receive notifications from agents in your projects.</td><td>User</td></tr><tr><td>Mayor</td><td>The managing agent for a project. Usually you send this agent messages, and it coordinates the work of other agents in the project.</td><td>Manager Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Polecat</td><td>Worker agent, taking commands from the mayor, doing some work, submitting a Merge Request, and then stopping.</td><td>Worker Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Refinery</td><td>Merge agent, who coordinates and makes decisions about merge requests coming from Worker Agents.</td><td>Merge Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Witness</td><td>Fixer agent, that watches the worker agents and tries to fix any that are stuck.</td><td>Fixer Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Deacon</td><td>Maintenance agent, runs a consistent workflow in a loop, unlike “worker agents” who do arbitrary tasks and then die.</td><td>Maintenance Manager Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Dogs</td><td>Maintenance worker agents who do cleanup tasks, directed by the Maintenance Agent.</td><td>Maintenance Worker Agents</td></tr><tr><td>Boot the Dog</td><td>Maintenance Manager checker agent, just checks on the Maintenance Manager Agent periodically to see if it needs a reboot or anything else.</td><td>Maintenance Manager Checker Agent</td></tr><tr><td>Crew</td><td>Persistent Worker Agents, which you talk to directly (not through the Mayor), and which persist after their tasks are done, to be reused. These are per-Project.</td><td>Persistent Worker Agents.</td></tr><tr><td>Beads</td><td>System for tracking work history across the system.</td><td>Work Tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Rig Beads</td><td>Project-specific work, tracked in the Work Tracker.</td><td>Project Work</td></tr><tr><td>Town Beads</td><td>Whole-workspace work, tracked in the Work Tracker.</td><td>Workspace Work</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Even with these definitions and alternative terms, Gas Town is still a bit of a mess, with watchers-on-watchers at times (do we really need a Maintenance Manager Checker Agent?). That said, hopefully this decoder at least makes understanding <em>what Gas Town is</em> easier.</p></div></div><p>Copyright Andrew Lilley Brinker.
