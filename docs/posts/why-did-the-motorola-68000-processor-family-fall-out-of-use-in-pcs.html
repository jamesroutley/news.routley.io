<p>In the &#39;80s and &#39;90s the Intel x86 and Motorola 68000 families were the two leading microcomputer architectures in the 16-bit/32-bit personal computer scene. The 68000s were even preferred by the purists because of its orthogonal instruction set. The Intel x86 family, although always the market leader, has been criticized for its non-orthogonal instruction set and segmented addressing.</p>
<p>When the Macintosh line switched to PowerPC, the Motorola 68000 family began to disappear as a contender for newly designed personal computers outside the “Wintel” ecosystem. New contenders, such as the PowerPC, ARM and MIPS, take the 68000 family’s place.</p>
<p>I cannot find on the internet the reason why the 68000 family fell out of favor in the personal computer market.</p>
<p>Can someone explain this or point me in the direction of the answer?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_alliance" rel="noreferrer">Apple-IBM-Motorola alliance</a> was created in 1991 to compete with the Windows/Intel market. Its main successes were the creation of the PowerPC instruction set, derived from IBM&#39;s POWER architecture, and Apple&#39;s Power Macintosh line of computers.</p>
<p>IBM originated the idea, having seen that Windows on Intel was out-competing OS/2, and wanting to avoid being dependent on Intel. Apple joined it, seeing the chance to grow out of their existing markets, and Motorola presumably saw it as a successor to 68000, having failed comprehensively with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_88000" rel="noreferrer">MC88000</a>.</p>
<p>While the 68000 was used in the Macintosh series, Atari STs and Amigas, all the operating systems involved were quite different, so there was no unified software base. That meant there wasn&#39;t the sustained demand for 68000 that could have paid for chip development on the scale required to keep it competitive with x86. The engineering workstation market had started with the 68000, but had already switched to RISC before AIM was created.</p>

<p>The 68k family instruction set, as elegant as it appeared to the casual assembler programmer (been there), had several flaws that made it very difficult to get fast in hardware. Out of order or superscalar execution were very, very difficult to implement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-complex addressing modes, especially the indirect one introduced with 68020: when combined with virtual memory made it theoretical possible to get up to 16 page faults in 1 instruction (move long indirect with displacement and shifted index from an odd address touching 2 pages etc.). These indirect addressing modes were the first to be removed when defining the Coldfire ISA.</li>
<li>Exposure of the pipeline internals on traps and exceptions: the idea was that on a trap, the instruction could be resumed after fixing the error cause. This made it very difficult to get performance out of the kernel as it wrote more and more data to the stack at each generation, and it also limited the internal state that could be saved. x86 was much more pragmatic and just restarted the cancelled instruction from start.</li>
<li>Compatibility between successive family members was not as good as in intel CPUs. If you want to compile a program that runs on 68000 and on any of 680[2346]0 you will lose a lot of features on the side.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is the famous <a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/%7Evijay/mashey.on.risc.html" rel="noreferrer">newsgroup post from John Mashey</a> explaining the fundamental issue with the 68k ISA in comparison to other ISAs of that time.</p>

<p>Motorola stopped investing in MC68000 family when everyone thought that RISC was the future and that CISC CPUs would be soon non competitive. So it switched to PowerPCs.</p>
<p>Even Intel thought this and developed RISC CPUs (i860, i960...). Intel reluctantly continued investing in x86.</p>
<p>For Motorola, it was probably true, the last version, MC68060 was competitive with Pentium but it was quickly surpassed because of Intel manufacturing superiority allowing lower dissipation, higher frequencies. Switching to simpler RISC CPUs could allow to stay in the race.</p>
<p>Now, the difference between RISC and CISC (eg x86) is less relevant performance-wise due to the possibility of putting 100 times more transistors on a die.</p>

<p>Cost on either side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorola wasn&#39;t able to keep up investment to improve their CPUs the same way that Intel did</li>
<li>Resulting CPUs were considerably more expensive than Intel&#39;s offering.</li>

    <p>Motorola lost the race to 32 bit computing from a simple engineering mistake.
In the era when the 68k and x86 were very popular, the shift to 32 bit CPUs was a race to mass production. No question the 68020 was a cleaner design and almost destined to be the no. 1 choice for new machines. Friends of mine paid around $400 at the time for early 68020 chips to build test boards. X86 at the time was hopelessly behind. BUT, the first iteration of the 68020 had pushed the design parameters of the chip process to the point that yields were appalling. Every chip sold at a loss. Motorola then had to redesign all the masks which was an 18 month engineering exercise. 18 months was the window that let x86 get ahead in the market and that was the end of the 68k family&#39;s dominance. Shame</p>

<p>This was purely economics. By about 1988 the ready availability of IBM AT clones had the effect of pushing the price of support hardware- including cases, discs etc.- down enormously, and even on the &#39;286 there were UNIX variants that demonstrated that such things were possible. The &#39;386, when introduced, exploited that, and from that point onwards it became a race between what Intel- with a growing income- and Motorola et al.- with static incomes- could do with the available semiconductor technology.</p>
<p>By about 1995 Intel&#39;s price/performance ratio was unassailable, and graphics accelerators which could operate in conjunction with PC hardware were starting to erode the market for specialist workstations.</p>
