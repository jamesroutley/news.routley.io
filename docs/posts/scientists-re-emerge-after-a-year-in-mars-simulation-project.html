    <h1>Scientists re-emerge after a year in Mars simulation project</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a year, four scientists in the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189">United States</a> on Saturday ended an experiment that simulated life on <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mars/t-54389481">Mars</a>.</p>

<p>To loud applause, the four volunteers left <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/nasa/t-64526832">NASA</a>-built Mars Dune Alpha, where they had spent the past 378 days completely isolated from the outside world.</p>

<p>The 160-square-meter structure at the Johnson Space Center in Houston was designed to mimic conditions on the Red Planet. The habitat is a 3D-printed facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas, and a vertical farm for growing food.</p>

<p>The structure also features an outdoor area, separated by an airlock. The space is filled with red sand and is where the team donned suits to conduct their &#34;Marswalks.&#34;</p>



<h2>What did the scientists do?</h2>

<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly Haston have spent the last year growing vegetables, conducting &#34;Marswalks&#34; and operating under what NASA calls &#34;additional stressors.&#34;</p>

<p>These included communication delays with &#34;Earth,&#34; including their families; isolation; and confinement.</p>

<p>As they left the habitat on Saturday, the four volunteers were visibly emotional.</p>

<p>&#34;We can do these things together,&#34; Brockwell said. &#34;We can use our senses of wonder and purpose, to achieve peace and prosperity and to unlock knowledge and joy for the benefit of everyone in every part of planet Earth,&#34; he added.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — What space exploration missions await us in 2024?"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>What space exploration missions await us in 2024?</h2><video id="video-67882901" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67882901" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/63535829_605.webp" data-duration="02:18"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20240103_Space24NEU_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"/><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20240103_Space24NEU_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>

<h2>What is the goal of the mission?</h2>

<p>The mission was the first in a series called Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA). Its goal is to help NASA prepare to send humans back to the moon and, one day, to Mars.</p>

<p>Julie Kramer, NASA&#39;s director of engineering, said the project &#34;gives us an opportunity to learn all these critical things about these complex systems, and it&#39;s going to make going to Mars and back a lot safer.&#34;</p>

<p>Additional CHAPEA missions are planned for 2025 and 2027, she said.</p>

<p>A year-long mission to simulate life on Mars took place in a habitat in Hawaii in 2015-2016. NASA participated but did not lead the mission.</p>

<p>As part of its Artemis program, the US plans <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/why-getting-astronauts-to-the-moon-is-tough-in-2024/a-66589973">to send humans back to the Moon</a> to learn how to live there long-term. This will help prepare for a trip to Mars sometime in the late 2030s.</p>
