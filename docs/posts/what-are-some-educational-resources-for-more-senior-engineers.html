    <h1>Ask HN: What are some educational resources for more senior engineers?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I recently had a more junior coworker take an AWS Solutions Architect course, and I realized I am missing out on my company&#39;s personal development resources, but I am not all that interested in an AWS Solutions Architecture course, in part because a) I don&#39;t want to, and b) I know a bunch of AWS stuff by now anyway</p><p>So I am curious what are some interesting educational resources for people in more advanced engineering roles? Courses or resources that might help one move to an Architect or Principal/Staff role?</p></div></div></div>
