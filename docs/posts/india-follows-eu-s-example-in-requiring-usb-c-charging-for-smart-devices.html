    <h1>India follows EU&#39;s example in requiring USB-C charging for smart devices</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>India is on a path to require USB-C charging ports in almost all smart devices following actions taken by an inter-ministerial task force.</p>
<p>Rohit Kumar Sing, Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs, <a target="_blank" href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1876583">said</a> the move is &#34;in the interest of consumer welfare and prevention of avoidable e-waste.&#34;</p>
<p>The broad consensus in the meeting was that USB-C would be required for electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops – but &#34;feature phones&#34; could end up with a different charging option. A sub-committee was formed to determine the fate of wearable devices.</p>

    

<p>But things won&#39;t change overnight. The move toward USB-C will be done in phases to ensure industry and consumers alike have time to adapt.</p>

        


        

<p>A similar effort from the EU began last June and became <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/04/eu_usbc_charging/">official</a> this October. Beginning in 2026, laptops sold in the EU will be required to use USB-C while phones, tablets, and cameras will make the switch in 2024. The mandate even applies to iPhones in spite of Apple&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/27/apple_usbc/">resistance</a> to dropping its proprietary Lightning charging system.</p>
<p>With the EU already on the path toward USB-C, countries like India could end up as dumping grounds for obsolete phones if they don&#39;t follow suit. The US is also urged to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/17/usb_us_senate/">adopt USB-C standardization</a>.</p>

<p>India is considered a mobile-first country. Its digitization came at a time that allowed the country to skip the desktop PC revolution that occurred in the West. Pre-pandemic, the country was already undergoing what Google <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/indias-mobile-first-ecosystem-numbers/">referred</a> to as a &#34;seismic digital transformation&#34; – only to be further boosted by the pandemic. Its digital economy is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-facing-massive-digital-transformation-modi-at-brics-business-forum-11655913777048.html">forecast</a> to surpass $1 trillion as early as 2025.</p>
<p>With regard to its electronics industry, the government <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/india_electronics_report/">set goals</a> to quadruple production by 2026. Exports have an even more ambitious growth rate of 750 percent by the same year.</p>

        

<p>As of 2022, India manufactures electronic goods worth $76 billion, with just $16 billion of that sent to export. The goals take electronic goods production to $300 billion and export to $120 billion in just four years.</p>
<p>To make the goal a possibility, the country&#39;s electronics and IT ministry adopted the slogan &#34;first globalize, then localize&#34; – and if India&#39;s going to globalize, it makes sense to get in on the change to USB-C early. ®</p>
