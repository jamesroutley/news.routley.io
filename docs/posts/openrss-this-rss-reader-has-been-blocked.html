                                Open RSS offers feeds that are a much healthier
                                alternative to the intrusive, algorithmic feeds
                                on websites that harm and manipulate us. Our
                                service continues to generate thousands of
                                feeds, and we won&#39;t stop until every website has
                                one. With RSS feeds, we can all finally follow
                                web content on our terms, using feeds that only
                                we control.

                                Open RSS feeds track real-time content posted on

                                to, and they come with many benefits

                                    Feed items are sorted chronologically by
                                    date and free of recommendation algorithms,
                                    moderation, self-prioritized ranking, and
                                    any other undesired curation

                                    Embedded media scripts, link tracking, and
                                    other invasive content is stripped from
                                    feeds to avoid being tracked while reading

                                    Instead of just headlines or short summaries
                                    for each feed item, all relevant content is
                                    included in feeds, so you never have to
                                    leave your RSS reader

                                    To avoid feeds breaking due to sudden
                                    changes on the websites they rely on, all
                                    feeds are actively monitored for issues and
                                    resolved quickly, often without our users
                                    knowing there was ever a problem

                                    from feeds, so you can stay focused
