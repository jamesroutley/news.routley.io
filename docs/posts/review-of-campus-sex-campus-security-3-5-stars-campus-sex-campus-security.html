    <h1>Review of &#34;Campus Sex, Campus Security&#34; (3.5 stars): Campus Sex, Campus Security</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                            <p>Gets at some important points â€” in particular, pointing out the fundamental issue with Title IX resulting in a process where universities are more concerned with protecting the university than protecting victims of sexual assault.</p>
<p>The discussion of the history of campus protests was interesting, as was hearing more details about the infamous UC Davis pepper-spraying cop (I grew up in Davis, which was for many years most well known for this, but I was too young when it happened to really be paying attention to many of the details beyond the shocking photo)</p>
<p>It does feel a little scattered, though, and it has that classic academic, somewhat pretentious and vapid feeling writing style. I wish it was more straightforward and collected, but I also understand that not being that was probably a intentional choice.</p>
