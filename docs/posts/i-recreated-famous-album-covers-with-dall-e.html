DALL-E often couldn&#39;t quite grasp the meaning of prepositions or the seemingly simple concepts of left and right. </p><p>Adding texts to your images is also something DALL-E isn&#39;t really good at. As you saw in the case of the Velvet Underground cover, it added some text, but it was mostly gibberish and definitely not what we expected.</p><h3 id="being-more-specific-helps">Being more specific helps!</h3><p>After some trial and error I noticed that I was simply not being specific enough in some cases. </p><p>Adding some more details, really boosted the generations. This is especially visible in the Abbey Road cover. </p><p>Adding info on age, lighting, decor and vibe made the cover way more similar to the original than the initial description could. </p><h3 id="copyright-who-owns-it">Copyright, who owns it?</h3><p>It&#39;s all fun and games until we talk about copyright, right? </p><p>But seriously, how creative and original can you be with something that is trained on the works of millions of other creators? </p><p>To me, it is unclear whether you can actually call these works your &#39;own&#39; at all, because there&#39;s always someone else&#39;s touch on it.</p><p>Especially when you&#39;re using tricks like style transfer. Suppose you have a very particular art style that happens to be popular. You wouldn&#39;t want someone to be able to easily create very similar renditions at the click of a button. It would totally ruin your business.. </p><h3 id="clarity-and-transparency-on-the-training-data">Clarity and transparency on the training data</h3><p>I think we owe it to the original creators to know more about the training data behind DALL-E. If I were an artist, I would like to know whether my art was being used.</p><p>Without it, artists will remain in doubt as to whether their style can be copied, or their works incorporated in generated art.. </p><p>And not just artists, users of DALL-E will also never be sure whether they are generating something that is &#39;theirs&#39; or just a knockoff of someone else&#39;s work.</p><h3 id="the-cover-art-of-the-future-is-it-ai-generated">The cover art of the future, is it AI Generated?</h3><p>So having mentioned all these caveats, I do think DALL-E is a fantastic tool to create artworks. </p><p>With a creative mind and good ideas in hand, you can create your own cover art within seconds! </p><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the artists of the future will start to use tools like DALL-E to generate their cover art.</p><p>The question is, when the music blows up and the artwork becomes a <em>signature</em>, like the Rolling Stones&#39; <em>Tongue &amp; Lips</em>, who will own the copyright?</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It&#39;s been great fun testing out DALL-E and recreating some famous album covers in the process.</p><p>I highly encourage you to sign up for DALL-E to try it out yourself. You even get some free credits to play around with. It might take a while before you get access, but don&#39;t let that stop you! 😂</p><p>If you recreate some album covers yourself, don&#39;t forget to tag me on Twitter. I&#39;d love to see what you come up with. Can you beat my generations? 😁</p><h2 id="lets-keep-in-touch-%F0%9F%93%AB">Let&#39;s keep in touch! 📫</h2><p>If you would like to be notified whenever I post a new article, you can sign up for my email newsletter <a href="https://lucytalksdata.com/#/portal/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>If you have any comments, questions or want to collaborate, please email me at lucy@lucytalksdata.com or drop me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/lucytalksdata"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</p>
