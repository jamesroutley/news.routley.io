<p>Occasionally, even experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> lose their heads and devote every waking moment to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_war" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit warring</a> over the most trivial thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_dance_on_the_head_of_a_pin%3F" title="How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?">wasting time debating topics of no practical value</a>, or wrestling over questions whose answers hold no practical consequence. This page documents our <i>lamest</i> examples. It isn&#39;t comprehensive or authoritative, but it serves as a showcase of situations where people lose sight of the big picture and obsessively expend huge amounts of energy fighting over something that, in the end, isn&#39;t really so important.
</p><p>Edit warring is believed by some to be important, possibly due to the historical regularity and frequency of the occurrence of these wars. A careful and scholarly study of available archeological evidence has even suggested that edit wars may have recurred on a regular basis going back all the way to the beginning of recorded history, even before the advent of proper writing circa 2001 C.E. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>). In some earlier instances of edit warring, dating back from before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_old_days" title="Good old days">good old days</a>, participants would simply brandish their swords and fight a battle, or later, their guns and fight a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel" title="Duel">duel</a>.
</p><p>In modern times, physical combat has been outlawed and replaced by the careful citing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" title="Wikipedia:NPA">personal attacks</a>, strategic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" title="Wikipedia:3RR">3RR</a> templating and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CANVAS" title="Wikipedia:CANVAS">canvassing</a>, timely notices on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AN/I" title="Wikipedia:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, and (in some cases) marking the changes as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Minor_edit" title="Help:Minor edit">a minor edit</a>. Truly, the revolutionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> outlook has changed the way things get done. It has changed them from actually getting done to never getting done. On the other hand, nobody gets dispatched (so far!).

<p>Some discussions are born lame; some achieve lameness; some have lameness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvolio" title="Malvolio">thrust upon them</a>. Upon coming across a discussion that is borderline lame, some Wikipedians may be tempted to go do something useful. This is a big mistake. Left to its own devices, the discussion might inadvertently become useful. What&#39;s the fun in that? It is essential that as many editors as possible chime in, not adding to the discussion at hand but pointing, LOL, and lamely commenting about how lame it is and how it&#39;s a big waste of time (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy" title="Self-fulfilling prophecy">Self-fulfilling prophecy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback" title="Positive feedback">Positive feedback</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth" title="Exponential growth">Exponential growth</a>). Merely stating the discussion is lame is frequently not sufficient; every opposing statement must be denied with increasingly vehement assertions of the lameness. While at first blush, wasting time whining about what a waste of time something is may seem illogical, the inherent irony just magnifies the lameness. An additional step to increase lameness is to include repeated links to this essay, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LAME" title="Wikipedia:LAME">WP:LAME</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Administrators</a> have a special role to play; proposing and implementing topic bans on lame participants is doubly effective: it not only increases the present-day lameness, but, by quashing debate, helps ensure the lame issue remains unsolved for future generations of Wikipedians to go on about. Lamely.
</p><p>The best way to begin a lame edit war is to change a large number of articles based on your interpretation of minutiae in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS" title="Wikipedia:MOS">manual of style</a>. If this does not work, try changing the MOS itself; that always works.

<p>If you want to add a &#34;lame edit war&#34; to this page, keep the following in mind:
</p>
<ul><li>It must have been an actual <i>edit</i> war. Discussions on talk pages, even over trivially lame details, are not &#34;edit wars&#34; and are, therefore, NOT suitable for this page: we want to encourage such rational debates between users/viewpoints (as opposed to actual edit warring). Note that pithy quotes on talk pages may be suitable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_highlights" title="Wikipedia:Talk page highlights">Wikipedia:Talk page highlights</a>.</li>
<li>It should truly be amongst the <b>lamest</b> edit wars. Not just garden-variety lame.</li>
<li>Unless a participant is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Banning_policy" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">banned</a> for their part in the edit war, do not give the names of participants or link to their userpages. People have lapses in judgment, and some end up edit warring; they shouldn&#39;t, however, be stuck with that for the rest of their on-wiki careers for no reason. This is absolutely not the place for harping over someone&#39;s past editing.</li>
<li>Be careful to avoid even the semblance of taking sides in the war. If one version was more or less accepted afterwards, it&#39;s OK to note that, but the fact that an edit war occurred means that neither side was &#34;in the right all along&#34;.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Be bold</a>! If you feel that an edit war was truly lame, add it! You don&#39;t need to ask on the talk page. The lameness of it should speak for itself. Of course, editors with a more experienced eye for lameness may disagree with your claim to the &#34;lamest&#34;, which may just result in yet another lame edit war!</li>
<li>Note that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><i>no original research</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><i>verifiability</i></a> policies are meant to apply to the <b>article</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Namespace" title="Wikipedia:Namespace">namespace</a>, not necessarily on pages like this in the <b>Wikipedia</b> (project) namespace.

<p>Was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopin" title="Chopin">Chopin</a> French, French–Polish, Polish, or Polish–French? For years, there has been a low-level (and at times high-intensity) conflict about which country can claim Chopin as its son. Or was it Szopen? The observer learns a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_code" title="Napoleonic code">Napoleonic code</a>, about the nuances of &#34;citizenship&#34;, &#34;nationality&#34;, and &#34;ethnicity&#34;.

The use of &#34;Polish-born&#34; is branded as a racist slur. There is spirited debate about whether the citing of a passage of law is considered original research, tantamount to &#34;dropping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentos" title="Mentos">Mentos</a> into a bottle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a> to see if it will explode&#34;. Can you emigrate from a country of which you are not a citizen? Can you receive citizenship if you already have it? The possibilities for intensive study are endless. Celebrity witnesses such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama" title="Obama">Obama</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill" title="Churchill">Churchill</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Taro_Ono_Lennon" title="Sean Taro Ono Lennon">Sean Taro Ono Lennon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss" title="Dr. Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a> are pressed into making appearances.

<p>There was a feud that was going on for a long time on this one concerning Freddie Mercury&#39;s true ancestry. Is he the most famous Iranian rock star? Indian? Parsi? Azeri? You&#39;d be surprised how many people get this annoyed, to the point that it is still a hotly contested item over there.

Oh, and this one, like all the others, had its share of random vandals, people leaving unmarked anonymous insults, and gnashing of teeth. Let&#39;s just say for now he&#39;s a Parsi whose parents originated from India! Just don&#39;t even <i>think</i> of suggesting he&#39;s &#34;left&#34; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a> or is an &#34;ex-member&#34; of the band, though, or you&#39;ll really get people&#39;s hackles up...

<p>Born in what was then Hungary but is now part of Austria to ethnic German parents whose families had lived in Hungary for a long time, and we had all thought it was common knowledge that Liszt claimed Hungary as his homeland and Hungarian as his nationality. Er, didn&#39;t he? Cue the largest and most acrimonious war in recent memory! It was mercifully confined to the talk page, but <i>what</i> a talk page it was. What was Liszt&#39;s real name, Franz or Ferenc? (It was actually Franciscus.) If he was such a Hungarian patriot, why didn&#39;t he fight in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848" title="Hungarian Revolution of 1848">war of independence in 1848</a>? If he was really Hungarian, why is his &#34;Hungarian&#34;-style music actually based on Romani music? If he really thought he was Hungarian, why did he spend so much time in France? Why couldn&#39;t he write better lyrics for the <i>Krönungslied</i> (which was actually <i>Ungarisches Königslied</i>)? What is the significance of the <a href="#Chopin">Chopinesque</a> left hand octaves in <i>Funerailles, Octobre 1849?</i> What event of October 1849 was he referring to, the crushing of the Hungarian rebellion or the death of Chopin? Or was it the publication of Heinrich Heine&#39;s rude poem about him? Why couldn&#39;t he learn to speak Hungarian better? Did he like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash" title="Goulash">goulash</a>? Could he dance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cs%C3%A1rd%C3%A1s" title="Csárdás">csárdás</a>? The farce was compounded by the occasional appearance of anonymous trolls who insisted that Liszt was, in fact, a Slovak.

Can we add &#34;American&#34; in there somewhere because he moved to America at age 74? Well over half the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:P._G._Wodehouse" title="Talk:P. G.

Is it bad faith to remove HTML comments from the page if only editors will see them, or do such invisible comments constitute a vandalism of their own?

<p>Biographers who knew him said his family was Kurdish. But was he a Kurd, Arab, Turk, Persian, Armenian, some combination of these, or something else? Were his father and uncle Kurds, or Arabs, or Kurdicized Arabs, or Turks, or Kurdicized Turks? Does it depend on the ethnicity of his mother, about whom we know literally nothing? He definitely spoke Arabic, but did he speak Kurdish too? Or Turkish? He was born in Tikrit, so does that make him Iraqi? Syrian? Mesopotamian? Kurdistani? If he is ethnically Kurdish, is the Ayyubid dynasty that followed him a Kurdish dynasty? Does modern Kurdish nationalism have anything to do with the Kurds of the 12th century?

<p>Is U2 an &#34;Irish band&#34; or simply a band that happens to be from Ireland, since two of their members were born in the UK? Many discussions have taken place over the course of several years as whether &#34;U2 are an Irish rock band&#34; or simply &#34;U2 are a rock band&#34; should be included in the text. Edit wars continued back and forth, and at one point the article even read &#34;U2 are an Irish and British rock band&#34; (which didn&#39;t last very long). A similar compromise could have been &#34;an Irish rock band with two British members&#34;.

Despite the compromise in the lead of calling him both Scottish and British, users and IPs don&#39;t realize that they are talking about the same place, so every year, when Wimbledon comes around, you can always see an edit war or talk page arguments about the subject, and like tennis, the final result of this edit war will never be known. Mainly going down the line of Murray called himself Scottish. Murray is anti-English and British after the media misinterpreted a joke with Des Kelly and Tim Henman in 2006 so therefore he must be Scottish. We can&#39;t have &#34;Scottish&#34; in the lead; he doesn&#39;t represent Scotland, he has to play for Great Britain. Any of which gets shouted down by the other argument and goes round and round all summer until a regular editor reverts it back to the &#34;consensus compromise&#34;. Of course, consumers of the British press will be aware that, to those south of the border, Murray is British <i>until he loses a match</i>, at which point he reverts to Scottishness. But the truly lame thing on this page is that&#39;s not the only regular edit war. The page also sees an argument of whether Murray was born in Dunblane or Glasgow.

<p>Was he Jewish through his maternal grandmother or never at all? People who claim his grandmother was Jewish quote an L.A. Times article wherein George Michael himself claims that &#34;His maternal grandmother was Jewish but married a Gentile and raised her children with no knowledge of their Semitic heritage. This was during World War<span> </span>II, and &#39;she thought if they didn&#39;t know that their mother was Jewish, they wouldn&#39;t be at risk,&#39; Michael said.&#34; They also claim that it should stay in the article because being Jewish (ethnicity) and practicing Judaism (religion) are two different things. The opposition claims that George Michael was simply confused with the name of his grandmother, Daisy Angold Young, and mistook Angold for a Jewish surname. One of the opposition found genealogy for George Michael&#39;s grandmother leading back to 1828 in London. The same person linked an article talking about Christmas songs written by Jewish people on an interfaith support website that claims Michael being Jewish is an internet myth. All this arguing led to mass edit warring, accusations of Jews and non-Jews trying to white-wash history, and anti-semitism.

Don&#39;t be silly, came the response: and anybody who removes the Hebrew name from the first sentence is a racist vandal.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Za%27atar&amp;offset=20080303&amp;action=history">[6]</a> Meanwhile, back at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus" title="Hummus">Hummus</a>, an attempt is made to replace a mention that the Oxford English Dictionary says that the word entered English via Turkish with a reference to the Greek name for the dish. Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbouleh" title="Tabbouleh">Tabbouleh</a> saw action, this time mercifully free of Arab-Israeli connotations; instead, the question was: can we call this dish a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levantine_cuisine" title="Levantine cuisine">Levantine cuisine</a>, or is the very term &#34;Levantine&#34; a European colonial plot to divide the great Arab nation?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tabbouleh&amp;action=history">[7]</a>
</p><p>In the meantime, another attempt is made to expunge the Turks from description of the traditional Greek (or maybe Arab) dish of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita" title="Pita">pita</a> (or is it pitta?), while controversy bubbles as to whether a photo of an Israeli <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel" title="Falafel">falafel</a> house constitutes &#34;Zionism&#34;.
</p><p>Conclusion: Tasty snacks in the Middle East are hilariously politicized. As of September 2022, the talk page for Hummus states: &#34;The article Hummus, along with other articles relating to the Arab–Israeli conflict, is currently subject to active arbitration remedies.&#34;

<p>Snakes from the Middle East are hilariously politicized too! This one is found in Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, and either &#34;Palestine&#34; or &#34;the Palestinian territories&#34;. Users have been edit-warring for six years now over how to describe it. The opinions of the snake itself on the political status of Palestine are unknown.

Is the name of the team now the New Avengers or is it just a <i>new</i> Avengers? Is it a new comic entirely or just a continuation of the old one?

<p>In the name of the programming language <i>C#</i>, is that # thing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octothorpe" title="Octothorpe">octothorpe</a>) after the C a number sign or the musical sharp symbol? What should the wrongname template say? Some argue that a Microsoft FAQ supports the sharp symbol, while others argue that the ECMA standard promotes the # symbol and that it has better browser support. Some propose using # as a superscript (C<sup>#</sup>), which few editors like. Editors repeatedly reverted between each other, some refusing to discuss the issue on the talk page. The issue was resolved with an e-mail exchange with Microsoft stating that in their view it&#39;s an octothorpe symbol representing the sharp symbol, similar to how &#34;&lt;=&#34; represents the less than or equal symbol, and that thus Microsoft does not disagree with ECMA. Written &#34;Netscape&#34; but pronounced &#34;Mozilla&#34;, eh? Anyone?

<p>Compact Disc is a tradename, and therefore is capitalised.

<p>Various supporters of the US Libertarian party (founded in 1971) argue that they own the meaning of the word &#34;libertarian&#34;, that placing it next to &#34;socialism&#34; is a contradiction in terms, and hence that libertarian socialism (described circa 1850) cannot possibly have existed.

<p>Is her name pronounced like &#34;rolling&#34; or to rhyme with &#34;howling&#34;? Rowling is on record claiming she pronounces her name like &#34;rolling&#34;. An irate editor argues that this is a &#34;British&#34; pronunciation and the &#34;American&#34; pronunciation of her name should also be noted. This is slightly ridiculous as she is English, and therefore of course will pronounce it in an English manner. Cue endless spats on talk pages over whose arguments are &#34;more cogent&#34;, and multiple reversions. Issue finally resolved (sort of) by very, very, very obliquely implying that <i>she</i> pronounces her name &#34;rolling&#34;, rather than stating that that is how her name <i>is pronounced</i>. Edit war was brief, but, astoundingly, other people have since logged on and made the same complaint. Perhaps it rhymes with &#34;Trolling&#34;?

<p>Should articles for U.S. state routes use the format &#34;State Route xx&#34; or &#34;Route xx (State)&#34; or something else (where xx is the route number)? There were numerous edit battles and huge debates over official terms versus common vernacular and over uniformity versus state individuality. Some advocated for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pipe_trick" title="Wikipedia:Pipe trick">pipe tricked</a> version while others preferred full string method of disambiguation. This skirmish raged on for about a full year between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadfan" title="Roadfan">roadfans</a>, members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:USRD" title="Wikipedia:USRD">U.S. Roads WikiProject</a>, regular editors, and administrators, resulting in a few probations and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Song/We_didn%27t_start_the_fire_(Roads)" title="Wikipedia:Song/We didn&#39;t start the fire (Roads)">a song</a>.

<p>Was this the name of one King of England and also of some totally obscure minor characters in the mists of history – or was it actually the name of two important and well-known Protestant Heads of State, etc?

<p>Is it important to know that Korea has been preparing to officially register the name &#34;Ulleung Basin&#34;? The ocean feature is known both under the Japanese name Tsushima basin and under the Korean name Ulleung basin.

<p>Every so often, tempers flare up over the bot-created &#34;demographic statistics&#34; added to the encyclopedia back in the Dark Ages (2002, to be exact) and the &#34;Wikipedia = <i>The Story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody</i>&#34; stance adopted by many editors towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOFIXIT" title="Wikipedia:SOFIXIT">actually fixing</a> these entries when the information is not exactly useful to readers. For instance, do we need to know the median income in this town has been $66,250? Is it original research to write &#34;3&#34; instead of &#34;50% of 6&#34;? In response to the sentence &#34;For every 100 females there were 88.9 males&#34;, one editor&#39;s eloquent statement says it all: &#34;there are SEVENTEEN PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE, for fuck&#39;s sake&#34;! And that&#39;s based on the 2000 Census; imagine how much more anachronistic and awkward these &#34;statistics&#34; would be were they to be based on Chicken&#39;s 2010 Census population of 7! Speaking of which, see also <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay,_Alaska" title="Prudhoe Bay, Alaska">Prudhoe Bay, Alaska</a></b>: while nowhere near as lame, edit warring dragged on in that article for years for pretty much the exact same reason. Ironically, settling the issue in that case resulted in effective abandonment of the article prior to the 2010 Census, in which the community&#39;s population mysteriously soared from just five in the year 2000, to 2,174. And if all this didn&#39;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:STICK" title="Wikipedia:STICK">drive home the point enough</a>, here&#39;s what one editor had to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Clarence,_Alaska" title="Port Clarence, Alaska">Port Clarence, Alaska</a> back in 2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Port_Clarence,_Alaska&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=16154842&amp;oldid=14916885">&#34;What&#39;s the point of saying there are 2000 males for every 100 females, if there&#39;s only 21 people in all? Why not just tell the truth – there is one woman, 20 men?&#34;</a> Sadly, no known edit wars ensued from that statement. We have learned two things, however: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> has a number of underpopulated communities, and the manner in which many underpopulated communities are portrayed on Wikipedia is truly lame.

<p>7500. Four simple numbers that got an add/remove/add/remove/consensus-add/remove-anyway/ADD edit war ongoing, in slow-motion and, perhaps, still ongoing on this page. What caused all the &#34;squawk&#34;ing? The fact that 7500 is the emergency code you put in a transponder when your aircraft has been hijacked. Although the code is public information provided by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration" title="Federal Aviation Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> and available in any student pilot&#39;s manual to be grabbed off the shelf, IP editors keep removing it from the article. Because, apparently, would-be hijackers use Wikipedia as their only source of information on aircraft, and would recognise the code when the pilot entered it, whereas it could be entered without recognition otherwise, or so the IPs claim. One even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transponder_(aviation)&amp;diff=365879602&amp;oldid=365839785">left an edit summary</a> saying &#34;Deleted reference to hijack code for secutity [<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] reasons.

<p>Editors constantly change spellings of the country name to Brasil, because this is the local name of the country. But since both pronunciations have the same sounding as z, but the correct spelling in Portuguese is s, Brazilians/Brasilians consider the z spelling an error.

<p>Questions have arisen concerning the name of Lita&#39;s moves. Is it DDT, or Lita DDT? Hurricanrana or Litacanrana? Moonsault or Litasault? Powerbomb or Lita Bomb? Is the powerbomb even a finishing move, considering it&#39;s not used that often? Do you go by the games, by the announcers, or by WWE.com? After several arguments and many people exclaiming they will continue to change it back, a Fan Name section is created, listing the names fans have given her moves.

<p>Not so much an edit war as an editing armed standoff. Ask yourself: should this song be declared &#34;written one pluvious night&#34; or &#34;one rainy night&#34;? Ironically, &#34;one&#34; night was declared superior to the previous version, &#34;in a&#34; night.

<p>In an article written in Commonwealth English and about a topic in the field of aviation, should &#34;alternate airport&#34; or &#34;alternative airport&#34; be used in the following sentence: <q>&#34;The extra fuel was enough to divert to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_plan#Alternate_airports" title="Flight plan">alternate airports</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan_Yaoqiang_International_Airport" title="Jinan Yaoqiang International Airport">Jinan Yaoqiang International Airport</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou_Xiaoshan_International_Airport" title="Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport">Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport</a> – which would require 4,800 kg (10,600 lb) or 10,700 kg (23,600 lb), respectively, to reach from Beijing.&#34;</q>? In the aviation field, the term &#34;alternate aerodrome&#34; (or &#34;alternate airport&#34; or &#34;alternate airfield&#34;) is used globally to refer to the second airport/aerodrome/airfield selected in a flight plan if a landing at the planned destination cannot be made, see material published by aviation authorities in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/lexicon/lexicon/en/index.php/Alternate_aerodrome">Europe (Eurocontrol)</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://caa.gov.il/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=download&amp;category_slug=2015-10-13-06-39-40-5&amp;alias=2180-13-6-1&amp;Itemid=669&amp;lang=he">Israel (CAA)</a>. This use of the term &#34;alternate&#34; is consistent with usage in North America, where it means &#34;taking the place of; alternative&#34;. In other English-speaking regions, and as second meaning in the US/Canada, the word &#34;alternate&#34; means &#34;every other&#34;. This has prompted many editors to try, even after a wikilink and hidden note was added, to change the term to &#34;alternative airport&#34;, which is not consistent with usage in the aviation field.

One is about his height, of all things, with the number being changed several times a week. Another slow edit war is over whom he is dating/engaged/married to, and whether this GF/fiancée/wife is pregnant. (Considering how long this slow edit war has been going on, if she&#39;s pregnant it&#39;s one of the longest human pregnancies ever.) And a third slow edit war is over how to pronounce his name.

<p>Is he French? Is he British? Is he Russian? German? Franco-Russian? South African? Algerian? Believe it or not, there was (before reveal of nationality) an extensive debate on where this (confirmed French) character class from the video game <i>Team Fortress 2</i> inherits his accent from – despite having only a handful of spoken lines in-game at the time. To be fair, this was mostly the result of every other class in the game (except the Pyro, who is near-unintelligible under <s>his</s> <s>her</s> <s>his</s> <s>her</s> <s><i>the</i></s> <s>her</s> <s>its</s> <s>their</s> the gas mask) having a clear regional upbringing, whereas the Spy&#39;s accent was a more vague European one. However, nowadays, voice lines with the Spy speaking French are most prominent in the English version of the game (such as cries of &#34;Mon dieu!&#34;). At the very least, it proves that the Spy is good at his job of causing confusion, frustration, and panic (and everyone turning the world upside down to sort him out).

He raised the subject on his own message board and both supporters and detractors flocked to Wikipedia to join in the fight, resulting in numerous articles in blogs and other comic industry media about the ensuing conflict.

Of course, there&#39;s the question of whether Wikipedia even <i>has</i> a committed style for its infoboxes – oh, did I not mention that there was no issue with the text of the article itself? This debate was solely about whether Wikipedia can or should list two party heads in an <i>infobox</i>. Hey, I&#39;ve got a good idea: Suggest consulting what the Wikipedias in other languages did for their infoboxes. Hey, I&#39;ve got an <i>even better</i> idea: Change the infoboxes on all the other Wikipedias just before suggesting that first idea.

<p>In January 2020, an edit war about whether the list of characters should also include short descriptions happened then was seemingly resolved. However, from May of 2020 to August of that same year, it picked up again, and because the edits fueling the war happened monthly instead of daily, the 3RR could not stop the edit war. What makes these wars particularly lame is that both the January and August wars caused the main instigators of both sides to flood the article&#39;s talk page (mainly in January) and dispute resolution noticeboard (in August) with blatantly uncivil behavior. Some examples include but are not limited to name-calling, stalking, and accusations.

<p>With the release of the <i>iPod classic</i>, there was a lot of confusion on whether the new iPod is in the same line as the original iPod. Can a new product be &#34;classic&#34;? Should it just be part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" title="IPod">iPod</a> article?<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_classic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=155935703">[75]</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_classic&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=155961197">[76]</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_classic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=156098764">[77]</a> Should previous generations be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_classic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=156119325">incorporated</a> into the &#34;classic&#34; article? Maybe there should just be an article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_%285G%29&amp;oldid=156098805">every generation</a> of the product? What about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_photo" title="IPod photo">iPod photo</a> – is that part of the iPod classic family or some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IPod_photo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=156195942">freaky half-cousin</a>?

<p>Should the Gay Nigger Association of America be at the top of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNAA_(disambiguation)" title="GNAA (disambiguation)">irrelevant disambiguation page</a>, or somewhere in the middle? The ongoing dispute leads to the page being protected and one administrator being blocked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" title="Wikipedia:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. After 18 Articles for Deletion nominations, the association&#39;s article was deleted for lack of reliable sources (see below), and the dispute mutated into whether the page should include a redlink to the deleted article or not. This critical issue of a single Wikilink led to full protection (three times) and a Request for Comment on a disambiguation page. The situation calmed down only when the disambiguation page for a 4-letter acronym joined the tiny number of articles with indefinite full protection (it has since been reduced to semiprotected). Recently, the association&#39;s article has been recreated as a result of a deletion review.

A sloppy cut-and-paste merge back follows, ensuring that no one is happy with the article&#39;s condition.

The contention still pops up occasionally, especially after the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_(name)" title="Lolita (name)">a stub for the name &#34;Lolita&#34;</a> and the debate over whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lolita#Incorrect_page_move" title="Talk:Lolita">Nabokov&#39;s novel</a> should really be the primary target.

<p>The edit war was sparked over whether an image of the &#34;one finger highway salute&#34; should have been included. Several different pictures were added; the debate even included the lighting of the picture. Eventually it was settled. At least no one went out on the highway and rammed somebody to get a good shot<span> </span>...

<p>Edit war over whether or not to mention the fact that Standing appears to be sitting in his infobox photo. The photo was humorously captioned &#34;Guy Standing sitting&#34;. Eventually, his legs were simply cropped out. Later, editors compromised to use a version of the photo that was not as tightly cropped, making it clear that he was sitting, with the caption &#34;Guy Standing in 2012&#34;.

<p>Right off the heels of earlier image wars lasting over a month, an idea to make the map more accessible for colourblind readers quickly spiraled into an all-out color war over the best palette for the map. Over the course of three days, users repeatedly uploaded competing &#34;colourblind-friendly&#34; maps and reverted each other, until Commons administrators stepped in and blocked most of the image-warriors for at least three days each. Subsequent discussions were held both on Commons and on the talk page of the main article on Wikipedia for implementing an accessible version of the map. The discussions eventually resolved roughly two weeks after the end of the color wars.

Rather, the edit-war concerned whether the article should contain two sentences of hidden text (i.e., text that shows in the edit window but is not visible to readers), advising against adding an infobox without gaining a consensus.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=653953772">[119]</a>

<p>Conflict began when an editor tried to add a new essay to this template. Another user suggested that the essay was only tangentially related to civility and removed it. Amid a sea of blue links to wise essays on the value of civility, an edit war broke out over the new link&#39;s inclusion. More parties joined the fray, making 12 reverts in two days over the essay&#39;s inclusion. Editors then took to the talk page and began hurling profanity at each other as they discussed whether the essay contained valuable advice about civility. After two full protections of the template and multiple blocks, the matter appears to have been resolved.

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" title="EU">EU</a> flag is added to the template&#39;s header. Another editor reverts it as a Eurocrat POV. No, the tiny little flag is a statement of fact, and <i>you&#39;re</i> the POV pusher. No, you! Vandal! Vandal! Somehow, despite the 5-alarm urgency of this three-day edit war, Luxembourg&#39;s political system fails to fall apart or be in any way affected by the existence of an EU flag on its template. (Other small European countries are also involved.)

<p>On June 12, 2010, England and the United States started the group C play with a 1–1 draw. FIFA seemed naively unbothered by this – perhaps under the assumption that the results of the remaining games against Algeria and Slovenia would determine who would advance. Wikipedia, in accordance with its core mission of providing real-time goal-by-goal updates to major sporting events, couldn&#39;t wait that long.

<p>Regarding the table of Moscow Metro lines, should the color of the line be in the first column or the second? Should the color names be spelled out or do the colors speak for themselves? Edit warring over the version of the table occurred at the onset of June 2006. Following a month-long full protection, a straw poll, a request for comment, and an appearance in the <i>New York Times</i> on June 17, 2006 for its protection (and almost certainly this lame dispute), the article was unprotected, not because anything was actually resolved but because the article had been protected for so long. And guess what? More edit/revert warring and ensues, to the point where the original table is re-added to the article and one frustrated editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Moscow_Metro&amp;diff=63521470&amp;oldid=63506600">proclaims</a>: &#34;Ah, so we&#39;ve killed a couple of weeks to<span> </span>... keep the old table.

<p>After 2038, it turns out that some computers are also going to run into date issues in the year 292,277,026,596, well after the predicted end of the solar system. Which means we&#39;ve still got some time to discuss whether the article should include a sentence that says &#34;this is not widely regarded as a pressing issue&#34;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Year_2038_problem&amp;diff=122921614&amp;oldid=122774855">[136]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Year_2038_problem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=122774855">[137]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Year_2038_problem&amp;diff=95587046&amp;oldid=95580006">[138]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Year_2038_problem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95580006">[139]</a> Apparently saying that it didn&#39;t matter <i>itself</i> didn&#39;t matter, because the phrase was deleted when nobody was watching and nobody even seemed to notice. And then the reference to the problem was deleted as well, so if you&#39;re reading this after finding a copy of Wikipedia amidst the fallout of the war caused by the Year 292,277,026,596 problem, the Wikimedia Foundation extends its condolences.

<p>Should the rule to be ignored be singular, or plural? Will working with others be permitted by this policy? And can (or should) this rule itself be ignored?

<p>Once again, the Tomfoolery/Jerryfoolery debate occurred, and the ensuring chaos enveloped the ENTIRE April Fools page. The Communist Manifesto got posted. Someone posted hundreds of digits of pi. People began listing the names of pokemon. &#34;Pre-April 1st&#34; became &#34;Pre-March 32nd&#34;, then &#34;Pre-February 61st&#34;, and so on. The page got rotated 45 degrees. It got to the point where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;diff=948453285&amp;oldid=948452241#Wikipedia:April_Fools/April_Fools&#39;_Day_2020_(unironic)">there had to be a genuine request for page protection because things had gotten too insane.</a> All this happened in the first three hours of April 1st.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America" title="Gay Nigger Association of America">Gay Nigger Association of America</a> is the most fought over article for whether it should be nuked. The GNAA article was first created sometime in 2004 and finally deleted in November 2006. September 2010 saw what were hoped to be the final pushes to restore the article. A redirect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse_Security" title="Goatse Security">Goatse Security</a> later took the absent article&#39;s place, and an RfD reaffirmed this redirect as the new status quo. After several more DRVs, the article was finally recreated after the 12th DRV.

<p>An edit war about the definition of &#34;edit war&#34; on the policy page telling us not to edit war. Does one word (or less than one word) count? (three edits reverted.) Involving the same or different material? (two edits reverted.) Is adding or deleting a cleanup tag exempt? (two edits reverted.). All without any real attempt to arrive at a consensus before reverting again.

<p>In what is, ironically, a noticeboard for violators of a rule <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" title="Wikipedia:3RR">which is supposed to prevent major edit wars</a>, an argument involving six reversions by a user, removing a report from the noticeboard citing that the Three Revert Rule <i>does not</i> apply to things such as obvious vandalism, or material in violation of some core policies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BLP" title="Wikipedia:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for instance. The strangest fact of all about this incident is that the repeated reversions were done by the user who had originally introduced the three revert rule to Wikipedia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Three-revert_rule&amp;dir=prev&amp;action=history">[147]</a>

<p>An edit war regarding a page about <i>preventing</i> edit wars.

<p>In the course of the debate over a proposed policy banning all links to sites deemed to be &#34;attack sites&#34; against Wikipedians, some editors enforced the proposed policy against other editors who were, for the purposes of the debate, attempting to provide (in their opinion) legitimate <i>examples of</i> attack sites. Much edit warring followed, with accusations from both sides of bad faith, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:POINT" title="Wikipedia:POINT">WP:POINT</a>-making, and of ulterior motives. The conflict later resurfaced when similar language was added to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" title="Wikipedia:NPA">No Personal Attacks policy</a>, and resulted in <i>two</i> (to date) arbitration cases.
