<p>It&#39;s the official end of an ambitious project launched nearly fifteen years ago: the court in Changsha, Hunan province, has declared the Gac-Fiat Chrysler joint venture bankrupt, putting a definitive end to the industrial presence of <a href="https://www.italpassion.fr/en/stellantis/">Stellantis</a> via this entity in China.</p>



<p>This joint venture, created in 2011 at the instigation of Sergio Marchionne, <strong>was to enable Fiat Chrysler to conquer the world&#39;s largest automobile market alongside Chinese giant GAC Group.</strong> At the time, the ambitions were immense: 17 billion yuan in investment (around 2.3 billion euros), two plants in Guangzhou and Changsha, a capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year, and a range adapted to local tastes, including Jeep Renegade, Compass, Cherokee and the Fiat Viaggio and Ottimo.</p>




<p>But after a sales peak in 2017 (over 200,000 units), the descent into hell was swift. Unable to keep up with the Chinese market, <strong>dominated by new technologies and electrified vehicles,</strong> Gac-FCA remained focused on thermal models that were increasingly unattractive to Chinese consumers.</p>



<p>In 2022, the company entered restructuring proceedings. Since then, no attempt has been made to sell assets: five public auctions have remained empty, despite the sale of land, equipment and two factories. The result: liabilities of over 8.1 billion yuan (approx. $1.1 billion), including 4 billion in undisputed debts, against assets estimated at just 1.9 billion. <strong>In the absence of an agreement with creditors, the court declared the company liquidated.</strong></p>




<p>This failure also symbolizes the inability of Stellantis, like other Western manufacturers, <strong>to adapt to China&#39;s electric revolution, led by ultra-competitive local brands.</strong> Converting sites from fossil-fired to electric power would have required colossal investments that no investor was willing to make.</p>



<p>The geopolitical context and deteriorating relations between Stellantis and GAC have not helped matters. After the FCA-PSA merger, Carlos Tavares had tried to regain control of the joint venture, but GAC had opposed him, denouncing what it considered unsuitable governance and a regulatory climate unfavorable to foreign groups.</p>




<p>With this bankruptcy, Stellantis definitively turns the page on a part of the Asian strategy inherited from Marchionne. A page fraught with symbolism... and a billion-dollar liability to wipe out.</p>
