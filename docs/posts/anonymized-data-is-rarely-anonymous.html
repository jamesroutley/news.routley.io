<p>Justin Sherman for Wired points out <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-may-not-know-your-name-but-it-knows-everything-else/">the farce that is anonymized data</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data on hundreds of millions of Americansâ€™ races, genders, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, political beliefs, internet searches, drug prescriptions, and GPS location histories (to name a few) are for sale on the open market, and there are far too many advertisers, insurance firms, predatory loan companies, US law enforcement agencies, scammers, and abusive domestic and foreign individuals (to name a few) willing to pay for it. There is virtually no regulation of the data brokerage circus.</p></blockquote>
