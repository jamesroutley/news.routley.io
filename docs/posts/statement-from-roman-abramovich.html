I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club. Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.</p></div></cfc-content-rich-text><cfc-deferred-loading-placeholder _ngcontent-c70="" _nghost-c13=""><cfc-loader-default _ngcontent-c13="" _nghost-c1=""></cfc-loader-default></cfc-deferred-loading-placeholder></section></cfc-content-section></div></section><h2 _ngcontent-c54="">More from chelsea</h2></div><section _ngcontent-c54=""><cfc-deferred-loading-placeholder _ngcontent-c54="" _nghost-c13=""><cfc-loader-default _ngcontent-c13="" _nghost-c1=""></cfc-loader-default></cfc-deferred-loading-placeholder></section></div></cfc-standard-article></cfc-page-content></div></div></div>
