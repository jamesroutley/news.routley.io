<p>A new survey suggests that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Intelligence</a> matters to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> buyers, but the majority say that the initial features add little to no value. It remains to be seen whether Genmoji and ChatGPT integration will change that view.</p>



<p>Things are even worse for Samsung smartphones, with an even greater majority of owners saying they can’t see much point in the AI features offered … </p>



<h2 id="h-iphone-owners-do-care-about-ai">iPhone owners do care about AI</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-vs-samsung-ai-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new survey</a> by tech trade-in site SellCell found that AI is an important factor when choosing a new smartphone.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>iPhone users showed relatively higher interest in mobile AI than Samsung users as almost half (47.6%) of iPhone users reported AI features as a ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’ important deciding factor when buying a new phone vs. 23.7% of Samsung users who said the same.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-but-what-they-ve-seen-so-far-doesn-t-impress">But what they’ve seen so far doesn’t impress</h2>



<p>But while iPhone users want AI features, the Apple Intelligence ones seen to date don’t seem to impress them.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Smartphone users in general are unsatisfied with the existing AI features as the survey recorded 73% of Apple Intelligence users and 87% of Galaxy AI users stating the new features to be either ‘not very valuable’ or they ‘add little to no value’ to their smartphone experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The site also ranked the popularity of different Apple Intelligence features available prior to the launch of iOS 18.2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Writing Tools (72%)</li>



<li>Notification summaries (54%)</li>



<li>Priority Messages (44.5%)</li>



<li>Clean Up in Photos (29.1%)</li>



<li>Smart Reply in Mail and Messages (20.9%)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-perhaps-genmoji-and-chatgpt-will-change-that">Perhaps Genmoji and ChatGPT will change that</h2>



<p>The survey was carried out before the launch of iOS 18.2, which <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/11/genmoji-are-here-in-ios-182/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Genmoji</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/chatgpt-in-ios-18-2-heres-what-apple-intelligence-has-coming-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT integration</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genmoji is a play on two phrases: ‘emoji’ and ‘AI-generated.’ Simply put, in iOS 18.2 you can use Apple Intelligence to create new emoji in an instant.</p>



<p>Open the emoji keyboard on your iPhone running iOS 18.2, and you’ll see a new glowing smiley icon in the top-right corner. Tap that icon, then describe the emoji you’d like created—and that’s it! […]</p>



<p>Apple demoed its ChatGPT integration as something secondary to Siri’s knowledge, with certain questions answered by Siri and others by ChatGPT. But in iOS 18.2 you can start your Siri request with “Ask ChatGPT” and the assistant will automatically send the query straight to ChatGPT.</p>
