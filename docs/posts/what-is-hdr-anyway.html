            <p>It&#39;s not you. HDR confuses tons of people.</p><p>Last year we announced HDR or &#34;High Dynamic Range&#34; photography was coming to our popular photography app, <a href="https://halide.cam" rel="noreferrer">Halide</a>. While most customers celebrated, some were confused, and others showed downright <em>concern</em>. That&#39;s because HDR can mean two different, but related, things.</p><p>The first HDR is the &#34;HDR mode&#34; introduced to the iPhone camera in 2010.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/04/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image-3.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/04/image-3.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>September, 2010</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second HDR involves new screens that display more vibrant, detailed images.

Our eyes can see both just fine. Cameras? They can deal with <em>overall</em> bright lighting, or <em>overall</em> dim lighting, but they struggled with scenes contain both really dark and really bright spots.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_05.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_05.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_05.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_05.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_08.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_08.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_08.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/HDRI_Sample_Scene_Window_-_08.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-exposure_HDR_capture" rel="noreferrer"><span>Via Wikipedia</span></a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Dynamic range simply means, &#34;the difference between the darkest and brightest bits of a scene.&#34; For example, this foggy morning is an example of a <em>low</em> dynamic range scene, because everything is sort of gray.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/foggy.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/foggy.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/foggy.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/foggy.jpeg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/foggy.jpeg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Screens have no trouble showing this low-contrast photo.

Even if you had a perfect camera that could match human vision, most <em>screens</em> cannot produce enough contrast to match the real world.</p><p>Regardless of your bottleneck, when a scene contains more dynamic range than your camera can capture or your screen can pump out, you lose highlights, shadows, or both.</p><h2 id="solution-1-hdr-mode">Solution 1: &#34;HDR Mode&#34;</h2><p>In the 1990s researchers came up with algorithms to tackle the dynamic range problem. The algorithms started by taking a bunch of photos with different settings to capture more highlights and shadows:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/memorial0062.png" width="512" height="768" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/memorial0065.png" width="512" height="768" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/memorial0068.png" width="512" height="768" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>This full sequence has 16 photos.

So these researchers also came up with algorithms to squeeze HDR values onto an SDR screen, which they called &#34;Tone Mapping.&#34;</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Reinhard.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="512" height="768"/><figcaption><span>The Reinhard Tone Mapper, invented in 2002.

Most people want to tap a button and get a photo that looks closer to what they see without thinking about it. So Google and Apple went an extra step in their camera apps.</p><p>Your modern phone&#39;s camera first captures a series of photos at various brightness levels, like we showed a moment ago. From this burst of photos, the app calculates an HDR image, but unlike that commercial software from earlier, it uses complex logic and AI to make the tone mapping choices for you.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-09.13.41.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1007" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-09.13.41.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-09.13.41.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-09.13.41.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-09.13.41.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Phil Schiller at the iPhone XS introduction showing off a newer Smart HDR </span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple and Google called this stuff &#34;HDR&#34; because &#34;HDR Construction Followed By Automatic Tone Mapping&#34; doesn&#39;t exactly roll off the tongue. But just to be clear, the HDR added to the iPhone in 2010<strong> was not HDR</strong>. The final JPEG was an SDR image that tries to replicate what you saw with your eyes. Maybe they should have called it &#34;Fake HDR Mode.&#34;</p><p>I know quibbling over names feels as pedantic as going, &#34;Well actually, &#39;Frankenstein&#39; was the doctor, you&#39;re thinking of &#39;Frankenstein&#39;s Monster,&#39;&#34; but if you&#39;re going to say you hate HDR, remember that it&#39;s <em>bad</em> <em>tone mapping</em> that is the actual monster. That brings us to…</p><h3 id="the-first-hdr-backlash">The First HDR Backlash</h3><p>Over the years, Apple touted better and better algorithms in their camera, like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion. As this happened, we worried that our flagship photography app, Halide, would become irrelevant. Who needs a manual controls when AI can do a better job?</p><p>We were surprised to watch the opposite play out. As phone cameras got smarter, users asked us to turn off these features. One issue was how the algorithms make mistakes, like this weird edge along my son Ethan&#39;s face.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/04/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1462" height="1570" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image-2.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/04/image-2.png 1462w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>When life gives you lemons, you... eat them.</span></figcaption></figure><p>That&#39;s because Smart HDR and Deep Fusion require that the iPhone camera capture a burst of photos and stitch them together to preserve the best parts. Sometimes it goofs. Even when the algorithms behave, they come with tradeoffs.</p><p>Consider these photos I took from a boat in the Galapagos: the ProRAW version, which uses multi-photo algorithms, looks smudgier than the single-shot capture I took moments later.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Untitled-1.jpeg" width="1008" height="1344" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Untitled-1.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Untitled-1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Untitled-1.jpeg 1008w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/galapagos-native.jpeg" width="1008" height="1344" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/galapagos-native.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/galapagos-native.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/galapagos-native.jpeg 1008w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>Left: Merged from Multiple Photos.

When things move in the middle of a burst capture— which always happens when shooting handheld— these algorithms have to nudge pixels around to make things line up. This sacrifices detail.</p><p>Since 2020, we&#39;ve offered users the option of disabling Smart HDR and Deep Fusion, and it quickly became one of our most popular features.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Disabled_SmarterProcessing.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1350" height="718" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Disabled_SmarterProcessing.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Disabled_SmarterProcessing.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/Disabled_SmarterProcessing.png 1350w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This lead us to Process Zero, our completely AI-free camera mode, which we launched last year and became a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/18/24222043/halide-process-zero-google-gemini-podcast-installer" rel="noreferrer">smash</a> <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-halide-process-zero-changed-my-iphone-camera-forever/" rel="noreferrer">hit</a>. However, without any algorithms, HDR scene end up over and under exposed. Some people actually prefer the look — more on that later — but many were bummed. They just accepted this as a tradeoff for the natural aesthetic of AI-free photos.</p><p>But what if we don&#39;t need that tradeoff?

The final image you achieve will, to quote Alfred Stieglitz, reveal what you saw and felt.</blockquote><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree. I don&#39;t think people reject processing your photos, whether it&#39;s dodging-and-burning a print, or fiddling with multi-exposure algorithms. The problem is that <strong>algorithms are not artists</strong>. </p><p>AI cannot read your mind, so it cannot honor your intent. For example, in this shot, I <em>wanted</em> stark contrast between light and dark. AI thought it was doing me a favor by pulling out detail in the shadow, flattening the whole image in the process.

While a single capture can&#39;t reach the dynamic range of human vision, good sensors have dynamic range approaching film.</p><p>However, the best feature is that this tone mapping is <strong>off by default. </strong>If you come across a photo that feels like it could use a little highlight or shadow recovery, you can now hop into Halide&#39;s updated Image Lab. </p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2025/05/skyline-edit-trimmed_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><p>Ok, today&#39;s best screens still can&#39;t match the high dynamic range of real life, but they&#39;re way higher than the past. Spend a few minutes watching Apple TV&#39;s mesmerizing screensavers in HDR, and you get why this feels as big as the move from analog TV to HDTV. So… nine years after the introduction of HDR screens, why hasn&#39;t the world moved on?</p><p>A big problem is that it costs the TV, Film, and Photography industries billions of dollars (and a bajillion hours of work) to upgrade their infrastructure. For context, it took well over a decade for HDTV to reach critical mass.</p><p>Another issue is taste. Much like adding a spice to your meal, you don&#39;t want HDR to overpower everything. The garishness of bad HDR has left many filmmakers lukewarm on the technology. Just recently, cinematographer Steve Yedlin published <a href="https://www.yedlin.net/DebunkingHDR/" rel="noreferrer">a two hour lecture</a> on the pitfalls of HDR in the real world.</p><p>If you want to see how bad HDR displays can get, look no further than online content creators. At some point these thirsty influencers realized that if you make your videos uncomfortably bright, people will pause while swiping through their Instagram reels. The abuse of brightness has lead to people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone15Pro/comments/17r2sf8/hdr_content_is_painfully_bright_and_is_sadly/" rel="noreferrer">disabling HDR altogether</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/03/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1622" height="734" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-2.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/03/image-2.png 1622w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>For all these reasons, I think HDR could end up another dead-end technology of the 2010s, alongside 3D televisions. However, Apple turned out to be HDR&#39;s best salesperson, as iPhones have captured and rendered HDR photos for years.</p><p>In fact, after we launched Process Zero last year, quite a few users asked us why their photos aren&#39;t as bright as the ones produced by Apple&#39;s camera. The answer was compatibility, which Apple improved with iOS 18. So HDR is coming to Process Zero!</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/p0hdr.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1242" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/p0hdr.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/p0hdr.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/p0hdr.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/p0hdr.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>To handle the taste problem, we&#39;re offering three levels of HDR:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard</strong>: increases detail in shadows, and bumps up highlights while giving a tasteful rolloff in highlights</li><li><strong>Max:</strong> HDR that pushes the limits of the iPhone display</li><li><strong>Off:</strong> turns HDR off altogether. </li></ul><h3 id="compatibility-considerations">Compatibility Considerations</h3><p>Once you&#39;ve got an amazing HDR photo, you&#39;re probably wondering where you can view it, today. The good news is that every iPhone that has shipped for the last several years supports HDR. It just isn&#39;t always available.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, some users turn off HDR because the content hurts their eyes, but even if it&#39;s on, it isn&#39;t <em>always</em> on. Because HDR consumes more power, iOS turns it off in low-power mode. It also turns it off when using your phone in bright sunlight, so it can pump up SDR as bright as it can go.</p><p>An even bigger issue is where you can share it online. Unfortunately, most web browser can&#39;t handle HDR photos. Even if you encode HDR into a JPEG, the browser might butcher the image, either reducing the contrast and making everything look flat, or clipping highlights, which is about as ugly as bad digital camera photos from the 1990s.</p><p>But wait… how did I display these HDR examples? If you look carefully those are short HDR videos that I&#39;ve set to loop. You might need these kinds of silly hacks to get around browser limitations.</p><p>Until recently, the best way to view HDR was with Instagram&#39;s native iPhone app. While Instagram is our users&#39; most popular place to share photos… it&#39;s Instagram. Fortunately, things are changing.</p><p>iOS 18 adopted Adobe&#39;s approach to HDR, which Apple calls &#34;Adaptive HDR.&#34; In this system, your photos contain <em>both</em> SDR and HDR information in a single file. If an app doesn&#39;t know what to do with the HDR information, or it can&#39;t render HDR, there&#39;s an SDR fallback. This stuff even works with JPEGs!</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-3.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/image-3.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/image-3.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>From Apple&#39;s </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10177/" rel="noreferrer"><span>Adaptive HDR Presentation</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Browser support is halfway there. Google beat Apple to the punch with their own version of Adaptive HDR they call <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/camera/ultra-hdr" rel="noreferrer">Ultra HDR</a>, which Android 14 now supports. Safari has <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=282299" rel="noreferrer">added HDR support into its developer preview</a>, then it disabled it, due to bugs within iOS.</p><p>Speaking of iOS bugs, there&#39;s a reason we aren&#39;t launching the Halide HDR update with today&#39;s post: HDR photos sometimes render wrong in Apple&#39;s own Photos app! Oddly enough, they render just fine in Instagram and other third-party apps. We&#39;ve filed a bug report with Apple, but due to how Apple releases software, we doubt we&#39;ll see a fix until iOS 19.</p><p>Rather than inundate customer support with angry emails about how photos don&#39;t look right in Apple&#39;s photos app, we&#39;ve decided to release HDR support in our Technology Preview beta that we&#39;re offering to 1,000 Halide subscribers. Why limit it to 1,000? Apple restricts how many people can sign up for TestFlight, so we want to make sure we stay within our limits. This is the start of our preview of some very exciting big features in Halide which are part of our big Mark III update.</p><p>If this stuff excites you and you want to try it out, go to the Members section in Settings <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368" rel="noreferrer">right now</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/IMG_7647.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1206" height="1700" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/IMG_7647.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/IMG_7647.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/IMG_7647.jpg 1206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="solution-3-embrace-sdr">Solution 3: Embrace SDR</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, some users actually prefer SDR.

Sometimes a less-realistic photo is more engaging.</p><p>But aren&#39;t photos about capturing reality? If that were true, we would all use pinhole cameras, ensuring we capture everything in sharp focus.  If photos were about realism, nobody would shoot black and white film.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/000272640006.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="3017" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/000272640006.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/000272640006.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/000272640006.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2025/05/000272640006.jpg 2075w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Shot on Ilford HP5, ƒ/1.4</span></figcaption></figure><p>Consider this HDR photo of my dad.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2025/05/Marc-ProRAW-hdr_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">
