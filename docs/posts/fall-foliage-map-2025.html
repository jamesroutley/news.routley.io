    <h1>Fall Foliage Map 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="more-info-4">
          <p>If you&#39;ve ever traveled in search of fall foliage before, you likely know how tricky it can be to be in the right place at the right time. The timing of peak color varies signficantly season-to-season, meaning what worked one year might not work the next! The best fall trips take careful planning, a lot of patience, and a reliable fall foliage map.</p>
          <p>It&#39;s helpful to establish a baseline for when leaves <i>normally</i> change. Maps, like the one in the above section, can help you identify roughly when in the season you should be planning your trip. From there, you should consult a real-time fall foliage map like ours to see if fall foliage is on-time or running early/late due to ongoing weather conditions.</p>
          <p>If at all possible, don&#39;t solidify your plans until you&#39;re two weeks out from peak fall foliage. This allows you to be flexible should extreme weather rear its head and disrupt the normal progression of fall foliage. Should that not be an option for you, do your planning in early September when fall foliage experts can give you an idea of whether or not fall color is on-time this year.</p>
          <p>You&#39;ll want to make the most of your time in fall&#39;s splendor, so be sure to pick out a few beautiful hikes or drives on which you can truly be emersed in autumnal glory. If you&#39;re looking to beat the crowds, consider going to popular locations very early in the morning, before the majority of people arrive. Sunrise bathes fall foliage in golden hues, making early morning one of the best times to venture out!</p>
