            <p>On April 9, 2025, someone risked about $2.5 million—and walked away with more than $70 million in under an hour.</p><p>The trade was simple, but bold: buy a specific kind of option tied to SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&amp;P 500, the most widely followed index of large-cap U.S. companies. The option—known as a call—gave the buyer the right to purchase SPY at $509 per share. That might not sound strange, except that SPY was trading below $500 when they placed the bet. And the option was set to expire the same day.</p><p>These are known as zero-day expiry options. They’re cheap because they’re risky. If the market doesn’t move in your favor, they expire worthless. If the market does move, they can pay off massively. But you have to be exactly right on both direction and timing.</p><p>In this case, the timing was perfect. The trade was placed just before 1:01 pm Eastern Time. At 1:30 pm, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he was pausing most of the tariffs he had imposed earlier that month. The market exploded upward. SPY surged well past the 509 mark. Those options that had cost just 85 cents were suddenly worth more than $25.</p><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="934" height="924" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png 934w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Notice the spike in trade at 17:00 GMT.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was not a small-volume trade. About 30,000 contracts changed hands. That’s a $2.5 million position that turned into more than $70 million. And that’s just one strike. Similar trades occurred in SPY 504, 505, 507, and QQQ contracts as well, suggesting that the total take may have been far larger.</p><p>It wasn’t just the profit. It was the precision. The market moved before the news. The options were bought before the rally. The volume spiked in contracts that almost never see this kind of interest unless something is expected. And the pattern wasn’t visible on previous trading days. This wasn’t a trend. It was a singular event.</p><p>And it wasn’t just options. At exactly 1:01 pm EST, trading volume in SPY shares themselves spiked. Nearly 2.75 million shares were bought in that single minute. If those shares were sold at the closing price of $533.94, the buyers would have locked in a gain of more than $36 per share—earning over $100 million in profit in sixty seconds.</p><p>Over the next fifteen minutes, volume remained elevated. If the same rate of trading continued, that window alone could account for more than 41 million shares traded. That means more than $1.5 billion in potential profit—all before the public even knew why the market was moving.</p><p>If the trades hadn’t worked out, the losses would have been swift and total. Zero-day options don’t forgive bad timing. The entire $2.5 million could have evaporated by the close of trading. Even with SPY shares, any unexpected reversal would have meant millions in losses. That’s what makes this kind of trading so revealing. Institutions hedge. Retail investors chase momentum. But this? This was conviction. Or it was information.</p><p>I checked comparable moments in market history: emergency rate cuts in 2008, the first quantitative easing program in 2009. These were true market shocks. But in those cases, SPY volume was flat before the announcements. The price didn’t move until after the news hit the wire. No sign of early bets. No one placing $2 million chips on the right number just minutes before the roulette wheel stopped.</p><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1528" height="938" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 1000w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 1528w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1524" height="936" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 1000w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 1524w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This time was different. April 9 shows all the hallmarks of pre-positioning—where a trader takes a major position just before a known catalyst. Sometimes it’s just a hunch. Sometimes it’s a coincidence. And sometimes it’s something else entirely.</p><p>We don’t know who placed the trades. We don’t know what they knew. But we do know this: if they were guessing, they guessed better than almost anyone in modern market history. And if they weren’t guessing, then someone made a fortune off of information the public didn’t yet have.</p>
