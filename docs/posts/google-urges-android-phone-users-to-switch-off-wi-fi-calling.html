With limited additional research and development, we believe that skilled attackers would be able to quickly create an operational exploit to compromise affected devices silently and remotely,” Google said.</p><p>The devices affected are:</p><p>- Samsung Galaxy phones, including those in the S22, M33, M13, M12, A71, A53, A33, A21, A13, A12 and A04 series</p><p>- Vivo phones, including those in the S16, S15, S6, X70, X60 and X30 series</p><p>- Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7 and 7 Pro</p><p>- Any wearables that use the Exynos W920 chipset</p><p>- Any vehicles that use the Exynos Auto T5123 chipset</p><div><div data-related-type="story" data-related-id="63a35d0ce93e2342346be963"><div><article><div><figure><img src="https://cdn.scrippsnews.com/images/videos/356x200/1671651616_lKRMOt.jpg" alt="Apple Pay mobile payment system."/></figure><div><h3>Mobile wallets are convenient, but how safe are they?</h3><p>An expert says adding a debit or credit card to your mobile wallet actually adds a layer of protection.</p><p><a href="https://scrippsnews.com/stories/mobile-wallets-are-convenient-but-how-safe-are-they/">LEARN MORE</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div><p>Samsung is aware of the issue and is currently working on a fix.
