<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center (RC)</a> peer <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rygoldstein.com">Ryan</a> recently coined a phrase that I
instantly fell in love with: <em>houseplant programming</em>.</p>
<p>In Ryan’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The tool I built] solves my idiosyncratic problems and may not
address yours at all. That’s fine—take it as an ad to write tiny
software just for yourself. Houseplant programming 🪴<sup>[2]</sup> !
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Houseplant programming: tiny software just for yourself.
<em>Perfection.</em></p>
<p>At the risk of overexplaining and thus cheapening the analogy, I feel
the need to wax poetic.🪴</p>

<h2 id="when-it-works-on-my-machine-is-the-goal-not-the-excuse">When “It
works on my machine” is the goal, not the excuse</h2>
<p>Things I have found myself saying about some personal projects,
almost apologetically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works for me, but…</li>
<li>It’s held together with <a href="https://hannahilea.com/slide-whistle-trombone-champ-controller/">string and electrical
tape and visibly disorganized wires</a>…</li>
<li>I have to do <a href="https://hannahilea.com/clapping-music-for-flip-disc-displays/">manual restarts after
the power goes off</a>…</li>
</ul>
<p>In the world of houseplant programming none of these statements are
apology-worthy. In a workplace, about a project that is intended for
productionization<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and mass dissemination? Sure,
production-ready code—code that has a job, or provides the
infrastructure for a job—needs to be some flavor of robust and tested
and reliable. For a project that lives in my house and does what I need
it to and periodically needs a little extra help? No worries.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.evalapply.org/">Aditya Athalye</a> (another RC
peer!) perfectly captures this vibe in the project description for his
software project <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite?tab=readme-ov-file"><code>shite</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>shite</code>’s job is to help me make my website: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://evalapply.org">https://evalapply.org</a>. Thus,
<code>shite</code>’s scope, (mis)feature set, polish will always be
production-grade, where production is “works on my machine(s)” :) <span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite?tab=readme-ov-file">[source]</a></span></p>

<p>Strong “Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I
have won an award” energy:</p>

<p>Any code is production ready, if you redefine the scope of your
production environment!</p>

of houseplants, programmatic and chlorophyllous</h2>
<p>Before we get to the self-reflective bit,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
here is a non-exhaustive list of parallels between my houseplants and my
houseplant programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A happy home</strong>: I love having both plants and
homemade projects in my living space. Sharing a space with them reminds
me of things that I like about the world and about myself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: Like my plants, I love my little
projects and I want them to thrive, and I baby them a little bit to get
them started. But also, if they don’t work out? It isn’t a big deal,
into <del>the great compost bin in the sky</del> Github they go, where a
hard-won line or two may be <del>composted</del> recycled into a future
project.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<figure>

</figure>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Propagation</strong>: Clippings! I love to propagate my
plants and share them with friends. Do you want a pilea or a spider
plant or a nice philodendron? Let me know, I’ll hook you up! Similarly,
do you want to set up <a href="https://hannahilea.com/ly-drawbot-setup/">your own pen
plotter</a> or make some quick and easy <a href="https://hannahilea.com/meme-making/">screenshot memes</a>? Awesome, I try to document
and share the code and steps for recreating most of my projects.</p>
<p>That said, once a plant/code has taken up residence in your home, it
is no longer my responsibility. While I’d love to hear about what you
did to help it thrive, and if it starts looking sad I’ll gladly help you
think through what might help, if it never thrives I’m probably not
going to lose sleep over it.</p>
<p>Besides, once you’ve gotten as far as propogating the code/plant I’ve
given you, you’ll know about as much about the situation as I do—maybe
more—and now we can explore the next steps together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pet toxicity</strong>: Just like some plants, some
projects are practically poisonous to my cat and—if the cat had her
way—should be rehomed with a pet-free pal.</p></li>
</ul>

</iframe>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Universalization</strong>: I don’t care to engineer my
houseplants to thrive in every environment—and similarly, I don’t feel a
need to make my houseplant code fully generalizable, until there is a
more specific reason to do so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong>: I love reading about other
people’s houseplant projects. While I occasionally take code cuttings
for my own home, mostly I just want to wander around and admire their
houseplants and learn more about the woes they encountered when figuring
out how to help their code/plants thrive.</p>
<p>I do not need to propagate someone’s houseplant [code] in my own home
order to admire it; I can learn to consider a different fertilizer or
communication protocol without transplanting their program into my own
home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capitalism</strong>: One person’s houseplants are another
person’s plant nursery. One person’s houseplant code is another person’s
B2B SaaS product. Enough said.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bugs</strong>: Soil gnats. Where do they even come from?!
It is unknowable.</p>
<p>Sometimes my weather station shows me the icon for snow, even though
it is currently April and the temperature isn’t predicted to dip below
32. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fun</strong>: It is really, really fun to grow plants.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> It is really really fun to write
code.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="not-an-idea-not-yet-a-platonic-ideal">Not an idea, not yet a
Platonic ideal</h2>
<p>While I build software as a career, I also like to muck about with
code in service of other goals. When sharing those other projects it has
taken me a long time be able to talk about what my code does do without
adding a zillion caveats about what the code <em>does not</em> do.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Why? I think somewhere along the line I picked up the unhealthy—and
false!—assumption that it wasn’t worth sharing my code until it was
ready to be reused easily by whoever was able to access it—specifically,
not sharing that code until it was “production ready,” for some
arbitrary and ever-growing definition of “production” that I never
<em>quite</em> fully defined for myself.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In the last year or so when presenting personal projects I’ve taken
to saying that they’re prototypes. Prototyping is a thing that makes
sense to many folks in the field—it involves a first pass at trying to
build something, with output that <em>won’t</em> be optimized, might be
hacked together with glue and dreams, and possibly even “only works on
my machine”. But it’s proof that it is worth spending more time on
something, or <em>not</em> worth spending more time on something.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of the personal projects I’ve built are
<em>not</em> prototypes, even if they share a lot of the same
characteristics of a prototype: while they are a first-ish pass at
bringing an idea to life, and they <em>could</em> be turned into a more
generalizable or generic Thing, they’re never designed to be more than
that first pass with its context-specific configuration.</p>
<p>While rebranding some of the projects I’ve built as “prototypes”
helped me feel better about sharing something not totally polished, I’ve
also felt like the term somehow devalues what I’ve built. Sure,
sometimes what I’ve built <em>is</em> a prototype! But often, it isn’t.
It’s a first pass, sure, but it’s just a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/make-little-guys-112268885">weird
little guy</a> of an idea, and doesn’t need to promise to be any more
than what it already is. Just existing is enough,and I’m not necessarily
interested in developing it into a less-weird less-little guy!</p>
<p>Thus: houseplant programming. Tiny software for just myself.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue-bouquet-programming">Epilogue: Bouquet programming
💐</h2>
<p>I’m going to spare us all a further brainstorm of plant/code
parallels, with the exception of one spin-off term: <em>bouquet
programming</em> 💐.</p>
<p>I’m hereby defining bouquet programming as one-off code that is
written for one specific user <em>to support one specific use-case</em>,
in a non-recurring way. By definition, it needs no maintenance and
simply provides proof of what once was one run. Examples of bouquet
programming: an analysis script in support of a one-time plot, a scrappy
proof-of-concept or a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example">minimal
reproducible example</a>.</p>
<p>Bouquet programming is still worth writing home about (!) and sharing
generously in the same ways as houseplant programming—or agricultural
programming!—but is even <em>less</em> likely to work off-the-shelf for
a new application than houseplant code is, even if rerun by the same
person who originally programmed it.</p>
<p>Examples of my own bouquet code: a script I used to scrape book cover
images for generating miniature book covers as part of a physical gift,
code run in service of helping a friend <a href="https://hannahilea.com/video-timelapses-with-ffmpeg/">prepare timelapse videos of her
marbling process</a>, etc.</p>
