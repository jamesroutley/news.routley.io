                                With this release, we introduce a major addition to IntelliJ IDEA – AI Assistant. With
                                the current starting set of AI-powered features, AI Assistant offers integrated AI chat
                                and can do things like automatically write documentation comments for you, suggest names,
                                generate commit messages, and more.
                            </p>

                                AI Assistant is powered by the JetBrains AI service, which can connect you to OpenAI for
                                now and will include other language model providers in the future. To access the
                                assistant’s AI features, you’ll need to install the AI Assistant plugin and log in to
                                the JetBrains AI service using your JetBrains Account. The availability of the JetBrains
                                AI service may vary initially. For more information on AI Assistant and instructions on
                                how to access it, refer to

                                In IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2, we&#39;ve enhanced the IntelliJ Profiler to provide more valuable
                                and easy-to-interpret insights into your application’s performance. The new in-editor
                                hints offer a quick way to analyze code performance line by line, helping you identify
                                and resolve issues faster. Color-coded annotations in the editor’s gutter highlight
                                critical methods allowing you to focus right on the performance bottlenecks. This
                                means you no longer have to perform a thorough, time-consuming analysis with the
                                <i>Flame Graph</i> and <i>Call Tree</i> views. Learn more in this

                                workflow. You can now work with the <i>Merge Request</i> functionality right from the IDE:
                                review the list of requests, check the changes, leave comments, and navigate to relevant
                                views.

                                <i>Search Everywhere</i> (<kbd data-mac="Double ⇧">Double Shift</kbd>) is primarily
                                used for searching through files, classes, methods, actions, and settings. With this
                                update, it now includes text search capabilities similar to <i>Find in Files</i>.
                                Now, text search results are displayed when there are few or no other search results
                                available for a given query. The feature is enabled by default and can be managed in
                                <i>Settings/Preferences | Advanced Settings | Search Everywhere</i>.

                                IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2 introduces colored headers to simplify navigation between
                                multiple open projects. You can now assign a unique color and icon to each of your
                                projects, making them easier to distinguish in your workspace. Headers now come with
                                predefined colors by default, but you can customize them. To set a new color for your
                                project, first right-click on a header to access the context menu. Then select the
                                <i>Change Project Color</i> option and choose your desired color
                                from the suggested list or by browsing the color palette. If you’d like to disable
                                this feature, simply deselect the <i>Show Project Gradient</i> option in the context
                                menu.

                        <p>
                                We’ve refined the behavior of the hamburger menu that is located in the main toolbar
                                in the new UI on Windows and Linux. Once you click on the menu icon, the elements now
                                appear horizontally over the toolbar. Also, there’s now an option to turn this menu
                                into a separate toolbar, accessible via
                                <i>View | Appearance | Main menu as a Separate Toolbar</i>.

                                IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2 brings the long-awaited ability to arrange your files in the
                                <i>Project</i> view based on their modification times. This new functionality
                                automatically reorders the files whenever the changes in your project are saved.
                                To enable this feature, open the kebab menu (three vertical dots) in the
                                <i>Project</i> view and then select <i>Tree Appearance | Sort by Modification Time</i>.

                                For v2023.2, we’ve refined the user experience with the <i>Light</i> theme by
                                introducing the <i>Light with Light Header</i> alternative, which features matching
                                light colors for window headers, tooltips, and notification balloons.

                                If you use full screen mode in the new UI on macOS, the window controls are now

                                For the convenience of Linux users, the native header of the operating system has
                                been removed in the new UI, resulting in a cleaner interface. By default, you will
                                now see the IDE’s custom header, which offers a range of customization options to
                                tailor your workspace. If you want to revert the header to its previous appearance,
                                uncheck the <i>Merge main menu with window title</i> option in

                                In the <i>Project</i> view, there’s a new <i>Open Directories with Single Click</i>
                                option that makes expanding and collapsing the project folders quicker and more

                                To do so, right-click on any widget, select <i>Add to Main Toolbar</i>, and explore

                                plugins that is determined automatically based on your project specifics and appears
                                at the top of the list.

                                To make managing multiple run configurations easier, we’ve implemented the option
                                to pin preferred configurations in the <i>Run</i> widget. To add a run configuration
                                to the <i>Pinned</i> section, open the kebab menu (three vertical dots) next to its
                                name and select <i>Pin</i>. If you have multiple pinned configurations, you can
                                easily rearrange them by dragging and dropping within the list.

                                We have improved and expanded Java inspections to help you maintain high-quality
                                code and detect potential issues more effectively. The new
                                <i>Incorrect ‘MessageFormat’ pattern</i> inspection will warn you when pattern
                                references do not match the arguments, and it will also detect incorrect usages of
                                quotes and braces in <code>MessageFormat</code> patterns. Also, the IDE now reports
                                calls with explicit <code>ChronoField</code> or <code>ChronoUnit</code> arguments and
                                suggests replacing them with calls of more specific methods, thus simplifying the code.

                        <p>
                                IntelliJ IDEA now features improved <code>@snippet</code> tag functionality in
                                Javadoc comments. It allows Markup comments within the <code>@snippet</code> tag and
                                renders them properly in the documentation. Code regions are now supported, meaning
                                you can specify a portion of code that you want to refer to in a Javadoc comment. In
                                addition, the IDE now supports the inclusion of external snippets within the
                                <code>@snippet</code> tag, allowing you to reference code snippets stored in separate
                                files or sources and include them in Javadoc documentation.

                                We’ve added new ways to apply certain refactorings to several members at once. You
                                can now invoke <i>Extract Delegate</i>, <i>Extract Interface</i>,
                                <i>Extract Superclass</i>, <i>Pull Members Up</i>, and <i>Push Members Down</i> on
                                multiple members simultaneously by selecting them right in the <i>Project</i> or
                                <i>Structure</i> tool window. In addition, IntelliJ IDEA now supports multi-caret
                                selection for an extended range of refactorings, including <i>Encapsulate Fields</i>,
                                <i>Move Static Members</i>, <i>Extract Delegate</i>, <i>Extract Interface</i>, and
                                <i>Extract Superclass</i>. To utilize this feature, place a caret in each member you
                                want to apply the refactoring to, and the IDE will automatically preselect and check
                                these members in the refactoring dialog.

                                IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2 brings enhanced Scala 3 support, with a focus on providing a
                                streamlined development experience. Notable improvements include fixes for Scala 3
                                enum highlighting, navigation to enum definitions, and the correct resolution of
                                enum cases in various contexts. The TASTy decompiler has been significantly enhanced,
                                ensuring accurate decompilation of popular Scala libraries, such as Akka, Cats, Play,
                                ZIO, and others. Additionally, the integration of
                                <code>scala-expression-compiler</code> into the debugger provides a better debugging
                                experience for Scala developers. Other improvements include enhanced completion hints
                                for Scala 3’s Universal Apply Methods, in-editor support for IArray, and improved
                                support for the “fewer braces” syntax.

                                This release comes with many improvements to IntelliJ IDEA’s sbt support. Environment
                                variables set for sbt are persisted and handled correctly after the project is
                                reopened. The settings page
                                <i>File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | sbt</i> was
                                redesigned for easier use, and a new <i>Environment variables</i> field was added
                                so that you can now pass custom environment variables to the sbt-shell process.

                                based on the selected theme. The list of extended traits and classes is split into
                                multiple lines if it exceeds the available space. Additionally, Scala 3 keywords are
                                now supported in the documentation.

                                The new release comes with many fixes to invalid type inference in some complex
                                or simply rare cases, such as when types have complicated bounds, when a sealed
                                trait hierarchy might be unclear, or in complex pattern matching.

                                In light of Zinc’s recent performance improvements, we’ve made it the default
                                incremental compiler in v2023.2. This ensures comprehensive support for incremental
                                compilation of new Scala 3 features, including <code>inline</code> methods.

                                Sub-folders of the target folder are no longer included automatically as sources
                                unless they are marked as managed. This speeds up searching in projects that
                                generate source code. Also, the IDE now provides better support for
                                <code>sbt-projectmatrix</code>.

                                spent in a method, including waiting time. With milliseconds as the measurement unit,
                                it takes center stage as the more powerful and intuitive option.

                                When debugging your reactive application, you can now easily evaluate values of watches
                                and local variables for <code>Mono</code> and <code>Flux</code> types. The IDE now
                                detects them during debugging sessions and provides a corresponding <code>get</code>
                                or <code>collectList</code> link in the <i>Variables</i> view, which you can click
                                to instantly compute reactive stream items. By default, the debugger fetches the first
                                100 items of <code>Flux</code>. You can configure this number in
                                <i>File | Settings | Languages &amp; Frameworks | Reactive Streams</i>.

                        <p>
                                We have expanded the capabilities of the auto-testing functionality, making it fully
                                compatible with the Maven, Gradle, and JPS build systems. We’ve also made it easier
                                to activate continuous testing mode. To enable it, use the new
                                <i>Rerun Automatically</i> button located in the <i>Run/Debug</i> tool window. Whenever
                                your changes are saved, the tests will run automatically, providing immediate feedback
                                on your code updates.

                                IntelliJ IDEA now offers improved support for setting breakpoints directly at the
                                return statement, similar to how it was already being done with lambda expressions.
                                This improvement offers developers improved debugging precision and deeper code
                                analysis, providing valuable insights into code behavior and return values. To set
                                an inline breakpoint, simply right-click on the gutter next to the statement and
                                select the <i>return</i> option.

                                specific parts of code chunks. To perform a partial commit, select the lines within

                                chunk will be divided into individual lines, with the selected ones highlighted. You
                                can add or exclude lines from the selection using checkboxes or the context menu.

                                generating shared indexes for your team, requiring just a few clicks instead of
                                multiple scripts and services.

                                configurations. We’ve reworked the <i>Edit Swagger Codegen Configuration</i> dialog

                                Additionally, you can now access Swagger Codegen run configurations right from

                                It is now possible to set a Docker run configuration to run before another
                                configuration by designating it as a <i>Before Launch</i> task. The IDE will wait for
                                the container that is currently running to become healthy, and then it will launch the
                                next run configuration. To put a Docker run configuration in a queue, first create it
                                and then add it to the relevant container via
                                <i>Modify options | Add before launch task | Run configuration</i>.

                                or working with environments on different clusters in the same project. To set the
                                files up, go to <i>File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Kubernetes</i>.

                                more readable way, making it easier to spot problems in your code. This works for
                                all TypeScript errors, some of the most common JavaScript errors, and even
                                localized errors.

                                popups. By default, VLS will be used for TypeScript v5.0 and higher, and the
                                wrapper over the TypeScript service will be used for earlier TypeScript versions.
                                You can set the Vue service to use VLS integration on all TypeScript versions under

                                analysis with a few clicks, view project-wide problems, and set up quality gates
                                in your preferred CI/CD system. Second, you can now see the server-side analysis
                                results without leaving your IDE, right out of the box. Learn more about Qodana and

                                    With this release, we’ve introduced an LSP API for plugin developers who want
                                    to use a specific LSP server for coding assistance in the IDE. If you’ve made
                                    your own programming language or framework, you can get it supported in the IDE
                                    by creating an LSP server and a plugin. Please note that this feature is
                                    available only in the paid version of the IDE.

                                    plugin, allowing you to use its parts separately. This means six new plugins are
                                    available for IntelliJ IDEA:
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21704-kafka">Kafka</a>,
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21700-spark">Spark</a>,
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21702-flink">Flink</a>,
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21706-remote-file-systems">Remote File Systems</a>,
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21701-big-data-file-viewer">Big Data File Viewer</a>, and
                                    <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21673-zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>.
                                    If you need all six, installing the umbrella Big Data Tools plugin is still
                                    possible and a convenient way to get them all in one click.

                                    IntelliJ IDEA&#39;s bundled Android plugin now provides the features of Android
                                    Studio Giraffe Beta 2, including support for Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) 8.0.0.
                                    Please note that this support doesn&#39;t include the features that require signing
                                    in to a Firebase account.
