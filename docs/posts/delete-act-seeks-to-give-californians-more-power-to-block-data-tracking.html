    <h1>&#39;Delete Act&#39; seeks to give Californians more power to block data tracking</h1>

<p>“Which is good, right? It’s good to know who these companies are,” said Hayley Tsukayama, senior legislative activist with San Francisco-based nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation; EFF is dedicated to civil liberties in the digital age.</p>
<p>Tsukayama said that what most experts in the field agree on is that California law leads the nation in this space, but that it’s still <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11793073/the-year-in-tech-privacy-controversy-and-unsuccessful-public-offerings">barely enforced</a>. The onus is on individuals to try to protect their data from an estimated 2,000–4,000 data brokers worldwide — many of which have no other relationship with consumers beyond the trade in their data. This lucrative trade is also known as <a href="https://consumerfed.org/consumer_info/factsheet-surveillance-advertising-what-is-it/">surveillance advertising</a>, or the “ad tech” industry.</p>
<h2>The Delete Act: An iterative change to California law</h2>
<p>In a privacy advocate’s ideal world, Tsukayama said, California would fight a lot harder on consumers’ behalf, but “that’s not the law that California has on the books, and it’s clearly a law that California has shown it’s not willing to pass. So, you know, we work with what we have.”</p>

<p>EFF supports <a href="https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/news/press-release/april-11-2023/data-brokers-beware-californians-will-gain-new-privacy-protections">The Delete Act</a>, or <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362">SB 362</a>, by state Sen. Josh Becker, who represents the Peninsula.</p>
</div></div><div><div>
<p>“I want to be able to hit that delete button and delete my personal information, delete the ability of these data brokers to collect and track me,” said Becker, of his second attempt to pass such a bill. “These data brokers are out there analyzing, selling personal information. You know, this is a way to put a stop to it.”</p>
<p>Tracy Rosenberg, a data privacy advocate with <a href="https://media-alliance.org">Media Alliance</a> and <a href="https://oaklandprivacy.org">Oakland Privacy</a>, said she anticipates a lot of pushback from tech companies, because “making [the Delete Act] workable probably destroys their businesses as most of us, by now, don’t really see the value in the aggregating and sale of our data on the open market by third parties …</p>
<p>“It is a pretty basic-level philosophical battle about whether your personal information is, in fact, yours to share as you see appropriate and when it is personally beneficial to you, or whether it is property to be bought and sold,” Rosenberg said.</p>
<h2>Likely opposition</h2>
<p>SB 362 isn’t on the California Chamber of Commerce’s “<a href="https://advocacy.calchamber.com/policy/bill-tracking/2023-job-killers/">job killer</a>” list this year, but the group typically opposes anything that tightens consumer privacy online. The Chamber recently asked a Sacramento Superior Court judge to force the state to <a href="https://advocacy.calchamber.com/2023/03/31/calchamber-lawsuit-asks-court-to-order-california-privacy-agency-to-adopt-complete-set-of-final-regulations-implement-voters-will-on-enforcement/">hold off enforcing</a> the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPRA) until at least July 1, “until businesses receive the implementation time that the voters approved, 12 months after regulations are adopted.”</p></div></div></div>
