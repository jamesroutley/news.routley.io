    <h1>RC Week 7: Four habits to improve as a programmer</h1>

    <p><strong>Friday, November  4, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>Seven weeks down, five weeks to go!
It&#39;s flying by quickly.
On the one hand, I want it to last forever.
On the other hand, I know it can&#39;t, and I&#39;m looking forward to talking to coworkers again at my day job when I go back.
RC has given me a renewed appreciation for what I get at my job.
More on that in December, though.</p>
<p>For now: RC, and the goals I have while I&#39;m here.
Instead of focusing on what I did this week, I&#39;m going to use this post to talk about how I want to improve as a programmer.</p>
<p>I came into RC in with certain hard skills I wanted to improve (debugging! profiling! optimization!) and those are all great, and I <em>have</em> worked on them.
But I am starting to focus more on the meta level of how do I actually improve broadly as a programmer?
What habits do I have that make me less effective?
What habits do I have that make me <em>more</em> effective?</p>
<p>One of my bad habits is jumping into writing code without doing sufficient analysis.
This might surprise some of my coworkers, since I&#39;m the design doc person at work.
I <strong>love</strong> writing design docs.
But what I don&#39;t do as great a job of is doing analysis when I&#39;m midstream on something.</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote a parser.
When I was working on it, I ran into some significant memory consumption issues.
I was pairing with another recurser, Manuel, and I started to just kind poke around at different ideas to bring down memory consumption.
Instead, he pushed us to take a few minutes to actually calculate what a lower bound is on the memory which would be used.
This informed our approach for reducing its usage and figuring out where high usage was coming from, and ultimately was a lot more effective a lot more quickly.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the first habit I want to build:
<strong>Using estimation to inform how I work on things.</strong>
It sounds simple, and it&#39;s hard for me to break out of the flow of coding to do it.
But I&#39;ve already started to put it in practice this week, which is promising!</p>
<p>The second bad habit I have is not reading the docs.
This one is pretty self-explanatory.
I want to read the docs more when I start using a new library.
But I also want to read the docs for standard library things that I <em>don&#39;t</em> use often so that I know they&#39;re there when I need them.
I might need to make some Anki cards to study the standard library or something!</p>
<p>And that&#39;s the second habit I want to build:
<strong>Proactively read/study documentation.</strong></p>
<p>But what habits do I have that make me a better programmer, that I&#39;m already doing?</p>
<p>The main one is <em>writing</em>.
I believe I&#39;m at least a halfway-decent writer.
The thing that I do that makes me more effective is <strong>writing design docs</strong>.</p>
<p>For the first half of RC, I didn&#39;t do this, and I&#39;m not sure why.
I&#39;ve started writing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Entietz/isabella-db/tree/main/item/docs">design docs</a> for IsabellaDB and it&#39;s been so helpful in clarifying my thoughts and giving me discrete steps that are more approachable.
My designs are not correct on the first pass, but that&#39;s also kind of the point!
After this database is working, I&#39;ll have a record of the design iterations, which I think will be a kind of neat example of how a skilled software engineer goes through design iterations, especially in an area they&#39;re not highly familiar with.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the third habit, which I want to reinforce:
<strong>Write design docs proactively and often.</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve also fallen out of the habit of using my favorite and most effective programming tool: Walking or running.
Something about walking or running helps me work through problems that have been nagging me.
The work I&#39;m most proud of in my life has all been catalyzed by walks or runs.
I don&#39;t solve the entire thing, but I typically will get the kernel of a solution that I need in order to chip away at it.
I used to go for walks proactively during the day to think, and I&#39;ve fallen out of that habit.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the fourth habit, which I&#39;m going to rebuild:
<strong>Go for walks during the day.</strong></p>
<p>These habits are what are effective <em>for me</em>.
I&#39;m going to keep at it.
I&#39;d be eager to hear from any of you:
What habits have you found make <strong>you</strong> a more effective programmer?
And are there any you think would help me that I&#39;m missing?</p>
