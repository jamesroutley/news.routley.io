    <h1>GNU Taler: An anonymous, taxable payment system using modern cryptography</h1>

<p>We are building an anonymous, taxable payment system using modern
cryptography.  Customers will use traditional money transfers to send
money to a digital Exchange and in return receive (anonymized) digital
cash.  Customers can use this digital cash to anonymously pay
Merchants.  Merchants can redeem the digital cash for traditional
money at the digital Exchange.  As Merchants are not anonymous, they can
be taxed, enabling income or sales taxes to be withheld by the state
while providing anonymity for Customers.</p>
<p>Cryptography is used to ensure that none of the participants can
defraud the others without being detected immediately; however, in
practice a fraudulent Exchange might go bankrupt instead of paying the
Merchants and thus the Exchange will need to be audited regularly like
any other banking institution.</p>
<p>The system will be based on free software and open protocols.</p>
<p>In this document, we describe the REST-based APIs between the various
components, internal architecture of key components, and how to get them
installed.  In addition to this documentation, we have source-level
documentation which you can find converted to HTML at these pages:</p>
