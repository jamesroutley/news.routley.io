By design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership. We continually listen to customer feedback and look for ways to improve the customer experience,&#34; Jamil Ghani, VP of Amazon Prime, told Business Insider in a statement.</p><p>Tech companies have often used a design language called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/amazon-prime-ftc-signups">“dark patterns”</a> to make it harder for users to quit services.
