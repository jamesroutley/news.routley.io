<p>A group of hackers have exposed an exploit that can unlock Tesla’s software-locked features worth up to $15,000.</p>



<p>Free heated seats and Full Self-Driving package, anyone?</p>



<p>Software-locked features that need to be activated by the owner paying or subscribing to a service are becoming increasingly popular in the auto industry.</p>



<p>Tesla has been on board that trend very early since it produced virtually all its vehicles with the same hardware and owners can unlock features later through software updates.</p>



<p>This includes features like heated seats, acceleration boost, and even Tesla’s Full Self-Driving package, which costs $15,000.</p>



<p>It creates a market for people trying to get around the software lock.</p>



<p>A group of security researchers (aka hackers) at TU Berlin announced that they managed to exploit a weakness in the onboard computer to unlock these features:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tesla has been known for their advanced and well-integrated car computers, from serving mundane entertainment purposes to fully autonomous driving capabilities. More recently, Tesla has started using this well-established platform to enable in-car purchases, not only for additional connectivity features but even for analog features like faster acceleration or rear heated seats. As a result, hacking the embedded car computer could allow users to unlock these features without paying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They plan to unveil the result of their exploit in a presentation called “<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#jailbreaking-an-electric-vehicle-in--or-what-it-means-to-hotwire-teslas-x-based-seat-heater-33049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jailbreaking an Electric Vehicle in 2023 or What It Means to Hotwire Tesla’s x86-Based Seat Heater</a>” next week.</p>



<p>The hack requires physical access to the car, and it involves a “voltage fault injection attack” on the AMD-based infotainment system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For this, we are using a known voltage fault injection attack against the AMD Secure Processor (ASP), serving as the root of trust for the system. First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-self hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP’s early boot code. We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The group of hackers claims that their “Tesla Jailbreak” is “unpatchable” and allows to run “arbitrary software on the infotainment.”</p>



<p>They add:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Second, it will enable us to extract an otherwise vehicle-unique hardware-bound RSA key used to authenticate and authorize a car in Tesla’s internal service network.</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Ultimately, the hackers believe that they can unlock virtually all software-locked features inside Tesla vehicles even Full Self-Driving – though they believe that it would require some more reverse-engineering.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Generally, these exploits are shared with Tesla, and it helps the automaker secure its systems.</p>



<p>In this case, the hackers said that despite the exploit, they believe Tesla’s security is better than other automakers.</p>



<p>We have seen Tesla put a lot more emphasis on cyber security over the last few years. We highlighted the effort in our report: <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/27/tesla-hack-control-over-entire-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Big Tesla Hack: A hacker gained control over the entire fleet, but fortunately he’s a good guy</a>.</p>
