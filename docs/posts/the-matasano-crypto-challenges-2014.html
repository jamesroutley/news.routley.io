    <h1>The Matasano crypto challenges (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>Welcome to the challenges</h2>
    <p>
      We can&#39;t introduce these any better than
      <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/">Maciej Ceglowski</a>
      did, so read that blog post first.
    </p>
    <p>
      We&#39;ve built a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They&#39;re derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you&#39;re finished, you&#39;ll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you&#39;ll also understand how they&#39;re attacked.
    </p>
    <h4>What Are The Rules?</h4>
    <p>
      There aren&#39;t any! For several years, we ran these challenges over email, and asked participants not to share
      their results. <i>The honor system worked beautifully!</i> But now we&#39;re ready to set aside the ceremony and
      just publish the challenges for everyone to work on.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How Much Math Do I Need To Know?
    </h4>
    <p>
      If you have any trouble with the math in these problems, you should be able to find a local 9th grader to help you out. It turns out that many modern crypto attacks don&#39;t involve much hard math.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How Much Crypto Do I Need To Know?
    </h4>
    <p>
      None. That&#39;s the point.
    </p>
    <h4>
      So What Do I Need To Know?
    </h4>
    <p>
      You&#39;ll want to be able to code proficiently in any language. We&#39;ve received submissions in C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl, Visual Basic, X86 Assembly, Haskell, and Lisp. Surprise us with another language. Our friend Maciej says these challenges are a good way to learn a new language, so maybe now&#39;s the time to pick up Clojure or Rust.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What Should I Expect?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Right now, we have eight sets. They get progressively harder. Again: these are based off real-world vulnerabilities. None of them are &#34;puzzles&#34;. They&#39;re not designed to trip you up. Some of the attacks are clever, though, and if you&#39;re not familiar with crypto cleverness... well, you should like solving puzzles. An appreciation for early-90&#39;s MTV hip-hop can&#39;t hurt either.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Can You Give Us A Long-Winded Indulgent Description For Why You&#39;Ve Chosen To Do This?
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>It turns out that we can.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&#39;re not that familiar with crypto already, or if your familiarity comes mostly from things like Applied Cryptography, this fact may surprise you: most crypto is fatally broken. The systems we&#39;re relying on today that aren&#39;t known to be fatally broken are in a state of just waiting to be fatally broken. Nobody is sure that TLS 1.2 or SSH 2 or OTR are going to remain safe as designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current state of crypto software security is similar to the state of software security in the 1990s. Specifically: until around 1995, it was not common knowledge that software built by humans might have trouble counting. As a result, nobody could size a buffer properly, and humanity incurred billions of dollars in cleanup after a decade and a half of emergency fixes for memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counting is not a hard problem. But cryptography is. There are just a few things you can screw up to get the size of a buffer wrong. There are tens, probably hundreds, of obscure little things you can do to take a cryptosystem that should be secure even against an adversary with more CPU cores than there are atoms in the solar system, and make it solveable with a Perl script and 15 seconds. Don&#39;t take our word for it: do the challenges and you&#39;ll see.
    </p>
    <p>
      People &#34;know&#34; this already, but they don&#39;t really know it in their gut, and we think the reason for that is that very few people actually know how to implement the best-known attacks. So, mail us, and we&#39;ll give you a tour of them.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How do I start?
    </h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://cryptopals.com/sets/1">Start here!</a>
    </p>
    <h4>Who did this?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Thomas Ptacek (@tqbf)</li>
      <li>Sean Devlin (@spdevlin)</li>
      <li>Alex Balducci (@iamalexalright)</li>
      <li>Marcin Wielgoszewski (@marcinw)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cryptopals is maintained and expanded (from Set 8 on) by Sean Devlin, in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/assessment-advisory/cryptography/">Cryptography Services Team</a> at <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/">NCC Group</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not possibly have done this without the help of several other people. Roughly in order of
      influence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.rootlabs.com/">Nate Lawson</a>
        taught us virtually everything we know about cryptography.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trevor Perrin taught Nate some of that. I can tell you a pretty compelling story about how Trevor is the
        intellectual origin of every successful attack on TLS over the past 5 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo are the godfathers of practical cryptographic software
        security. Several things in this challenge didn&#39;t make sense to us until after Thai and
        Juliano exploited them in mainstream software.
      </li>
