<p>Without enduring self-ideals, our [research] would lack coherence. As individuals, we’d never be able to trust ourselves to carry out our [protocols]. In a social group, no one person would be able to trust the others. A working society must evolve mechanisms that stabilize ideals – and many of the social principles that each of us regards as personal are really “long-term memories” in which our cultures store what they have learned across the centuries.</p>

<p>Your electronic lab notebook (ELN) and/or laboratory<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> information management system (LIMS)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> embodies ideals in various implicit or explicit forms: data formats and validators, software transformation functions and tests, planning/recording/reporting document templates, etc.</p>
<p>Are these ideals siloed in your ELN/LIMS, or are they shared? If so, how, and is sharing robust?</p>
