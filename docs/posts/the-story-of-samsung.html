Read Part 2&#xA0;</em><a href="https://commoncog.com/the-study-of-asian-tycoons/" rel="noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>. You may read more about the&#xA0;</em><a href="https://commoncog.com/the-asian-conglomerate-series/"><em>Asian Conglomerate Series here</em></a><em>, or view all the published cases&#xA0;</em><a href="https://commoncog.com/c/concepts/asian-conglomerates/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>This is the third instalment and the second case in the Asian Conglomerate series. At <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-study-of-asian-tycoons/#wrapping-up">the end</a> of the last instalment, I mentioned, briefly, that the simplest questions you may ask as you read these cases are comparison questions:</p><ul><li>What are some surprising similarities between this case and the previous cases we&#x2019;ve examined?</li><li>What are some surprising dissimilarities between this case and the previous cases we&#x2019;ve examined?</li></ul><p>These questions are designed to help <a href="https://commoncog.com/how-note-taking-can-help-you-become-an-expert/#idea-two-in-ill-structured-domains-cases-are-as-if-not-more-important-than-concepts">accelerate the pattern matching aspect</a> of business expertise. </p><p>In this particular case, you should keep these questions in mind when comparing the rise of Samsung (and the life of Lee Byung-chul or B.C. Lee) to the rise of STDM and the life of Stanley Ho. </p><p>You&#x2019;re going to need to increase the number of pair-wise comparisons as we introduce more tycoons and publish more cases over the course of this series, but for now: what are your answers to these two questions when comparing the lives of these two men?
