<p>Researchers at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) have invented a novel microwave isolator and have demonstrated, for the first time, its basic principle that enables small isolators; essential for future quantum computers. This isolator consists of two frequency mixers, which are widely used in receivers for radio telescopes, and paves the way for the development of large-scale multi-pixel radio cameras as well. The paper is published in the journal <i>IEEE Microwave and Wireless Technology Letters</i>.

<p>An <a href="https://phys.org/tags/isolator/" rel="tag">isolator</a> is an electronic component that controls the direction of signal propagation and is used in various instruments, including quantum computers and radio receivers for astronomy.
</p><p>Conventional isolators utilize magnetic materials, which in principle make it difficult to construct an isolator smaller than a few centimeters. This is an obstacle to the realization of large-scale quantum computers with one million qubits. Currently realized quantum computers have only about 100 qubits, and to increase this number by a factor of 10,000 would require a large number of components, including isolators, each of which would have to be miniaturized. The same problem exists in the development of large-format cameras for radio astronomy observations.
</p><p>In this new study, the research team utilized two sets of frequency mixers for an isolator, instead of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/magnetic+materials/" rel="tag">magnetic materials</a>, and have demonstrated the principle both theoretically and experimentally. &#34;This is based on a completely new principle,&#34; says Sho Masui, a Project Researcher at the NAOJ Advanced Technology Center (ATC). &#34;We have created a novel circuit device in the microwave band. It is also significant from an electrical engineering point of view, as the new isolator can provide highly scalable circuits.&#34;
</p><p>One of the major scalability benefits is the fact that the new isolator can be configured entirely within a flat circuit on a printed circuit board. This means that an isolator with integrated circuits can be miniaturized to the millimeter scale, which is 1,000 times smaller in volume than conventional isolators.
</p><p>The research team is aiming higher; they are looking at developing isolators that can also amplify signals. The frequency mixers widely used in radio observation equipment are superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers (SIS mixers), which have the function of amplifying signals. In this development, a commercially available semiconductor <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mixer/" rel="tag">mixer</a> is used as a frequency mixer, but if an SIS mixer is used instead, a new device that both amplifies signals and functions as an isolator will be realized.
</p><p>&#34;Radio wave observation equipment and quantum computers share some common development elements,&#34; says Yoshinori Uzawa, the NAOJ Director of Engineering. &#34;NAOJ has accumulated knowledge in the development of observational instruments for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/radio+waves/" rel="tag">radio waves</a> and visible and infrared light. Recently we established the Social Implementation Program in the NAOJ ATC and formed a project team to promote <a href="https://phys.org/tags/technological+development/" rel="tag">technological development</a> for the application of quantum computers. We will continue to develop breakthroughs in these two fields.&#34;
