    <h1>Asynchronous Rust on Cortex-M Microcontrollers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>In the realm of embedded software, the demand for efficient and responsive
applications is ever-increasing. Asynchronous programming, with its ability
to handle concurrent tasks effectively, holds immense potential in this domain.
Let’s delve into the world of asynchronous Rust specifically tailored for
microcontrollers.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the inner workings of Futures, cooperative
scheduling, and Async Rust executors, highlighting their significance in
optimizing resource utilization. Moreover, we introduce the Rust Embassy
project, an innovative framework designed to unlock the power of asynchronous
programming on microcontrollers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-asynchronous-programming">What is Asynchronous Programming?</h2>

<p>Asynchronous programming is a type of concurrent programming where the
execution of a task can be paused if it does not have work to do. This is
especially useful for tasks that are waiting for some external event to occur,
such as a network packet arriving, or a button being pressed. In a synchronous
system, the task would have to wait for the event to occur before it could
continue execution. In an asynchronous system, the task can be paused, and
another task can be executed until the event occurs. This allows for more
efficient use of resources, as the thread this task is running on can be used
for other tasks while it is waiting. Additionally all resources for the thread,
such as the stack, an be used by other tasks while it is waiting.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-async-rust-work">How Does Async Rust Work?</h2>

<p>Similar to other languages Rust provides async/await syntax to make writing
concurrent code easier. The async/await syntax is built on top of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html" target="_blank"><code>Future</code></a> trait, which
is the core of Rust’s asynchronous programming story. Before we dive into how
async Rust works, let’s take a look at how async functions are defined in Rust:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>42</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code is pretty simple, but there are a few things to note. First, the
<code>async</code> keyword is used to mark a function as async. It’s important to note that
the <code>async</code> keyword is just syntactic sugar for returning a future. The function
signature for <code>foo</code> could be rewritten as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>impl</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>await</code> keyword is important, as it signals for the underlying future to
make progress. Futures in Rust are considered “lazy”, meaning they will
not make any progress until they are polled. We’ll cover polling in more detail
later, but for now, just think of it as a way to advance the state of the future.
The <code>await</code> keyword is what calls <code>poll</code> on the future, and returns the
result of the future.</p>

<p>Now that we have a good idea of how async functions generate futures, let’s look
in depth into how futures work.</p>

<h3 id="rust-futures">Rust Futures</h3>

<p>Futures in Rust represent a calculation that eventually yields some result. All
futures implement the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html" target="_blank"><code>Future</code></a> trait:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>:</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>cx</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Context</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;_</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Poll</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple right? Let’s unpack what we’re looking at. The <code>Output</code> type is
exactly what you’d expect, the output of our calculation. The <code>poll</code> function
hides a bit of complexity. Starting from the return value we see our defined
<code>Output</code> type, but what is the type wrapping it? Diving deeper we see the
following definition for
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html" target="_blank"><code>Poll</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Pending</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This enum represents the two possible states of a future. The <code>Ready</code> state
indicates that our calculation represented by the future is complete, and
encloses our defined return type. The <code>Pending</code> state indicates that our future
is not yet complete, and has more work that needs to be done. Generally, this
means we’re waiting for some I/O to complete, say a packet from a network stack,
or a message over a SPI bus.</p>

<p>To advance the state of our future we could call <code>poll</code> repeatedly until we
get a <code>Ready</code> status, but that seems rather inefficient. If our <code>Future</code> is
dependent on an external I/O event, looping over calls to <code>poll</code> keeps our
processor awake and wastes precious power. This observation brings us to the
only argument passed into the <code>poll</code> function, the future
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/task/struct.Context.html" target="_blank"><code>Context</code></a>.
The <code>Context</code> only has one role, to provide access to the <code>Future</code>’s
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/task/struct.Waker.html" target="_blank"><code>Waker</code></a>.</p>

<p>The <code>Waker</code> gives us an elegant solution to calling our <code>poll</code> implementation in
a loop. When a future is not ready to complete, the asynchronous action can save
off the <code>Waker</code> and use it to inform the executor that there is more work to be
done on the future. An example of this would be an interrupt on a GPIO wired to
a button. We’ll go over this exact example later in the article!</p>

<p>Now that we understand how futures work, we can plot out the lifetime of one
like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/embedded-rust-async/future-lifetime.excalidraw.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The last part of the poll function we haven’t covered is a fairly spicy bit.
The <code>self</code> reference here is a little strange. Let’s take a deeper look:</p>



<p>This is one of the stranger variants of self we can see on a trait.
The <code>&amp;mut self</code> is pretty standard, but what is this <code>Pin</code> thing? The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html" target="_blank"><code>Pin</code></a> struct acts as a
marker that tells the compiler that the memory of the wrapped type will not be
moved. This is important when we’re dealing with futures, as we need to ensure
that all of the state tracking the future’s progress is not moved. If the
underlying calculation is not complete, and we move the memory, we could lose
track of the future’s progress. Any future poll would potentially be in an
invalid state, as it would attempt to access memory that is no longer valid.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="async-executors">Async Executors</h2>

<p>Now that we have a good understanding of Rust futures work we need to look at
the core of any async system, the executor. Unlike its contemporaries in other
languages like Go or Javascript, Rust does not have a built-in executor. This
means that we need to provide our executor implementation. While this may
add a bit of complexity, it also gives us a lot of flexibility. We can choose
the executor that best fits our needs, and we can even write our own if we need
to. This is what allows us to run async Rust on embedded systems, as well as
giant servers in the cloud.</p>

<p>Any executor implementation needs to fulfill a few requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep track of all running tasks</li>
  <li>Provide the ability to spawn new tasks</li>
  <li>Provide a mechanism for
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/index.html" target="_blank"><code>Waker</code></a>s to notify the
executor there is work to be done for a given task.</li>
  <li>Poll all tasks when they have work to complete</li>
</ol>

<p>Since Rust futures are state machines that expect to run to completion, we can’t
rely on preemptive scheduling like we would when running an RTOS. Instead, we
must use cooperative scheduling.</p>

<h3 id="cooperative-vs-preemptive-scheduling">Cooperative vs. Preemptive Scheduling</h3>

<h4 id="preemptive-scheduling">Preemptive Scheduling</h4>

<p>We’re all familiar with Preemptive scheduling. This is the type of scheduling
used in most RTOS, as well as the most prominent operating systems like Linux,
Windows, and MacOS. At a high level preemptive schedulers can stop the execution
of a task at any time it sees fit. Generally, there is a concept of priority,
and the OS kernel will favor higher priority threads when determining which
threads to run while attempting to allow all tasks to run.</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/embedded-rust-async/preemptive.excalidraw.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a deeper dive into RTOS context switching, check out our
post on
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-rtos-context-switching">Cortex-M Task Switching</a>.
Additionally, check out this great article doing a
<a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown" target="_blank">Comparison of FreeRTOS and Embassy</a>.</p>

<h4 id="cooperative-scheduling">Cooperative Scheduling</h4>

<p>Cooperative scheduling is quite different. There is no priority, and tasks are
run until they return (yield) control back to the caller. It is the
responsibility of the task to be a good neighbor, and not run for too long.
Compare the preemptive scheduling diagram above with the cooperative scheduling
diagram below. Notice how the tasks can run to completion before
switching to the next task.</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/embedded-rust-async/cooperative.excalidraw.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>On its own, this cooperative scheduling doesn’t seem to provide much value. Why
would we want to move the cognitive load of ensuring all tasks run from the
OS scheduler to the writer of the tasks? Doesn’t this also start to resemble a
super loop? I thought we moved to an RTOS to get away from having to worry about
these things?! If we combine cooperative scheduling with our understanding of
Rust futures, we start to see the value. Whenever a future yields, the next
future can be polled. This means that we can run multiple futures on a single
thread! That means concurrent execution without the overhead of context
switches, or a separate stack for each task!</p>

<h2 id="embassy">Embassy</h2>

<p><a href="https://embassy.dev/" target="_blank">Embassy</a> is probably the most popular async executor for
embedded systems. It provides a full suite of synchronization primitives and a
very small footprint. Additionally, it provides fully implemented HALs for many
popular microcontrollers.</p>

<p>So far we’ve done a lot of gabbing about how async executors work, but we
haven’t written any code! Let’s change that by looking at a simple
blinky example using Embassy.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example likely looks very familiar to anyone who has written a blinky
example before. We’re spawning a task that toggles an LED every 200ms. What
likely isn’t familiar is all this crazy <code>embassy_executor</code>, and <code>spawner</code> stuff.
Let’s break down this example piece by piece.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[embassy_executor::main]</span>
<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>spawner</span><span>:</span> <span>Spawner</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>#[embassy_executor::main]</code> attribute macro has a few responsibilities<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
First, it provides an
<a href="https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rt/latest/cortex_m_rt/attr.entry.html" target="_blank">entry point</a>
for our program. This is the function that will be called by the Cortex-M
reset handler on boot. If you want to learn more about this check out our
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/zero-to-main-1">Zero to Main: Bare Metal C</a>
article.</p>

<p>Secondly, it creates a new
<a href="https://docs.rs/embassy-executor/latest/embassy_executor/struct.Executor.html" target="_blank"><code>Executor</code></a>
for us. In our configuration, this executor  is expected to have a <code>\</code>static`
lifetime, meaning that it’s expected to live for the entire lifetime of the
program. This makes sense, as we need our executor to live at least as long as
all of our tasks.</p>

<p>Lastly, it spawns a task that will run our <code>main</code> function and passes a copy
of the internal
<a href="https://docs.rs/embassy-executor/latest/embassy_executor/struct.Spawner.html" target="_blank"><code>Spawner</code></a>
handle for our executor. This handle allows us to spawn new tasks and send them
over to our executor. The [<code>Spawner</code>] implements [<code>Copy</code>], so it can cheaply be
passed around to different tasks to allow them to spawn new tasks.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>embassy_stm32</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>Default</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>());</span>
<span>let</span> <span>led</span> <span>=</span> <span>Output</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.PH7</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>::</span><span>Low</span><span>,</span> <span>Speed</span><span>::</span><span>Medium</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This section sets up the LED that we’ll be blinking. Since we’re using an
stm32 dev kit, we’re using the
<a href="https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/git/stm32c011d6/index.html" target="_blank"><code>embassy_stm32</code></a>
crate.  The call to <code>embassy_stm32::init</code> is responsible for setting up all of
our peripherals. The <code>Output</code> struct provides us with a safe interface for
interacting with the GPIO that our LED is connected to PH7<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>spawner</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>blinky</span><span>(</span><span>led</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final bit of our <code>main</code> function is to spawn our <code>blinky</code> task. This adds
the task to the executor’s task queue, and allows it to be polled when it has
work to do.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[embassy_executor::task]</span>
<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>blinky</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>led</span><span>:</span> <span>Output</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;static</span><span>,</span> <span>PH7</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re on to the fun part! The <code>#[embassy_executor::task]</code> attribute macro
is responsible for turning our <code>blinky</code> function into a task. The underpinnings
of this macro are a bit beyond the scope of this article, but if you’re
interested you can check out the
<a href="https://docs.rs/embassy-macro/latest/embassy_macro/" target="_blank"><code>embassy-macro</code></a> crate.
For now, we can just think of this macro as a special wrapper that turns the
future generated by our <code>blinky</code> function into a task that can be polled by the
embassy executor.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>LED_PERIOD_MS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>ticker</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ticker</span><span>::</span><span>every</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>::</span><span>from_millis</span><span>(</span><span>LED_PERIOD_MS</span><span>));</span>
<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ticker</span><span>.next</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    <span>led</span><span>.toggle</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re almost done! The rest of our <code>blinky</code> function is just a simple loop that
toggles our LED every 200ms. The <code>Ticker</code> struct is provided by the
<a href="https://docs.rs/embassy/latest/embassy/time/index.html" target="_blank"><code>embassy::time</code></a> crate,
and provides a simple interface for waiting for a given duration. The
<a href="https://docs.rs/embassy/latest/embassy/time/struct.Ticker.html#method.next" target="_blank"><code>next</code></a>
method returns a future that will resolve once the given duration has elapsed.
I’m sure you’ve guessed what the last bit does, but just in case, it toggles
the GPIO pin that our LED is connected to.</p>

<p>This is a pretty simple example, but it demonstrates the basics of how to write
an async program using Embassy. Let’s modify the example to be a bit more
complex, and see how we can extract some more interesting value.</p>

<h3 id="button-example">Button Example</h3>

<p>Our button example will be largely the same as our blinky example, but we’ll
add a button to the mix. When the button is pressed we’ll toggle the blinking
of the LED. Let’s take a look at the code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>LED_BLINK_ACTIVE</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicBool</span> <span>=</span> <span>AtomicBool</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that we’ve added a new static variable,
<code>LED_BLINK_ACTIVE</code>. It is an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html" target="_blank"><code>AtomicBool</code></a>
which allows us to safely share it between tasks. We’ll use this variable to
track whether or not the LED should be blinking.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>button</span> <span>=</span> <span>Input</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.PC13</span><span>,</span> <span>Pull</span><span>::</span><span>Down</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>button</span> <span>=</span> <span>ExtiInput</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>button</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>.EXTI13</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this next section of the new code, we’re setting up our button. The first
line sets up our <code>PC13</code> GPIO as an input. The second line assigns the GPIO to an
interrupt in the <code>EXTI</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> peripheral of the STM32U5. This sets up the GPIO as
an interrupt source and allows us to wait for the button to be pressed without
having to poll the GPIO.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>LED_BLINK_ACTIVE</span><span>.load</span><span>(</span><span>Ordering</span><span>::</span><span>Relaxed</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>led</span><span>.toggle</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we have a small change in our <code>blinky</code> task. We’ve added a check to see if
the LED should be blinking. If it should, we toggle the LED. If not, we do
nothing. This is a simple way to pause the blinking of the LED when we press the
button.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[embassy_executor::task]</span>
<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>buttony</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>button</span><span>:</span> <span>ExtiInput</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;static</span><span>,</span> <span>PC13</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our last bit of code is the meat of our new addition. The aptly named <code>buttony</code>
task. This task is responsible for waiting for the button to be pressed, and
then toggling the <code>LED_BLINK_ACTIVE</code>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html" target="_blank"><code>AtomicBool</code></a>
. Let’s dive deep into the <code>wait_for_rising_edge</code> method to get a good
understanding of how it works, and tie together our understanding of Async Rust
on embedded.</p>

  <p>Note: We’re going to be diving into the source code of Embassy here. At the

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s a lot of pins! All of these calls to pin are a result of a few layers of
abstraction here that we won’t touch on. The important thing to note is that
this is the pin we initially assigned to the <code>EXTI</code> interrupt. In our case this
<code>PC13</code> and its associated port. The other arguments are the edge we’re waiting
on. One other note is that the <code>pin</code>s here are GPIO pins and not the Rust
future <code>Pin</code> type we discussed earlier.</p>

<p>It looks like the core of this function is in another castle! Let’s take a look
at the

<p>The members of this struct are mostly what we’d expect. The <code>pin</code> member is
the GPIO attached to our button. The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html" target="_blank"><code>PhantomData</code></a>
member is a bit of a distraction here. We won’t cover it in detail, but it’s a
way to preserve the lifetime needed for the future even though we don’t
use the lifetime anywhere.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> method is where we set up our interrupt. We won’t cover all of the
individual bit manipulations here. If you want to get a complete understanding
of what’s going on, check out section 23 of the STM32U5 reference manual<sup id="fnref:5:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
At a high level here’s what’s going on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we enter a critical section. This ensures that we aren’t interrupted
  while we’re setting up our interrupt.</li>
  <li>Next, we set the <code>EXTI</code> interrupt to use the pin we’re waiting on.</li>
  <li>Then we set the edge we’re waiting on. In our case, we’re waiting for a rising
  edge.</li>
  <li>Then we clear the pending bits of any interrupts on this line</li>
  <li>Finally, we enable the interrupt to wake up the CPU when it’s triggered.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all pretty standard peripheral configuration. What we’re
interested in is how this future is driven to completion. Let’s take a look at
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html" target="_blank"><code>Future</code></a>
implementation for

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s taken a while, but we’re finally looking at a Rust future implementation
for a peripheral! Given how much we’ve covered so far, this implementation
should be pretty straightforward. Let’s break it down.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>EXTI_WAKERS</span><span>[</span><span>self</span><span>.pin</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>]</span><span>.register</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>.waker</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line is the key to how this future is driven to completion. Here we copy
the waker associated with the future to a static array of wakers that each map
to a specific interrupt line. We’ll come back to this in a moment when we look
at the actual interrupt handler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>imr</span> <span>=</span> <span>cpu_regs</span><span>()</span><span>.imr</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>.read</span><span>();</span>
<span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>imr</span><span>.line</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.pin</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Poll</span><span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Poll</span><span>::</span><span>Pending</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we check if the interrupt has fired, and return <code>Poll::Ready</code> if it has. If
it hasn’t fired yet, we return <code>Poll::Pending</code>. This is the pattern we
established earlier for futures. If there is still work to be done, in the case
of this future waiting for an interrupt, we return <code>Poll::Pending</code>.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the interrupt handler. Again we won’t cover all
of the register configurations <sup id="fnref:5:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> here. The important part is right in the
middle where we call <code>wake</code> on the waker associated with the interrupt line that
fired.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>pin</span> <span>in</span> <span>BitIter</span><span>(</span><span>bits</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>EXTI_WAKERS</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>]</span><span>.wake</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the key to how our future is driven to completion. When any interrupt
registered fires, we’ll call the associated waker. Under the hood, this will
throw our <code>buttony</code> task back onto the executor’s task queue, and it will be
polled when it gets its next turn.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-async-rust-on-embedded-systems">Benefits of Async Rust on Embedded Systems</h2>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of async Rust is a much smaller RAM footprint. A
traditional RTOS will require a stack for each task. Rust futures only need to
keep track of variables that are used across await points. This means that the
memory needed for an async task can be much smaller than a traditional RTOS
task, as small as 10s of bytes for less complex tasks! This means we can spin up
more tasks that have smaller discrete jobs, instead of overloading single tasks
with multiple responsibilities.</p>

<p>Another benefit is the lack of context switching between tasks. Since we’re
operating in a cooperative scheduling environment, we don’t need to save and
restore the state of a task when it is pending. This means we can spend more
time doing useful work, and less time context-switching!</p>

<h2 id="downsides-of-async-rust-on-embedded-systems">Downsides of Async Rust on Embedded Systems</h2>

<p>There’s no such thing as a free lunch, and async Rust is no exception. There are
some downsides to using async Rust on embedded systems.</p>

<p>While async Rust feels ergonomic, there is still a lot of complexity under the
hood. This can make it difficult to debug issues when they arise. An overloaded
task that is starving others in the runtime can be difficult to diagnose. This
isn’t helped by the fact that debug symbols can get a little weird when using
async Rust. This is because stack unwinding isn’t quite what you’d
expect when looking because of the way futures are polled and scheduled.</p>

<p>Another downside is the lack of priorities introduced by the cooperative
scheduler. To its credit, Embassy has a pretty cool solution to this problem.
Using the priorities assigned to interrupts, an executor is run in each of these
interrupts<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This allows for a form of priority-based scheduling, but it’s a
decent amount of added complexity compared to a traditional preemptive RTOS.</p>

<p>Additionally the ability to spawn more tasks than you would with a traditional
RTOS can be a double-edged sword. While it’s great to be able to spin up more
tasks, it can be easy to go overboard and create too many tasks. This can lead
to an overloaded task queue, with tasks spending more time waiting to be polled.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Async Rust is a powerful tool for embedded systems. It allows us to write
concurrent code that is easy to reason about, and has a small memory footprint.
It’s not without its downsides, but the benefits far outweigh the costs in my
opinion. I hope this article has helped you understand how async Rust works
under the hood, and how it can be used to write concurrent code on embedded
systems.</p>

<p>We’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible with async Rust. I hope this
article serves as a jumping-off point for you to explore the world of async Rust
on embedded systems. I hope you have fun writing concurrent code in this
paradigm!</p>
