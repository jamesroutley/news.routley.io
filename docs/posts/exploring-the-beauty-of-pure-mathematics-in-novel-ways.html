    <h1>Exploring the beauty of pure mathematics in novel ways</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc51="" _nghost-sc11=""><!----><dm-body-text _nghost-sc44="" id="" colour-theme=""><div _ngcontent-sc44=""><p>The use of learning techniques and AI systems holds great promise for the identification and discovery of patterns in mathematics. Even if certain kinds of patterns continue to elude modern ML, we hope <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Nature paper</a> can inspire other researchers to consider the potential for AI as a useful tool in pure maths. To replicate the results, anybody can access our <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_conjectures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interactive notebooks</a>. Reflecting on the incredible mind of Ramanujan, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Temple/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">George Frederick James Temple</a> wrote, “The great advances in mathematics have not been made by logic but by creative imagination.” Working with mathematicians, we look forward to seeing how AI can further elevate the beauty of human intuition to new levels of creativity.</p>
