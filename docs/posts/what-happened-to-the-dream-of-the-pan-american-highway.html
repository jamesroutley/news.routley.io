							<p>Trivia question: when was the Pan-American Highway completed?</p>
<p>The highway began a century ago as a dream of unfettered motor-vehicle travel between Alaska and Tierra del Fuego. It was born of a can-do optimism and good neighbor policies, not to mention US businesses eager to increase their automobile, tire, and road construction sales in South American markets.</p>
		
		
<p>“<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24690556?mag=the-pan-american-highway-and-the-darien-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The highway was to be a shared American public space</a>,” writes scholar Shawn W. Miller of boosters’ notions in the 1920–1940s, “an international corridor, and tourism would bind the Americas in a common, popular fellowship.” Behind the talk of fellowship and cooperation, though, it was all very much about building the infrastructure to sell more US-made cars. Cars which were, incidentally, transported by ship.</p>
<p>“Glossy tracts […] promot[ed] the fraternal beauties of nations linked and continents conjoined by ribbons of asphalt,” writes Miller, describing the task as “too far-reaching, too vital in all of its national and international social and economic implications to admit of any other answer than that ‘IT SHALL BE DONE.’”</p>
<p>But it was not done. This trivia question is a trick one. North Americans tend to assume the Pan-American Highway <i>was</i> completed, that you can drive from North America down through the narrowing isthmus of Central America into South America. Try it, though, and you’ll dead-end in Panama.</p>

<p>The border between Panama and Columbia is where the dream faltered. A route through <i>El Tapón Darién,</i> the Darién Gap, was never cleared and paved. To this day, writes Miller, “Panama and Colombia are the only neighboring nations on the globe without a single road link of even the most primitive kind.”</p>
<p>First there was the the engineering challenge: “steep mountains, incessant seasonal rain, inaccessibility, unstable soils, hundreds of rivers and streams, and abroad river basin, the so-called Atrato Swamp, which had no discernible bedrock on which to build what would have to be the world’s longest bridge.”</p>
<p>These could probably have been surmounted, eventually. But by the 1970s, the highway fantasies of 1920s were half a century old. <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-pardon-of-president-nixon-annotated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US President Richard Nixon</a>, for one, really wanted it completed by 1976 “so he could inaugurate it personally, and he had some pretension that the Darién section, if not the Pan-American highway itself, would be named for him.”</p>
<p>But in 1975, a year after Nixon’s resignation, the Sierra Club sued the US Department of Transportation, the primary funder of the project to bridge the Gap. It was a “singular case,” notes Miller, this application of US law to an international setting. The Sierra Club argued that the highway was a environmental disaster for the Gap’s wilderness and the indigenous people living there.</p>
<p>The winning argument, however, turned out to be that the “Gap served as an essentially prophylactic against dangerous microbes. The threat of hoof-and-mouth disease persuaded federal judges to shut down highway construction for nearly two decades,” explains Miller.</p>
<p>In 1992, the US Department of Agriculture declared South America free of hoof-and-mouth, and the legal injunction on USDOT funding was removed. But by then, “something of the generous if rhetorical spirit of Pan-Americanism had died.” “Good neighbors” now meant good fences if not actual walls.</p>
<p>“For many Panamanian voters, the Darién Gap represents a popular border fence” against an influx of undocumented Colombians. Further north, the US now saw the highway as artery along which leftist guerrillas, narcotics, and migrants could travel.</p>

	
	
<p>It was left unfinished. Yet the Pan-American Highway, with all its “powerful symbolism” of linking continents, countries, and peoples, has weirdly entered historical consciousness as <i>existing</i>, as finished, as smooth driving. Failure, writes Miller, “ran contrary to the dominant narrative of progress and development, and hence [the Highway] has entered social memory—remembered or assumed—as complete.”</p>
<p>Things change, of course, so maybe someday it may completed. But by then, we’ll all have <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-jet-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jet packs</a>.</p>
