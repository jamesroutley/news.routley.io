        <div><p>What’s the secret to coming up with good ideas? For Jeremy Utley, it’s about generating as many as possible.</p>

<p>The director of executive education at the Stanford d.school, <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/team-members/2016/12/12/jeremy-utley" target="_blank">Utley</a> says, “very few problems we face in business or in life have a single right answer.” All ideas — the good, the bad, and the ugly — are “a necessary input to an innovation process,” and an essential step in getting to solutions that will actually work.</p>

<p>In this episode of <em>Think Fast, Talk Smart,</em> Utley and host Matt Abrahams explore how we can focus less on finding the “right” answer and open ourselves up to more innovative ideas.</p></div>
