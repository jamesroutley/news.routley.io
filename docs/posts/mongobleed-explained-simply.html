    <h1>MongoBleed Explained Simply</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>MongoBleed, </strong><span>officially CVE-2025-14847, is a recently-uncovered extremely sensitive vulnerability affecting basically all versions of MongoDB since </span><strong>~2017</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>It is a bug in the </span><strong><span>zlib</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-1-182764771" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></strong><span> message compression path in MongoDB.</span></p><p><span>It allows an attacker to read off any uninitialized heap memory, meaning </span><em><strong>anything</strong></em><span> that was allocated to memory from a previous database operation could be read.</span></p><p><span>The bug was introduced in 2017</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-2-182764771" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. It is dead-easy to exploit - it only requires connectivity to the database (no auth needed). It is fixed as of writing, but some EOL versions (3.6, 4.0, 4.2) will not get it.</span></p><p>Let’s get a few basics out of the way before we explain the bug:</p><ul><li><p>MongoDB uses its own TCP wire protocol instead of e.g HTTP. This is standard for databases, especially ones chasing high performance.</p></li><li><p><span>Mongo uses the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON" rel="">BSON</a><span> format for messages</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-3-182764771" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>. It’s basically binary json but with some key optimizations. We will talk about one later because it is essential to the exploit.</span></p></li><li><p>Mongo doesn’t have endpoints or RPCs. It only uses a single op code called OP_MSG.</p></li><li><p><span>The OP_MSG command contains a BSON message. The contents of the message denote what type of request it is. Concretely, it’s the first field of the message that marks the request type. </span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-4-182764771" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p></li><li><p><span>The request can be compressed. In that case, an OP_COMPRESSED message is sent</span><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol#op_compressed" rel=""> which wraps</a><span> the now-compressed OP_MSG BSON.</span></p></li><li><p>The request then looks like this:</p></li></ul><pre><code>     OP_COMPRESSED message
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ standard header (16 bytes) │
├────────────────────────────┤
│ originalOpcode (int32)     │

│ compressorId (int8)        │
│ compressed OP payload      │
└────────────────────────────┘</code></pre><ul><li><p><span>Critically, the </span><code>uncompressedSize</code><span> field denotes how large the payload is once it’s uncompressed.</span></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the exploit is to get the server to wrongfully think that an overly-large OP_MSG is coming.</p><p><span>An attacker can send a falsefully large </span><code>`uncompressedSize`</code><span> field, say 1MB</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-5-182764771" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>, when in reality the underlying message is 1KB uncompressed. </span></p><p><span>This will make the server</span><strong> allocate a 1MB buffer</strong><span> in memory to decompress the message into. This is fine.</span></p><p>The critical bug here is that, once finished decompressing, the server does NOT check the actual resulting size of the newly-uncompressed payload.</p><p><span>Instead, it trusts the user’s input and uses that as the canonical size of the payload, even if it got a different number.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-6-182764771" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> </span></p><p>The result is an in-memory representation of the BSON message which looks something like this:</p><pre><code>[ 1KB of REAL DATA |      999KB of UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE       ]
                   ↑                                               ↑
        actual length (1KB)                     user input length (1MB)</code></pre><p>Like in every programming language, when a variables in the code goes out of scope, the runtime marks the memory it previously took up as available.</p><p>In most modern languages, the memory gets zeroed out. In other words, the old bytes that used to take up the space get deleted.</p><p><span>In C/C++, this doesn’t happen. When you allocate memory via </span><code>`malloc()`</code><span>, you get whatever was previously there.</span></p><p>Since Mongo is writen in C++, that unreferenced heap garbage part can represent anything that was in memory from previous operations, including:</p><ul><li><p>Cleartext passwords and credentials</p></li><li><p>Session tokens / API keys</p></li><li><p>Customer data and PII</p></li><li><p>Database configs and system info</p></li><li><p>Docker paths and client IP addresses</p></li></ul><pre><code>[ REAL BSON DATA | password: 123 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]</code></pre><p>Now that the server has wrongfully allocated some potentially-sensitive data to the input message, the only thing left for the attacker is to somehow get the server return the data.</p><p><span>As mentioned, BSON is Mongo’s way of serializing JSON. </span><a href="https://bsonspec.org/" rel="">As mentioned on its site</a><span>, it was designed with efficiency in mind:</span></p><blockquote><h3><strong>3. Efficient</strong></h3><p><span>En­cod­ing data to BSON and de­cod­ing from BSON can be per­formed very quickly in most lan­guages due to </span><strong>the use of C data types</strong><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>C famously uses </span><strong>null-terminated</strong><span> </span><strong>strings</strong><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-7-182764771" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span><span>. A null-terminated string means that a null byte is used to mark the end of the string:</span></p><pre><code><span>char* s = &#34;hello&#34;
// in memory, this is represented as an array of characters with the last element being the null terminator: h e l l o </span><strong>\0</strong></code></pre><p>The way such strings get parsed is very simple - the deserializer reads every character until it finds a null terminator.</p><p>If you recall, I said earlier that the first field of the BSON message denotes what type of “RPC” the command is.</p><p>As such, the first thing a server does when handling an incoming message over the wire is… parse the first field!</p><p>Because fields are strings, and strings are null-terminated CStrings, the deserializing logic in the MongoDB server parses the field until the first null terminator found.</p><p><span>An attacker can send a compressed, invalid BSON object that does NOT contain a null terminator. This forces the server to continue scanning through foreign data in the wrongly-allocated memory buffer until it finds the first null terminator (</span><strong>\0</strong><span>)</span></p><pre><code><code># Conceptual
[ REAL DATA |             UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE                 ]
# Practical Example
[ { &#34;a      | password: 123\0 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]</code></code></pre><p>As the first null terminator is right after the password, the server would now think that the first field of the BSON is:</p><pre><code>&#34;a      | password: 123&#34;</code></pre><p>Obviously that is an invalid BSON field, so the server responds with an error to the client. In order to be helpful, the response contains an error message that shows which field was invalid:</p><pre><code><span>{
  &#34;ok&#34;: 0,
  &#34;errmsg&#34;: &#34;invalid BSON field name &#39;a      | </span><strong>password: 123</strong><span>&#39;&#34;,
  &#34;code&#34;: 2,
  &#34;codeName&#34;: &#34;BadValue&#34;
}</span></code></pre><p>Boom. The attacker successfully got the server to leak data to it.</p><p>Any serious attacker would then run this over and over again, thousands of time a second, until they believe they’ve scanned the majority of the database’s heap. They can then repeat this ad infinitum.</p><p><span>The impact of this is particularly nasty, because the request-response parsing cycle happens </span><strong>before any authentication can be made</strong><span>. This makes sense, since you cannot begin to authenticate a request you still haven’t deserialized.</span></p><p><span>This allows </span><strong>any</strong><span> attacker to gain access to </span><strong>any</strong><span> piece of potentially-sensitive data. The only thing they need is internet access to the database.</span></p><p><span>Exposing your database to the internet is a practice that’s heavily frowned upon</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-182764771" href="https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply#footnote-8-182764771" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span>. At the same time, Shodan shows that there are over </span><a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Product%3A%22MongoDB%22" rel="">213,000 publicly-accessible Mongo databases</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The PR that introduced the bug was from </span><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/pull/1152" rel="">May 2017</a><span>. This means that, roughly from version 3.6.0, any publicly-accessible MongoDB instance has been vulnerable to this.</span></p><p>It is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.</p><p>As of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.</p><p><span>Sifting through Git history, it seems like the fix was initially committed on </span><a href="https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo/commits/505b660a14698bd2b5233bd94da3917b585c5728" rel="">the 17th of December</a><span>. It was merged a full 5 days after in the public repo - </span><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/505b660a14698bd2b5233bd94da3917b585c5728#diff-e5f6e2daef81ce1c3c4e9f7d992bd6ff9946b3b4d98a601e4d9573e5ef0cb07dR77" rel="">on the 22nd of December</a><span> (1-line fix btw).</span></p><p><span>That beig said, MongoDB 8.0.17 containing the fix </span><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/8.0/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#8.0.17---dec-19--2025" rel="">was released on Dec 19</a><span>, consistent with the CVE publish data. While public JIRA activity shows that patches went out on </span><a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-115508" rel="">the 22nd of December</a><span>, </span><strong><span>I understand that Mongo </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46415553" rel="">develops in a private repository</a></strong><span> and only later syncs to the public one.</span></p><p><span>In any case - because there’s no official timeline posted, members of the community like me have to guess. As of writing, 10 days later in Dec 28, 2025, Mongo have </span><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog" rel="">still NOT properly addressed the issue publicly</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>They only issued </span><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/important-mongodb-patch-available/332977" rel="">a community disclosure</a><span> of the CVE </span><strong>a full five days</strong><span> after the publication of it. It is then, on the 24th of December, that they announced that all of their database instances in their cloud service Atlas were fully patched. Reading through </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1py2c0w/comment/nwfo9hn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="">online</a><span> </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46415560" rel="">anecdotes</a><span>, it seems like the service was patched days before the CVE was published.
