<p>Thanks for stopping by. If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;).</p>
<p>When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I’d been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I’ve found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at over 400 free, open-sourced books.</p>
<p>Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable.</p>

<p>Who says you can’t have privacy AND transparency??</p>
<p>I’m guessing that if you’re interested in R then you also like data ;).</p>
<p>Note that “unique” visits will be higher in Plausible than you’d find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that’s counted as 2 “uniques” whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users.</p>
<p>From now on, you can view the <strong><a href="https://plausible.io/bigbookofr.com?ref=BigBoofofR">LIVE site stats right here</a></strong>.</p>
