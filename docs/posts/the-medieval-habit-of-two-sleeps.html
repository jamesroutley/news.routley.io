The night-time wakefulness usually lasted from around 23:00 to about 01:00, depending on what time they went to bed.

After an initial week of observing their normal sleeping patterns, they were deprived of artificial illumination at night to shorten their hours of &#34;daylight&#34; – whether naturally or electrically generated – from the usual 16 hours to just 10. The rest of the time, they were confined to a bedroom with no lights or windows, and fully enveloped in its velvety blackness. They weren&#39;t allowed to play music or exercise – and were nudged towards resting and sleeping instead.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0bfysgg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Ekirch wonders if today people might remember fewer dreams than our ancestors did, because it&#39;s less common to wake up in the middle of the night (Credit: Alamy)"/><span>Alamy</span></p></section><section data-component="caption-block"><span>Ekirch wonders if today people might remember fewer dreams than our ancestors did, because it&#39;s less common to wake up in the middle of the night (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></span></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>At the start of the experiment, the men all had normal nocturnal habits – they slept in one continuous shift that lasted from the late evening until the morning.
