<p>This month marks the 20th anniversary of the effort that became the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287">Atom feed format</a>. It all began on June 16, 2003, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121030042604/http://intertwingly.net/blog/1472.html">blog post</a> from Apache Software Foundation contributor Sam Ruby asking for feedback about what constitutes a well-formed blog entry.</p>

<p>The development of <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS 2.0</a> had been an unplanned hopscotch from a small group at Netscape to a smaller one at UserLand Software, but Atom was a barn raising. Hundreds of software developers, web publishers and technologists gathered for a discussion in the abstract that led to a concrete effort to build a well-specified syndication format and associated <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5023">publishing API</a> that could become Internet standards. Work was done on a project wiki that grew to over 1,500 pages. Everything was up for a vote, including a plebiscite on choosing a name that ballooned into a four-month-long bikeshed discussion in which Pie, Echo, Wingnut, Feedcast, Phaistos and several dozen alternatives finally, mercifully, miraculously lost out to Atom.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080913062709/http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap">road map</a> of the Atom wiki lists the people, companies and projects that jumped at the chance to create a new format for feeds. XML specification co-author Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The time to write it all down and standardize it is not when you&#39;re first struggling to invent the technology. We now have aggregators and publishing systems and search engines and you-name-it, and I think the community collectively understands pretty well what you need, what you don&#39;t need, and what a good syntax looks like.</p>

<p>So, now&#39;s the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone whose only contribution to the project was voting on names, I think I was too quick to rule out Phaistos, a suggestion inspired by a clay disc produced by movable type before 1600 B.C. Comments on the wiki page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030923180702/http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/PhaistosNameDiscuss">proposing that monicker</a> offer a sample of the name wars:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MikeBlumenthal: Does one of the great mysteries of antiquity, a document which, after almost 100 years of trying, is still a mystery not only as to its meaning but even as to its purpose, and which stands as a paragon of impenetrability, really fit as a name for an interoperability format?</p>

<p>Jayseae: Actually, the current state of RSS is pretty much a mystery -- why should this project be any different? I like the association with publishing -- though I&#39;m not sure the pronunciation really flows. Perhaps it could be shortened somehow?</p>

<p>AsbjornUlsberg: Sorry, but I don&#39;t like it. We could just as gladly give the project any other Greek-sounding name, like Papadopolous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arising from all the chaos and debate, the Atom format became a beautifully specified IETF standard in 2005 edited by Mark Nottingham and Robert Sayre that&#39;s used today in millions of feeds. It is the most popular syndication format that&#39;s never argued about.</p>

<p>Everybody got that out of their system on the wiki.</p></div><p>No comments yet.</p></div>
