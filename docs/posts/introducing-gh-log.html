    <h1>Introducing gh-log</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><span> <time datetime="2025-03-23">March 23, 2025 </time> </span></header><p>This weekend I finished and released a small tool I’ve been wanting to write for a few months. It is called <a href="https://github.com/jake-low/gh-log" rel="external"><code>gh-log</code></a> and it is a plugin for GitHub’s <code>gh</code> CLI tool. The plugin adds a <code>gh log</code> subcommand which is sort of like <code>git log</code> but for actions you take on GitHub, such as creating or closing issues, reviewing or merging PRs, pushing branches and tags, etc.</p><p>When you run <code>gh log</code>, it prints out a summary of what you did on GitHub over the past 7 days, in chronological order. You can specify a different time frame using the <code>--since</code> option. Here’s an example of the output.</p><pre id="example"><code>λ <span>gh log </span>--since <span>&#39;3 days ago&#39;

</pre><p>I wrote this tool to help me remember what I did last week. I like to review what I’ve been working on from time to time—it helps me spend my time wisely and follow up on things that I might otherwise forget about. I keep a work journal to help me with this too, but I don’t always add every last thing to it, and some days I forget to update it at all. Seeing the actions I’ve taken on GitHub helps jog my memory and fill in gaps I may have left in my notes.</p><p>This is also the first program I’ve written in Go. Go, being a popular and very successful language, is something that a lot of programmers have strong and diverging opinions on. I had read a bunch of these opinions before ever touching Go, so I admit that I went in with some preconceptions about the language’s strengths and weaknesses. My experience so far mostly matched my expections, but it was nice to get some hands-on experience and start forming my own opinions about Go.</p><p>Anyway, if you want to try out <code>gh-log</code>, you can install it by running:</p><pre aria-label="code"><code>gh extension install jake-low/gh-log
</code></pre><p>Please let me know if you do, and feel free to open an issue if you run into any problems.</p></article> </div></div>
