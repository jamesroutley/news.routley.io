    <h1>X changes its terms to bar training of AI models using its content</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Social network X has changed its developer agreement to prevent third parties from using the platform’s content to train large language models.</p>

<p>In an update on Wednesday, the company added a line under “Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions,” a subsection of restrictions on use: “You shall not and you shall not attempt to (or allow others to) […] use the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model,” it reads. </p>







<p>This change comes after Elon Musk’s AI company xAI acquired X in March — understandably, xAI wouldn’t want to give its competitors free access to the social platform’s data without a sale agreement.</p>

<p>In 2023, X changed its privacy policy to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/xs-privacy-policy-confirms-it-will-use-public-data-to-train-ai-models/">use public data on its site to train AI models</a>. Last October, it made further changes to allow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/elon-musks-x-is-changing-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-on-your-posts/">third parties to train their models</a>. </p>

<p>Reddit has also put in place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/reddits-upcoming-changes-attempt-to-safeguard-the-platform-against-ai-crawlers/">safeguards against AI crawlers</a>, and last month, The Browser Company added <a href="https://www.diabrowser.com/termsofuse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a similar clause</a> to its AI-focused browser Dia’s terms of use.</p>
