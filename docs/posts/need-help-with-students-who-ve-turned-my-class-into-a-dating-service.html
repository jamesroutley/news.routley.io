<p>Here are few suggestions. These will not resolve the problem completely (I think, nothing can), but might help to alleviate it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Auditors.</strong> These might be registered or unregistered.</li>
</ol>
<p>(i) <strong>Unregistered</strong>. The unregistered ones are easier to deal with (although, time-consuming). On the first day of classes, or whenever you are ready for this, bring a printout of the list of all registered (for this class) students. A day or two before the lecture send a general announcement to the class, asking everybody to bring their student Id&#39;s to the class. Then, on the day of the lecture you ask <strong>all</strong> present students one-by-one to identify their name, check it against the roster and if needed, ask for their Id&#39;s to confirm. This way you will find who (if anybody) is unregistered and ask them to leave and not to attend the class unless they register. If they refuse, call the campus police.
If some of them leave but come back to the next lecture (you will probably recognize such students), ask them to leave again.</p>
<p>(ii)  <strong>Registered</strong>. Find out the exact campus policy regarding auditors: You can probably find it online; if it is not available, ask registrar&#39;s office or whatever office deals  with registration for classes. The auditor policies vary widely. Here is just a small sample:</p>
<p>UCLA: No fee is required for auditing, but instructor&#39;s consent is required.</p>
<p>UGA: Full registration fee, instructor&#39;s consent is not required.</p>
<p>Harvard: $500 registration fee for a course, but instructor&#39;s consent is required.</p>
<p>Princeton: $200 registration fee for a course, instructor&#39;s consent is not required.</p>
<p>After finding out the precise policy you may find out that instructor&#39;s consent is required, just your department for some reason is not following the policy and, maybe a secretary, is dealing with the issue. In the case when
instructor&#39;s consent is required, make sure that the official policy is followed and then introduce a strict &#34;no-auditing&#34; system for your class. Even if it turns out (as in Princeton) that the fee is small but  instructor&#39;s consent is not required, go and discuss the issue with an appropriate campus entity (like registrar&#39;s office) if you can petition them, as an exception to allow you to control who is auditing the class. As an explanation, my suggestion is to stick to educational issues and argue that too many upperclassmen are auditing the class, which disrupts the education of the freshmen students (or something along these lines) - try to avoid discussing diversity-related issues  since you already know how it will be perceived. Since the money involved is relatively small, maybe your petition will be granted.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Registered students, taking the class for a credit.</strong> These are the most difficult ones to handle. On the first day of classes (or whenever you are ready), run a quiz asking students their name, seniority status, major, why are they taking the class and what do they hope to get from it. I think, there is a good chance that upperclassmen will identify themselves honestly. (You can also double check the information through official channels. I know, I can do this with my classes.) Now, you have several options.</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) After collecting this information, you can send individual emails to the upperclassmen students, asking them to meet you, as a group, in a (reserved in advance) classroom. Then explain to them, possibly appealing to their answers to the quiz, that it seems that they are overqualified for this class. And since you care deeply about their education, you will be giving them special assignments to work on during lectures and labs so that they do not waste their precious time on the material that they already know, and tell them that they are so well-prepared that the assignments should be quite easy. Each assignment is worth zero points, but you will still collect these at the end of the class. Make the assignments sufficiently hard so that the students will spend most of their time in class working on these assignments instead of staring at the girls or showing off.</p>
<p>If students complain that this is unfair, you will also give individually tailored assignments (still worth 0 points) to the rest of the students as well, explaining that the assignments are designed to reflect the level of preparedness of students for the class.</p>
<p>Now, what is intensive the upperclassmen have to hand in their assignments if they are worth 0 points? This is because they are in the class to show off! Failing to hand-in something reasonable will undermine their credibility.</p>
<p>(b) You identify the enrolled upperclassmen visually (your university probably has a database of student pictures (mine does), if not, take pictures of their student Ids on the first day of classes. Also, have a list of upperclassmen ready during lectures/labs. I know that in the US &#34;cold calling&#34; students during the class is usually not done, but you are in a special situation. So, during each lecture/lab you would cold-call some of the upperclassmen and ask them hard questions (still based on the class material). In order to preserve fairness, you also call some of the freshmen, asking easier questions. Being unable to answer, would hurt students egos and will reduce their incentive to take your classes. And, also, the word would get out that you are a harsh instructor, but the effect will be similar.</p>
<p>The drawback of (a) and (b) is that these are  likely to reduce your teaching evaluation averages. But think if it&#39;s worth it.</p>
