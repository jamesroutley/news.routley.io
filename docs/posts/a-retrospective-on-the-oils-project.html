</p>

<p>Every time I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">released Oils</a> in the last year, I&#39;ve said I would write a project <strong>retrospective</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers have been interested, but I usually want to get back to coding and design after an announcement.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s one way of looking at the project.  The <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/gc.html">last few posts</a> were mostly positive, so let&#39;s now be <strong>critical</strong>!</p>

 
<a name="background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I published an overview of the project a few days ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/project-overview.html"><strong>What Oils Looks Like in 2024</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ll start by summarizing the last major reflection on the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/12/backlog-project.html">Backlog: Explaining the Oils Project</a> (December 2021)</li>
</ul>
<a name="summary-of-2021-retrospective"></a>
<h3>Summary of 2021 Retrospective</h3>
<p>I mentioned that Oils is a <strong>bunch of experiments that kept working</strong>.  Some of them took <strong>two</strong> tries, like <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=j8-notation#j8-notation">J8 Notation</a>, but they eventually worked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, here are 2021&#39;s <strong>wrong turns and regrets</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translating <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> to <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> didn&#39;t work, technically.
<ul>
<li>It was overly focused on syntax, rather than semantics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The &#34;OPy&#34; bytecode compiler would never be fast enough.
<ul>
<li>It was more like a learning exercise, and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> has replaced it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I thought about <strong>bootstrapping</strong> too much, e.g. a &#34;Tea dialect&#34; to write Oils in
<ul>
<li>We&#39;ll continue to use Python-based DSLs, and generate C++ from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(I confess I&#39;m still thinking about bootstrapping, like exposing a well-defined IR for <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> to users.  This is the &#34;Yaks&#34; experiment, mentioned in the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/project-overview.html">project overview</a>.)</p>


<a name="why-is-oils-taking-a-long-time"></a>
<h2>Why is Oils Taking a Long Time?</h2>
<p>Taking into account what I wrote in 2021, let&#39;s make a fresh assessment.  I have <strong>nine</strong> points to make, which fall in these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>The goals are inherently hard</li>
<li>Technical reasons</li>
<li>Social reasons</li>
</ol>
<a name="its-inherently-hard"></a>
<h2>It&#39;s Inherently Hard</h2>
<a name="were-still-on-the-bell-labs-timeline"></a>
<h3>We&#39;re Still on the &#34;Bell Labs Timeline&#34;</h3>
<p>This is a way of saying that Unix and C were created in the early 1970&#39;s by Thompson and Ritchie, at Bell Labs, and</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s an unbroken line from <strong>Unix to Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Linux runs the cloud, many embedded devices, and many PCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There&#39;s an unbroken line from <strong>C to C++</strong>
<ul>
<li>All OS kernels are written in C or C++, and many of the largest applications are too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There&#39;s an unbroken line from <strong>Thompson&#39;s shell to <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>Shell was the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages?src_trk=em6690b43a717440.491810831822941226">6th fastest growing language on Github in 2022</a>.  I frame this as a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39925798">mathematical problem, with respect to software growth</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to the extent that we want to get off the &#34;Bell Labs timeline&#34;, we <strong>don&#39;t know</strong> how to do it!</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is why Oils has the unusual structure of both <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> — two shell languages that share the same runtime.  We want to provide a <strong>smooth</strong>, gradual upgrade path — ideally without language wars.</p>
<p>Some readers have suggested: Why not just work on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>, and de-emphasize <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>?  A couple answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>We sort of did that, in that our <a href="https://nlnet.nl">NLnet</a> grants were focused on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>.  But contributors were also excited
about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> too!</li>
<li>Many users are interested in <strong>only</strong> <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>, in addition to users interested in <strong>only</strong> <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>.
<ul>
<li>This is good!  There are multiple ways to use Oils.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ll return to the ideas of compatibility and a gradual upgrade path later.  Slogans:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you want a different result, you have to do something different</em>.</li>
<li><em>Is <a href="https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront">Cpp2</a> what C++ could have been, or what Rust could have been?</em>
<ul>
<li>Both clean slate, and compatible?  A subset of a superset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<a name="bash-is-big"></a>
<h3>Bash is Big</h3>
<p>This is the most <strong>predictable</strong> reason.  The <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/10.html">first post</a> in 2016 underestimated the size of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that my shell is closer to the bash language than the POSIX shell subset ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have 44 K lines of code in <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>, so <strong>10 K</strong> lines was not close!</p>
<p>Of course I can be wrong again, but with more experience, I expect there to be a &#34;long tail&#34; of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> convergence, especially now that <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> is &#34;figured out&#34;.  This may be 5-10K more lines over a few years.  Though it depends on how many people help.</p>
<p>For some color:</p>
<ul>
<li>It took <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">until 2018</a> to run non-trivial shell scripts.</li>
<li>It took another full year, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/02/05.html">until 2019</a>, to run interactive parts like shell completion.
<ul>
<li>I consider this <strong>another</strong> language that <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> has, which many shells don&#39;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/12/extended-glob.html">Appendix: The Journey of Extended Globs</a> (2021) may give a sense of the many corners of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.</li>
<li>In 2024, there are still gaps, like the <code>bind</code> builtin.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need more testing and demos to show off what <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> can do.  Samuel and Aidan have done great work in this area recently.</p>
<hr/>
<p>All in all, it&#39;s not too surprising that I underestimated <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Projects have to start with optimism!</p>
<p>Note that the project has &#34;oscillated&#34; between <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> over the years.  When I get bored of working on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>, I work on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>, and vice versa.  There&#39;s more parallelism now, but I&#39;d like even more.</p>

<a name="oils-is-bigger"></a>
<h3>Oils is Bigger</h3>
<p>The slogan I use is: <em>Three Languages Takes More Effort Than One</em></p>

<p>That is, GNU <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is big, and it corresponds to <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>.  But <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> is just <strong>one</strong> part of the project!</p>
<p>In particular, I didn&#39;t realize that <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> was its own language!  It has its own <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/01/garbage-collector.html">garbage collector</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an analogy I made in the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/why-a-new-shell.html#more-ways-to-understand-oil">project FAQ</a>:</p>
<p>bash : OSH :: GCC : Clang</p>
<p>That is, Clang is a modern re-implementation of GCC, and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> is a modern re-implementation of POSIX shell and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use a table to extend the analogy to <strong>three</strong> languages:</p>
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
   <td>Shell / Oils</td>
   <td>Native Code World</td>
   <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
</thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>bash</td>
   <td>GCC</td>
   <td>De-facto Standard</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>OSH</td>
   <td>Clang</td>
   <td>Compatible, modern re-implementation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>mycpp</td>
   <td>LLVM</td>
   <td>Common Infrastructure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>YSH</td>
   <td>Swift or Rust or Cpp2</td>
   <td>New Language, reusing the infrastructure</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>And let&#39;s call each part of the shell world <strong>10x smaller</strong> than its counterpart.  (bash is ~142K lines; I think GCC is 1M - 2M lines.)</p>
<p>Even taking into account, Oils is still a <strong>huge</strong> project!  There was less overlap between the parts than I expected, and it takes work make everything fit together.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And that&#39;s not all.  Recall that the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/project-overview.html">project overview</a> showed <strong>13</strong> parts of the project, not just <strong>3</strong> languages!</p>
<a name="technical-reasons"></a>
<h2>Technical Reasons</h2>
<p>I gave 3 reasons why Oils is difficult <strong>by design</strong>, mostly due to &#34;getting off the Bells Labs timeline&#34;.  Here are some <strong>technical</strong> reasons that it&#39;s taking a long time.</p>
<a name="short-code-takes-more-effort-to-write-than-long-code"></a>
<h3>Short Code Takes More Effort to Write Than Long Code</h3>
<p>There&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">well-known quote</a> from mathematician Blaise Pascal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After writing <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/">many blog posts</a>, I feel this viscerally.  The short ones take more time and effort to write.
I start out with something long, <strong>learn</strong> what I&#39;m writing about through many revisions, and write it again.</p>

<hr/>
<p>It also applies to <strong>code</strong>, which is what our <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/03/middle-out.html">middle-out style</a> is all about.  Short code takes longer to write.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m glad we made this tradeoff, because: <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/line-counts.html">After 8 Years, Oils Is Still Small and Flexible</a>.  This paves the way for many more features, like coprocesses and <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=r-language#r-language">R-like</a> libraries.</p>
<p>That is, we can do whatever we want with the codebase.  (I still want to write <em>Comments On Writing Software Over Time</em>, which argues that this isn&#39;t the case for most software.)</p>
<a name="speed-is-hard-and-c-is-fast"></a>
<h3>Speed is Hard, and C is Fast</h3>
<p>That&#39;s the slogan I use for <strong>underestimating</strong> the problem of speed.  As background, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> does two important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It &#34;erases&#34; Python&#39;s bytecode interpreter, by translating Python to <strong>C++</strong></li>
<li>It &#34;erases&#34; dynamic dispatch on <code>PyObject*</code>, by using <strong>static types</strong>, via <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mypy#mypy">MyPy</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Those are both good things, but I also learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idiomatic Python is like idiomatic Lisp: it <strong>allocates</strong> a lot.
<ul>
<li>Funny thing: we use C++ tools to analyze allocations in our Python source code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Writing a <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/01/garbage-collector.html">garbage collector</a> is hard.
<ul>
<li>This was the part of the project with the most <strong>false starts</strong>.  Fortunately, after a big transformation of the project with <a href="https://nlnet.nl">NLnet</a> funding, it&#39;s now in good shape!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>Related issue: when designing the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=LST#LST">lossless syntax tree</a>, I didn&#39;t know what the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> runtime would look like.  We took a &#34;pure computer science&#34; approach of just designing the &#34;right&#34; logical data structure.</p>
<p>But some decisions are helped by knowledge of data layout, which in turn depends on the type system.  For example, Aidan and I removed the &#34;span ID&#34; concept from the codebase, so we now have a single 24-byte <code>Token</code> object, with an 8-byte GC header.</p>
<p>It would have saved time to start with the latter design, but unfortunately there&#39;s no other GC runtime we could have started with.</p>

<a name="the-shell-runtime-is-complex"></a>
<h3>The Shell Runtime is Complex</h3>
<p>I had also proposed: <em>If you can figure out how to parse shell, you can write a shell.</em></p>
<p>This turned out to be <strong>false</strong>.  Leaving aside GC, there are several more challenges.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.23.0/">Oils 0.23.0</a> was delayed because I was wrestling with bugs in <code>trap</code>, which involve Unix signals and <code>fork()</code> optimizations.</p>
<p>Shells do different <code>fork()</code> optimizations, and this behavior doesn&#39;t appear to be documented anywhere.  It&#39;s not OK to do <strong>zero</strong> optimizations, but doing too many causes bugs.  Recent versions of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> are still fixing bugs in this area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/hru0ib/how_lose_control_your_shell#c_dfluhm">long comment about the Zed/zsh bug</a>, which I mentioned in the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/03/release-0.21.0.html">announcement with the &#34;Starship bug&#34;</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="social-reasons"></a>
<h2>Social Reasons</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve seen 3 reasons the project is inherently difficult, and 3 technical reasons that it&#39;s taken a long time.  Now let&#39;s look at <strong>social</strong> reasons.</p>
<a name="small-pool-of-contributors"></a>
<h3>Small Pool of Contributors?</h3>
<p>Compared to say Clang users and Clang contributors, there may be less overlap between shell <strong>users</strong> and shell <strong>contributors</strong>.</p>
<p>Because a shell is not written in shell!  In contrast, Clang is written C++, and the Rust compiler is written in Rust.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is really an issue, but a few people on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zulip#zulip">Zulip</a> agreed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Historically, it&#39;s also true that <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> has had few contributors, compared with other GNU projects.</p>
<p>(Aside: <a href="https://akinomyoga.github.io/">Koiche Murase</a>, author of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ble.sh#ble.sh">ble.sh</a>, has contributed to both <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and Oils.  Koiche might also disagree that shells aren&#39;t written in shell :-) )</p>
<a name="disincentives-for-software-interoperability"></a>
<h3>Disincentives for Software Interoperability</h3>
<p>I was going to write that <em>Nobody makes money from software interoperability</em>.  This is one reason it&#39;s hard to find people to work on Oils.</p>
<p>But I realized it&#39;s <strong>worse</strong> than that.  From word processors to chat apps, it&#39;s clear that interoperability can mean <em>losing</em> money!</p>
<p>That is, interoperability is not just neutral — there&#39;s a <strong>disincentive</strong> for it.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s why I like Unix.  Interoperability and composition let you build smaller systems more quickly.</p>
<p>Unix was unfortunately an <strong>anomaly</strong>: it was created by a telephone monopoly that was <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/unix-and-adversarial-interoperability-one-weird-antitrust-trick-defined-computing">banned from competing</a> in the computer industry.  That is, they simply did not have the disincentive!</p>


<p>As another example of incentives, let&#39;s refer to this video from Van Jacobsen, which I linked in <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/02/diagrams.html">The Internet Was Designed With a Narrow Waist</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69p78tfm29o">Watching NDN&#39;s Waist</a> (2019)</li>
</ul>
<p>He describes the <strong>pre-Internet</strong> networking situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were a lot of vendor protocols</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The intent of the protocols was to make them all different and unique and to suck in your customers and make sure that they couldn&#39;t leave you for some other vendor</p>
<p>That&#39;s not the world&#39;s greatest architectural principle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the Internet&#39;s design was another anomaly or <strong>outlier</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a good time to thank <a href="https://nlnet.nl">NLnet</a>, which has funded <strong>many</strong> outlier projects, including Oils!</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: Why are <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html">CGI and FastCGI rotting</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Counterpoint</strong>: Why does Linux have <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members">corporate sponsors</a>?  One reason is that many hardware vendors want to <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/">commoditize their complement</a>.  The natural complement to hardware is an operating system.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that logic doesn&#39;t extend to either GNU <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>, which has historically had few resources, or the Oils project.</p>

<a name="oils-was-a-personal-research-project"></a>
<h3>Oils Was a Personal Research Project</h3>
<p>On the other hand, this dynamic creates some <strong>space</strong> that I enjoy :-)  It&#39;s a breath of fresh air, and a <strong>privilege</strong>, not to worry about money when writing software.</p>
<p>When I started the project, there were a bunch of things I wanted to figure out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can we <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">statically parse</a> shell?
<ul>
<li>Yes, with some notable exceptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can we use Python as a metaprogramming language for C++?  Can we write an executable <strong>spec</strong> for shell in Python-based DSLs?
<ul>
<li>This is the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/03/middle-out.html">middle-out style</a>.</li>
<li>Will the resulting code be smaller?  <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/line-counts.html">Yes</a>.</li>
<li>Will it be fast enough?   Yes, but I underestimated the effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can we design a nice language with an upgrade path from <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>?</li>
<li>Can we teach <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> to people who don&#39;t know any shell?
<ul>
<li>That is, does it <strong>stand alone</strong> as a clean-slate shell design, without legacy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the last point, I&#39;m happy that several people have been able to write <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>, despite the fact it&#39;s still in progress, and the documentation is basic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/325160-oil-discuss-public/topic/Real.20YSH.20code.20in.20the.20wild.21">#oil-discuss-public &gt; Real YSH code in the wild!</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I like to ask big and <strong>naive</strong> questions, which means it&#39;s not that surprising that Oils took awhile.</p>

<a name="its-now-a-team-project"></a>
<h2>It&#39;s Now a Team Project</h2>
<p>I want to express my gratitude for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>That <a href="https://nlnet.nl">NLnet</a> has funded Oils, starting in 2022.  I definitely didn&#39;t envision this when starting the project, but it turned out to be <strong>necessary</strong>.</li>
<li>That other, skilled people actually wanted to work on Oils.  It could have been that nobody wanted to work on my personal research project!  They could be working on their own projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>And I should have planned on it being a team project.  Making <strong>three</strong> languages takes more effort than making one!  Speed is hard, and C is fast.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we now have a team.  I hesitate to single out specific people, since dozens of people have helped over the years, and I appreciate them all.  But let me thank these people in particular (in chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesse Hughes</li>
<li>Melvin Walls</li>
<li>Aidan Olsen</li>
<li>Samuel Hierholzer</li>
</ul>
<p>They got deep into the project, and deep into the codebase, in a way that we really needed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Remember that I credit contributors near the beginning of each release announcement, like <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/release-0.22.0.html">Oils 0.22.0 - Docs, Pretty Printing, Nix, and Zsh
</a>.</p>

<h3>Caveat: Design Bottlenecks</h3>
<p>But I still want to improve the project&#39;s structure.  I&#39;ve been &#34;heads down&#34; in coding and design, and there are design issues <strong>bottlenecked</strong> on me, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/384942-language-design/topic/Hay.20Overhaul.202024">#language-design &gt; Hay Overhaul 2024</a> - Several people have tried Hay, given feedback, and are excited about it.  But I haven&#39;t been able to address it for at least <strong>a year</strong> now.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the one hand, you could argue that I&#39;m &#34;controlling&#34;, and not delegating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&#39;s a rational reason for this.  I say that programming languages are a <strong>special</strong> piece of software.  They&#39;re inherently tightly-coupled: a change in one part affects many other parts.</p>
<p>For example, adding structured data affected <code>for while if case</code>, &#34;functions&#34;, garbage collection, serialization, pretty printing, and more.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an O(n<sup>2</sup>) or worse design problem, where N is the number of features.</p>

<p>If language design is &#34;parallelized&#34; too much, you often get a <strong>bad result</strong>.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The preprocessor bolted onto C, which still exists in C++.  (People have been trying to get rid of it for decades.)</li>
<li>Macros and async in Rust (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/vp7jca/pin#c_aoar7u">lobste.rs comments</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#34;Bolted on&#34; designs allow parallelism.  They may be inevitable in big languages, but remember that shell is perhaps <strong>10x</strong> smaller than C++.  So why not lean toward idealism?</p>

<p>The next post will elaborate on this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language design is a curious mixture of grand ideas and fiddly details</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don&#39;t claim to have it all figured out.  I&#39;d like more feedback from existing contributors!</p>
<a name="help-wanted"></a>
<h3>Help Wanted</h3>
<p>I post many tasks that are <strong>not</strong> bottlenecked on <a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/417617-help-wanted/topic/kill.20builtin.20-.20initial.20implementation.20.2F.20spec.20tests">#help-wanted</a> on Zulip!</p>
<p>Please ask questions about them!  Remember that I like to ask big and naive questions too :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page is also useful</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I also mentioned a &#34;catbrain&#34; language design experiment in the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/project-overview.html">project overview</a>.  If you want to write quick prototypes toward</p>
<pre><code>A { Forth, Tcl, Lisp } that can express
  { Shell, Awk, Make, find, xargs } and
  { Python, node.js event loop, R data frames } and
  { YAML, Dockerfiles, HTML Templates } and
  { JSON, TSV, S-expressions, ... }
</code></pre>
<p>then <a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266575-blog-ideas/topic/Retrospective.20on.20Translating.20Oils.20to.20C.2B.2B">let me know</a>!  Concrete ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for pipelines, which are a special case in shell!</li>
<li>Port ~600 lines of Python to the language you like best (that supports <code>fork()</code> and the like)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m just &#34;teasing&#34; this for now, and will publish a repo in the near future.</p>


<a name="the-main-message"></a>
<h2>The Main Message</h2>
<p>This post was a bit <strong>critical</strong> of the project.  The rest of the series explains what we got right, and where the project is in 2024:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/project-overview.html">What Oils Looks Like in 2024</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/line-counts.html">After 8 Years, Oils Is Still Small and Flexible</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/09/gc.html">Garbage Collection Makes YSH Different</a></li>
<li><strong>A Retrospective of the Oils Project</strong></li>
<li>Oils - Grand Ideas and Fiddly Details
<ul>
<li>less code from a systems perspective</li>
<li>language evolution over language wars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oils 0.23.0 - User Feedback, Bug Bounty, and Writing YSH Code
<ul>
<li>Likely the <strong>longest</strong> post ever, reflecting a huge release</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It feels like the &#34;high bits&#34; of the project are right:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> exists, and will become more and more compatible.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a> exists, and people are learning and writing it, <em>without me asking them to</em>!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> exists, so we can write code like a short <strong>spec</strong>.  But the shell is also <strong>fast</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And this opens up many other parts of the project, which I&#39;m excited about!</p>
<a name="whats-next"></a>
<h2>What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to write about the grants, since they caused a necessary transformation of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What Did We Accomplish With our NLnet Grants?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to building a team, we made Oils fast, and &#34;figured out&#34; <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>!  That means <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a> is free to be even more compatible, and work can be parallelized.</p>

<a name="appendix-more-viewpoints"></a>
<h2>Appendix: More Viewpoints</h2>
<p>I called this &#34;<strong>a</strong> retrospective&#34; because there are other viewpoints.  The following sections comment on more technical issues.</p>
<a name="c-type-system"></a>
<h4>C++ Type System</h4>
<p>I updated this thread for years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266575-blog-ideas/topic/Translation.20Bugs.20That.20Survived.20the.20Compiler">#blog-ideas &gt; Translation Bugs That Survived the Compiler</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And I summarized it in a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/wtk2rk/types_comparison_rust_zig#c_5lbiuf">lobste.rs comment</a>.  Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve never hit so many bugs caused by <code>signed char</code>, a choice borrowed from <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=cpython#cpython">CPython</a>.
<ul>
<li>Graydon Hoare mentioned this design issue in <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/218040.html">Things Rust Shipped Without</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A parent class and a derived class can have two different fields of the <strong>same name</strong>.</li>
<li>Throwing C++ exceptions in destructors is problematic.</li>
</ul>


<a name="garbage-collection"></a>
<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not just marking and sweeping that are slow, but <strong>rooting</strong> too.
<ul>
<li>Rooting = figuring out where to start tracing.  Rooting generally occurs <strong>all over</strong> the mutator, rather than in the collector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every GC is a <strong>snowflake</strong>.
<ul>
<li>There are many design dimensions and decisions, and you&#39;re even likely to hit unique problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A successful GC is likely turn into a 10+ year <strong>research</strong> project.  Performance is &#34;fractally&#34; hard.
<ul>
<li>We shouldn&#39;t have this problem because we don&#39;t aim to support large heaps (gigabytes).  You can <code>fork()</code> instead, and our GC is fork-friendly, unlike say <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=cpython#cpython">CPython</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GC engineering is a bit separate from compiler engineering.
<ul>
<li>Some people know more about compilers, and some people know more about runtimes.  I didn&#39;t know about either before starting Oils!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/gpb0qh/garbage_collection_for_systems#c_rrypks">Related comment</a> on <em>Garbage Collection for Systems Programmers</em></p>
<a name="the-speed-of-c-rust-go-is-necessary-for-language-processors"></a>
<h4>The Speed of C++ / Rust / Go is Necessary for Language Processors</h4>
<p>As mentioned, I was a bit naive about this to start.  In other words, the TypeScript compiler is too slow because it&#39;s written in TypeScript.  TypeScript code runs on v8, which only sees JavaScript code.</p>
<p>It would be better if it were written in a language where static types speed up the code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35045520">HN comment</a> which I may elaborate on later.</li>
<li><a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/121540-oil-discuss/topic/Examples.20of.20AST.20.2F.20Graph.20workloads">#oil-discuss &gt; Examples of AST / Graph workloads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This also applies to <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> itself, which is a bit slow to analyze our code.  But it doesn&#39;t apply to Oils, because it <strong>uses</strong> <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a>!</p>
