During periods of low production, the weight is released and used to power a turbine as it drops.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Disused mines have the potential to store vast amounts of electricity using gravity batteries</p><p> (iStock/ Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The gravity battery system has been developed by Scottish firm Gravitricity, which plans to use the Finnish mine as a full-scale prototype to demonstrate the technology.</p><p>“This project will demonstrate at full scale how our technology can offer reliable long-life energy storage that can capture and store energy during periods of low demand and release it rapidly when required,” said Martin Wright, an executive chairman at Gravitricity.</p><p>“This full-scale project will provide a pathway to other commercial projects and allow our solution to be embedded into mine decommissioning activities, offering a potential future for mines approaching the end of their original service life.”</p><figure><figcaption><p>A schematic of how the Underground Gravity Energy Storage system would work</p><p> (IIASA)</p></figcaption></figure><p>A study last year by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) estimated that gravity <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/batteries">batteries</a> in abandoned underground mines could store up to 70TWh of energy – enough to meet global electricity demands.</p><p>The repurposed mines could also provide economic benefits to the communities that previously relied on the mine for their livelihoods.</p><p>The IIASA analysts noted that mines already have the basic infrastructure for such an endeavour, while also being connected to the power grid.</p><p>“This significantly reduces the cost and facilities for the implementation of Underground Gravity Energy Storage (UGES) plants,” the study noted.</p><p>The Pyhäsalmi Mine was decommissioned in 2022, with Graviticity claiming that 600 direct and indirect jobs were impacted. Other initiatives being explored for the site include a solar farm.</p><p>“As the world generates more electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources, there is a growing need for technologies which can capture and store energy during periods of low demand and release it rapidly when required” Gravitricity’s website states.</p><p>“We are developing innovative, long-life, underground technologies which store energy safely and deliver it on demand at a lower lifetime cost than current alternatives.”</p></div></div>
