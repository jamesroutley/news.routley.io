            <span>Abstract:</span>  This manuscript analyzes lunar lander soil erosion models and trajectory
models to calculate how much damage will occur to spacecraft orbiting in the
vicinity of the Moon. The soil erosion models have considerable uncertainty due
to gaps in our understanding of the basic physics. The results for ~40 t
landers show that the Lunar Orbital Gateway will be impacted by 1000s to
10,000s of particles per square meter but the particle sizes are very small and
the impact velocity is low so the damage will be slight. However, a spacecraft
in Low Lunar Orbit that happens to pass through the ejecta sheet will sustain
extensive damage with hundreds of millions of impacts per square meter:
although they are small, they are in the hypervelocity regime, and exposed
glass on the spacecraft will sustain spallation over 4% of its surface.
