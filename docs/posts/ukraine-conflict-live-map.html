<p>Hello! I was talking to some friends the other day about the types of
conference talks we enjoyed.</p>
<p>One category we came up with was “you know this thing that used to be super
hard? Turns out now it’s WAY EASIER and maybe you can do it now!“.</p>
<p>So I asked on Twitter about <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1494301227533967369?s=20&amp;t=M_RYvWzEOymZ--YjE9jvpQ">programming things that used to be hard and are now easy</a></p>
<p>Here are some of the answers I got. Not all of them are equally “easy”, but I
found reading the list really fun and it gave me some ideas for things to
learn. Maybe it’ll give you some ideas too.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSL certificates, with Let’s Encrypt</li>
<li>Concurrency, with async/await (in several languages)</li>
<li>Centering in CSS, with flexbox/grid</li>
<li>Building fast programs, with Go</li>
<li>Image recognition, with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/29/transfer-learning/">transfer learning</a> (someone pointed out that the joke in <a href="https://xkcd.com/1425/">this XKCD</a> doesn’t make sense anymore)</li>
<li>Building cross-platform GUIs, with Electron</li>
<li>VPNs, with Wireguard</li>
<li>Running your own code inside the Linux kernel, with eBPF</li>
<li>Cross-compilation (Go and Rust ship with cross-compilation support out of the box)</li>
<li>Configuring cloud infrastructure, with Terraform</li>
<li>Setting up a dev environment, with Docker</li>
<li>Sharing memory safely with threads, with Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that involve hosted services:</p>
<ul>
<li>CI/CD, with GitHub Actions/CircleCI/GitLab etc</li>
<li>Making useful websites by only writing frontend code, with a variety of “serverless” backend services</li>
<li>Training neural networks, with Colab</li>
<li>Deploying a website to a server, with Netlify/Heroku etc</li>
<li>Running a database, with hosted services like RDS</li>
<li>Realtime web applications, with Firebase</li>
<li>Image recognition, with hosted ML services like Teachable Machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I haven’t done myself but that sound cool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptography, with opinionated crypto primitives like libsodium</li>
<li>Live updates to web pages pushed by the web server, with LiveView/Hotwire</li>
<li>Embedded programming, with MicroPython</li>
<li>Building videogames, with Roblox / Unity</li>
<li>Writing code that runs on GPU in the browser (maybe with Unity?)</li>
<li>Building IDE tooling with LSP (the language server protocol)</li>
<li>Interactive theorem provers (not sure with what)</li>
<li>NLP, with HuggingFace</li>
<li>Parsing, with PEG or parser combinator libraries</li>
<li>ESP microcontrollers</li>
<li>Batch data processing, with Spark</li>
</ul>
<p>Language specific things people mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust, with non-lexical lifetimes</li>
<li>IE support for CSS/JS</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-else">what else?</h3>
<p>I’d love more examples of things that have become easier over the years.</p>
