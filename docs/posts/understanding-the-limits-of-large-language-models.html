<p><i>Reading level: No programming knowledge required, but trying ChatGPT first is advised.</i></p>

<p><a href="#TLDR">Want a TL;DR?</a></p>

<p>If you’ve been hiding under a rock, ChatGPT has been making headlines for helping students cheat their exams, breaking 100m users in 2 months, and for being about to putting software engineers out of a job. If you’ve tried it, you’ll know it’s quite a remarkable accomplishment and tool - but the more you experiment with it the deeper you realise the limitations lie.</p>

<p>Before we go through these limitations, I want to emphasise that this post will likely be obsolete even 6 months from now. The rate that ML capabilities have been improving in the last few years is astonishing and today’s limitations are going to be tomorrow’s research papers.</p>
