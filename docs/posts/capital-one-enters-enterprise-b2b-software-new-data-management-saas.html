The solution is designed to help businesses accelerate adoption of Snowflake, manage cloud costs, and automate critical governance processes.

<p dir="ltr">“Capital One was an early adopter of Snowflake, which enabled our more than 6,000 analysts to run millions of queries with no degradation in performance. Snowflake gave us the ability to scale instantly for nearly any workload, and as our access to data increased, we wanted to ensure we were managing costs in a well-governed way,” said Biba Helou, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Data Platforms at Capital One. “Since creating and launching Slingshot at Capital One, we’ve seen 27 percent cost savings over projected costs by dynamically rightsizing resources. Slingshot has allowed us to further scale our use of Snowflake, and we’re excited to help other companies harness the full power of the cloud to accelerate innovation for customers.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“As we enter into the defining decade of data, it’s clear that every organization needs to leverage insights to manage costs, identify new opportunities, and ultimately drive the bottom line. Capital One Slingshot makes it incredibly easy to identify these insights from across all our Snowflake accounts,” said Kaushik Patel, Senior Vice President, Business Operations, ThoughtSpot. “With Slingshot, we have the information we need to empower our teams to optimize usage and control costs in a seamless, scalable fashion.” </p>

 </li>
 <li dir="ltr">
