<p>Most people on the internet use the Chrome browser, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/27/america_ad_blocker/&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">most Americans are using ad blockers</a>. And even though advertising puts food on my table, I can’t blame them — <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419276/i-block-every-ad-on-youtube-and-im-not-ashamed.html">because I block ads, too</a>.</p>



<p>Google, as the world’s biggest advertising company, doesn’t appreciate that. That’s why recent policy changes in Chrome are going to impact one of the browser’s most popular ad blockers.</p>



<p>A change in Chrome’s extension support — <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">from the Manifest V2 framework to the newer V3</a> — is being billed as a way to make browser add-ons safer, more efficient, and compliant with modern APIs. But it’s also deprecating features that complex extensions reply upon.</p>



<p>One of those extensions is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">uBlock Origin</a>, an ad-blocking tool with over 30 million users according to its Chrome Web Store page (and presumably many more users across other browsers).</p>

		
			
			


<p>uBlock Origin still works as of this writing, but it will soon be automatically disabled by Chrome updates. Users will have the option to manually re-enable it for a little while, but that will disappear at some point in the near future. When that happens, uBlock Origin fans will need to find a different ad blocker… or a different web browser.</p>



<p>The maker of uBlock Origin is trying to weather this storm, and has already created a Manifest V3-compliant version of the tool called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">uBlock Origin Lite</a>. This one uses the same core ad-blocking filters, but lacks certain features like dynamic filters for blocking scriptlet injection.</p>



<p>uBO Lite is also less capable of getting around anti-ad-blocking systems, like the infamous Admiral ad-blocker-blocker. Google has given uBO Lite the “Featured” badge on the Chrome Web Store. </p>



<p>uBlock Origin’s developer Raymond Hill could simply replace the Chrome Web Store page with the new Lite version, but <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">according to an explainer post on GitHub</a>, he’s not interested:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I consider uBO Lite to be too different from uBO to be an automatic replacement. You will have to explicitly find a replacement to uBO according to what you expect from a content blocker. uBO Lite may or may not fulfill your expectations.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>uBlock Origin should continue to work fine on other browsers, including Firefox, Edge, Opera, and other Chromium-based browsers that support extensions, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2384494/i-finally-got-sick-of-chromes-bs-and-switched-to-vivaldi.html">my new browser bestie Vivaldi</a>.</p>



<p>Google’s move to Manifest V3 support doesn’t appear to be entirely driven by attempts to make ad blockers obsolete, but it seems likely that it helped prod decisions in this direction.</p>



<p>Google has had a lot of drama surrounding ads recently, like dropping a years-long initiative to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2406441/google-is-ditching-its-plan-to-replace-cookies-in-chrome.html">replace tracking cookies</a> and trying to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.techradar.com/pro/youtubes-server-side-ad-insertion-complicates-ad-blocking-efforts&amp;xcust=2-1-2423294-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html" rel="nofollow">force advertising past ad blockers on YouTube</a>.</p>
