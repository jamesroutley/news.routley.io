<p><SPAN size="+2">1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without 
  numbers is only an opinion.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. 
  This is why it&#39;s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are 
  wrong .</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations 
  is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point 
  in time.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless 
  in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">5. (Miller&#39;s Law) Three points determine a curve.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">6. (Mar&#39;s Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a 
  fat magic marker.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants 
  to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. 
  Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory 
  excuse for not starting the analysis.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure 
  to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw 
  everything out and start over.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">12. There is never a single right solution. There are always 
  multiple wrong ones, though.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">13. Design is based on requirements. There&#39;s no justification 
  for designing something one bit &#34;better&#34; than the requirements dictate.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">14. (Edison&#39;s Law) &#34;Better&#34; is the enemy of &#34;good&#34;.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">15. (Shea&#39;s Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily 
  at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have 
  a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to 
  believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present 
  their analysis <em>as</em> yours.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship 
  to the likelihood of its being correct.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">18. Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. 
  Too much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">19. The odds are greatly against you being immensely smarter 
  than everyone else in the field. If your analysis says your terminal velocity 
  is twice the speed of light, you may have invented warp drive, but the chances 
  are a lot better that you&#39;ve screwed up.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. 
  A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">21. (Larrabee&#39;s Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom 
  is crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">22. When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will 
  reach a maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of 
  fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">24. It&#39;s called a &#34;Work Breakdown Structure&#34; because 
  the Work remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce 
  some Structure on it.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">25. (Bowden&#39;s Law) Following a testing failure, it&#39;s always possible 
  to refine the analysis to show that you really had negative margins all along.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">26. (Montemerlo&#39;s Law) Don&#39;t do nuthin&#39; dumb.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">27. (Varsi&#39;s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">28. (Ranger&#39;s Law) There ain&#39;t no such thing as a free launch.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">29. (von Tiesenhausen&#39;s Law of Program Management) To get an 
  accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates 
  by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">30. (von Tiesenhausen&#39;s Law of Engineering Design) If you want 
  to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to 
  draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial 
  artist&#39;s concept.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">31. (Mo&#39;s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can&#39;t get to the 
  moon by climbing successively taller trees.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">32. (Atkin&#39;s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working 
  perfectly, the really important visitors don&#39;t show up.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">33. (Patton&#39;s Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently 
  executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">34. (Roosevelt&#39;s Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where 
  you are, with what you have.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">35. (de Saint-Exupery&#39;s Law of Design) A designer knows that 
  they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there 
  is nothing left to take away.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">36. Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which 
  is elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A <em>great</em> 
  engineer designs them to be effective. </SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">37. (Henshaw&#39;s Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing 
  clear lines of blame. </SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">38. Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the 
  systems engineering textbooks say.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">39. Any exploration program which &#34;just happens&#34; to include a new launch vehicle is, <em>de facto</em>, a launch vehicle program.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">39. (alternate formulation) The three keys to keeping a new human space program affordable
    and on schedule:</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">40. (McBryan&#39;s Law) You can&#39;t make it better until you make it work.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">41. There&#39;s never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there&#39;s always enough time to do it over.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">42. If there&#39;s not a flight program, there&#39;s no money.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">43. You really understand something the third time you see it (or the first time you teach it.)</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">44. (Lachance&#39;s Law) &#34;Plenty of time&#34; becomes &#34;not enough time&#34; in a very short time.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN size="+2">45. Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw 
  up the engineering, somebody dies (and there&#39;s no partial credit because <i>most</i> 
  of the analysis was right...)</SPAN></p>
<div><p><img src="https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/graphics/110920.MMR.png" alt="MMR"/></p></div>
<p><SPAN size="+1">*I&#39;ve been involved in spacecraft and space systems design and 
  development for my entire career, including teaching the senior-level capstone 
  spacecraft design course, for ten years at MIT and now at the University of 
  Maryland for more than three decades. These are some bits of wisdom that I have gleaned 
  during that time, some by picking up on the experience of others, but mostly 
  by screwing up myself. I originally wrote these up and handed them out to my 
  senior design class, as a strong hint on how best to survive my design experience. 
  Months later, I get a phone call from a friend in California complimenting me 
  on the Laws, which he saw on a &#34;joke-of-the-day&#34; listserve. Since 
  then, I&#39;m aware of half a dozen sites around the world that present various 
  editions of the Laws, and even one site which has converted them (without attribution, of course) to the Laws 
  of Certified Public Accounting. (Don&#39;t ask...) Anyone is welcome to link to 
  these, use them, post them, send me suggestions of additional laws, but I do 
maintain that <i>this</i> is the canonical set of Akin&#39;s Laws...</SPAN> <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
