    <h1>Knowing CSS is mastery to Front end Development</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>There are countless articles why developers should not focus on Frameworks too much and instead learn to understand the underlying languages. But I think rarely we can find good reasons except that Frameworks come and go. To me, the main reason is different: You won’t be a master at frontend development if you don’t understand underlying mechanisms of a language.</p>
<p>A usual stack today is React together with countless layers in between the language and the framework itself. CSS as styling method is not used natively but via JavaScript tools that translate it into native CSS. For JavaScript we nowadays write an opinionated Framework language mix using TypeScript which by itself is translated to native JavaScript in the end again. And while we all know the comfort of these tools and languages, there are many things that make it easier if you understand a browser’s ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debug JavaScript errors easier and also in foreign environments without a debugging browser extension installed</li>
<li>Debug CSS</li>
<li>Write custom CSS (and every project I’ve seen so far needs it somewhere)</li>
<li>Understand why errors occur that you may not find locally and only in client’s browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past years I had various situations where TypeScript developers (they called themselves) approached me and asked whether I could help them out with CSS. <strong>I expected to solve a complex problem</strong> but for me — knowing CSS very well — it was always a simple, straightforward solution or code snippet:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A multi-colored footer bar should not be an image, it’s a simple CSS background multi-step gradient</em> with one line of code. No need to scale an image, create an SVG, just CSS.  </li>
<li><em>Custom icons for an input field?</em> Welp, it’s not that easy for privacy reasons to add a pseudo-class here in certain cases. But there are many simple solutions and no need to include another bloated npm dependency that nobody understands what it does.  </li>
<li><em>Webfonts</em>: Dev: We can’t add another webfont style, we already serve 4MB of webfonts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays people can write great React and TypeScript code. Most of the time a component library like MUI, Tailwind and others are used for styling. However, nearly no one is able to judge whether the CSS in the codebase is good or far from optimal. It is magically applied by our toolchain into the HTML and we struggle to understand why the website is getting slower and slower.</p>
<p>Most of the performance basics I learned ten years ago are still the most relevant ones today. Yet, most developers don’t know about them because we use create-react-web-app or similar things. Put Cloudflare on top to boost performance and reduce costs. Yes, that works for your website and little project. </p>
<p><strong>What companies expect</strong> when they ask for a web dashboard serving real time data for their customers is different: It should be a robust, well working application that is easy to maintain. That means we need to combine the developer experience (React, TypeScript, all the little helpers) with the knowledge of how browsers and networks work. And only then we can boost performance, write accessible code, load dynamic data in a proper and safe way and provide fallbacks in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>In cases of emergency like an Incident with the service, I’ve seen the difference often enough</strong> between people who exactly know where to look at, start debugging and go further, and those who try to find out in panic what’s going on here, hoping that a restart or re-deployment with reinstalled dependencies will help bring the service back to life.</p>
<p><strong>And that means in the end again: If you know CSS, you also know the style framework. If you understand JavaScript, TypeScript is not a big problem for you. And that makes you a Senior or Principal.</strong></p>		</div></div>
