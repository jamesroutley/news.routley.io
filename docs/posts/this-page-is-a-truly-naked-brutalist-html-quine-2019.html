    <h1>This page is a truly naked, brutalist HTML quine (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>One of my favorite things is to misuse technology in creative ways. Breaking the rules without breaking the rules.</p>

<p>For example, a hobby project I built long ago was <a href="https://github.com/secretGeek/dod">DOS-on-dope</a>, a working Ruby-on-rails parody, billed as <em>the last batch-file based MVC framework you&#39;ll ever need</em>. And there was <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/console_log">a console.log() adventure</a> in which you played an old school console-adventure-game from inside the chrome developer tools.</p>

<p>The world of esoteric programming is filled with examples of people stretching the rules to breaking point, and misusing technology in creative ways. In particular (for example) I love <a href="http://wiki.secretgeek.net/quine">quines</a>. Quines are programs which output their own source code. Life is a Quine.</p>

<p>A different but somehow related topic I like is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalism</a>, in particular, this often overlooked aspect:</p>

<blockquote>Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building&#39;s functions.</blockquote>

<p>...the tendency to <strong>make the internal external</strong>, and reveal the secrets of the building, in a somehow.... <em>brutaful</em> way. ;-).</p>

<p>A similarly intriguing idea which has fallen into disuse is the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects</a>, wherein:</p>

<blockquote>The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects.</blockquote>

<p>Putting all this together I decided to make a truly naked, brutalist html page, that is itself a quine. And this page is it.</p>

<p>Viewing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretGeek/html_wysiwyg/master/html.html">the source</a> of this page should reveal a page identical to the page you are now seeing. Nothing is hidden. It&#39;s a true &#34;What you see is what you get.&#34;</p>

<h2>How it works.</h2>

<p>Did you know that the rules of html and css allow you to make <strong>every</strong> element visible, even elements like &#39;title&#39; or &#39;style&#39; or &#39;script&#39;, that are normally hidden from view? Those are just elements like any other. You can expose them <strong>all</strong> like so:</p>



<p>With that snippet of code (which is <strong>not</strong> a snippet of code, but an <strong>actual</strong> style block itself!) you can now see every element of this page, including that style block, the html and title tags, etc.</p>

<p>It does have one downside: every element on the page is now a &#34;block&#34; element, even some which should be &#34;inline&#34;, such as &#34;code&#34; and &#34;anchor&#34; elements. We can correct this like so:</p>



<p>To give the code a more &#39;view source&#39; feel, I&#39;ve also applied <code>monospace</code> fonts, and a generally simple and consistent style to all elements, using a &#34;*&#34; selector, like so:</p>



<p>So far I&#39;ve put style declarations all on one line, because ordinary html refuses to treat line breaks as &#34;br&#34; tags. But there is a way to make line-breaks display as line-breaks, and that is with this piece of styling:</p>



<h2>Make the internal external.</h2>

<p>The next trick is to make the internal external. We can start by ensuring that the tags themselves, such as paragraph tags, are exposed in their stark, brutal, beauty:</p>



<p>That works for &#34;p&#34; elements, but do we need to have custom styling for <strong>every</strong> element? If there was a way to output the &#34;name&#34; of a tag in html, then we could reduce all of the necessary style rules above to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
*::before {
 &#39;&lt;&#39; name() &#39;&gt;&#39;
}
</blockquote>

<p>And...

</p><blockquote>
*::after {
 &#39;&lt;\/&#39; name() &#39;&gt;&#39;
}
</blockquote>


<p>But alas there is no &#34;name()&#34; function (yet!). So we are forced to generate a chunk of style information like this (via <a href="https://nimbletext.com/Live/1105905186/">NimbleText</a> of course)</p>

<p>Please scroll happily past the next 28 offensively repetitive lines...</p>



<p>Some elements are a little trickier because they have attributes. Consider for example the &#34;anchor&#34; which often has a <code>href</code> attribute. We <em>need</em> that attribute to be visible, including its value. This is done like so:</p>



<p>The <code>attr()</code> function, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">mozilla docs</a> is a nifty trick, &#34;supported&#34; since CSS 2.</p>


<p>The only other style that is special is &#34;style&#34; itself, which has to include an escape character to avoid being taken literally.</p>







<p>Finally to reduce the visual weight of the before and after pseudo elements we can give them a soft purple color and a low weight font:</p>





<p>Finally, because I believe brutalist design, even when applied to truly naked brutal html quines, is about function, not about deliberate ugliness, I&#39;d like to apply these humble styles that improve the readability of this brutiful missive.</p>



<p>...they&#39;re derived from <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">&#34;58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere&#34;</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing. Although this idea has bounced around in my head for a decade, the thing that reminded me to pipe it into a file was seeing this piece of &#34;Code as Art&#34; from Geoff Huntley: <a href="https://noyaml.com/">no yaml</a>. Bring back the world weird web.</p>
