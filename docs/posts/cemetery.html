    <h1>Cemetery</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I found the episode of Search Engine <a href="https://podpage.searchengine.show/what-happens-when-a-cemetery-goes-out-of-business/">&#34;What happens when a cemetery goes out of business?&#34;</a> absolutely fascinating. Both a history of burial in the US, a comparison to other countries, and a look at the business of cemeteries.</p>
<p>This made me think a lot about where I wanted to be buried. I understand the idea of wanting to be remembered, and how that affects decisions about burial. I also understand the ecological and economic impacts of it all. This episode made me want to follow the British and make filled up cemeteries into parks. When I lived in London I lived next to a cemetery that had been turned into a park, and it was regularly frequented by folks who wanted to stop and have a quiet place to sit. There were still headstones and grave markers, but some had fallen down and been turned into paths and surface. It always seemed quiet and peaceful, and it was a nice way to remember the dead while also allowing the living to enjoy the space.</p>
<p>I think I would like to be buried in a park. A place where people can play and enjoy themselves, rather than isolated away.</p>
