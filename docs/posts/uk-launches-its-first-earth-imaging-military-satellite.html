    <h1>UK launches its first Earth-imaging military satellite</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>The UK has launched its first military satellite able to capture daytime images and videos of the Earth’s surface.</p><p>The satellite, named Tyche, will support British armed forces operations as well as monitor natural disasters, help map information development and track the impact of climate change globally, the Ministry of Defence said.</p><p>The washing machine-sized satellite, was designed and built in the UK under a £22m contract awarded to Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) and is the first to be fully owned by the MoD.</p><p>The first signals from Tyche were received a few hours after lift-off on Friday night, confirming the successful launch from Vandenberg space force base, in California, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the Transporter-11 mission.</p><figure id="536c038e-eb5e-42fe-97f9-2417954eff34" data-spacefinder-role="inline"

constellation of satellites under its space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programme.</p><p>Maria Eagle, the minister for defence procurement and industry, said: “Tyche will provide essential intelligence for military operations as well as supporting wider tasks across government.</p><p>“Tyche also shows the UK’s commitment to support innovation in science and technology, stimulating growth across the sector and supporting highly skilled jobs in the UK.”</p><p>The MoD said the design and build of Tyche had supported about 100 high-skilled roles at SSTL since 2022.</p><p>The commander of UK Space Command, Maj Gen Paul Tedman, thanked and congratulated everyone involved in the development of Tyche.</p><p>“This is a fabulous day for UK space,” he said. “The successful launch of Tyche has shown that UK Space Command, and its essential partners across defence and industry, can rapidly take a concept through to the delivery of a satellite capability on orbit.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling"

equipment and support space team leader, Paul Russell, described the project as an “exciting journey”.</p><p>He said: “To see Tyche, the first of a new generation of UK military capabilities, delivered into orbit is an incredibly proud moment and a tribute to everyone’s commitment to this key project.”</p></div></div></div>
