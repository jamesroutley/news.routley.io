    <h1>13 Months: The Kodak Calendar Experiment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>Can you imagine having an extra month between June and July?! In the “International Fixed Calendar,” that’s exactly what was proposed in the 1920s. The only organization to adopt this 28-day-a-month calendar was Kodak, who kept it up all the way until 1989! In this episode, we talk about the Kodak calendar and chat with Comedian Glen Tickle!</p>

<p>Imagine having an extra month between June and July. Sounds pretty great to me! In the International Fixed Calendar, that’s what would happen. 13 months. Extra month of summer. I’m here for it.</p>



<p>George Eastman founded the Eastman Kodak Company. He brought the idea of the roll of film to the masses and “Kodak Camera” became a household name. The company was started in 1892 and still exists today. It was a leading manufacturer of film, then of cameras, and today they still make chemicals and products to support the print film industry. And from 1928 to 1989 – for 61 years. They operated on their own calendar – the International Fixed Calendar.</p>



<p>Before the break I told you that the Eastman Kodak Company operated on the International Fixed Calendar. So where did George Eastman get the idea?</p>



<p>Cotsworth had figured this out and in 1907, formed the International Fixed Calendar League, an organization to gain support for the idea of a fixed calendar internationally. Here’s what his calendar looked like:</p>



<p>In the 1920s, the idea was being spread in publications around the world. Cotsworth placed articles explaining the benefits of the idea in newspapers and magazines. And he made a compelling case, arguing how his new calendar, the International Fixed Calendar, was better for business and better for simplifying the understanding of the dates of the year. He laid out all the reasons, with many newspapers publishing a graphic of what the calendar would look like.</p>



<p>Even the United State House of Representatives took up the matter when a Minnesota Legislator, Tom Schall, brought it to them in 1919. In their version of the International Calendar, however, the extra month was called “Vern” because of the Vernal Equinox. The idea never made it out of committee. By the way, can you imagine telling people your birthday is Vern 12th?</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the supporters of this radical idea, something like a calendar isn’t easy to change unless EVERYBODY changes. After all, if your business is on the new Fixed Calendar and ships a product to someone on the old Gregorian calendar, how do you tell them when it will get there? It forces you to convert the date any time you communicate with someone else, which then forces you to first find out which calendar they’re using. It’s similar to the headache of asking someone what time zone they’re in before you schedule a meeting.</p>



<p>These were serious issues for people, and were the reason that almost nobody adopted the calendar. It’s like when video tried to shift from VHS to Laserdisc. It’s cool, but now you have to have both players, because you already own your collection on VHS. Now you have to buy everything again. Compatibility is a serious concern.</p>



<p>Despite no one else adopting the calendar, George Eastman said “I’m doing it anyway,” and in 1928, adopted the International Fixed Calendar for the Eastman Kodak Company. And he continued advocating for the adoption of the calendar – even addressing the League of Nations, who twice took up the idea. In both instances, it was religious leaders who organized to put an end to the idea.</p>

<p>After the adjustment period, employees actually enjoyed the predictability of the calendar, which was just used internally at the company. Every employee had a pocket-sized calendar with them all the time. Every company boardroom had a large poster of the fixed calendar. And this system worked so well for the company, that they continued to use it for 61 years.</p>



<p>George Eastman’s health started to decline dramatically in 1930. He lived with constant pain in his spine and suffered from horrible depression because of the pain. He took his own life in 1932, but his company lived on – as did their fixed calendar, which they continued to use all the way until 1989. </p>



<p>So the Internet Says it’s True. The Kodak Company operated under their own 13 month calendar for 61 years. And – it could be argued that it’s a better calendar! But if that were a good reason to make a worldwide change, we’d probably be using the Metric system. </p>
