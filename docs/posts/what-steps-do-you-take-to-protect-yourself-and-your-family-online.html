    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>This week, I found out that someone opened a bank account in my name. I was able to block the account, but I am not receiving any help from the bank. They don&#39;t even have a phone number to let me talk to someone. Everything is done via email :(<p>What steps can I take, to protect myself online? By now, it is safe to assume that my SSN, address, employment info are in multiple databases somewhere. Given this scenario, any advice?</p></td></div></div>
