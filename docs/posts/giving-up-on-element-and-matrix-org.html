    <h1>Giving Up on Element and Matrix.org</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The <em>Matrix.org</em> network has great potential, but after years of dealing with
glitches, slow performance, poor UX, and one too many failures, I’m done with
it.</p><div><p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> After five years of using <em>Matrix.org</em>/<em>Element</em> as my primary
communication platform, and rooting for it, <strong>and</strong> promoting it, <strong>and</strong>
enduring its many quirks, I’ve decided to move on (or rather <em>back</em>). Despite
promising ideals and growing institutional adoption, the network remains slow,
unreliable, and confusing for everyday users. Development feels directionless,
client and server projects are fragmented, and the user experience still lags
far behind my expectations. A recent incident that essentially broke my own
community channel on the <em>Matrix.org</em> homeserver was the final straw: I’m
heading back to <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/contact/">XMPP</a>.</p><p>For the past few years, I’ve been trying to make <em>Matrix.org</em>, and with it the
<em>Element</em> client applications, my primary platform for communication. When
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix/">Mozilla announced its move to <em>Matrix</em> back in 2019</a>, it felt like
the ecosystem was finally taking off. A wave of third-party clients and
<em>Matrix.org</em>-based projects emerged, and I eagerly hopped on the bandwagon. I
gradually phased out my presence on <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/irc-server-as-tor-hidden-service-on-openbsd/">IRC</a> and <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/run-your-own-instant-messaging-service-on-freebsd/">XMPP</a>,
hopeful that this would be the next <em>Slack-</em> or <em>Discord-killer</em>.</p><p>Five years later I’m leaving the <em>Matrix.org</em> ecosystem with a bruised eye and
the bitter aftertaste of a future that never arrived. Let me explain.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I know the difference between <em>Matrix.org</em>, the foundation, and
<em>Element</em>, the product developed by <em>New Vector</em>, the company. However, in order
to tell the story for the casual reader, from a user perspective, I am
intentionally leaving out such details.</p><h2 id="early-days">Early days</h2><p><em>Matrix.org</em> began just over a decade ago as a federated messaging protocol. Its
primary goal was to make real-time communication seamless across different
providers, similar to how SMTP enables cross-provider email.</p><p><em>“Wait, isn’t that exactly what XMPP has done since forever?”</em>, you might ask.
And you’d be right. <em>Matrix.org</em> essentially reinvented the wheel, swapping out
XML for JSON and incorporating technologies like WebRTC and, at some point,
end-to-end encryption (E2EE) as <em>built-in</em> rather than an <em>extension</em>, although
from a practical standpoint it doesn’t make much difference as long as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/549">metadata is</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/660">still unencrypted</a>.</p><p>The project originated inside <em>Amdocs</em>, a software company founded by the <em>Aurec
Group</em> in Israel, which is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, USA today, and
employs over twenty-nine thousand people. <em>Amdocs</em> itself has an interesting
(read: <em>controversial</em>) history, with investigations by U.S. federal agencies
into alleged espionage. The history around <em>Amdocs</em> has been debated for a few
years now, with
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36022780"><em>Matrix people</em> (<em>“Agents”? *scnr*</em>) rebutting</a> the supposed
<em>conspiracy theories</em> every once in a while, but that’s a story for another
time.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/amdocs.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/amdocs_hu_fac7fa1cab6818ad.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>What matters here is that <em>Amdocs</em> funded most of <em>Matrix</em>’s development from
2014 until the end of 2017, under a subsidiary named <em>Vector Creations Limited</em>.
When that funding ended, the UK-based company <em>New Vector Limited</em> was formed to
continue development of the protocol and its main client, <em>Riot</em> (now known as
<em>Element</em>).</p><p>That’s when <em>Matrix.org</em> seemed to gain serious traction. The community rallied
to support the newly independent project. Organizations like
<a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-devel/2023-May/001837.html"><em>KDE</em></a>, companies such as <em>Purism</em> and <em>Status</em>, and even the
French government got involved. But while enthusiasm surged, the implementation
quality of core components remained mediocre at best.</p><p>The official <em>Matrix</em> homeserver, <em>Synapse</em>, was built with a tech stack
ill-suited for its long-term goals and scale. The protocol also implemented
features that drove overall complexity through the roof. Community projects like
<em>Dendrite</em> emerged to rewrite the homeserver more sensibly. Some efforts, like
<em>Conduit</em>, even received government funding to stabilize the foundation
<em>Matrix.org</em> was built on.</p><h2 id="use-matrix">Use Matrix!</h2><p>After Mozilla’s bold move, <em>New Vector</em> hit the accelerator and went <em>all gas no
brakes</em>. E2EE became the default for all private conversations. <em>Riot</em> was
rebranded as <em>Element</em>. Within two years, <em>New Vector</em> effectively took over
<em>Dendrite</em> as its official future homeserver implementation.</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Matrix.org</em> continued to attract interest, especially from European
governments eager to reduce their dependencies on U.S. tech giants. France’s
central administration adopted <em>Tchap</em>, a software based on <em>Matrix.org</em>,
Germany’s armed forces and healthcare institutions rolled out <em>Matrix</em>-based
tools, Luxembourg launched its <em>creatively</em> named <em>Luxchat4Gov</em>, and even
Sweden’s social insurance agency joined in.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/hype.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/hype_hu_8c2968993723e9c1.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>The sense that <em>Matrix.org</em> was <em>finally</em> taking off was further reinforced by
the rise of projects like <em>SchildiChat</em> and <em>FUTO Circles</em>, and by the
announcement of <em>Element X</em>, a new native client promising to eliminate the UX
and performance woes of the old <em>Electron</em>-based <em>Element</em> app. It all sounded
too good to be true.</p><p>Encouraged by <em>the hype</em>, I doubled down on my engagement with <em>Matrix</em>. I
launched an official community channel on <em>Matrix.org</em> for topics related to
this site and persuaded several friends to give the platform a try. Group chats,
DMs, community discussions: I wanted <em>Matrix</em> and <em>Element</em> to succeed. I wanted
to love the platform.</p><h2 id="fast-forward">Fast-forward</h2><p>Today, I’m writing this post to say that I’ve lost hope and patience.</p><p>After five years of using <em>Matrix</em> and <em>Element</em> as my main platform, I no
longer have the energy or desire to keep using it, much less convince others,
especially the people close to me, to do the same.</p><p>Despite all the perceived hype a few years ago, the basics of the platform
remain undercooked. <em>New Vector</em> seems to be chasing too many goals
simultaneously, with no clear direction. Just a few months ago, they migrated to
the <a href="https://element.io/blog/mas-migration-unleashes-element-x-on-matrix-org/"><em>Matrix</em> Authentication Service (MAS)</a>, which was supposed to be a
leap forward, yet lacks even essential security features like 2FA/MFA.
Meanwhile, the company appears to have begun <em>quietly phasing out</em> the classic
<em>Element</em> app in favor of <em>Element X</em>, even though it still misses crucial
features like threads and spaces, besides the less important things like
widgets, grouping by priority, and live location sharing.</p><p>Yes, <em>Element X</em> is faster than its Electron predecessor, but only relatively.
Compared to other popular communication apps like <em>Signal</em>, <em>Telegram X</em> or
<em>WhatsApp</em>, it’s still slow. Launching the app requires network synchronization
that hampers responsiveness. Especially on older devices (like my GrapheneOS
<a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/computer/#c4l1c0">tablet</a>) the whole UI feels sluggish in a way you’d usually only expect from
poorly built hybrid apps. On more modern flagship devices the experience isn’t
significantly better either.</p><p>The <em>Matrix.org</em> service, especially its <code>matrix.org</code> homeserver, is also slow,
especially on <em>thinner</em> broadband connections. On my <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/computer/#f0g6">laptop</a>, I’ve been using
<a href="https://github.com/ulyssa/iamb"><em>iamb</em></a>, a TUI <em>Matrix</em> client, and even there I experience delays of
tens of seconds when launching it, and a lag of several seconds between pressing
<em>Enter</em> and seeing the message actually appear in the chat room. And that’s
certainly not <em>iamb</em>’s fault, because <em>it’s written in Rust, btw™</em>. If
you’re accustomed to IRC, XMPP, or even bloated platforms like <em>Discord</em>, you’ll
likely find <em>Matrix</em> painful to work with in comparison.</p><p><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/element-experience.webm">This</a> had been my experience with the <em>Element</em>
web client, even these days. The video was not slowed down, it literally takes
almost 40 seconds for the web UI to just load, with the browser tab running on
100% of a CPU core and munching through plenty of RAM. Once loaded, using the
web UI isn’t much smoother either.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/loading.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/loading_hu_cef07a27de03e057.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>Over the years I’ve tried several times to find a way to <em>abstract</em> these
performance issues, e.g. by using <em>Matrix</em> via <em>Irssi</em>, the popular IRC client,
and a <em>Matrix-IRC-bouncer</em> software. However, each of these attempts fell short
of important features, most prominently the lack of E2EE between the bouncer and
<em>Matrix</em>, rendering the whole end-to-end-encryption promise that <em>Matrix</em> is
making useless.</p><p>Speaking of E2EE, <a href="https://element.io/features/device-verification">device cross-verification</a> is another thing that has
been haunting <em>Matrix</em>/<em>Element</em> users for years and has only gotten <em>less
broken</em> in the past year or so. The story goes like this: Whenever you log on
from a new device, you have to cross-verify the device using either a secret key
or, more comfortably, another device that has already been verified. Not only
has this feature been particularly complicated to implement for 3rd-party
clients, but even the official <em>Element</em> and <em>Element X</em> clients have struggled
to get it right up until recently. Verifications would either not start at all
or simply break in the middle of the process, requiring users to re-start the
process or ultimately give up and use their secret key.</p><p>With the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31137588">complexity of the underlying protocol</a> and its
encryption, the pace at which it evolved and the lack of proper first-party
libraries for 3rd-party developers to build on top of, it became visible that
the once-vibrant ecosystem, does no longer look so healthy. Development on
Synapse alternatives has stagnated. Even <em>Conduit</em>, despite its government
support, is largely dormant. <em>Dendrite</em> still isn’t production-ready for large
deployments. And while many community members self-host it, the project has yet
to prove it can scale robustly.</p><p>On the client side, things aren’t much better. The FUTO-funded
<a href="https://github.com/circles-project/circles-android"><em>Circles</em> client shut down in 2025</a>, with a quite telling reason.
Other clients like <em>SchildiChat</em> are faced with the dilemma of continuing their
existing work or starting over by forking <em>Element X</em>. Given the divergence in
tech stacks, adopting the newer <code>matrix-rust-sdk</code> seems inevitable, but costly.</p><p>Speaking of SDKs, <em>New Vector</em> appears to lack a coherent technology strategy.
They’ve built infrastructure in Python and Node.js/TypeScript, moved into Go for
the Synapse replacement, and now maintain a Rust-based client SDK, while
abandoning their Go client library
(<a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go">which is now community-maintained</a>). This fragmentation isn’t just
<a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/issues/262">messy</a>, but it’s expensive. Especially for an organization that appears
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/crossroads/">perpetually cash-strapped</a>. <em>New Vector</em>’s approach feels more like
indecisiveness than <em>the right tool for the right job</em> when looking through
their <a href="https://github.com/orgs/element-hq/repositories">repositories on GitHub</a>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As of writing, the official
<a href="https://github.com/element-hq/dendrite"><em>Element Dendrite</em> implementation</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/dendrite/blob/331a6f221b31e0de9ff427d0ed35e66149e35d9e/go.mod">Go libraries</a>
that haven’t been updated in months or years, with dependencies that are equally
stale.</p><h2 id="maybe-its-you">Maybe it’s you?</h2><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/me.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/me_hu_bd907d74ee06523d.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>It’s always worth asking <em>“Is it me?”</em>, before condemning something as <em>bad</em> or
<em>broken</em>. In search of other perspectives, I found mostly positive comments on
<code>/r/matrixdotorg</code> and similar sites, from people actively using
<em>Element</em>/<em>Matrix</em>, which, well, isn’t surprising. However, the deeper I dug,
the more I <a href="https://hanez.org/document/why-matrix-sucks/">stumbled</a> <a href="https://ersei.net/en/notes/matrix-sux">upon</a> <a href="https://blog.fyralabs.com/dropping-matrix/">blog-</a> and

observed and described, e.g.:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matrix was never good.</strong> Have you met a person who actually enjoyed using
Matrix? Because, I haven’t. This isn’t to say that Matrix isn’t more usable
than other open alternatives, but that’s a low bar. There’s a reason why
<em>“Unable to decrypt message”</em> is a common gag in the FOSS community. The
promise of what Matrix could become, plus, being already more accessible than
other open alternatives, was what kept me there. I’m willing to bet it’s the
same for many others. However, I’ve come to terms that these ambitions will
not be realized, at least in the current direction</p></blockquote><p>Yes, cartoon person with cat ears, that’s exactly what kept me on
<em>Matrix</em>/<em>Element</em> as well! I could go on for hours linking to posts that
criticize the platform’s functionality. And while this might be a case of
confirmation bias, it <em>feels</em> like there don’t seem to be as many <strong>dedicated
posts</strong> praising how <a href="https://www.superbestaudiofriends.org/index.php?threads/matrix-element-x-impressions.8856/">great <em>Matrix Element X</em> is</a> as there are write-ups
of people going into great length to describe their negative experiences with
the platform. Then again, the confusing naming (<em>“SEO”</em>) makes it difficult to
find things in the first place. Just imagine the average Joe <em>googling</em> things
like <em>“What to do when Matrix doesn’t work”</em>, or <em>“Why won’t Element start?”</em> –
oh boy.</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.matrix.org/@matthew">Matthew</a>, if you’re reading this: We both
know that <em>naming things</em> is one of the hardest problems in computer science,
right after <em>cache invalidation</em>. I totally get the geeky, <em>31337</em> thrill a name
like <em>Matrix</em> might evoke, but believe me when I say that
<a href="https://github.com/mrusme/reader">using generic names</a> is a bad idea. Things
would have been a lot easier for everyone involved if you had at least rebranded
<em>Riot</em> to something <a href="https://github.com/mrusme/superhighway84">more</a>
<a href="https://github.com/mrusme/neonmodem">distinctive</a>. For future rebrandings, I
highly recommend using the
<a href="https://synthwavegenerator.com">Synthwave Band Name Generator</a> and some good
old human creativity. :-)</p><h2 id="the-straw-that-broke-the-camels-back">The straw that broke the camel’s back</h2><p>In early July, I opened <em>Element X</em> on my phone and noticed an eerie silence in
my community channel there. It wasn’t unusual for the channel to be quiet, but
this felt <em>off</em>. I tried posting something. Nothing sent.</p><p>Puzzled, I switched to my laptop and loaded <code>app.element.io</code>, only to discover
that the channel was <em>gone</em>, or at least, I appeared to have left it. It now
showed up under <em>“Suggested”</em>, as if I could rejoin. But I never left it.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/room-gone.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/room-gone_hu_b8d15a1975ebee8c.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>Back on <em>Element X</em>, I still appeared to be a member. I suspected a browser
glitch, so I tried it from a clean profile without extensions and cached data.
Same result.</p><p>Attempts to rejoin the room failed. Amongst literally dozens of other JavaScript
warnings and errors, even with uBlock Origin turned off –
<a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/jserrors.png"><em>w.. t.. f..</em></a> – the browser’s developer console showed this

channel on <em>Matrix.org</em>, and also contacted the <em>Element</em> support (ticket
<code>2386</code>). The next day, <a href="https://x61.ar">gonzalo</a>, who runs his own homeserver, helped me
investigate. Surprisingly, he was still part of the channel and could chat with
others. But accounts on <code>matrix.org</code>, including mine, couldn’t interact with it
at all.</p><p>gonzalo and I tried joining the channel with different <code>matrix.org</code> accounts,
which also failed with the following error for both of us:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>MatrixError: [403] No create event in auth events (https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/client/v3/join/%23root%40localhost%3Amatrix.org?server_name=matrix.org&amp;via=matrix.org)

communicating this to the rest of the network. Even stranger, from gonzalo’s
point of view, I was still in the room, just offline:</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/still-joined.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/still-joined_hu_d471ce23bc03611d.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>I attempted to elevate his permissions via the <em>Space</em> that the channel belonged

be curious to know how bad the situation could turn out for other communities or
maybe even enterprise customers using the platform.</p><div><p><strong>Note:</strong> To prevent comments like <em>“Well, it’s your fault, because you should
have just dropped a message to/in &lt;insert here&gt; to get support <strong>for your

cc the <code>@matrix.org</code> address, or taken any number of other steps. But, from a
real-world user perspective, that’s all nonsense. It’s not the user’s
responsibility to understand the separation between <em>Matrix.org</em> and <em>Element</em>,
nor to figure out whose responsiibility a particular issue falls under. That
separation was a deliberate choice made by <em>Matrix.org</em>/<em>Element</em>, not by the
user, which means it’s on them to have the support pipelines in place that
clearly guide users to the right channels. That’s simply not happening.

I haven’t heard back from the support team, and I still haven’t regained access

the <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/contact/">SimpleX room</a> that has accumulated over a hundred people in a
fraction of the time – it is nevertheless sad to have lost it just like that.
At least this post can hopefully serve as a cautionary tale for others who are
considering hosting their community on <em>Matrix.org</em>’s homeserver.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/bruised.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/bruised_hu_9d3b344aed6a9565.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p>Between the slow performance, the increasing amount of spam, the miserable web
client, and the unfinished state of <em>Element X</em>, the <em>Matrix.org</em> network is not
something I am willing to continue to recommend, especially to non-technical
users. <em>Normal people</em> are simply tolerating it to communicate with idealistic
nerds like myself who insist(<em>ed</em>) on using it.</p><p>Despite my experience with <em>Element</em> and <em>Matrix.org</em> over the past years, I
still believe that they won’t be going anywhere soon. European governments in
particular seem willing to endure all sorts of <em>digital torture</em> if it means
reducing dependency on U.S. <em>big tech</em>. After all, their institutions which have
failed over and over to develop own solutions, and that just <em>“recently”</em> (in
relative terms) migrated off Windows XP and Internet Explorer, yet continue to
use Lotus Notes and fax machines, are unlikely to be deterred by sluggish UIs or
bizarre permission bugs.</p><p>But as long as things remain as they are, I don’t see the general public warming
to <em>Matrix.org</em>/<em>Element</em>. The platform is cumbersome for newcomers and lacks
user-facing features that people actually want, while simultaneously
overexposing complex settings like roles, permissions, and addresses. It’s the
ideal <em>enterprise software</em> – and I don’t mean that as a compliment. Even
overloaded platforms like Discord ultimately focus on what users want: <em>Dumb</em>
emojis and stickers, <em>silly</em> color themes, and intuitive <em>server</em> and friend
management. <em>Matrix</em>, by contrast, feels like it was built for compliance
departments and bureaucrats, not communities.</p><p>This is where I part ways with <em>Element</em>/<em>Matrix.org</em>. Not out of bitterness
over losing my channel, and not out of frustration over the complete lack of
support, but out of exhaustion from dealing with glitches and a frankly terrible
user experience on a regular basis.</p><p>I’m still all for the ideals behind the project: Open protocols, privacy by
design, decentralized and federated infrastructure, and maybe one day
<a href="https://arewep2pyet.com">peer-to-peer</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p2p-matrix/">networking</a>. Unfortunately ideals alone don’t
make for usable tools. At this stage, I have to admit that the user experience
on XMPP… heck, even on the IRC, is so much superior to what
<em>Element</em>/<em>Matrix.org</em> delivers, that it doesn’t make any sense at all for me to
continue moving into this direction. Considering that a self-hosted
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/installation/planning"><em>Dendrite</em> instance should ideally have</a>, quote:</p><blockquote><p>For a comfortable day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated
rooms for a number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB
RAM — more if your user count increases.</p></blockquote><p>… <em>Matrix</em> ends up being worse not just in terms of user experience, but also
from an administrative and cost perspective, especially when compared to
something like <em>Ejabberd</em>, which has <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/benchmark/index.html">historically</a> proven capable
of supporting large numbers of users even in highly resource-constrained
environments.</p><div><p><strong>Hot take:</strong> Erlang/OTP is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6vuXd3lM8g">renowned for handling <strong>ridiculous</strong> numbers of
concurrent users</a> and has been
battle-tested <strong>for decades</strong> in distributed systems,
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/20-years-of-open-source-erlang-openerlang-interview-with-anton-lavrik-from-whatsapp/">especially in comms platforms</a>.
To this day, I cannot comprehend why <em>Matrix.org</em> chose to use <em>Python</em> and
<em>Node.js</em> of all things, instead of Erlang, or more recently, Elixir. This feels
like such a low-hanging fruit in terms of architecture design, yet <em>Matrix.org</em>,
and later on <em>New Vector</em> never really appear to have had that lightbulb moment
of <em>“Hey, wait, the <em>Open Telecom Platform</em> provides <strong>everything</strong> Matrix needs
right out of the box and would make large-scale deployments significantly easier
(and cheaper) – let’s use that!”</em>. Imagine how beautifully simple a
<a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/distribunomicon#setting-up-an-erlang-cluster">cluster</a>
could have been set up, without the headache that is Kubernetes. Imagine how
<em>“easy”</em> integrating an <a href="https://github.com/processone/xmpp">XMPP bridge</a> into
<em>Matrix</em> could have been, in comparison to the
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost"><em>frankensteined</em> thing that it is today</a>.
Heck, they could have straight-up forked <em>Ejabberd</em> and built their protocols
and ideas on the shoulders of this two-decade-old giant, while continuing to
natively support XMPP for migration purposes. <em>Matrix</em> would have had a near
drop-in replacement for administrators who’d like to <em>try before they buy</em>, to
ease the transition from XMPP to <em>Matrix</em>. And they still could have leveraged
the Rust expertise they gained while building the client SDK in areas where
low-level performance is critical, via
<a href="https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler">Erlang’s
Native Implemented Functions (NIFs)</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/how-could-you-not-think-of-all-this.gif" alt=""/></figure></div><p>I truly hope the team behind <em>Matrix.org</em> finds their footing, because the world
<em>does</em> need an open alternative to the corporate silos that are Slack, Teams,
Discord and all the others. But until that vision materializes into something
dependable, fast, and user-friendly, I’ll be elsewhere, quietly rooting for a
comeback, but no longer waiting for it.</p><h2 id="a-new-home">A new home</h2><p>Over the years, I’ve tried just about every <em>new thing</em>, only to eventually
return to where my journey began decades ago, namely XMPP (and IRC). This time
is no different. Sure, both platforms have their quirks and limitations, but
their reliability, simplicity, and interoperability remain unmatched.</p><p>I want every member of the former community channel on <em>Matrix.org</em> to know that
there is a <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/contact/">new (old) home: XMPP</a>, and that the room on <em>Matrix.org</em> is
effective immediately a <em>rogue room</em> that I have no control over. If you have
been part of the <em>Matrix.org</em> room, I would be happy to have you on the <code>VT100</code>
<em>multi-user chat</em> room, as well as on my own roster on XMPP. If you are new here
or on XMPP in general, I also invite you to join the shindig: Find yourself a
suitable <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/">XMPP client</a>, and sign up on <a href="https://providers.xmpp.net">an</a>
<a href="https://list.jabber.at">instance</a> or <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/run-your-own-instant-messaging-service-on-freebsd/">host it yourself</a>.</p><p>While the <em>new</em> XMPP instance is operable, I’m still improving things here and
there and dealing with quirks along the way, so it might be that its
availability might only reach 73.31% atm. Things on my todo list include making
the instance available via Tor and I2P, setting up a dedicated rewrite proxy for
<a href="https://unifiedpush.org">UnifiedPush</a>, as well as (maybe at some point) setting up an IRCv3 server
alongside the XMPP service and create a dedicated channel there as well.</p><p>PS: The <a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/contact/">SimpleX room</a> is still around as well, just in case you prefer
an <em>easier to use</em> option. However, keep in mind that this is another
non-self-governing space that’s at the mercy of the operating platform.</p><figure><a href="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/xmpp.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg/images/xmpp_hu_1715248c6bd0481b.webp" alt=""/></a></figure><p><small><strong>Footnote:</strong> The artwork was generated using AI and further botched by me using
