    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the end of each year I summarize how the year went, reflecting on how I progressed towards my goal of being self-sufficient as a web developer, here are the previous editions of this article:</p><ul><li>(2022) <a href="https://maxrozen.com/2022-just-keep-shipping">Just keep shipping</a></li><li>(2021) <a href="https://maxrozen.com/2021-strangers-paid-my-macbook">Strangers from the internet paid for my MacBook Air</a></li><li>(2020) <a href="https://maxrozen.com/indiehacking-3-year-review">Indiehacking: a review of my 3rd year</a></li><li>(2019) <a href="https://maxrozen.com/2019/12/29/2019-further-reflections-trying-to-start-an-internet-business/">Further reflections on trying to start an internet business</a></li><li>(2018) <a href="https://maxrozen.com/2018/12/31/2018-review-starting-an-internet-business/">Reflections on trying to start an internet business</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://rozenmd.com/">ROZENMD</a> (my business here in France that runs OnlineOrNot, and sells my products) continued to grow in 2023, approximately twice as fast as I expected at the start of the year.</p><p>I have two theories as to how this happened:</p><ol><li>On the <a href="https://onlineornot.com/">OnlineOrNot</a> side, what I learn about running the business compounds. Fixing something that wasn&#39;t working results in a slight increase in adoption, improving <em>that</em> fix increases adoption even more, and so on.</li><li>My book about useEffect seems to make even more money the longer it exists. This is likely partly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">lindy effect</a>, and partly from more and more folks entering web development and using React.</li></ol><p>As I approach the point where my business could feasibly pay my salary (still a few years away), I don&#39;t think I see myself quitting full-time work - I work better knowing I have two hours to ship something each morning.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#one-big-bet">One big bet</a><ul><li><a href="#running-the-business-long-term-starts-paying-off">Running the business long-term starts paying off</a></li><li><a href="#dear-diary">Dear diary</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#i-changed-teams-at-work">I changed teams at work</a></li><li><a href="#i-built-the-boring-enterprise-laptop-of-my-dreams">I built the boring enterprise laptop of my dreams</a></li></ul><p>At the start of 2023, it was trendy to make many &#34;small bets&#34; when starting an internet business.</p><p>Popularized by folks like Pieter Levels and Jon Yongfook, and then turned into a paid product/community itself by others, the idea is to keep throwing products at the wall, until you see what sticks.</p><p>Folks will point to investment portfolio management theory, saying if 5 or so investments is enough diversification to smooth out risk/reward, surely the same idea follows for building products.</p><p>The trouble I find with that argument is the amount of effort to get from $0 -&gt; $500 MRR is <em>significantly</em> greater than $500 -&gt; $1000 and above. Having to repeat the most difficult part of starting a project, where you need to figure out the means of attracting the right type of users (and figure out who <em>they</em> are), and the features they need to solve a problem <em>several times</em> (and you&#39;re going for diversification, so the products can&#39;t be related) sounds a bit suboptimal to me, compared to doubling down on what works.</p><p>I also don&#39;t buy the idea that individual makers <strong>need</strong> diversification. Avoid platform risk (where you build on top of someone else&#39;s platform, like Twitter), don&#39;t work on things you&#39;re not personally interested in, and you&#39;re <em>well</em> on your way to reducing the greatest risks to your business running long term.</p><h3 id="running-the-business-long-term-starts-paying-off"><a href="#running-the-business-long-term-starts-paying-off" aria-label="2023 focus single product pays off permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Running the business long-term starts paying off</h3><p>This year I started having wins that were only possible from sticking around long enough:</p><ul><li>I had folks that rejected my pitch for OnlineOrNot pre-launch (back when OnlineOrNot was literally just a single input form that sent only email alerts) sign up and become customers of OnlineOrNot.

They don&#39;t get tons of views, but I write them primarily as a means of reflecting on what I said I&#39;d do, what I did, and what I learned along the way.</p><p>It&#39;d be weird (to me) to do a year-in-review post without discussing my full-time job at Cloudflare: without it, I would simply not have the ability to pursue a slow-yet-steady growth project that requires patience like OnlineOrNot.</p><p>At the start of the year, a partner team started integrating their early-alpha product into wrangler (the command-line tool for building <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>), I helped out by fixing bugs and contributing ideas for a better user experience, and long story short, I ended up being one of the founding engineers of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/">D1</a>.</p><p>Considering my product and writing skills (see the last five years in review), I reckon it&#39;s a pretty good fit!</p><p>So I didn&#39;t <em>just</em> work on software this year, I also had a couple of cute hardware projects like this where I upgraded a laptop over a few hours, or put together an AirGradient sensor.</p><p>I&#39;m actually writing this article from that same laptop - at the start of the year, I grew a bit fed-up with Apple, and wanted to build a cheap enterprise-looking laptop no one would want to steal when traveling (it&#39;s one asset tag sticker away from looking like my wife&#39;s old work laptop).</p><p>So I bought a cheap Lenovo T480 off a refurbisher, bought a bunch of parts to upgrade it, put it all together, and wrote about the project:</p><ul><li><a href="https://maxrozen.com/replacing-my-macbook-m1-with-thinkpad-t480">On replacing my MacBook Air M1 with a Thinkpad T480</a></li><li><a href="https://maxrozen.com/getting-your-own-good-enough-laptop-for-under-500">Getting your own good enough laptop for under $500</a></li></ul><p>The first article ended up getting translated and posted to <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/diy-mein-thinkpad-t480-ist-so-gut-wie-ein-macbook-air-m1-2308-176569.html">golem.de</a>, which was pretty cool, and I had a stray mention to running OnlineOrNot&#39;s dev server in the article, so that accidentally drew thousands of people to Google what OnlineOrNot is.</p><p>The first article also drew quite a bit of anger from random strangers online, and I found it pretty funny. As though I was telling people they had to go throw out their Apple laptops immediately because you can get a good-enough laptop for under $500.</p></div><div action="https://app.convertkit.com/forms/2274202/subscriptions" method="post" id="signup"><div data-style="full"><div data-element="column"><h3 data-element="header">Follow the Journey</h3><p>Roughly every second weekend, I send a newsletter with an update of how the business side of OnlineOrNot is going. </p><ul data-element="errors" data-group="alert"></ul><p>Join 355 curious folks that have signed up so far.</p></div></div></div></div>
