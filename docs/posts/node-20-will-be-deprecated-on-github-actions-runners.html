    <h1>Node 20 will be deprecated on GitHub Actions runners</h1>

<p>Node20 will reach end-of-life (EOL) in April of 2026. As a result we have started the deprecation process of Node20 for GitHub Actions. We plan to migrate all actions to run on Node24 in the fall of 2025.</p>
<p>The newest GitHub runner (<a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.328.0">v2.328.0</a>) now supports both Node20 and Node24 and uses Node20 as the default version. If youâ€™d like to test Node24 ahead of time, set <code>FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true</code> as an <code>env</code> in your workflow or as an environment variable on your runner machine to force the use of Node24.</p>
<p>Beginning on March 4th, 2026, runners will begin using Node24 by default. To opt out of this and continue using Node20 after this date, set <code>ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION=true</code> as an <code>env</code> in your workflow or as an environment variable on your runner machine. This will only work until we upgrade the runner and remove Node20 later in the summer of 2026.</p>

<p>Node24 is incompatible with macOS 13.4 and lower versions.</p>
<p>Node 24 does not have official support for ARM32, so self-hosted runners on ARM32 will no longer be supported after Node 20 deprecation.</p>
<p>To find out more about the OS versions we support and self-hosted runner architectures, please read our documentation.</p>
