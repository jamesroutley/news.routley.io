<p>At Erlang Solutions, our support for the BEAM community is long-standing and built into everything we do. From contributing to open-source tools and sponsoring events to improving security and shaping ecosystem standards, we’re proud to play an active role in helping the BEAM ecosystem grow and thrive.</p>

<p>One way we’re putting that support into action is by offering free CI/CD-based security audits for open-source Erlang and Elixir projects. These audits help maintainers identify and fix vulnerabilities early, integrated directly into modern development workflows.</p>



<p>Our free CI/CD security audits for open source projects are powered by<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/services/security-audit-for-erlang-and-elixir/"> <strong>SAFE (Security Audit for Erlang/Elixir)</strong></a>, a dedicated solution built to detect vulnerabilities in Erlang and Elixir code that could leave systems exposed to cyber attacks.</p>

<p>The CI/CD version of SAFE integrates directly into your development pipeline (e.g. GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins), enabling you to scan for vulnerabilities automatically every time code is committed or updated. This helps projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Detect issues early, before they reach production<br/></li>



<li>Maintain a more secure and resilient codebase<br/></li>



<li>Improve visibility of risks within day-to-day workflows<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Results are delivered quickly– typically within a few minutes. For larger codebases, it may take up to 20–30 minutes. The feedback is designed to be clear, actionable, and minimally disruptive.</p>

<p>Open source maintainers can request a free license by emailing safe@erlang-solutions.com and including a link to their repository. Once approved, we provide a SAFE license for one month or up to a year, depending on the project’s needs, at no cost.<br/></p>

<p>For more information, read our <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/policies/safe-for-open-source-projects/">full terms and conditions</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Expert-Led Audits for Production BEAM Systems</strong></h2>

<p>SAFE is just one way we help teams build secure, resilient systems. We also offer hands-on audit services for production systems, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Code reviews</strong> focused on clarity, maintainability, and best practices<br/></li>



<li><strong>Architecture assessments</strong> to help ensure systems are scalable and fault-tolerant<br/></li>



<li><strong>Performance audits</strong> to identify bottlenecks and optimise how systems behave under load</li>
</ul>

<p>These services are delivered by our in-house experts and are a great fit for teams working on complex or business-critical systems. They also pair well with SAFE for a full picture of how systems are running and how they could be even better.</p>

<p>Of course, supporting the BEAM community goes beyond security and audits. Our involvement spans education, events, and long-term ecosystem development.</p>

<p>“We’re proud to support the BEAM ecosystem not just with code, but with the infrastructure and insights that help it grow stronger,” says Zoltan Literati, Business Unit Leader at Erlang Solutions Hungary. </p>

<p>“Our free audits offer real, practical value to maintainers working in open source. It’s one of the ways we’re giving back to the community.”</p>

<h2><strong>A Broader Commitment to the BEAM Community</strong></h2>

<p>The BEAM ecosystem continues to grow across languages like Erlang, Elixir and Gleam, driven by a global community of developers, maintainers, educators and advocates. Erlang Solutions is proud to contribute across multiple fronts, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sponsoring various conferences, including <a href="https://www.codesync.global/"><strong>Code Sync</strong></a></li>



<li>Supporting the <a href="https://erlef.org/"><strong>Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF)</strong></a>, including participation in working groups focused on security, documentation, interoperability, and tooling</li>



<li>Backing inclusion-focused initiatives such as <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/women-in-beam/"><strong>Women in BEAM</strong></a></li>



<li>Sharing learning resources, contributing to open source libraries, and facilitating knowledge exchange through meetups, blogs and webinars<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Our role is to support the ecosystem not only through expertise, but through action, and to help ensure that BEAM-based systems are not only scalable and reliable, but secure.</p>
