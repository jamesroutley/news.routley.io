      <p>Along Route 110 in the tiny village of Still River, Massachusetts, about an hour west of Boston, sits a small building where passers-by stock up on produce—corn and tomatoes in the summer; flowers in the spring; and pumpkins, gourds and squash in the fall. If they’re lucky, they’ll meet brothers Paul and Wendall Willard as the two farmers lay out that day’s harvest.</p>

<p>After 350 years and many generations, however, the farm’s future is in doubt. Photographer <a href="https://www.ellenharasimowicz.com/index">Ellen Harasimowicz</a> has been documenting what she refers to as the “long, slow ending of the farm” in her ongoing project, <em>Living Like Grass</em>, that will be on exhibit in Concord, Massachusetts, in May. Their story is far from unique; in Massachusetts, family or individually owned farms represent nearly <a href="https://ag.umass.edu/resources/massachusetts-agricultural-data/farms-by-type-of-business">80 percent</a> of the commonwealth’s stock, according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture (2017).</p>

<p>The Willard family has lived and farmed in Still River since 1676; to say that they have built a community is both literally and figuratively true. According to Harasimowicz, the Willards have grown a loyal following, selling their produce only at the farm stand and using an honor system. “People appreciate the neighborly feel this service provides,” she writes. “You weigh your tomatoes, do the math, and leave the money—the big bills go in a slot in the safe—or you can make change in the wooden box with smaller bills. Sometimes people leave an IOU. I always round up. I think many people do.”</p>

It just happened.”

<p>Alas, Paul, 80, and Wendell, 74, are growing closer to retirement, and they say dependable help is difficult to find. Their 65-year-old farmhand died in January, and a young man Paul was training left for another job. Operating expenses are rising, weather extremes are causing erratic crop yields, and it’s unlikely any next-generation Willards will be taking up the family business.</p>

<p>“Today, the cost of producing anything is way out of line,” Paul tells Harasimowicz. “A dollar gets spent almost before you earn it because of the cost of pesticides, diesel fuel, labor, insurance—everything has gone up. You can only get so much for a tomato.”</p>

<p>There’s a great beauty and a quiet sadness reflected in Harasimowicz’s project<em>.</em> For the past three years, she has documented the Willards and their farm, one she’s been returning to for more than 25 years to buy her produce. It’s important to her to visualize Americans’ personal connections to the land and to food, which are rapidly dissolving. In all probability, the 17-acre Willard Farm will not continue; at the very least, Paul and Wendell will likely be the last Willards to farm this land.</p>

<p>Photographs from <em>Living Like Grass</em> <a href="https://www.threestonesgallery.com/schedule">will be on display in an exhibition at the Three Stones Gallery</a> in Concord starting May 10. Harasimowicz spoke with <em>Smithsonian</em> about her project via email below.</p>

      “There’s something about [this photo], the way he’s framed, his posture, the lines that are in it,” says Harasimowicz. “There’s so many details … the ripped wall of the greenhouse mended and the weeds on the right that are reaching up. There’s the two strong supports for the greenhouse and the limp hose. I just love that contrast. And you can see he has the neck brace, you can see he’s bent over, you can see he has the headlamp. It seems to encompass everything.”

<p><strong>What is the biggest difference between the farm 20 years ago and today?</strong></p>

<p><strong>You didn’t just make current-day images, but you also did a deep dive researching the Willards’ history, their family tree, the history of the land. What was that process? </strong></p>

<p>I went over to the historical society, which is literally across the street and over a house or two—that used to be on Willard land—and started doing some research into the farm. They have this huge genealogy book. The very first Willard to own this land was Simon Willard. He’s known all over Massachusetts. The show I’m having is in Concord, and Simon was one of the founders of the town. He was also on the Board of Overseers at Harvard College, and two of his heirs became Harvard College presidents, and that’s how this town got its name, Harvard. It seemed to be such a rich history that once this farm ends, I felt it should be honored for everything that it was and still is.</p>

<p><strong>What’s been the most surprising thing you discovered during this project? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Does Eleanor, the only member of the next generation of the Willards, have any desire to stay on the farm? </strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you hope viewers come to understand when they look at these images?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What’s your next project?</strong></p>

<p>I am also part of a newly formed international group of artists, scientists, students and other experts focusing on how to better see, connect and amplify the “transformation” systems of the Casco Bay Bioregion in Maine. We’re looking specifically at the seagrass ecosystems. Eelgrass meadows are home to a staggering number of fish and invertebrates. Seagrass can take up nitrogen from the water and sequester carbon by burying it in the sediments. These meadows also serve like a lawn in the estuary, reducing the effects of storms, waves and the erosion they can create.</p>
