<p>SVG, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for,
well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion
of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to
improve things.</p>

short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well,
scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the
format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve
things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years
for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my
love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of
love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and
open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well
supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for
editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You
can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and
can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference
other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend
SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously
supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also
animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is
magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG
specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred
twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s
also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the
scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do
you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g. another 20 pages of
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as
well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG
files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated
already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a
complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually
just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem
of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to
work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month.
The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly
implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what,
confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they
want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly
verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or
generate automatically.</p>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above
is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/posts/2021/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design
for machines vs. humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a
machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing
badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that.
Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The
syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be
represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no.
Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human
users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable
for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use
would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for
LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my
opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary
features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would
have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the
finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of
Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it
into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but
well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a
machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said –
it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h3 id="what-now">What now?</h3>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange
format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal
in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You
should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even
better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem
libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients
should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension
could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test
suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative
ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and
implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and
JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power.
Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like
Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics
through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a>
that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector
graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and
writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with
similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student
research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines
and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both,
but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26114863">Hacker News</a> and
landed on the front page, currently it’s on rank 3. I’m honored! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=26115086&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D26114863%2326115086">In
the comments there</a> somebody mentioned an <a href="https://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg">interesting use of the
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in SVG</a>. I’m unsure though whether I
should be impressed or horrified :D</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a>
as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not
about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than
JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And
while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a
document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a
good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML,
binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least
important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format
for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t
like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious
war.</p>
