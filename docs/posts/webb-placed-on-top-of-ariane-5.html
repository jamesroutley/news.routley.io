</div><p>On Saturday 11 December, the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb" target="_blank">James Webb Space Telescope</a> was placed on top of the Ariane 5 rocket that will launch it to space from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.</p><div>
				
		<p><a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/12/Webb_moved_to_meet_Ariane_5" target="_blank">After its arrival in the final assembly building</a>, Webb was lifted slowly about 40 m high and then carefully manoeuvred on top of Ariane 5, after which technicians bolted Webb’s launch vehicle adapter down to the rocket.</p><p>This whole process was performed under strict safety and cleanliness regulations, as it was one of the most delicate operations during the entire launch campaign for Webb.</p><p>A ‘shower curtain’ about 12 m high and 8 m in diameter was installed in between two platforms, to create a closed-off space around Webb to avoid any contamination.</p><p>The next step is to encapsulate Webb inside Ariane 5’s specially adapted fairing.</p><p>Webb will be the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. As part of an international collaboration agreement, ESA is providing the telescope’s launch service using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Working with partners, ESA was responsible for the development and qualification of Ariane 5 adaptations for the Webb mission and for the procurement of the launch service by Arianespace.</p><p>Webb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).</p><p>Find out more about Webb in ESA’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/James_Webb_Space_Telescope_launch_kit" target="_blank">launch kit</a> and <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_Publications/ESA_BR-348_Webb_Seeing_farther" target="_blank">interactive brochure</a>.</p>
