<p>Survey and excavation work, commissioned by the university, was carried out on the site from 2003. It culminated in a full-scale excavation carried out in 2007–08 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Archaeological_Trust" title="York Archaeological Trust">York Archaeological Trust</a> in an area of just over 8 hectares (20 acres).<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup> The archaeologists found that the landscape had been inhabited and farmed for thousands of years. The remains of prehistoric fields, buildings and trackways were discovered, dating from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_Britain" title="Bronze Age Britain">Bronze Age</a> through to the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Britain" title="Iron Age Britain">Iron Age</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nouse_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nouse-4">[4]</a></sup> with traces of earlier activity as far back as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic" title="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> periods.<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>During the Iron Age, the area appears to have been the site of a permanent settlement. The excavators found a number of circular features, which they interpreted as the remains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhouse_(dwelling)" title="Roundhouse (dwelling)">roundhouses</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-LiveScience_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-LiveScience-5">[5]</a></sup> The inhabitants seem to have relocated during the Roman period to a site further up the ridge, leaving the area of the Iron Age settlement to revert to fields.<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Around a dozen pits were found on the site and possibly ritualistic objects were found in a number of them.

Jim cleaned it up and recorded it but had a dentist&#39;s appointment that afternoon (for a filling) and so the task of lifting the skull fell to his colleague and friend Rupert Lotherington. The find was seen as unusual but its true importance was not discovered until after it had been transported, within a block of soil, to the Finds Laboratory of the York Archaeological Trust. As Finds officer Rachel Cubitt was cleaning it, she noticed that something was loose inside the skull.<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup> She peered through its base and saw that it contained a &#34;yellow substance&#34;.

<p>The skull was found to be that of a man aged between 26–45 years old at the time of death, likely in his mid-30s. Radiocarbon dating found that the man had died some time between the 7th century BCE and 5th century BCE (673–482 BCE). He belonged to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA_haplogroup" title="MtDNA haplogroup">Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J_(mtDNA)" title="Haplogroup J (mtDNA)">J1d</a>, which had not previously been seen in Britain, in either living or dead individuals. J1d has been identified previously in only a few people from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany" title="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>; it may have been more widely present in Britain in the past, and lost through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" title="Genetic drift">genetic drift</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-4"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>He had died from traumatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylolisthesis" title="Spondylolisthesis">spondylolisthesis</a> – a complete fracture of his spine that is usually associated with death by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging" title="Hanging">hanging</a>. Shortly after death his head and upper vertebrae had been severed from his body, almost surgically, using a thin-bladed knife. Although there is evidence from other sites of &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trophy_collecting" title="Human trophy collecting">trophy heads</a>&#34; in Iron Age societies, it appears that the head was immediately deposited in the pit and buried in fine-grained wet sediment.<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-5"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup> The reason for the killing is unclear. The archaeological context suggests that the man may have been killed for a ritual or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice" title="Human sacrifice">sacrificial</a> purposes.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography" title="X-ray computed tomography">CT scanning</a> was carried out at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Hospital" title="York Hospital">York Hospital</a>, where the skull was opened and the contents were removed and forensically examined. The interior of the skull was found to contain several large fragments of brain mixed with sediment. The brain had shrunk to about 20% of its original size, but many anatomical features were still readily identifiable. It was remarkably well-preserved and had few signs of decay other than the presence of a few bacterial spores.<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-6"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup> One of the fragments clearly showed the neural folds of a cerebral lobe.<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Discovery of such a well-preserved brain is all the more remarkable, considering the fragility of all human brains following death. Even when placed in a chilled environment in a mortuary, brains quickly dissolve into liquid.<sup id="cite_ref-Medical_Daily_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Medical_Daily-1">[1]</a></sup> The high fat content of the brain means that it is usually the first major organ to deteriorate.<sup id="cite_ref-LiveScience_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-LiveScience-5">[5]</a></sup> The brains of the crew of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> submarine <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL_Hunley_(submarine)" title="HL Hunley (submarine)">H. L.

(January 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Brains found in terrestrial environments have tended to be better preserved, as the surviving material tends to have a higher proportion of hydrophobic (water-repellent) matter than in a fresh brain. There appear to be a number of routes by which brains have been preserved, though a common factor appears to be the existence of a wet, anoxic environment.<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-7"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup> The presence of such an environment is thought to have been responsible for a similar but less complete preservation of brain matter discovered in the 1990s during the construction of a new magistrates&#39; court in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull" title="Kingston upon Hull">Hull</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-YAT_report_2-6"><a href="#cite_note-YAT_report-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The preservation of the brain has been attributed to several factors. First, the waterlogged, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anoxic" title="wiktionary:anoxic">anoxic</a> soil in which the head was buried, even though only the brain, and not the rest of the tissue, survived burial. Only scanty traces of other tissue remain on the rest of the skull. Second, the brain had undergone unusual chemical changes as a result of being severed and the conditions under which it was buried. In contrast to other brains found, no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocere" title="Adipocere">adipocere</a> – a fatty compound formed through the process of decay – was detected in the Heslington brain, probably because the head was severed from the body before the brain had started to decay. There had also been a major decrease in the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid" title="Lipid">lipids</a> and their replacement by fatty acids and other substances produced as degradation products. Much of the original substance of the brain has been replaced by a high molecular weight, long-chain, hydrocarbon material that is as yet unidentified. According to the archaeologists who have examined it, the brain is &#34;odourless&#34;, with a &#34;smooth surface&#34; and a &#34;resilient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu" title="Tofu">tofu</a>-like texture.&#34;<sup id="cite_ref-JAS_3-8"><a href="#cite_note-JAS-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Thirdly, the human body tends to decay from the inside out, consumed by a post-mortem swarm of bacteria from the gut which spread around the body via blood from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimentary_tract" title="Alimentary tract">alimentary tract</a>. In this particular case, the head was severed from the alimentary tract and drained of blood, so the intestinal bacteria did not have an opportunity to contaminate it. The precise mechanism by which the Heslington brain was preserved is unclear, however; in a bid to shed light on this question, researchers buried a number of pigs&#39; heads in and around the campus to see what happened to them<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The date of the event predicted near this tag has passed.

</p><p>In a paper published on 8 January 2020 in the <i>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</i>, Axel Petzold et al performed molecular studies on a sample of the brain, and identified over 800 proteins. Some of these proteins were in good enough condition to elicit an immune response. The team also found that the proteins had folded themselves into tightly packed aggregates which are more stable than those found in live brains. This may partly explain how the Heslington brain has been able to stave off decomposition, in addition to the wet, anoxic environment in which the skull was found that could have prevented aerobic microorganisms from surviving.<sup id="cite_ref-Phys_Org_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-Phys_Org-8">[8]</a></sup>
