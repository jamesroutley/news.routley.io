<center><h2>Thales&#39; Theorem</h2></center>

<p>A useful theorem attributed to the probably first mathematician ever, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales">Thales of Miletus</a> (ca. 624 BC-ca. 546 BC) is one of most elementary and intuitive ever stated.</p>

<p>
An angle <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/inscribed.shtml">inscribed</a> in a semicircle is right, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>A seventh-grader student of <a href="https://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html">Paul Lockhart</a> found a beautiful proof. The following is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">Paul&#39;s online article</a>:</p>

<div>
<p>As a more serious example, let&#39;s take the case of a triangle inside a semicircle:</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Now the beautiful truth about this pattern is that no matter where on the circle you place the tip of the triangle, it always forms a nice right angle. (I have no objection to a term like &#34;right angle&#34; if it is relevant to the problem and makes it easier to discuss. It&#39;s not terminology itself that I object to, it&#39;s pointless unnecessary terminology. In any case, I would be happy to use &#34;corner&#34; or even &#34;pigpen&#34; if a student preferred.)</p>

</p>

<p>Here is a case where our intuition is somewhat in doubt. It&#39;s not at all clear that this should be true; it even seems unlikely - shouldn&#39;t the angle change if I move the tip? What we have here is a fantastic math problem! Is it true? If so, why is it true? What a great project! What a terrific opportunity to exercise one&#39;s ingenuity and imagination!

</p>

<p>Take the triangle and rotate it around so it makes a foursided box inside the circle. Since the triangle got turned
completely around, the sides of the box must be parallel, so it makes a parallelogram. But it can&#39;t be a slanted box
because both of its diagonals are diameters of the circle, so they&#39;re equal, which means it must be an actual rectangle.
That&#39;s why the corner is always a right angle.</p>

<p>...</p>
</div>

<p>(AB: note that) Since the triangle got rotated halfway around the circle, the tip must end up exactly opposite from where it started. That&#39;s why the diagonal of the box is a diameter.</p>
