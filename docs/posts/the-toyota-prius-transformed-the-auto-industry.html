    <h1>The Toyota Prius transformed the auto industry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Toyota Prius Transformed the Auto Industry"><div><p>In the early 1990s, <a href="https://www.toyota.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toyota</a> saw that environmental awareness and tighter emissions regulations would shape the future of the automotive industry. The company aimed to create an eco-friendly, efficient <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/transportation/" target="_self">vehicle</a> that would meet future standards.</p><p>In 1997 Toyota introduced the <a href="https://www.toyota.com/prius/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prius</a> to the Japanese market. The car was the world’s first mass-produced hybrid vehicle that combined gasoline and electric power to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Its worldwide debut came in 2000.</p><p>Developing the Prius posed significant technical and market challenges that included designing an efficient hybrid power train, managing battery technology, and overcoming consumer skepticism about combining an electric drivetrain system with the standard gasoline-fueled power train. Toyota persevered, however, and its instincts proved prescient and transformative.</p><p>“The Prius is not only the world’s first mass-produced hybrid car, but its technical and commercial success also spurred other automakers to accelerate hybrid vehicle development,” says IEEE Member<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274113100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nobuo Kawaguchi</a>, a professor in the computational science and engineering department at<a href="https://www.engg.nagoya-u.ac.jp/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nagoya University’s Graduate School of Engineering</a>, in Japan. He is also secretary of the<a href="https://ieee-jp.org/section/nagoya/%EF%BC%9C%E5%95%8F%E3%81%84%E5%90%88%E3%82%8F%E3%81%9B%EF%BC%9E/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Nagoya Section</a>. “The Prius helped shape the role of hybrid cars in today’s automotive market.”</p><p>The Prius was honored with an<a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/w/index.php/Milestone-Proposal:Deep_Space_Station_43%2C_1973" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Milestone</a> on 30 October during a ceremony held at company headquarters in Toyota City, Japan.</p><h2>The G21 project</h2><p>The development of the Prius began in 1993 with the <a href="https://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/leaping_forward_as_a_global_corporation/chapter4/section8/item1_a.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G21 project</a>, which focused on fuel efficiency, low emissions, and affordability. According to a Toyota article detailing the project’s history, by 1997, Toyota engineers—including <a href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/executives/takeshi_uchiyamada.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takeshi Uchiyamada</a>, who has since become known as the “father of the Prius”—were satisfied they had met the challenge of achieving all three goals. </p><p>The first-generation Prius featured a compact design with aerodynamic efficiency. Its groundbreaking hybrid system enabled smooth transitions between an electric motor powered by a nickel–metal hydride battery and an internal combustion engine fueled by gasoline. </p><p>The car’s design incorporated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_braking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regenerative braking</a> in the power-train arrangement to enhance the vehicle’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/climate-tech/" target="_self">energy efficiency</a>. Regenerative braking captures the kinetic energy typically lost as heat when conventional brake pads stop the wheels with friction. Instead, the electric motor switches over to generator mode so that the wheels drive the motor in reverse rather than the motor driving the wheels. Using the motor as a generator slows the car and converts the kinetic energy into an electrical charge routed to the battery to recharge it.</p><p>“The Prius is not only the world’s first mass-produced hybrid car, but its technical and commercial success also spurred other automakers to <span>accelerate hybrid vehicle development.” <strong>—Nobuo Kawaguchi, IEEE Nagoya Section secretary</strong></span></p><p><span></span>According to the company’s “<a href="https://www.riveratoyota.com/HarnessingEfficiencyADeepDiveintoToyotasHybridTechnology/" target="_blank">Harnessing Efficiency: A Deep Dive Into Toyota’s Hybrid Technology</a>” article, a breakthrough was the<a href="https://www.beechmonttoyota.com/manufacturer-information/toyota-hybrid-synergy-drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Hybrid Synergy Drive</a>, a system that allows the Prius to operate in different modes—electric only, gasoline only, or a combination—depending on driving conditions.</p><p>A key component Toyota engineers developed from scratch was the power split device, a planetary gear system that allows smooth transitions between electric and gasoline power, permitting the engine and the motor to propel the vehicle in their respective optimal performance ranges. The arrangement helps optimize fuel economy and simplifies the drivetrain by making a traditional transmission unnecessary. </p><h2>Setting fuel-efficiency records</h2><p>Nearly 30 years after its commercial debut, the Prius remains an icon of environmental responsibility combined with technical innovation. It is still setting records for fuel efficiency. When in July 2023 the newly released <a href="https://www.toyota.com/prius/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 Prius LE</a> was driven from Los Angeles to New York City, it consumed a miserly<a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-prius-sets-guinness-world-record-for-highest-mpg-for-a-coast-to-coast-drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 2.52 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers</a> during the 5,150-km cross-country journey. The record was set by a so-called hypermiler, a driver who practices advanced driving techniques aimed at optimizing fuel efficiency. Hypermilers accelerate smoothly and avoid hard braking. They let off the accelerator early so the car can coast to a gradual stop without applying the brakes, and they drive as often as possible at speeds between 72 and 105 km per hour, the velocities at which a car is typically most efficient.</p><p>A driver not employing such techniques still can expect fuel economy as high as 4.06 L per 100 km from the latest generation of Prius models.</p><p>Toyota has advanced the Prius’s hybrid technology with each generation, solidifying the car’s role as a leader in fuel efficiency and sustainability. </p><h2>Milestone event attracts luminaries</h2><p>Uchiyamada gave a brief talk at the IEEE Milestone event about the Prius’s development process and the challenges he faced as chief G21 engineer. Other notable attendees were <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39254426.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takeshi Uehara</a>, president of Toyota’s power-train company; <a href="http://www.toshiofukuda.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toshio Fukuda</a>, 2020 IEEE president; <a href="https://ieee-jp.org/en/activity/jchc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Isao Shirakawa</a>, <a href="https://ieee-jp.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Japan Council</a> history committee chair; and <a href="https://www.ieeer10.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/230228Annual-Report-2022-Nagoya-Section.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jun Sato</a>, <a href="https://ieee-jp.org/section/nagoya/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Nagoya Section</a> chair.</p><p>A plaque recognizing the technology is displayed at the entrance of the <a href="https://www.toyota-td.jp/en/corporate/office/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toyota Technical Center</a>, which is within walking distance of the company’s headquarters. It reads:</p><p><em><em>“In 1997 Toyota Motor Corporation developed the world’s first mass-produced hybrid vehicle, the Toyota Prius, which used both an internal combustion engine and two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-motors">electric motors</a>. This vehicle achieved revolutionary fuel efficiency by recovering and reusing energy previously lost while driving. Its success helped popularize hybrid vehicles internationally, advanced the technology essential for electric power trains, contributed to the reduction of CO</em></em><em><em><span>2</span></em></em><em><em> emissions, and influenced the design of subsequent electrified vehicles.”</em></em></p><p>Administered by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a> and supported by donors, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments worldwide.
