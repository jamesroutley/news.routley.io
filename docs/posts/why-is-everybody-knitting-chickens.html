        <p>A couple years ago, my wife began knitting. And when she takes an interest in something, she goes all in. She’s a perfectionist about learning a new craft, so in a short amount of time, she’s gotten pretty damn good. I can’t even pretend to know anything more than the most basic idea behind knitting, but somehow she makes incredibly complex garments with skill and precision.</p><p>She’s also become active in the online knitting community, which is interesting for me to watch because she’s otherwise not really active online. But now she follows <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">r/knitting</a> and shares on <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Ravelry</a> and watches knitting videos on YouTube.</p><p>The other day she told me about something that’s spread like wildfire through the knitting community: chickens. Knitted chickens. They’re roughly the size of a throw pillow and are stuffed with material to be soft and huggable. Everybody’s making them.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1600" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image.png 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image.png 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/image.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>“Emotional Support Chicken” by Annette Corsino</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/emotional-support-chicken?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">the knitting pattern</a> for this chicken was posted on Ravelry in 2023, nearly 11,000 people have posted photos of their own knitted chickens on the platform. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKN99679bOQ&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">tutorial video</a> has more than 300,000 views on YouTube with comments like: “This pattern should come with a warning that it is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! I have finished 4 so far and am working on 2 more.”</p><p>People give their knitted chickens names like Hennifer Lopez and Lindsey LoHEN, a punny habit shared by owners of actual backyard chickens, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/10qi86u/if_your_chickens_names_arent_puns_based_on_famous/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">who also like</a> to name their birds after celebrities. (Mine would be Henny Youngman.)</p><p>And there are knittable accessories, natch.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="622" height="640" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-1.png 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/image-1.png 622w"/><figcaption><span>Accessories by Annette Corsino</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was fascinated by all this. I love little artsy niches and this one was completely new to me. I had to know where the knitted chicken came from. The answer turned out to be easy to find, it just never overlapped with my own interests so I never came across it before.</p><p>The knitted chicken is known as the Emotional Support Chicken and was designed by Annette Corsino at a fiber arts shop in Los Angeles called <a href="https://theknittingtreela.com/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">The Knitting Tree</a>. She made the chicken as a sort of play on emotional comfort animals, but one that doesn’t require any sort of permit to own or need to feed it.</p><p>It was adapted from an earlier chicken design from the 90s called Henrietta (another “hen” name) by Bev Galeskas.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/s-l1600.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1090" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/s-l1600.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/s-l1600.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/s-l1600.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>The original Henrietta by Bev Galeskas</span></figcaption></figure><p>The idea of a comforting stuffed animal for grownups (or anyone really) that you can make yourself was appealing to a lot of people in these hard times. During COVID lockdowns, people developed indoor hobbies like knitting which meant there were a lot of new knitters among the old-timers looking for things to knit. Knitting is a relaxing activity for many, and the Chicken knitting pattern wasn’t too difficult, so it made a good project for beginner-to-intermediate knitters.</p><p>In 2024, the LA Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-04/inglewood-knitting-tree-store?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> (with great photos you should go look at) that people were gathering at The Knitting Tree for Emotional Support Chicken knit-along events. By then the store had already sold 25,000 copies of the knitting pattern and more than 3,000 <a href="https://theknittingtreela.com/products/8-piece-chicken-bucket?variant=40615966048343&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">kits</a> including everything you need except for needles and stuffing.</p><p>I admit that it does look kind of comforting to hug one of these chickens. And that comforting quality has prompted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1728167914606688/" rel="noreferrer">Facebook group</a> to knit Emotional Support Chickens for survivors of Hurricane Helene. The group description says, “There has been a request for chickens for those suffering from this historical tragedy. This is something I know we can do together! Let’s get together and make some chickens yall!!”</p><p>A couple weeks ago <a href="https://www.facebook.com/milissa.ellison/posts/pfbid0YaU4GcQ4xx8MJqu9L4tvtV5SB8Ah7rcm6XTzJquVRgRNxvfsGJkd1WGx3ZmYBL3El" rel="noreferrer">someone in the group shared</a> this photo of an Emotional Support Chicken being delivered, noting “The need is real. I carry a few emergency chickens all the time now.”</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/helene-chicken.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1750" height="1618" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/helene-chicken.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/helene-chicken.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/helene-chicken.jpg 1600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/helene-chicken.jpg 1750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Variations on the pattern include a crochet version, a mini-version, etc. And it’s a perfect feel-good story for TV news. Here are a couple stories I came across:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vzq_Md5Fbds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Alberta woman makes crocheted &#39;emotional support chickens&#39; for Oilers fans"></iframe></figure><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDdoo7NFVjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Emotional support chickens all the rage in knitting circles"></iframe></figure><p>And the BBC reported on a yarn shop in Suffolk that displayed 67 olympic-themed chickens knitted by people around the world in its front window.</p><figure><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yz4d23k9o?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io"><div><p>Olympic-themed knitted hens take over Long Melford shop front</p><p>Sixty-seven ‘Olympi’hens’ have been decorated to represent different nations in the Games.</p><p><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/icon/apple-touch-icon.png" alt=""/><span>BBC News</span></p></div><p><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/thumbnail/27fdf6b0-4b65-11ef-94e8-85be4519404e.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a><figcaption><p><span>More fun photos await if you click through</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This is obviously a trend that lots of people know about, and I have just been out of the loop (that’s a knitting pun). Have any of my readers ever made an emotional support chicken? What did you name it?</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/horiz.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="295" height="22"/></figure><p>And that brings another newsletter to a close! So far, the move to Ghost seems to be going okay, right? No problems on your end? Only one person said they missed last issue so hopefully everyone else is getting it.</p><p>As long as you’re here, I have something for the font nerds among us. You know who you are. I directed a short documentary for Nebula about their new font and it’s now on YouTube:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwMuLQPIThQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Nebula Sans"></iframe></figure><p>Hope everyone has a great week. See you next time!</p><p>David</p>
