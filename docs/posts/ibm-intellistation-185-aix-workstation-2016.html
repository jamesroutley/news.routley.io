    <h1>IBM Intellistation 185 AIX workstation (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contcontainer">


<p>Released in 2006 <i>after</i> the 285, this system used the PowerPC 970 processors (sometimes erroneously categorized under POWER5 by 3rd parties and at IBM--it would technically be closer to a POWER4). Despite POWER5+ and DDR2 already being used on the 285, the 185 took a few steps back and used DDR1 and didn&#39;t bother with the POWER chips. While this may seem rather strange, it can be explained with System p5 185 (7037-A50). Perhaps IBM wanted to create a machine of their own with the PPC 970 or it was stuck in developmental hell for a bit, whatever the case IBM used the 7037 guts to be modified into the IntelliStation 185. This move could have been done to offer a workstation that used less power and was quieter / while still maintaining AIX compatibility. Hundreds went to use in government offices and engineering firms; as a result they mainly show up in the U.S. and Japan.</p>

<p>Most of the POWER and AIX people don&#39;t even know that IBM badged the 970 under POWER and popped it into a workstation; therefore making the IntelliStation &#34;POWER&#34; 185 a source of confusion, horror and intrigue--and the fact it&#39;s relatively unknown means you&#39;ll get different responses as to what it can and cannot do. It is still a POWER system <b>in firmware</b>, and supports hardware virtualization like any other POWER system, which makes it completely different from a Power Mac G5 which uses the same CPU. If it didn&#39;t support hardware virtualization IBM wouldn&#39;t have been able to call the original System p5 185 a <i>System p5</i>... it would just be a plain PowerPC box. But this wasn&#39;t too unfamiliar as other AIX systems in the past also leveraged PowerPC chips like RS/6000s and PowerPC ThinkPads. I suspect the whole reason why the PowerPC 970MP had virtualization in the first place was because of IBM&#39;s exact requirement for this on their System p5 that they were intending to use it in (which Apple never did on the G5 as far as I know), and then of course Apple wanted AltiVec (which IBM didn&#39;t use in AIX as far as I know, but that doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t write AIX software to leverage it).</p>

<center><b><p>PowerPC 970MP running in single-core?</p></b></center>
<p>It may sound strange but the IntelliStation POWER 185 is in fact running the PowerPC 970MP &#34;dual core&#34; chip in single core mode. This is undocumented on the PPC 970MP datasheet and not implemented on anything else as far as I can tell. I&#39;m not exactly sure how this was achieved but it&#39;s either a hidden switch on the PPC970MP or a special switch done through firmware. The reason why this was done was to reduce the thermal requirements for a smaller system and smaller heatsink; as a work-around IBM then offered adding a second PowerPC 970MP in the IntelliStation 185 (also running in single-core mode) to simulate a &#34;dual-core&#34; PowerPC 970MP setup through two discreet chips instead of one.</p>

 
<center><b><p>7037-A50 or 7047-185, which came first</p></b></center>
<p>It&#39;s easy to tell the 7037-A50 came first based on the fact documentation always shows the system with a 7037 bezel instead of the characteristic one present on 7047: even on the IntelliStation POWER 185&#39;s service diagram on the metal door. Furthermore based on the timing, where IBM felt they needed a lower-end IntelliStation POWER to complement the already released 285 / why create a system from scratch when the upcoming  7037 design could be used. It gets somewhat interesting because this means the IntelliStation 185&#39;s bezel was designed after-the-fact, as a result that&#39;s why it is so thick on the front to compensate for the slanting that&#39;s characeristic of (most) IntelliStations. However, vendors and IBM constantly mix 7037 and 7047 in stock photos and documentation. The photo below shows a 7037 and you can see how it is inspired by 9228--oh and the bezel is flush against the front:</p>


<center><img src="https://gianluca.ai/ibmfiles/intellistation/p5-185.jpg"/></center>

<p>The story doesn&#39;t end there... System p5 185 sold *so* poorly (and was more work for IBM to support due to the PPC 970 that really should have never been considered p5) that IBM discontinued it a year after its release in 2007, while the IntelliStation 185 continued to be sold until 2009.</p>

 
<center><b><p>Deceptive as a Greyghost (PC Server 500)</p></b></center>

<p>The IntelliStation 185 POWER was aimed towards CAD running under AIX, and had a specific emphasis on quiet operations, as mentioned in the hardware announcement &#34;A quiet deskside form factor&#34;. Unlike System x and the IntelliStation 9228 (which is based on a System x), these run amazingly quiet for what they are--which begs the question why couldn&#39;t have IBM calibrated the cooling of System x like the POWER 185 as the design (internally) is very similar to 9228?* In fact the original external appearance of 7037-A50 could be confused with 9228; so there was some inspiration between the two. A lot of attention was put into the acoustics as the system is lined extensively with foam, unlike the 9228 or even 7382 which hails as one of the poorest &#39;acoustic&#39; performers and makes a similar sound to an IntelliStation POWER 285. The characteristic front fold baffle is also meant to reduce noise (and is actually a separate piece clipped in to the main bezel: the design would be rather complex to injection mold as a single piece).in).</p>

<p>*<i>I have confirmed System x towers can run fine with noctua fans / of course I suppose System x is not design to reside as a workstation, but still. The servers have thermal sensors so it would be VERY little effort for IBM to calibrate the fans at a slower RPM instead of hard-lining at a higher-than-necessary value--&#39;desktop mode&#39; could even be added to the UEFI. Even worse, the IntelliStation 6225 was never shipped with a rear fan when it&#39;s REALLY ideal to have one (else the FSB can get up to 90C), and when a rear fan is installed the controller throttles it down to a few *hundred* RPM. I suppose different engineers were involved with the RPM tuning on 7047-185, 7382, 9228, 9229 and 6225 so I shouldn&#39;t be that critical</i>.</p>

<p>Here with the IntelliStation POWER 185 opened up into pieces you can see the foam lining behind the front bezel along with the interior baffles being lined with foam. The foam on the front bezel was actually manually cut near the intake bezel to angle it off:</p>

<center><b><p>It&#39;s a workstation not a server</p></b></center>
<p>Some mistake the IntelliStation POWER 185 as a &#34;server&#34; or try to say that IntelliStation POWERs in general are servers, but it was always <u>meant</u> as an end-user workstation typically involving CAD or industrial design. The correct &#34;server&#34; product would be system type 7037-A50, the A50 was modified to perform as a server and not a CAD workstation / and also features some differences supported PCI add-ons. It&#39;s still hard to distinguish the two when the workstations are directly derived from the servers.</p>

<p>By all means you can use an IntelliStation POWER as a server, but then it&#39;s being under-utilizing for what it can really do and missing an opportunity for getting the most out of AIX as a &#34;desktop&#34; OS. Something which is rarely exhibited with the phasing out of the CAD components the IntelliStations first brought to the table.</p>


 
<center><b><p>UNIX high-end CAD meets its death</p></b></center>
<p>When the ancients roamed the earth (2006), Dassault Systemes ported CATIA V5 and V6 to AIX, most likely by request from IBM. What&#39;s weird about this is that you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find any references to CATIA being run on UNIX now, Dassault completely removed it but there&#39;s probably a story behind this as to why. If you go back to the Dassault Systemes website in early 2007, you&#39;ll see that they still reference support for Windows and all major flavours of UNIX--but there&#39;s one key phrase near the end where they say: &#34;Dassault Systemes has set up a certification program... (blah blah blah)... since the launch of V5, natively developed on windows NT Platform&#34;. At that point Windows XP 32-bit was the most commonly used variant, and while you could run XP 64-bit (and IBM did have native support for it on the IntelliStation 9228), XP 64-bit had so many problems so most users were stuck with 3.9 GB of RAM. Therefore if we were to assume that UNIX and said UNIX hardware offered way more memory, it starts to make sense (not to mention that the drivers and video cards would be extremely optimized and had features nVidia and ATI didn&#39;t offer*--at the time--). This may be even supported further from the POWER 185 RedBook where IBM states: &#34;<i>The addition of <b>native 64-bit capability</b> brings significant performance enhancements of CATIA V5 and ENOVIA DMU Navigator. Initial benchmarks indicate that for <b>memory-intensive operations</b>, such as analysis of large models, global performance is significantly increased. In addition, improvements to clash analysis greatly reduces processing times for analysis of large assemblies.</i>&#34; It&#39;s also worth pointing out that CATIA predates Windows, so Dassault probably rewrote V5 from scratch on NT.</p>
<p><i>*HP&#39;s HP-UX hardware being an exception since they just sloppily hacked in standard ATI cards / which means you wouldn&#39;t get the extra benefits of running a GXT6500 on AIX as you would with a FireGL X3 on HP-UX. HP probably had the lowest share of the UNIX CAD market so they probably felt little need to invest much R&amp;D: not to mention HP can&#39;t make a proper enterprise workstation or server ANYWAYS.</i></p>

<p>While the IntelliStation lineup was never involved with the sale of the PC division to Lenovo (and continued to press on for awhile), IBM dropped the x86 IntelliStations in 2006 and the POWER IntelliStations in 2009. Why did IBM bother to dedicate CAD resources to AIX when they were deliberately planning to phase out the platform? As established already, UNIX workstations were &#39;still a thing&#39; back then and had advantages over the terrible x86 machines at the time (Windows XP with Pentium 4), and it was profitable for IBM (along with HP, SGI and Sun) to manufacture such computers. When x64 Windows 7 rolled by various changes in the market happened alongside it: Sun and SGI went out of business, HP started downsizing and split their enterprise into HPE, and Dassault Systemes dropped support for CAITA on UNIX. The UNIX CAD market had the carpet pulled from underneath and now UNIX was set aside for even more specialized applications.</p>

<p>The IntelliStation POWER lineup left a few remnants which are still gawked at by users of newer POWER7/8 systems, such as the high-performance CAD GPUs. AIX has never again received high performance video cards / apparently some IBM customers have complained of this, but not enough to warrant development on better AIX graphics cards. As a result, for more realistic graphics performance AIX users continue to use the IntelliStation cards.</p>

<p>There is a story underneath the death march of AIX workstations, if you look carefully you&#39;ll notice the GXT6500P was originaly announced in 2002 (along with the IntelliStation POWER 265). <u>IBM never refreshed any of the GXT135P, GXT4500P and GXT6500P cards, still keeping them as &#34;current&#34; offerings for the IntelliStation POWER 185 and 285</u>. And soon as the last two of the POWER IntelliStations were made, other OEMs stopped making UNIX CAD stations and IBM quietly killed all IntelliStations, only leaving System x and System i behind (of course IBM has now even sold System x off in 2014 after the U.S. government reviewed the case as they used System x servers internally).</p>



 
<center><b><p>POWER Linux vs AIX on the IntelliStation POWER 185</p></b></center>
<p>Let&#39;s get it out of the way: many think AIX will be dead soon and stipulate IBM is wanting clients to all mass migrate to POWER Linux (in fact, Watson was even programmed in POWER Linux and not AIX). The truth of the matter is that AIX contains more features that IBM or anyone else does not add in Linux. For instance, going through the RedBooks and Hardware Announcement, the higher-end CAD cards are not supported under Linux, RAS is not supported, the sound card is not supported and it goes on and on. <b>In other words you&#39;re not going to use be using Linux for CAD, graphical operations or sound any time soon</b>. While it may &#39;seem&#39; IBM wants everyone on POWER Linux and not AIX, you can&#39;t use it as a workstation operating system unlike AIX.</p>

<p>Because the IntelliStation POWER 185 uses the aforementioned PowerPC 970, POWER Linux itself has limited support on the system. In the  June 23 2009 hardware announcement, IBM confirms that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 has dropped support for the PowerPC 970:</p>

<p>&#34;SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (SLES 11) for POWER supports all POWER5 and POWER6 technology-based systems with the exception of the OpenPower line of servers. It does not support any 970 based systems, which includes JS20, JS21, IBM System p5 185, and the IBM Intellistation POWER 185.&#34;</p>

<p>Whereas on AIX 7.1 PPC 970 is still supported (note that AIX 7.2 dropped it, but so was the IntelliStation POWER 285):</p>
<p>&#34;Only 64-bit Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) machines running selected PowerPC 970, POWER4, POWER5, POWER6, and POWER7 processors that implement the POWER architecture Platform Requirements (PAPR) are supported.&#34;</p>

<p>It&#39;s therefore far more logical to use AIX to get the most out of the IntelliStation&#39;s workstation-oriented hardware, since POWER Linux has virtually nothing to offer for graphics support. While AIX and UNIX workstations in general are dead, you won&#39;t see such features revisted on newer AIX hardware / and it&#39;s *completely* omitted under POWER Linux.</p>

<p><i>Meanwhile HPE and Intel seem to be having a hard time maintaining their Itanium contracts and want HP-UX to die / whereas AIX and POWER are in a much better position due to IBM&#39;s contributions to Linux and (now) OpenPOWER.</i></p>
