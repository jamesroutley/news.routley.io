<p dir="auto"><strong>It&#39;s unlikely that there will be any further releases of mt32-pi.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I have endured a sustained campaign of abuse from members of the VOGONS forum, been labelled a &#34;clout-chaser&#34;, had threats sent to my personal email address, code been used in other projects without proper accreditation, my 3D print designs stolen and sold by faceless eBay/Etsy sellers, personal attacks made towards me when people don&#39;t get their feature request... the list goes on and on.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>There is only so much I can take.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">My mental health has been in decline as a direct result of this behavior; the joy of working on this project has pretty much gone. There is nothing to be gained from putting time and hard work into it any more. There is no gratitude, no encouragement - just entitled behavior and grift.</p>
<p dir="auto">To those who supported this project in the past, especially whilst I was a struggling student who needed all the uplift I could get, thank you sincerely.</p>

<p dir="auto">🆕 If you have a Linux computer or MiSTer FPGA device, you may wish to try the new interactive <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/blob/075b52809e77420c6e80828825fe42430336b369/scripts">mt32-pi installer script</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Otherwise, for a manual installation:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the latest release from the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/releases">Releases</a> section.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you are <strong>updating an old version</strong>, read the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/Updating-mt32-pi">Updating mt32-pi</a> wiki page for the correct procedure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extract contents to a blank <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/SD-card-preparation">FAT32-formatted SD card</a>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Read the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/SD-card-preparation">SD card preparation</a> wiki page for hints on formatting an SD card correctly (especially under Windows).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For MT-32 support, add your MT-32 or CM-32L ROM images to the <code>roms</code> directory - you have to provide these for copyright reasons.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You will need at least one control ROM and one PCM ROM.</li>
<li>For information on using multiple ROM sets and switching between them, see the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/MT-32-synthesis">MT-32 synthesis</a> wiki page.</li>
<li>The file names or extensions don&#39;t matter; mt32-pi will scan and detect their types automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optionally add your favorite SoundFonts to the <code>soundfonts</code> directory.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For information on using multiple SoundFonts and switching between them, see the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/SoundFont-synthesis">SoundFont synthesis</a> wiki page.</li>
<li>Again, file names/extensions don&#39;t matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edit the <code>mt32-pi.cfg</code> file to enable any optional hardware (Hi-Fi DAC, displays, buttons). Refer to <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki">the wiki</a> to find supported hardware.
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>MiSTer users</strong>: Read the <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/MiSTer-FPGA%3A-Setup-and-usage">MiSTer setup</a> section of the wiki for the recommended configuration, and ignore the following two steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connect a <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/USB-MIDI-interfaces">USB MIDI interface</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/wiki/GPIO-MIDI-interface">GPIO MIDI circuit</a> to the Pi, and connect some speakers to the headphone jack.</li>
<li>Connect your vintage PC&#39;s MIDI OUT to the Pi&#39;s MIDI IN and (optionally) vice versa.</li>
</ol>
