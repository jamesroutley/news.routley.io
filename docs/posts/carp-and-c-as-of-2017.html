    <h1>Carp and C (as of 2017)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’ve written a bunch of blog posts about Carp now that have proved to be surprisingly popular, and people have been demanding follow-ups on a variety of subjects. One of the features that has been the subject of multiple requests is C interoperability, which has been notably absent from my <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html">whirlwind tour of the language</a>, mostly because the post was too long already. Today I want to fill that hole and show you both how C interop works, and how to write packages with a clean interface. To make it simple, I’ll use a package that I’ve already written which wraps <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/stdint">stdint</a>.</p>
<p>We’re not going to write much Carp today, instead focusing on the C side. I will guide you on how to write C that is suitable for interoperability, package it up nicely, and test it with the Carp testing library that is part of the standard library of Carp<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="api-prerequisites">API prerequisites</h2>
<p>Let’s get the API out of the way first, so that we can move on to the more interesting parts. You can register types, variables, and functions defined in C in your Carp code. You can also register macros if you pretend they’re either variables or functions, but that’s going to hurt pretty quickly, especially if you then try setting the variable or using the function in a higher-order context. What I’m saying is “don’t do that, unless you’re very sure you know what you’re doing”<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<pre><code>typedef int MyInt;

typedef struct MyStructure {
  MyInt member1;
  float member2;
} MyStructure;</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 1: A perfectly useless type definition.
</p>
<p>In Figure 1 we define two kinds of types, an alias and a struct. If we want to use those types in Carp, we have to register them. Observe their registration in Figure 2.</p>
<pre><code>; registering an opaque type
(register-type MyInt)

; registering a thin type
(register-type MyStructure [member1 MyInt, member2 Float])</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: The two ways of registering types.
</p>
<p>As you can see in Figure 2, there are two ways of registering types: you can either register “opaque types”, i.e. types that are black boxes for Carp, or “thin types”<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, i.e. types whose implementation is exposed to Carp. So what’s the difference?</p>
<p>Opaque types can only be used by the type system. No support structure will be generated for them, and, even if they’re only aliases, you will not be able to use them as you used the aliased types, as is the case for <code>MyInt</code> above. Integer addition will cease to work with them, and you’ll have to reimplement every operation you want to perform with them. And here’s the catch: as of the time of writing—the end of 2017—, you cannot define non-opaque type aliases. The <code>register-type</code> syntax only supports opaque types and structures. Bummer.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to the other way of registering types anyway. Thin types are quite comfortable to use, because registering them will also result in the creation of lenses implicitly. As I detailed in <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html">my first blog post on Carp</a>, lenses are functions for retrieving, setting, and updating members in a structure. This makes them easier to work with, and useful on their own.</p>
<pre><code>int MyInt_to_MINUS_int(MyInt x) {
  return (int) x;
}

MyInt MyInt_inc(MyInt x) {
  return x + 1;
}</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: Making <code>MyInt</code> less useless.
</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice in Figure 3 will be the somewhat awkward naming scheme of the functions. This had to happen because we mangle the names by hand, which is a bit tedious, but, in my opinion, bearable<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It will all start to make sense again when we look at Figure 4, in which we register the functions we’ve just created.</p>
<pre><code>(defmodule MyInt
  (register to-int (Fn [MyInt] Int))
  (register inc (Fn [MyInt] MyInt))
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: Modulizing C.
</p>
<p>What we’re doing here is demangling the name: the prefix <code>MyInt</code> will become the module name, the mangled symbol <code>_MINUS_</code> will become a dash, and so on. The isomorphism between Figure 3 and Figure 4 should still be somewhat apparent.</p>
<p>I know that the skin will crawl for some of you already. In our defense, we are well aware that nameclashes are perfectly possible with this mangling strategy, and <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/issues/120">there is a Github issue</a>. Maybe you’ll understand why we haven’t changed it yet when you read through it. Spoiler: it has to do with the fact that we’re mangling by hand and that would be more complicated if we adopted C++ style name mangling. Also there are conflicting standards, because nothing is ever easy.</p>
<p>Now that we have the tools to work C into our Carpentry, let’s try and do something useful with it!</p>
<h2 id="writing-fish-friendly-c">Writing fish-friendly C</h2>
<p>As I’ve said above we’re going to try and wrap <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/stdint.h.html">stdint.h</a>, or at least parts of it. A fuller implementation can be found in the Github repository I linked to in the beginning.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this blog post, let’s focus on <code>uint8_t</code>, the arithmetic operations that are defined on it, and its conversions to and from Strings and Ints.</p>
<p>First, we will have to define the data type. To make the type name idiomatic Carp, we alias it to <code>Uint8</code> in C.</p>
<pre><code>typedef uint8_t Uint8;</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: Renaming our type in C.
</p>
<p>In Carp, we register the type as an opaque type, because, as we remember from the last section, we cannot make a thin type from anything other than a struct. We will also have to include the C file. In my native modules—which are the canonical and only examples for now—I decide to put all the native code into a <code>lib</code> directory, and if I need more than one Carp file, put them in a <code>src/</code> directory. I’ve put the C above in a file called <code>stdint_helper.h</code> inside <code>lib</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(local-include &#34;../lib/stdint_helper.h&#34;)

(register-type Uint8)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: Registering our type in Carp.
</p>
<p>The <code>..</code> is necessary for now, because the compiler will put all of the build files into a directory called <code>out</code>. This is subject to change in the future; your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s define some functions, starting with converters from and to integers and the mathematical functions <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>. While we’re at it, we can also define the comparison operations <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;core.h&gt;

Uint8 Uint8_from_MINUS_int(int x) { return (Uint8)x; }
int Uint8_to_MINUS_int(Uint8 x) { return (int)x; }

Uint8 Uint8__PLUS_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x + y; }
Uint8 Uint8__MINUS_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x - y; }
Uint8 Uint8__MUL_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x * y; }
Uint8 Uint8__DIV_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x / y; }

bool Uint8__EQ_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x == y; }
bool Uint8__LT_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x &lt; y; }
bool Uint8__GT_(Uint8 x, Uint8 y) { return x &gt; y; }</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 7: Registering functions on our types.
</p>
<p>As you can see, we do a fair amount of mangling by hand, replacing the actual operator symbols with their mangled names. Because we use the <code>bool</code> type, which is not part of C by default, and we will need it in the future, we also include the <code>core</code> header which is supplied by Carp. The Carp compiler will ensure that it is on the path at compilation time.</p>
<p>These are repetitive, but necessary. The amount of repetition could also be decreased by using C macros, but I chose not to for our sake. This is but a tutorial after all.</p>
<p>In Carp land, we register all of the functions we just defined. Because we prefixed them with the type name, we can do so in a module. We will also define a few functions based on our new primitives.</p>
<pre><code>(defmodule Uint8
  (register from-int (λ [Int] UInt8))
  (register to-int (λ [UInt8] Int))

  (register = (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Bool))
  (register &gt; (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Bool))
  (register &lt; (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Bool))
  (register + (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Uint8))
  (register - (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Uint8))
  (register * (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Uint8))
  (register / (λ [Uint8 Uint8] Uint8))

  (defn &gt;= [a b] (not (&lt; a b)))
  (defn &lt;= [a b] (not (&gt; a b)))
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 8: A beautiful Carp module.
</p>
<p>This is a little bit contrived—usually we would like to have <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> as primitives—, but it is nice to see that composition and building upwards are in fact possible.</p>
<p>To showcase how we allocate memory, let’s add an implementation of the <code>str</code> interface. The <code>str</code> interface is the generic way of converting a data type to a <code>String</code> and, thus, quite useful. For this, we need to allocate some data. Luckily, <code>core.h</code> provides us with just the right function: <code>CARP_MALLOC</code>.</p>
<pre><code>string Uint8_str(Uint8 x) {
    char *buffer = CARP_MALLOC(64);
    snprintf(buffer, 64, &#34;Uint8(%hhu)&#34;, x);
    return buffer;
}</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 9: A naive stringification for our datatype.</p>
<p>To cut a few corners, we will just allocate 64 bytes. This will be plenty, even wasteful, but for our purposes it is good enough. We also define our format to be <code>Uint8(&lt;data&gt;)</code>, so that we know whether it is a regular <code>Int</code> or one of our types. This is not required, but I consider it good practice. An alternative way of writing that is with S-expressions, i.e. as <code>(Uint8 &lt;data&gt;)</code>, but I seem to default to the first one; maybe I’m just not a good Lisper after all.</p>
<p>We can register that function like any other function in Carp. When we use it in our code, Carp will ensure that our program does not leak and our string will be deallocated.</p>
<p>Before we move on to the other aspects of writing packages in Carp, namely packaging and testing, let me have another word about allocations. Currently, Carp uses the system allocator. This means that on some embedded systems, using <code>CARP_MALLOC</code> will result in compilation errors. In these cases, our advice is to refrain from using it and compiling with <code>--no-core</code>, which will prevent the core library from getting loaded. Currently, there is no alternative drop-in replacement for embedded systems. We hope this will be resolved sooner or later, but it is not an immediate priority, and we request your patience.</p>
<h2 id="packaging">Packaging</h2>
<p>I talked a little bit about package structure earlier. Now I want to give you a more complete picture of the project layout I use, and why I use it. In general, I like to be very explicit about structure and err on the side of too many folders. Again, this is just my personal style, but it seems to work.</p>
<pre><code>.
├── README.md
├── lib
├── my_top_level_module.carp
├── src
└── tests</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 10: A tree view of my project structure.
</p>
<p>The top level always stays the same in my Carp projects. I have a <code>README.md</code> with a—hopefully informative—outline of the project, what it does, and how to get it. Because Carp does not yet have a package manager, working with external packages involves a lot of cloning from Github.</p>
<p>I then provide you with three directories, of which two are optional. The <code>tests</code> directory is there, and it shouldn’t be optional—although I’ve been known to break my own rules, especially when I’m just dabbling. Depending on the complexity of the project, we will also want a <code>lib</code> directory for any C headers, and a <code>src</code> directory for any source file that our top level project file uses.</p>
<p>I usually exclude the <code>out</code> directory from git through an entry in <code>.gitignore</code>. Some people like to push build artifacts, but they are subject to change even in a “transpiled” language like Carp.</p>
<p>This entire layout is nothing new. It is the standard layout in many other languages, and it works well. I am currently working on the most urgent prerequisites for a package manager, and once that one is in the works, I hope to be able to codify a simple, extensible, one-size-fits-all way of organizing projects. Again I have to ask you to be patient with us.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Once we’ve found a way of organizing our sources, and maybe written a little bit of glue code to get started, we will want to start writing tests. Even in a module like <code>Uint8</code> that is largely driven by already-working C code we at least need some smoke tests that tell us that everything is hooked up correctly. So, let’s write a few!</p>
<pre><code>(load &#34;Test.carp&#34;)
(use Test)

(load &#34;stdint.carp&#34;)
(use Uint8)

(defn main []
  (with-test test
    (assert-equal test
                  (from-int 3)
                  (- (from-int 2) (from-int -1))
                  &#34;subtraction seems to work&#34;
    )
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 11: Writing our first test.
</p>
<p>This test file assumes to be compiled from the project’s top level directory, for example through <code>carp -x tests/&lt;filename&gt;</code>. This should pass, and leave a bit of hopeful green text for us to think of when our tests start to fail. From here, we can build up a more or less complete battery of tests like <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/stdint/blob/master/tests/uint8.carp">this one</a>. You’ll likely find fewer test cases than you would like in my test suites, but I take care to test all of the functions at least once. You are most welcome to write more than the bare minimum, though.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I hopefully gave you enough of a taste of what it’s like to write a Carp module, with C extensions or not, to build up confidence so that you can also try experimenting. While most of the work on Carp is contributed back to the compiler or standard library these days, this is by far not the only way to get started with it. You can write own projects and experiments in Carp, and even structure them in such a way that makes it easy for other Carpenters to reuse them.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions, suggestions or comments, holler at me via mail!</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> Full disclosure: it was written by yours truly.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> As programmers we should be acquainted with the fact that we rarely truly know what we’re doing, even if we’re sure of it.</p>
<p><span id="3">3.</span> I’m making up the lingo as I go here, don’t blame me.</p>
<p><span id="4">4.</span> I hope that someone will throw a nifty preprocessor or something our way, but as of now I’m perfectly content with the mechanisms as they are. They are way better than all of the FFIs that I’ve designed, anyway.</p>
