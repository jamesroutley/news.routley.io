The document also says any face photos taken by the app, called Mobile Fortify, will be stored for 15 years, including those of U.S. citizens.</p><p>The document provides new details about the technology behind Mobile Fortify, how the data it collects is processed and stored, and DHS’s rationale for using it. On Wednesday <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-and-cbp-agents-are-scanning-peoples-faces-on-the-street-to-verify-citizenship/"><u>404 Media reported</u></a> that both ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are scanning peoples’ faces in the streets to verify citizenship.</p>
