<h2 id="starting-off">Starting off</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/roots.webp" alt="The Roots"/></p>
<p>It all began with an interest in learning how to use Arduinos. After a few years
of working on <a href="https://brooklynrobotfoundry.com">robot foundry</a>’s design team
(and many years prior as a student!) building an assortment of simple-circuit
powered robots, my desire to implement microcontrollers and programming to a
larger-scale personal project had been growing. I’d procured a few years of
coding experience at the time, but had never before gone about integrating that
experience with hardware. So, I decided to buy myself a small knock-off eBay
arduino, and chose to learn how to program it though a project-based approach
(as usual). While some people go about learning the language with simple LEDs,
buttons, and perhaps a servo or two, as usual I was more interested in a
productive and larger scale introductory project. After much brainstorming, I
stumbled upon the idea of somehow automating the care of a plant. The idea would
be to somehow control the lights and water automatically and dynamically, so
that the plant could grow for long periods of time without any human
involvement. It seemed like a fun project, and so I dove in, beginning with the
most fun decision in the process: choosing what to grow. At the time, it was
just a small educational project, but since then it’s scaled farther than I ever
anticipated.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/strawberry_tower.webp" alt="Strawberry Grow Tower"/></p>
<p>As I began my research, I realized that I was actually more enticed by the
concept of the project (mass-garden-automation) than the actual implementation
of the Arduino. Learning a custom and slightly esoteric programming language
wasn’t something that particularly interested me, but having infinite access to
edible plants was very enticing. Though I’d start out the project with a simple
Arduino-based system, later on, as will be explained, I moved away from the
microcontroller and chose a larger-scale redundant system for the plant
automation system. For the research process, I started out by exploring fast
growing, easily maintainable plants. I really wanted to grow avocados, but they
take a very long time to grow and generally are full sized trees. There is,
however, a specific variety of avocado called
<a href="https://minnetonkaorchards.com/wurtz-avocado-tree/">wartz avocados</a> that are
smaller, but one issue that quickly came to my attention is that once they reach
maturity, which could take a very long time, the avocados themselves take a
while to regenerate between harvests. Greens like spinach seemed to be popular
choices for the type of system I was planning on making, but I wanted a crop
that I could easily preserve over the long term, and unfortunately greens lose
their texture when frozen. Berries seemed to be an appealing choice, given their
quick germination and grow time, and so I eventually settled on strawberries.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/howRelaysWork_0001.gif" alt="How a relay works"/></p>
<p>Ultimately I settled on strawberries specifically, since I found that there are
fairly common
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Creation-Strawberries-Vegetables-Succulents/dp/B07BSX6R31">stackable grow towers</a>
readily available. The nice thing about the towers is that I could scale them to
perfectly fit my closet, and could easily add more towers as needed. I ordered
some generic strawberry seeds, and got to work cleaning out my closet. I lined
the floor with a plastic garbage bag to prevent moisture from damaging the wood
floor, and bought a
<a href="https://us.govee.com/products/wireless-water-leak-detector">Govee brand water leak detector</a>
in case of any emergency spills. I sectioned off the right half of the closet
for the tower and then set up a large bucket with fertilizer-water and affixed
the arduino to the inside wall of the closet with velcro. Parsing together some
code snippets I found online I figured out enough Arduino to set up a system for
automatically dispersing water when the soil dried up using a soil moisture
sensor, and covered the closet walls in tin foil with the hope of maximizing the
amount of light hitting the plants. I purchased a small relay, a device that
lets a low power device like an Arduino toggle an external power connection to
higher power devices, and ran the positive wire of an extension cord across it,
so I could control the lights automatically with the same system. Cutting the
extension cord felt a bit scary, but it seemed to work so I didn’t overthink it.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/strawberry_tubing.webp" alt="The strawberry apparatus"/></p>
<p>With everything complete and operational, the seeds did indeed germinate as
anticipated, but the watering system didn’t go according to plan. As time
progressed, it didn’t water often enough, and when I tinkered with the watering
threshold it tended to over-water and cause spillage. To compensate, I ended up
needing to manually water from time to time, which defeated the whole point of
the project. So, I ended up pivoting to timer-based-watering, which worked,
though it was slightly less precise.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/cheapGrowLights_0001.jpg" alt="Cheap grow lights"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/betterGrowLight_0001.jpg" alt="Better grow lights"/></p>
<p>For the grow lights, I started out with a cheap Amazon grow light, but that
didn’t last long. After only a few days in the PSU melted itself, but since I
had planned for the worst, it simply tripped my GFCI outlet (I ran an extension
cord from a specially-protected laundry machine outlet, which has auto-shutoff
for this sort of thing) and shut itself off. The replacement lights I bought
were definitely better, but still weren’t bright enough for the flourishing
strawberries, so I ended up again purchasing higher quality more powerful bar
lights. This third choice worked well, but it heated up my closet to an ambient
85 and drew 90 watts of power. The expense was notable (probably around $10-15 a
month of extra power usage), but less than the quantity of strawberries I was
expecting the plants to yield.</p>
<h2 id="success-ish">Success-ish</h2>

<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/strawberries.webp" alt="Strawberry Fruit"/></p>
<p>Within a few weeks the plants were off to a great start: they began branching
out and runners (technically they’re called
<a href="https://strawberry.calpoly.edu/runner-cutter">stolons</a>), which are baby plants
attached to the mother plant, started shooting out of the lower parts of the
stems. Cutting them off turned out to be important, since they took significant
energy away from the plant’s fruit production, and it quickly became a daily
chore. This is definitely something I’d take into account for future plants,
since it was quite tedious. On a few occasions I placed pots next to the plant
to clone it, for strawberry-plant-gifts. Flowers eventually appeared on the
plants, and then the first few fruits sprung out. I began using a basic
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Gro-2000992-Water-Soluble-Purpose/">“miracle gro”</a>
fertilizer at this stage, worried that the soil would be depleted of nutrients
with the new fruit. The strawberries were indeed juicy, bright red, and
aesthetically perfect.</p>
<h3 id="mold">Mold</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/moldyLeaves_0001.jpg" alt="Moldy leaves"/></p>
<p>The success unfortunately didn’t last much more than a few weeks, which is when
the mold started. A slight white powder type mold began appearing on the
undersides of leaves, and it quickly spread to the entire plant. It seemed that
it was “powdery mildew” that I was dealing with. I added a small dehumidifier
from Amazon, and drilled a hole in the water tank to redirect the collected
water back into the plant watering reservoir, which actually helped reduce the
need to water the plant as often as an added bonus. I bought Neem oil as a
natural fungicide to protect the edibility of the fruit, but it was futile at
stopping the mold and only did so much as deter flies. In such a moist, enclosed
setting, with plants growing in dirt, fungus was inevitable, but it got quite
bad. Unfortunately I had to cave to a powerful toxic synthetic fungicide, which
almost overnight completely ridded the plants of fungus, but had effectively
made them ornamental for months to come. In the meantime I began planning for
the next season, contriving a solution to prevent the fungus before it were to
start. To me, the culprit was clear: it was the soil. I’d have to go dirt-less.</p>

<h2 id="the-transition">The Transition</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/germinatingSeeds_0001.webp" alt="Germinating basil plants"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/germinatingSeedsLightOn_0001.webp" alt="Lights on"/></p>
<p>Through the previous strawberry endeavor, I learned a lot. Keeping the
environment clean is key, and consistency maximizes yield. Before setting up the
next crop, I moved the strawberries out onto a deck, and completely bleached out
the closet to kill all residual mold. While the Arduino was fun to tinker with,
it’d be in the best interest of the plants to go with a more robust and
consistent system this next time around. For the upcoming crop, I chose to
implement hydroponics, a technique wherein the plants grow with their roots
directly in nutrient water or mist, eliminating the need for soil. Hydroponics
is really neat since the plants grow on average 30% faster and use up to 10x
less water. I also opted for
<a href="https://southernag.com/product/garden-friendly-fungicide/">preventative biofungicide</a>,
which utilizes naturally occurring soil bacteria that ‘eat’ fungus: a fungicide
that’s not only non-toxic to humans, but scientifically proven effective. For
the seeds, I bought generic basil seeds, which I’d soon realize was highly
unideal. And, for the germination medium, I went with rockwool (instead of a
make-shift paper towel like I did for the strawberries). Rockwool is a fluffy
stuffing-like material, used most frequently in insulation, but also commonly
botanically.</p>
<h2 id="assembled-grow-tower">Assembled Grow Tower</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/basil_tower.webp" alt="Basil grow rack"/></p>
<p>For my first attempt, I decided to go with an Amazon
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787F9LG7/">basil grow rack</a>, since it
claimed to provide an all-in-one system that could assemble quickly and easily.
A bit weary of leakage, I carefully put it together, and placed my basil seeds
into the included grow pods. For the first few weeks, while figuring out ideal
nutrient ratios and water acidity, the basil did successfully began growing.
However, I quickly ran into a roadblock: the small tubes were being jammed by
the ever-growing plants’ roots. The larger they got, the more unwieldy the
system became, and the less water they received. Moreover, cleaning the system
was virtually impossible without removing all the plants and disassembling the
tubes, since the roots were jamming themselves in the tubes. Unfortunately, I
needed to change gears, but, on the brighter side, I did establish hydroponic
basil as a plant with potential.</p>
<h2 id="custom-vertical-tower">Custom Vertical Tower</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/hydroponic_grow_tower.webp" alt="Hydroponic vertical grow tower"/></p>
<p>The first idea for the overhaul was to build a vertical
<a href="https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/building-a-vertical-hydroponic-tower.html">hydroponic grow tower</a>.
In the setup, a pump would turn on every 10 minutes for 10 minutes, carrying
water to the top of the system, and letting it drip on and drench the roots.
Vertical systems like the one pictured don’t require an additional air system,
since the roots are constantly exposed to direct air. Another key advantage is
space efficiency: whereas in typical systems the plants height is limited
because of bushing tendencies, with a vertical system the space of my closet
could be maximized by having multiple towers of the height of my closet. Instead
of buying a kit this time, I made my own vertical system by drilling holes along
a large PVC tube, and then placing smaller segments of tube within the holes.
Unfortunately the product didn’t work out, since my pump was so powerful as to
propel water out and along the edges of the tube, wetting the outside of the
central tower and fostering algae. Additionally, the tower itself was
particularly difficult to keep upright, even amidst many ropes and wires, and
since this setup involves water dripping down the central tube, it was extremely
loud. It was disappointing, but I wasn’t defeated. It was time for another
method.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/deepWaterCulture.webp" alt="Deep water culture system"/></p>
<p>My first success: deep water culture (DWC) hydroponics. In DWC hydroponics,
plant roots are suspended in a nutrient-rich water solution, with airstones
constantly pumping air into the water, allowing the roots to maximally absorb
the nutrients and minerals. The system itself is extremely simple on paper, but
requires managing large reservoirs of liquid—ensuring that they hover around the
right acidity level, that there’s the right fertilizer amount, and that they
stay fungus-free. The approach seemed much more feasible than any of my prior
systems, since I’d just need a few bins and grow baskets. Agog to proceed, I got
to work planning.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/grow_baskets.webp" alt="Grow baskets"/></p>
<p>To start, I purchased
<a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Style-Selections-30-Gallon-120-Quart-Gray-Tote-with-Standard-Snap-Lid/1000183149">three large storage containers from Lowes</a>.
While food safety is obviously of importance, food grade bins are astronomically
expensive, so I settled on bins with food-safe plastic composition, even though
they weren’t technically rated food grade. My plan was to use a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZRVM7WM/">super large 3” drill bit</a> and
some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CGVL9FW">3” grow baskets</a> filled with pebbles
to hold the plants in place. The air pumps I used were initially small bubblers,
but, after later learning that 1 wat of air pumping power per liter of liquid is
the general practice in hydroponics, went with
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078H92695/">two commercial air pumps</a>. Since
they were extremely loud, I also threw in some
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042U92TE/">vibration dampening pads</a> that
cut down on the sound a bit, and placed a dollar-store fan above the air pumps
to prevent overheating.</p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/baby_pepper.webp" alt="Baby plants"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/early_growth.webp" alt="Early growth"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/pruning_basil.webp" alt="Pruning basil"/></p>
<p>The system was all set up, so now all that was left was to wait. The plants
germinated flawlessly, and were quickly ready to be placed into the
pebble-stuffed grow cups. The tanks were full and fertilized, and the air pumps
and lights’ timers had been configured properly in advance. The new DWC setup
worked like magic, requiring extremely low maintenance and yielding extremely
high loads of basil. Unlike my strawberries, there was no soil involved, so the
setup was significantly cleaner and more maintainable. Something that I quickly
learned is that basil <strong>requires</strong> meticulous pruning to maximize yield, which
explains why the basil from my previous tower-approach grew as vertical stalks.
By cutting between the leaf stalks, I was able to get the plant to branch out
into a bush, rather than the tall stalks I had in my older systems. With such
rapid growth, the harvests quickly began rolling in. It was finally time to
start producing pesto.</p>
<h2 id="pesto-production">Pesto Production</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/frozen_pesto.webp" alt="Pesto-packed freezer"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/a_harvest.webp" alt="A harvest"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/pesto_bowl.webp" alt="Bowl of pesto"/></p>
<p>While indeed the basil tasted great as a salad mix-in and pasta topper, pesto
was the inevitable real deal. It was one of the primary reasons I chose basil:
as the plants grew beyond my appetite, it’d be super easy to freeze the final
product. For the first few rounds of pesto, I kept it super simple, just
blending together basil, salt, and a bit of olive oil and garlic. As the batches
went on, I started getting more creative, experimenting with adding walnuts and
almonds, along with weirder ingredients like kale and hot peppers. Each week I
reaped around 2 cups of pesto, which I froze in ice cube molds and then zip
locked, so that I could microwave one cube at a time as needed. Over the weeks,
the freezer filled with pesto, and, even two years later we still have a
seemingly endless supply.</p>
<h2 id="basily-takeaways">Basily Takeaways</h2>
<p>The deep water culture system seemed to be the best route, yielding the greatest
amount of basil while being extremely easy to maintain. I decided to keep up the
system for a few years, slowly building off of prior years by improving the
setup. I switched to
<a href="https://extension.umn.edu/disease-management/basil-downy-mildew">special basil seeds</a>,
which have been bred to be resistant to the most common basil illness downy
mildew. During my first few years I worried that the basil had mites, but
shortly learned that they were in fact the buds of roots. I also spraypainted
the bins with a layer of opaque black, followed by two layers of white, to
prevent light from penetrating the water and causing algae. I also upgraded my
air stone system to new, larger disc airstones, which provide a much steadier
and higher quality flow of air. I also installed a fan in the ceiling of the
closet, along with two smaller fans on the walls, aimed at the plants and
machinery. Since the fans use lots of electricity, they are set on timers to
turn off an hour after the lights, and on when the lights turn on. And finally,
I’ve switched my rope out paracord, which is much more durable, easier to work
with, and overall sleeker.</p>

<h2 id="the-choice">The choice</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/new_cording.webp" alt="Current setup"/></p>
<p>With my optimized system already assembled and ready for the next year’s plant,
I’ve entered research mode once more. Basil was great because of how rapidly it
grew, but, equally important, that its product (pesto) could be frozen. Surfing
through the vast array of potential hydroponic candidates, including tomatos,
bell peppers, lettice, spinach, and more, I eventually settled on Shishito
peppers. They were the perfect match: tasty, roast-able, and freezable. And,
most importantly, unlike many other types of peppers, they’re particularly fast
growing.</p>
<h2 id="progress-1">Progress</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/outside_closet_view_of_peppers.webp" alt="Peppers (exterior view)"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/peppers_side_view.webp" alt="Peppers (side view)"/></p>
<p>Since germination, the peppers have been growing rapidly, day after day. After
some research, I learned that in the past I’d been using way less fertilizer
than I could have been, so I’ve increased my concentration. Additionally, I
quickly learned that the new, cheaper tubing that I purchased this year was
completely unsuitable for my purposes, as the acidic water quickly ate away at
the plastic, and the tubing began to leak. My check valves (valves that you put
on a tube that force water to only travel in one direction) worked, preventing
the water from entering the expensive electric air pumps, but still allowed the
water to leak onto my floor. Luckily I’d installed some water sensors on the
floor, and was able to quickly dry the floor. Since this incident, I moved the
air pumps to a higher location (even though the check valves worked, I was
scared of the possibility of them not working, and having the water pumps higher
up would make it impossible for the water to backflow into the pumps). I
switched to a much higher quality PVC clear tubing, and have had no issues
since.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/peppers_side_view_lights_on.webp" alt="Lights on!"/></p>
<p>At this point there are no actual peppers on the plants. The fertilizer I’ve
been using is optimized for foliage growth, so I’m fairly certain that that has
been why the peppers haven’t begun to grow. Soon I’ll be switching to a
different fertilizer, which is optimized for fruit growth, which should
kickstart flowering. After a bit of research, I’ve also come to find that
peppers require pollination in order to produce fruit, so, while there is indeed
a notable wind current in the closet due to the fans, it may not be enough, and
I may need to learn how to manually pollinate the plants. Since this is an
ongoing project, I’ll be sure to keep updating this post as the peppers grow
(and hopefully eventually make it into my freezer [and stomach!]).</p>  </div> </astro-slot></div></div>
