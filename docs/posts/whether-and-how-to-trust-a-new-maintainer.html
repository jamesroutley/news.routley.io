<h3 data-block-key="u59cx">4: What if you don&#39;t have time?</h3><p data-block-key="9jvtc">I&#39;ve laid out a lot of ideas for checking a candidate&#39;s trustworthiness. But what if you don&#39;t have time to do any of that? What if the core reason you need to delegate and leave is because you are a solo maintainer with no time?</p><p data-block-key="6qgi7">(A few maintainer collectives or groups of projects have developed safety-net volunteer groups that can take over projects, which are <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/help/issues/196#issuecomment-1857153782">variations</a> on the model that the currently-stagnating <a href="https://jazzband.co/">Jazzband</a> initiative popularized. But if your ecosystem doesn&#39;t already have a safety net like this, and you don&#39;t have enough time to keep your project maintained, you probably don&#39;t have time to do social infrastructure work like starting a local Jazzband-like.)</p><p data-block-key="eoge4">I suggest three options, in the following order.</p><p data-block-key="46q0r"><b>#1: ask for resources</b>. What would you need to help the project move forward? Coaching, money, administrative assistance, testing infrastructure, mentorship for new contributors, something else? I&#39;ve written about things you could ask for, and how to ask for them:</p><ul><li data-block-key="5tc4v"><a href="http://changeset.nyc/stuckness/">five ways open source projects get stuck</a></li><li data-block-key="8gelt"><a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/sidestepping-the-pr-bottleneck-four-non-dev-ways-to-support-your-upstreams/">four non-development ways your users can support you</a></li><li data-block-key="6lt25"><a href="https://docs.oscollective.org/guides/recruiting-financial-sponsors">a step-by-step how-to guide to recruiting financial sponsors</a> (caution: this will likely take at least 10 hours of work)</li></ul><p data-block-key="cthfh">And <a href="https://tidelift.com/lifter/search">look for your package on Tidelift</a> to see whether some monthly income is waiting for you (<a href="https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/maven/com.101tec:zkclient">example</a>).</p><p data-block-key="6t6nl">These resources could free up your time so you can concentrate on maintaining the project. So ask for help:</p><ul><li data-block-key="dqup">in the <code>README</code></li><li data-block-key="4i6tb">on the project&#39;s website, if there is one</li><li data-block-key="4th09">in release notes</li><li data-block-key="9e6r8">on your social media channels</li><li data-block-key="o0r9">in replies to people&#39;s requests, questions, patches, and bug reports on the mailing list, in chat, and on forges such as GitHub (for example, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7279#issuecomment-721064051">my comments in 2020 on CI for pip</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139#issuecomment-758882979">in 2021 on a requested pip feature</a>.)</li></ul><p data-block-key="djh9h">Let&#39;s say that doesn&#39;t work. You could:</p><p data-block-key="7fsa1"><b>#2</b>: perform a <b>hasty check and public handover</b>. Find an existing contributor who is willing to be the new maintainer. Do the bare minimum to confirm that the candidate shows no obvious signs that it would be a bad idea to trust them, and announce the handover in public, in the places a reasonable person would look for that notification.</p><p data-block-key="e6lop">What&#39;s the bare minimum? Here&#39;s what I think:</p><ul><li data-block-key="c09o">Do a web search for their username and another for their main email address, and spend 10-15 minutes poking around to look for big red flags. Have they been banned from other projects? Do they habitually post hate speech?</li><li data-block-key="662ho">Ask for their wallet name; if they&#39;re willing to share it, spend 5 minutes on that web search too. Have they been convicted of embezzling? Are they affiliated with a hate group?</li><li data-block-key="2aef6">Mention the candidate privately to 2-3 other open source maintainers. They&#39;ll likely speak up if they&#39;ve heard gossip about the candidate or had bad experiences themselves.</li><li data-block-key="ebi7h">Review the candidate&#39;s past contributions to your project. Have they done anything obviously negligent when they should have known better? Take about 15 minutes to do this.</li></ul><p data-block-key="736mi">And where should you announce it?</p><ul><li data-block-key="a1evq">the <code>README</code></li><li data-block-key="2d2g1">the project&#39;s website, if there is one</li><li data-block-key="6g6dq">the release notes for the first release under new management</li><li data-block-key="btb1s">your social media channels</li></ul><p data-block-key="5gkb6">But: let&#39;s say you don&#39;t have any maintainer candidates, or you are just so done with this project that you cannot face the work of the check and handover. In that case:</p><p data-block-key="e2mg3"><b>#3: archive the project and announce it&#39;s done</b>.</p><p data-block-key="a4d13">You do not <i>need</i> to find a successor.</p><p data-block-key="4r783">Archive the project -- leave the code publicly accessible, but move it to an &#34;archived&#34; state however your forge allows .<a href="https://github.com/pypa/easy_install">For instance</a>, GitHub lets you make a repository a read-only archive. Renew the domain name for a couple years, but turn off auto-renewal.</p><p data-block-key="9jbrd">Before you hit that Archive button, change the <code>README</code>, add <a href="http://unmaintained.tech/">the No Maintenance Intended badge</a>, and publish a final release whose release notes explicitly say that this is the last version. On PyPI you can set a <a href="https://pypi.org/classifiers/">classifier in the metadata</a> for &#34;Development Status :: 7 - Inactive&#34; to better set user expectations (<a href="https://pypi.org/search/?c=Development+Status+%3A%3A+7+-+Inactive">examples</a>). And announce the conclusion and deprecation of the project on any social media channels and (if there is one) the project website. Announce on <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day (the next one is June 20th)</a> if it helps.</p><p data-block-key="9rc90">If you&#39;ve already asked for support, and you haven&#39;t gotten what you need, <b>you do not owe your downstreams a smooth transition to a successor maintainer or project</b>. And here&#39;s why.</p><p data-block-key="e4hss">As I said in my <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2023/user-support-equanimity-potential-cross-project-tools-practices-open-source/">&#34;infrastructure of equanimity&#34; post</a>:</p><blockquote data-block-key="3j3l7">Each maintainer has to seriously reflect on <b>power and economics</b> enough to develop their own <b>analysis of their freedoms and obligations</b> within open source, and the freedoms and obligations of others. This ought to be nuanced enough to differentiate between users who contribute to sustaining the project and users who do not, and to acknowledge that maintainers have power over users unless they actively work to have power <i>with</i> those users.</blockquote><p data-block-key="elsuq">Your users had the chance to support you. They still have choices. They could collectively decide to fork your project and co-maintain it, or hire a vendor to do so. Of course this would be easier if we had a pre-existing template and tools for them to gather, decide, and implement that decision, <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2021/what-would-open-source-look-like-if-it-were-healthy-video-transcript/#healthy-oss-legacy-ending">as I discussed in &#34;What Would Open Source Look Like If It Were Healthy?&#34;</a>. But they could do it, and it&#39;s not your fault if they don&#39;t.</p><p data-block-key="8rt2c">Many businesses and volunteer organizations choose to shut down. Sometimes that&#39;s because of lack of resources, and/or because they can&#39;t find any successor leaders trustworthy enough to steward the project, and they don&#39;t want to betray their users/customers/etc. who have come to trust a particular brand reputation. If you need help deciding whether a conscious and caring closure is right for your project, <a href="https://www.wind-down.org/">my friend Camille E. Acey has a new initiative called The Wind Down that you should check out</a>.</p><p data-block-key="67jc9">In your sunsetting announcement, you can even mention that you&#39;re interested in anointing a successor, but that the successor <b>will not get</b> your repository, nor the namespace of your package in the package manager (e.g. they won&#39;t own &#34;example&#34; in PyPI). This then forces your downstreams to make their own choices of whom to trust.</p><p data-block-key="3euut">Another thing that your users could do: publish their own analyses of potential replacements. Someone else can blog about why you should go with the fork of &#34;<code>example</code>&#34; that&#39;s called &#34;<code>example2</code>&#34; and why that maintainer seems trustworthy. If they are right, then likely other major distributions, downstream users, etc. will pick that up and share that recommendation till it becomes a bit of conventional wisdom.</p><p data-block-key="cmms1">If you do later notice a successor project that seems good, you can probably un-archive the <code>README</code> long enough to add that pointer and then re-archive it.</p><h3 data-block-key="itq6">Hope that helps</h3><p data-block-key="ctfpb">I’m Sumana Harihareswara, and I can help you implement these recommendations through my consultancy, <a href="http://changeset.nyc/">Changeset Consulting</a>; I do project management, <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/some-upcoming-availability-talks-and-coaching/">coaching</a>, training workshops, and more.
