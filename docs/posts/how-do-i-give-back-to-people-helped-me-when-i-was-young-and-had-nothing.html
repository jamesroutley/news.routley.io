    <h1>Ask HN: How do I give back to people helped me when I was young and had nothing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Throughout my career, I&#39;ve received incredible kindness and inspiration from experienced people - professors, and strangers who invested time in me when I feel like I had little to offer in return. While I always express gratitude and try to pay it forward, I often feel there&#39;s still an imbalance. I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life.</p><p>How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on (when you literally have nothing...haha)?
What forms of gratitude have you found most meaningful?</p><p>Appreciate any comments.</p></div></td></div></div>
