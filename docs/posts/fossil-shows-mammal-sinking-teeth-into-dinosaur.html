    <h1>Fossil shows mammal sinking teeth into dinosaur</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Whether they had sharp teeth, vicious claws or were simply enormous, dinosaurs were creatures to be feared. But a newly identified fossil shows that, at least sometimes, the underdog bit back.</p><p>Experts revealed the 125m-year-old fossil that froze in time after being taken on by a small mammal a third of its size. They are tangled together, the mammal’s teeth sunk into the beaked dinosaur’s ribs, its left paw clasping the beast’s lower jaw.</p><figure id="d987a868-987e-45cc-84b9-d05809db372d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:2,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/11/dinosaurs-are-not-us-book-reveals-how-mammals-came-to-rule-the-world&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;‘Dinosaurs are not us’: book reveals how mammals came to rule the world&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;d987a868-987e-45cc-84b9-d05809db372d&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-2 | 2" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Researchers said the discovery challenged a long-held view of early mammals as “fodder” for dinosaurs.</p><p>Dr Jordan Mallon, a co-author of the study, based at the Canadian Museum of Nature, said: “This new fossil teaches us that in the Mesozoic ‘age of dinosaurs’, dinosaurs were not always king.

And this turns the old story on its head. We’re used to thinking of the age of dinosaurs as a time when dinosaurs ruled the world, and the tiny mammals cowered in the shadows. But here is a mammal that seems to be eating a dinosaur.”</p><p>While the authors acknowledge that fossil forgeries have previously been reported, they say it is unlikely to be the case here, not least because the two skeletons are entwined. They also undertook to test the fossil’s authenticity by exposing the left lower jaw of the mammal – which had not been revealed before – and found it “plunges into the matrix to clasp the dinosaur’s ribs”.</p><p>But Brusatte said there remained some legitimate concerns about the integrity of the fossil. “There have been doctored fossils from this part of the world before, and the scientists did not dig up this specimen themselves. The skeletons are no doubt genuine, but I suppose the poses of the bones could have been altered, although I have no direct evidence for this,” he said.</p><p>“As more scientists are able to study the fossil, I hope this doubt can be put to rest.”</p></div></div></div>
