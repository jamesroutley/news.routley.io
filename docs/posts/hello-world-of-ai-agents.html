    <h1>Hello World of AI Agents</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>My favorite guidebook of all time is ‘The C Programming Language’ by Kernighan and Ritchie. In the first chapter of the book are the immortal words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
The first program to write is the same for all languages:
<em>Print the words</em> ‘hello, world’</p></blockquote>
<p>I have always believed that a ‘hello world’ is the best way to understand the basics of a system.
Given that AI agents are the hottest systems in the news all the time now, I decided to find out the ‘hello world of AI agents’.</p>
<h2 id="re-cap---what-is-an-ai-agent">Re-cap - what <em>is</em> an AI agent</h2>
<p>There are many examples of AI agents today. Since they have the word AI in them, obviously they engage LLMs - because somehow these two words have become synonymous. But, they have to do something more than what an LLM can do.</p>
<p>So, for example, the ‘hello world’ of LLMs could be a software program that can satisfactorily do this task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tell me a joke, starting with ‘you won’t believe what happened’</p></blockquote>
<p>You can try this with any LLM and you will get some answer that was not exactly rote learning.</p>
<p>An AI agent has to go beyond this</p>
<h2 id="my-definition-of-ai-agent">My definition of AI agent</h2>
<p>Here’s my simplified take, at least for the purpose of this blog post. An AI agent is a software program which can answer your question, and in case it doesn’t know the answer it will consult a reference and find the answer, or ask you what to do next.</p>
<p>So, you could use a regular piece of software or maybe an LLM to commit a crime, but you would need an AI agent to solve the mystery and find out who did it.</p>

<h2 id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started</h2>
<p>We’ll use python, Ollama and some python libraries for communication between the two, and also with the external reference. For simplicity we’ll consider the internet our external reference.</p>
<p>First the LLM needs to ask a question</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span>    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;What would you like to know? </span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, it needs to pass it to the agent and get the answer</p>
<h3 id="our-agent">Our agent</h3>
<p>Our agent follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask an LLM if it knows the answer, and tells the LLM to reply with NEEDS_SEARCH in case it does not</li>
<li>One of the following:
<ul>
<li>Return the answer if the LLM knows it</li>
<li>If the LLM said NEEDS_SEARCH then call an internet search engine to get some results
<ul>
<li>Ask the LLM to summarize the search results, and give the summary as the answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/debamitro/tiniest-ai-agent/blob/main/main.py">Here</a> is the full ‘hello world’ source code. I asked chatgpt a few months ago and got a bigger version of this code, which I have simplified to its current form.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-ai-agent">Using the AI agent</h2>
<p>Here’s a conversation I had with my AI agent a while ago. I used <a href="https://ollama.com/library/qwen3-vl">qwen3:14b</a> via Ollama as the LLM.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="markdown"><span><span>What would you like to know? 
</span></span><span><span>who is the richest man in the world today?
</span></span><span><span>[Checking with LLM...]
</span></span><span><span>[Searching online...]
</span></span><span><span>[Summarizing your answer...]
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>think</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>Okay, so the user is asking who the richest man in the world is today. Let me look through the provided sources.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>First, the Wikipedia page on The World&#39;s Billionaires mentions that 
</span></span><span><span>Jeff Bezos was the top in 2018 and held the position for four years until 2022. 
</span></span><span><span>But the text cuts off there, so I don&#39;t know what happened after that. 
</span></span><span><span>However, the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires page might have more up-to-date info. 
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Looking at the Forbes link, it&#39;s about their real-time list. 
</span></span><span><span>But the description doesn&#39;t specify the current top person. It does say that 
</span></span><span><span>the list updates net worth based on stock market changes, but without 
</span></span><span><span>current data, I can&#39;t tell who&#39;s on top now. The Bloomberg Billionaires 
</span></span><span><span>Index is another source, but the info given there is about the index&#39;s 
</span></span><span><span>methodology and history, not the current top individual.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Since the user is asking for today&#39;s richest person, and the sources don&#39;t 
</span></span><span><span>provide current rankings beyond 2022, I might need to note that the latest info 
</span></span><span><span>from the sources is up to 2022, where Bezos was the top. However, I should check 
</span></span><span><span>if there&#39;s any recent data. But the sources provided don&#39;t have that. So the answer 
</span></span><span><span>should mention that as of the latest info from the sources, Jeff Bezos was the richest, 
</span></span><span><span>but note that the current status might be different and suggest checking the latest Forbes or Bloomberg reports.
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>think</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>As of the latest information available from the provided sources, 
</span></span><span><span><span>**Jeff Bezos**</span> was the richest person in the world in 2022, according to 
</span></span><span><span>the <span>**Forbes**</span> rankings. He held the top position for four years until being 
</span></span><span><span>surpassed by others in subsequent years. However, the sources do not specify the 
</span></span><span><span>current (2023) ranking. For real-time updates, <span>**Forbes&#39; Real-Time Billionaires**</span> 
</span></span><span><span>list tracks daily changes in net worth, but the exact current top individual is not detailed in the provided text. 
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>For the most up-to-date information, refer to the latest editions 
</span></span><span><span>of <span>**Forbes**</span> or <span>**Bloomberg Billionaires Index**</span>.

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since we moved to <a href="https://debamitro.github.io/blog/karpathian-classification-of-software">software 3.0</a> there is almost no limit to what software can do. Quite naturally, there could be many more versions of this ‘hello world’. So, I cannot claim that this is the canonical ‘hello world of ai agents.</p>
<p>Note: If you change the one-question-one-answer structure of my AI agent into a loop, you can create a chatgpt or perplexity of your own!</p>
