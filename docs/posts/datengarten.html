      <p>This blog post is meant as a quick one to tide you over the ever longer periods between blog posts.</p>
<p>On January 8th, I gave a talk entitled “Programming Languages and Trust” at Datengarten. Datengarten is a monthly talk event hosted by the Chaos Computer Club Berlin. I was fortunate enough to speak before a crowd of extremely bright people about two topics I cannot claim to be an expert in: programming languages and their trust level.</p>
<p>It was both livestreamed and recorded, and the result can be seen in its full glory here.</p>
