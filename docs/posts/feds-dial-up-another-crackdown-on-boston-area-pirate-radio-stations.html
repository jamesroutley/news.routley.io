    <h1>Feds dial up another crackdown on Boston-area pirate radio stations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-warns-boston-landowners-illegal-pirate-radio-broadcasts">last week warned the owners of eight properties</a> - including a church on Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester - that they have two weeks to shut down the unlicensed radio stations emanating from their buildings or face fines of more than $2.3 million per station.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the latest in a series of FCC actions over the past decade to try to squelch radio stations - many serving the local Haitian community - which the FCC says not only don&#39;t have licenses but which can interfere with stations that do. </p>
<p>Among those warned in letters sent Friday: New Fellowship Baptist Church of Dorchester, which was actually cited for allowing two unlicensed stations to use antennas on the roof of its building, a former theater at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LXNV3Z876BWaqRiD6">616 Blue Hill Ave.</a> in Dorchester. That potentially could leave it open to fines totaling $4.6 million. </p>
<p>One of the frequencies the commission cited was 88.5 MHz, still broadcasting this afternoon as <a href="https://bigcityfm.com">Big City FM</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the FCC has gone after both the church building and Big City. </p>
<p>In 2018, FCC inspectors and US marshals <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2018/feds-move-shut-radio-station-operating-out">seized equipment at the church building</a> it said was being used by unlicensed stations as well as <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/radio-equipment-seized-two-illegal-radio-stations-boston">equipment used by Big City</a>.</p>
<p>FCC records show that inspectors have been attempting to shut illegal emissions from the church building since <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-281507A1.txt">at least 2008</a>, before the church bought the property.</p>
<p>According to the FCC, Boston-area inspectors <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398368A1.pdf">responded to a complaint</a> by using direction-finding radio equipment tuned to 88.5 MHz that led them to the church location on both June 5 and July 13. They made similar trips <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-347264A1.pdf">for 87.7 MHZ</a> to the same location.</p>
<p>The commission gave the church two weeks to prove it&#39;s kicked the stations off its property.</p>
<p>Similar notices went out to the owners of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7cBkYoy7BEmwiHbZ7">92 Hazleton St.</a> in Mattapan for an unlicensed station at 107.5 MHZ, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/d1DcBPhsqLRYoxtJ8">56 Deering Rd.</a> in Mattapan for at station at 100.1 MHZ, and the owners of properties in Randolph, Brockton and Holyoke.</p>
