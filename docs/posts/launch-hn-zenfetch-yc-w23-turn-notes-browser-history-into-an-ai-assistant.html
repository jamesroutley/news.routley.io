    <h1>Launch HN: Zenfetch (YC W23) – Turn notes/browser history into an AI assistant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey everyone! Akash and Gabe here from Zenfetch (<a href="https://www.zenfetch.com">https://www.zenfetch.com</a>) - a Chrome extension that transforms your saved web browsing into a personal chatGPT and search engine. Here’s a demo video: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/abe9d40dc82545a482be55b631f9bf2a?sid=53fb1432-0c59-4c08-93aa-3b3184363cc3" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/abe9d40dc82545a482be55b631f9bf2a?...</a></p><p>How it works: (1) Optionally import your existing saved web browsing through one of our integrations or through a URL CSV import. (2) Click the Zenfetch icon in a tab to save any PDF, YouTube video, note, article, email, forum post, etc. Zenfetch can save almost anything across the internet. (3) Zenfetch indexes the text or transcript and adds that information to your personal knowledge assistant. This is done on your computer so you don’t have to worry about paywalls, logins, etc. (4) Use the dashboard or side panel to search your knowledge or chat with your personal knowledge assistant.</p><p>We built Zenfetch to solve our personal problem: we were reading tons of content but using little to none of the information. While searching for solutions, we found that most tools were good at storing information but not at retrieving it. We even found that search functionalities on existing read-later tools got worse the more content we saved.</p><p>A few examples of how our users use Zenfetch: “What was that article I read on the new nuclear fusion company?”, “Analyze this strategy based on the Lenny Rachitsky article I read”, “Summarize Karpathys video introducing LLMs”, “Which research papers mentioned the increase in carbon emissions?”, “Compile the different perspectives I’ve read on climate change”, and more.</p><p>Zenfetch is free for the first 14 days and then costs $14.99/mo (No credit card needed for the trial).</p><p>We’d love for you to try it out and let us know what we can do to improve your experience! While we only work on Chromium-based browsers right now, we’re actively working on browser compatibility and integrations. Let us know which ones to prioritize!</p></div></div></div>
