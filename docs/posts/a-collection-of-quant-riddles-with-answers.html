    <h1>A collection of quant riddles with answers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
The quant riddles or logic or lateral puzzles 1-19 appear in the book &#39;Heard on The Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews&#39; by Timothy Falcon Crack PhD available on <a title="Timothy Crack PhD - investment banking job interviews" href="http://www.investmentbankingjobinterviews.com/" target="_blank">his website</a>, the rest have been accumulated from the internet and emails I receive. They are designed to help practice for job or university interviews or just training your brain. Realistically, in an interview you wouldn&#39;t be asked these questions and left to your own devices, you&#39;d be prompted. That&#39;s where the clues come in, they are intended to add ideas incrementally and help you get there by yourself.. Questions 3 &amp; 5 are probably the easiest and a good place to start. I&#39;ve coloured them <span>Red</span>, <span>Amber</span> and <span>Green</span> to indicate the difficulty along with the bar on the right. Difficulty is very subjective, but they all offer something in teaching you the ideas and tricks used to solve them. So that&#39;s it good luck... New! I&#39;ve also run the questions through <strong><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank" title="ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue">ChatGPT</a></strong> &amp; 
 
 <strong><a href="https://bard.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Google&#39;s AI experiment">Bard</a></strong> and (spoiler,) they did quite well! </p><!--

 Â 89. A manufacturing process for ceramics exists as described below:<br />
Clay is sourced - unlimited supply.<br />
The ceramics are shaped - takes about half an hour & there are 4 shapers.<br />
They're painted - takes about half an hour (3 painters.)<br />
Fired in a kiln - 300 at a time & takes 2 days.<br />
Glazed - takes 15 minutes (2 glazers.)<br />
Dried - takes a week but they have space to dry a lot, lets say 1000.<br />
What is the maximum rate the ceramics can be produced?.
