    <h1>Technical Debt: How do you get out of the bottleneck?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In its early days, a startup searches for a good product-market fit. When
    it finds one it looks to grow rapidly, a phase known as a <b>scaleup</b>. At this
    time it&#39;s growing rapidly along many dimensions: revenues, customer,
    headcount. At Thoughtworks, we&#39;ve worked with many such scaleups, and our
    work has focused on how to help them overcome various bottlenecks that
    impede this growth. </p>

<p>As we&#39;ve done this work, we&#39;ve noticed common
    bottlenecks, and learned approaches to deal with them. This article is the
    first in a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups">series that examines these bottlenecks</a>. In each article we&#39;ll look
    at how startups get into the bottleneck, usually through doing the right
    things that are needed early in a startup&#39;s life, but are no longer right as
    growth changes the context for ways of working. We&#39;ll highlight key signs
    that the startup is approaching or stuck in the bottleneck. We&#39;ll then talk
    about how to break through the bottleneck, describing the changes we&#39;ve seen
    that allow scaleups to reach their proper potential.</p>

<p>We start this series by looking at technical debt: how the tools and
    practices that facilitate rapid experimentation of the product/market fit
    need to change once growth kicks in.</p>

<section id="entry">
<h2>How did you get into the bottleneck?</h2>

<p>The most common scaling bottleneck we encounter is technical debt —
      startups regularly state that tech debt is their main impediment to
      growth. The term “tech debt” tends to be used as a catch-all term,
      generally indicating that the technical platform and stack needs
      improvement. They’ve seen feature development slow down, quality issues, or
      engineering frustration. The startup team attributes it to technical debt
      incurred due to a lack of technical investment during their growth phase.
      An analysis is required to figure out the type and scale of the tech debt.
      It could be that the code quality is bad, an older language or framework
      is used, or the deployment and operation of the product isn’t fully
      automated. The solution strategy might be slight changes to the teams’
      process or starting an initiative to rebuild parts of the application.
      </p>

<p>It’s important to say that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">prudent technical debt</a> is healthy and desired,
      especially in the initial phases of a startup’s journey. Startups should
      trade technical aspects such as quality or robustness for product delivery
      speed. This will get the startup to its first goal – a viable business
      model, a proven product and customers that love the product. But as the
      company looks to scale up, we have to address the shortcuts taken, or it
      will very quickly affect the business.</p>

<p>Let’s examine a couple of examples we’ve encountered.</p>

<p><b>Company A –</b> A startup has built an MVP that has shown enough
      evidence (user traffic, user sentiment, revenue) for investors and secured
      the next round of funding. Like most MVPs, it was built to generate user
      feedback rather than high-quality technical architecture. After the
      funding, instead of rebuilding that pilot, they build upon it, keeping the
      traction by focusing on features. This may not be an immediate problem
      since the startup has a small senior team that knows the sharp edges and
      can put in bandaid solutions to keep the company afloat. </p>

<p>The issues start to arise when the team continues to focus on feature
      development and the debt isn’t getting paid down. Over time, the
      low-quality MVP becomes core components, with no clear path to improve or
      replace them. There is friction to learn, work, and support the code. It
      becomes increasingly difficult to expand the team or the feature set
      effectively. The engineering leaders are also very nervous about the
      attrition of the original engineers and losing the knowledge they have.
      </p>

<p>Eventually, the lack of technical investment comes to a head. The team
      becomes paralyzed, measured in lower velocity and team frustration. The
      startup has to rebuild significantly, meaning feature development has to
      slow down, allowing competitors to catch up. </p>

<p><b>Company B –</b> The company was founded by ex-engineers and they
      wanted to do everything “right.” It was built to scale out of the box.
      They used the latest libraries and programming languages. It has a finely
      grained architecture, allowing each part of the application to be
      implemented with different technologies, each optimized to scale
      perfectly. As a result, it will easily be able to handle hyper growth when
      the company gets there.
      </p>

<p>The issue with this example is that it took a long time to create,
      feature development was slow, and many engineers spent time working on the
      platform rather than the product. It was also hard to experiment — the
      finely grained architecture meant ideas that didn’t fit into an existing
      service architecture were challenging to do. The company didn’t realize
      the value of the highly scalable architecture because it was not able to
      find a product-market fit to reach that scale of customer base.</p>

<p>These are two extreme examples, based on an amalgamation of various
      clients with whom the startup teams at Thoughtworks have worked. Company A
      got itself into a technical debt bottleneck that paralyzed the company.
      Company B over-engineered a solution that slowed down development and
      crippled its ability to pivot quickly as it learnt more. </p>

<p>The theme with both is an inability to find the right balance of technical
      investment vs. product delivery. Ideally we want to leverage the use of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">prudent technical debt</a> to power
      rapid feature development and experimentation. When the ideas are found to
      be valuable, we should pay down that technical debt. While this is very easily
      stated, it can be a challenge to put into practice. </p>

<p>To explore how to create the right balance, we are going to examine the
      different types of technical debt: </p>

<section id="TypicalTypesOfDebt">
<h3>Typical types of debt:</h3>

<p>Technical debt is an ambiguous term, often regarded as purely
        code-related. For this discussion, we’re going to use technical debt to mean
        any technical shortcut, where we’re trading long-term investment into a
        technical platform for short-term feature development.</p>

<dl>
<p>
<dt>Code quality</dt>

<dd>Code that is brittle, hard to test, hard to understand, or poorly
          documented will make all development and maintenance tasks slower and will
          degrade the &#34;enjoyment&#34; of writing code while demotivating engineers.
          Another example is a domain model and associated data model that doesn’t
          fit the current business model, resulting in workarounds. </dd>
</p>

<div>
<dt>Testing</dt>

<dd>A lack of unit, integration, or E2E tests, or the wrong distribution
          (see <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html">test pyramid</a>). The developer can’t quickly get confidence that
          their code will not break existing functionality and dependencies. This leads
          to developers batching changes and a reduction of deployment frequency.
          Larger increments are harder to test and will often result in more bugs.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt>Coupling</dt>

<dd>Between modules (often happens in a monolith), teams potentially
          block each other, thus reducing the deployment frequency and
          increasing lead time for changes. One solution is to pull out services
          into microservices, which <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html">comes with it’s own
          complexity</a> — there can be more straightforward ways of setting
          clear boundaries within the monolith.</dd>
</div>

<p>
<dt>Unused or low value features</dt>

<dd>Not typically thought of as technical debt, but one of the symptoms of
          tech debt is code that is hard to work with. More features creates
          more conditions, more edge cases that developers have to design
          around. This erodes the delivery speed. A startup is experimenting. We
          should always make sure to go back and re-evaluate if the experiment
          (the feature) is working, and if not, delete it. Emotionally, it can be very
          difficult for teams to make a judgment call, but it becomes much easier
          when you have objective data quantifying the feature value.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Out of date libraries or frameworks</dt>

<dd> The team will be unable to take advantage of new improvements and
          remain vulnerable to security problems. It will result in a skills
          problem, slowing down the onboarding of new hires and frustrating
          current developers who are forced to work with older versions. Additionally, those
          legacy frameworks tend to limit further upgrades and innovation.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Tooling</dt>

<dd>Sub-optimum third-party products or tools that require a lot of
          maintenance. The landscape is ever-changing, and more efficient
          tooling may have entered the market. Developers also naturally want to
          work with the most efficient tools. The balance between buying vs.
          building is complex and needs reassessment with the remaining debt in
          consideration.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Reliability and performance engineering problems</dt>

<dd>This can affect the customer experience and the ability to scale. We
          have to be careful, as we have seen wasted effort in premature
          optimization when scaling for a hypothetical future situation. It’s better to
          have a product proven to be valuable with users than an unproven product
          that can scale. We’ll describe this in more detail in the piece on
          “Scaling Bottleneck: Built without reliability and observability in mind”.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Manual processes</dt>

<dd>Part of the product delivery workflow isn’t automated. This could
          be steps in the developer workflow or things related to managing the
          production system. A warning: this can also go the other way when you
          spend a lot of time automating something that is not used enough to be
          worth the investment.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Automated deployments</dt>

<dd>Early stage startups can get away with a simple setup, but this should
          be addressed very soon — small incremental deployments power experimental
          software delivery. Use the four key metrics as your guide post. You should
          have the ability to deploy at will, usually at least once a day.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Knowledge sharing</dt>

<dd>Lack of useful information is a form of technical debt. It makes
          it difficult for new employees and dependent teams to get up to speed.
          As standard practice, development teams should produce concisely
          written technical documentation, API Specifications, and architectural
          decision records. It should also be discoverable via a developer
          portal or search engine. An anti-pattern is no moderation and
          deprecation process to ensure quality.</dd>

<section id="IsThatReallyTechnicalDebtOrFunctionality">
<h3>Is that really technical debt or functionality?</h3>

<p>Startups often tell us about being swamped with technical debt, but
        under examination they’re really referring to the limited functionality
        of the technical platform, which needs its own proper treatment with
        planning, requirement gathering, and dedicated resources.</p>

<p>For example, Thoughtworks&#39; startup teams often work with clients on
        automating customer onboarding. They might have a single-tenant solution
        with little automation. This starts off well enough — the developers can
        manually set up the accounts and track the differences between installs.
        But, as you add more clients, it becomes too time-consuming for the
        developers. So the startup might hire dedicated operations staff to set
        up the customer accounts. As the user base and functionality grows, it
        becomes increasingly difficult to manage the different installs —
        customer onboarding time increases, and quality problems increase. At
        this point automating the deployment and configuration or moving to a
        multi-tenant setup will directly impact KPIs — this is
        functionality.</p>

<p>Other forms of technical debt are harder to spot and harder to point
        to a direct impact, such as code that is difficult to work with or short
        repeated manual processes. The best way to identify them is with
        feedback from the teams that experience them day-to-day. A team’s
        continuous improvement process can handle it and shouldn’t require a
        dedicated initiative to fix it.</p>

</section>

<section id="exit">
<h2>How do you get out of the bottleneck?</h2>

<p>The approach that teams are taking to technical debt should come from
      its technical strategy, set by its leaders. It should be intentional,
      clear, and re-evaluated over time. Unfortunately, we often see teams
      working off historical directions, creating future problems without
      realizing it. For a company in this circumstance, a few opportunities
      commonly trigger when to re-evaluate their current strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li>New funding means more features and more resources — this will compound
        current problems. Addressing current technical debt should be part of the
        funding plan. </li>

<li>New product direction can invalidate previous assumptions and put
        stress on new parts of the systems.</li>

<li>A good governance process involves reevaluating the state of the
        technology on a regular cadence.</li>

<li>New opinions can help avoid “boiling frog” problems. Outside help, team
        rotations and new employees will bring a fresh perspective.</li>
</ul>

<section id="TheSlipperySlope">
<h3>The slippery slope</h3>

<p>How did you end up with a lot of technical debt? It can be very hard to
        pinpoint. Typically it isn’t due to just one event or decision, but
        rather a series of decisions and trade-offs made under pressure.</p>

<p>Ironically, in retrospect, if one considers each decision at the point
        in time at which it was made, based on what was known at the
        time, it is unlikely to be considered a mistake.  However, one
        concession leads to another and so on, until you have a serious problem
        with quality.  There is commonly a tipping point at which resolving the
        tech debt takes more time than developing incremental value.</p>

<p>It’s hard to recover and the situation tends to snowball. It is
        natural for developers to use the current state as an indicator of what
        is acceptable. In these conditions, developing the new features will
        result in even more debt. This is the slippery slope, a vicious cycle
        that unfortunately leads to a cliff as the effort to implement the next
        feature increases non-linearly.</p>
</section>

<section id="SetAQualityBar">
<h3>Set a quality bar</h3>

<p>Many organizations find it beneficial to have a set of standards and
        practices to which the company is committed that guide technical
        evolution. Keep in mind that some technical practices are quite
        difficult to achieve, for example continuous delivery; deploying
        regularly without affecting users is technically challenging. Teams
        often have initial problems, and in response leadership may deprioritize
        the practice. Instead we recommend the opposite, do it more often and
        your teams will master the practices and form strong habits. When the
        tough time comes, rather than dropping the practice, use the feedback to
        guide future investment in team capability.</p>
</section>

<section id="BlastRadius">
<h3>Blast Radius</h3>

<p>We accept that taking shortcuts is a necessary part of scaling the
        business. How do we limit the blast radius, knowing that these shortcuts
        will need to be resolved, or even totally rebuilt? Clearly, we need a
        strategy that limits the impact to the business. One way is to decouple
        teams and systems, which allows a team to introduce tech debt that is
        isolated and won’t necessarily snowball as described above.</p>

<p>High quality literature about decoupling is plentiful, so we won’t
        attempt to explain here. We recommend focusing attention on
        microservices and domain driven design techniques. However, be careful
        doing too much too early, decoupling adds latency and complexity to your
        systems, and choosing poor domain boundaries between teams can add
        communication friction. We will be writing about anti-patterns related
        to overcomplicated distributed architectures in future articles.</p>
</section>

<section id="ProductAndEngineeringCollaboration">
<h3>Product and Engineering Collaboration</h3>

<p>If trade off conversations aren’t balanced between business strategy,
        product and engineering, technical quality most commonly degrades first,
        and as a result product quality eventually suffers as well. When you
        look for the root cause of this bottleneck, it nearly always comes down
        to the balance within the company between business, product and
        engineering goals. Lack of collaboration typically leads to short
        sighted decisions made in a vacuum. This can go both ways, cutting
        corners in critical areas or gold plating something that isn’t valuable
        are equally likely.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/product-eng-collaboration.png"/></p>

<ul>
<li>The business strategy at any point in time should be clear and transparent.</li>

<li>We empower team leaders to make decisions which benefit the business.</li>

<li>Product and Engineering should have an equal footing, trust in each other, and
          be willing to make trade off decisions based on long and short term impact to the business.
          </li>

<li>Decisions are made with data – e.g. the current state of the technical platform,
          estimates, analysis of expected value and KPI improvement, user research, A/B test results.
          </li>

<li>Decisions are revisited when data is refined or new learnings are discovered.</li>

<section id="HowDoYouAddressTheTechDebt">
<h3>How do you address the tech debt</h3>

<p>It starts with <b>transparent information</b> sharing how the
        business is doing, the current product direction, metrics on the current
        scaling capacity, what customers are saying about the product and what
        customer support and ops are seeing. This information will allow
        technologists to make informed decisions. Sharing the data of the
        current challenge helps technologists to know why problems are being
        addressed and measure their success. </p>

<p>There should be <b>clear end-to-end ownership</b> of all products and
        their related systems. As teams grow and take responsibility for their
        respective areas, there is often no clear ownership for an end-to-end
        journey, which leaves technical gaps that often become filled with
        technical debt. As teams grow and take on new duties, it becomes
        increasingly difficult to find an owner for older code. Furthermore,
        without ownership, teams are less incentivized to fix problems.</p>

<p>We have to <b>empower teams</b> to fix problems — resolving technical debt should
        be part of the natural flow of product development. Engineers and product
        managers need to negotiate the healthy balance between tech debt vs.
        functionality with the right pragmatic mentality. It’s part of a product
        team’s job to maintain and sustain technically healthy products, not something
        done as an after-thought. There should be an agreed process to tackle and
        monitor technical debt continually. This requires hard trade-offs among
        engineering and product leaders to keep a stable balance. </p>

<p>Designing your <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/">team topology</a> the right
        way can also be a factor. For example, suppose we continually see
        technical debt created in certain areas. In that case, it might indicate
        that the team design is wrong, and there might be a platform or business
        capability that needs strong ownership and attention.</p>

<p>Some <b>metrics</b> are powerful — for example, scanning for common
        mistakes or measuring build and deployment times. The engineering
        organization should provide self-service tooling into which teams
        can quickly integrate their systems. Metrics should be used as guides
        for the team to make decisions about tech-debt rather than for managers
        to monitor or incentivize. Experienced developers provide value by
        interpreting the available data and grounding their intution in fact-based
        qualitative information. </p>

<p>While we believe in autonomous teams, too much autonomy can be a problem
        and can result in a chaotic technical landscape. There should be <b>lightweight checks and balances</b> such
        as automated checks or architectural peer review, which can help enforce
        policies and aid developers. </p>

<p>How your organization chooses to address its tech debt depends on your
        context. One common theme we have seen across many organizations is the desire
        to “just do something,” often resulting in a band-aid which soon creates its
        own set of frictions. Instead, we’ve found that taking an iterative approach
        and letting the metrics combined with current development activity guide the investment in resolving tech debt results in
        better outcomes.</p>

<li>Have a clear technical quality bar, and enable teams to stick to it.</li>

<li>Create a technical debt process, clear ownership and empowered teams
        that have access to transparent information to make informed decisions.
        </li>

<li>Necessary technical platform improvements may be masquerading as tech debt,
        especially if they can be linked directly to KPIs.</li>

<li>Continually re-evaluate your tech debt strategy, particular at key
        moments in your startup’s growth journey (new funding, new product
      direction, new employees).</li>
