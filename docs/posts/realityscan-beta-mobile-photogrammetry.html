    <h1>RealityScan Beta: Mobile Photogrammetry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we’re happy to introduce RealityScan, a free 3D scanning app, developed in collaboration with <a href="https://quixel.com/">Quixel</a>, that turns smartphone photos into high-fidelity 3D models—in the most accessible way possible.</p>
<p><strong>The power and simplicity of RealityCapture—in your pocket</strong></p>
<p>Capturing real-world assets for digital experiences has traditionally been complicated, technical, and labor-intensive. Now in <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/lhflbQpp">limited beta</a>, RealityScan takes what people love about <a href="https://www.capturingreality.com/realitycapture">RealityCapture</a>—fast and easy 3D scanning—and puts it into the hands of anyone with a smartphone, turning their cameras into an endless source of creativity.</p>
<p>As more creators and hobbyists embrace 3D photogrammetry, we want to make our technology even more accessible, so anyone can bring ultra-detailed, digital models of real-world objects into their virtual projects. Today marks an exciting new step in that direction.</p>

<p>With RealityScan, creating digital 3D objects starts with picking up your phone.</p>
<p>From there, RealityScan walks you through the scanning experience with real-time feedback and AR guidance, and enables you to check the quality of your data without the need for long wait times. So, whether you’re a seasoned pro or a beginner just starting out, you can capture the world around you wherever, whenever.</p>
<p><strong>Straight to the cloud, share with Sketchfab</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done scanning, RealityScan does the hard work for you, creating a realistic model almost instantly thanks to the fastest photogrammetry software on the market. From there, finished assets can be seamlessly uploaded to <a href="https://sketchfab.com/">Sketchfab</a>, the ultimate platform for publishing, sharing, and selling 3D, VR and AR content.</p>



<p>Starting today, we’re inviting 10,000 of you to get an early hands-on as part of our limited beta test through <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/lhflbQpp">TestFlight</a>. <span>Access will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis, so be sure to sign up quickly.</span> Later this spring, we’ll open up RealityScan Early Access—first on iOS, with Android to follow later this year—where the app will be widely available to download, and we’ll continue to polish and enhance the app with your feedback ahead of its official release.</p>
