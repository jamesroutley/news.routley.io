This follows along with the trend from 2022 in the IPFS ecosystem to use more precise language to create space for alternative options (i.e., other DHTs). Just as there isn’t one IPFS implementation, there isn’t one content routing system or DHT. “Amino” was chosen from Amino acids - the building block for larger, stronger structures, which is what we believe will happen with this network. There can be several IPFS DHT networks, and they can choose to borrow functionality from the “Amino” network.

The problems that have been identified by core maintainers and community contributors alike can be summarised in the following:</p> <ol><li>Several years of adding extra features to the codebase and iterations of core functionality have made the DHT faster and more efficient, but have also added substantially to its complexity. It has now become more <strong>difficult to understand and make changes to the code</strong>, which indirectly is pushing developers away from contributing to it.</li> <li><strong>Flaky tests due to concurrency issues</strong>. Unit tests, which evaluate if the implementation is working as expected, are difficult to implement due to extensive parallelization of several parts of the code.</li> <li>Lack of unit tests in turn make it <strong>hard to carry out performance evaluation tests</strong>. This has recently resulted in performance evaluation results that are hard to understand or act upon - Bitswap’s <code>Provider Search</code> delay is a good example here [<a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/9530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>].</li> <li>The current implementation is carrying a <strong>non-negligible amount of technical debt</strong> that was acquired over the years.

The refactored code is expected to be completed, tested and ready for integration into Kubo for further testing during the first half of October.</p> <p>Where possible, we aim to remain compatible with version 1. There are no breaking protocol changes planned, and we expect to be able to adhere to the standard Routing interface used by Kubo. The libp2p Kademlia implementation has been battle tested through many years of use, and we want to take advantage of the learnings from that real-world usage while improving the ergonomics and clarity of the code. However, we will be taking this opportunity to look closely at the current code interfaces and to propose improved or new ones.</p> <p>Most of the changes being made are internal to the operation of the DHT. We’re creating a new state machine oriented execution model that is very different to the existing implementation. This allows us to bound work and resources more cleanly and prioritize work performed more appropriately. Performance will also be different and, for the initial release, our goal is for this to be similar to the current codebase. However, we expect the new execution model will give us more scope for optimization in the future. Having better control over the scheduling of work will also allow the new implementation to continue to perform well under resource pressure and high load.</p> <h2 id="making-reprovides-to-amino-lightning-fast"><a href="#making-reprovides-to-amino-lightning-fast">#</a> Making Reprovides to Amino lightning fast</h2> <p>Content providers with a large number of CIDs to provide to the DHT have traditionally been facing difficulties. The current PUT operation in <code>go-libp2p-kad-dht</code> lacks resource efficiency. For every CID being reprovided, the provider performs a lookup and initiates a connection with the top 20 nearest peers <em>sequentially</em>. In practice, this means that if a peer needs to be contacted twice for two CIDs, the providing peer needs to open two connections to the same peer at different points in time within the same reprovide task.</p> <p>In turn, this results in significant bandwidth requirements and deters large content providers from advertising their content on Amino (the IPFS DHT) due to cost constraints. The sequential manner in which reprovides take place can result in content providers failing to refresh all content within the 48h provider record expiration interval [<a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/blob/b63ad6096833d36b365f1361edab871f6cdc283c/providers/providers_manager.go#L38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to source<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>][<a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht#content-provider-advertisement-and-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to spec<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>], rendering the content inaccessible.</p> <p>Our approach is to optimize the provide process, making it much less resource intensive.

The primary rationale is to send/re-provide all Provider Records allocated to the same DHT Server <em><strong><strong><strong>at once, instead of having to revisit the same server later on, re-establish a connection, and store the provider record</strong></strong></strong></em>.</p> <p>However, because sending multiple Provider Records requires a new RPC causing a breaking change, it isn’t trivial to send all Provider Records exactly <em>at once.</em> That said, the most expensive part in a (Re)Provide operation is the DHT walk to discover the right DHT Servers to store the Provider Records on, as well as opening new connections to these peers. Once these peers are known, and a connection is already open, the Content Provider can simply reuse the same connection to send multiple individual <code>Provide</code> requests, thereby avoiding breaking changes while still reaping performance gains.</p> <p>The <code>go-libp2p-kad-dht</code> DHT implementation must keep track of the CIDs that must be republished every <code>Interval</code> (let’s assume that all Provider Records are republished at the same frequency). The Kademlia identifiers of the CIDs to republish must be arranged in a <a href="https://github.com/guillaumemichel/py-binary-trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binary trie<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> to allow for faster access. As each Provider Record is replicated on 20 different DHT Servers, 20 DHT Servers in a close locality are expected to store the same Provider Records (this is not 100% accurate, but suffices for our high-level description here - we’ll publish all the details in a subsequent post, when the solution is in production).</p> <p>In a nutshell, the Content Provider will continuously lookup keys across the entire keyspace, hence “sweeping” the keyspace. For each key that is to be published, the Content Provider will find the 20 closest peers, and lookup in its “CIDs Republish Binary Trie” all Provider Records that would belong to those specific 20 remote peers. Doing this match-making exercise, content providers will be able to reprovide all provider records that correspond to a particular peer at once.
