    <h1>Is air conditioning making cities hotter?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        A study found that waste heat generated by a city’s worth of air conditioners during a heatwave can raise the outside temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius. 
    </p><div><p>As Europe faces more frequent and more intense heatwaves, you might have considered taking the plunge and buying an air conditioning unit.</p><p>But while you&#39;d be forgiven for thinking it’s cooling things down, it’s actually doing the exact opposite, it’s heating things up.</p><p>In France, the use of <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/02/europe-reluctantly-turns-to-air-conditioning-as-heatwaves-bite-data-shows"><strong>air conditioning</strong></a> has become the subject of debate after left-wing MP Mathilde Panot said during an interview, “the temperature of a city can be increased by up to 2 degrees Celsius due to the use of AC [air conditioning].”</p><p>Was she right?</p><h2>Where did the French MP get this statistic from?</h2><p>It comes from a study published in 2020 that was based on a scenario in which air conditioners are used in all buildings of a city like Paris to maintain an interior temperature of 23 degrees Celsius during a heatwave. </p><p>Temperature increases due to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/28/air-conditioning-use-has-more-than-doubled-in-europe-since-1990"><strong>air conditioning</strong></a> (AC) use &#34;depend on the time of day and the characteristics of the heatwave, mainly its intensity&#34;, according to the study.</p><p>The scientists used the deadly 2003 heatwave which killed more than 14,000 people in France to model their predictions. </p><p>They found that, after &#34;Nine days of a heat wave similar to the one of 2003,&#34; the systematic use of AC during that time would increase air temperature &#34;by up to 2.4°C&#34;.</p><h2>Why does air conditioning increase the temperature?</h2><p>How is that possible? Because air conditioners work like a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/02/20/heat-pumps-avoided-8m-tonnes-of-co2-emissions-in-europe-last-year-which-country-sold-the-m"><strong>heat pump</strong></a>, cooling a room by releasing hot air outside. </p><p>Air conditioners use more electricity than any other appliance in the home. They consume 10% of global electricity and leak harmful planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.</p><p>The link between AC use and increasing temperatures in cities has already been documented. </p><p>According to research published in 2014 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, excess heat generated by a city’s worth of air conditioners can increase the outside temperature by 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius at night.</p><p>And as cities are only likely to grow hotter as a result of climate change, that means that citizens are likely to demand more indoor air conditioning.</p><p>Heatwaves that would have been a once-in-a-decade event in the 1800s iare now more intense and happen nearly three times as often, according to the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/03/21/how-can-ipccs-report-be-turned-into-action-politicians-and-environmentalists-weigh-in"><strong>latest IPCC report</strong></a>.</p><h2>Air conditioner use is set to triple worldwide by 2050</h2><p>In 2019, 20% of EU households owned an AC unit, according to the European Environment Agency<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/cooling-buildings-sustainably-in-europe"><strong>.</strong></a></p><p>The number of air conditioners worldwide is predicted to rise from 1.6 billion units today to 5.6 billion units by the middle of this century, according to a 2018 report issued by the International Energy Agency.</p><p>By 2050 all the air conditioners in the world would use as much electricity as <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/29/air-pollution-is-deadlier-than-smoking-new-study-finds"><strong>China</strong></a> does for all activities today, according to the report&#39;s predictions. </p><p>What are some alternatives to air conditioners? The scientists behind the 2020 study suggest other options to help cool down cities: including creating more green spaces, insulating buildings, and better advising the population on how to keep cool during a heatwave.</p><p>If all of these measures are taken, the study claims these actions could significantly &#34;cool outdoor air temperatures up to 4.2°C at night&#34;.</p></div></div>
