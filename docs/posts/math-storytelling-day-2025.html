    <h1>Math Storytelling Day 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today is math storytelling day, so I thought I would make a visual coloring sheet as a prompt for others. </p><p>What characters live in this world? What stories are there to tell? What number system would you have? What mathemagical spells would you cast? Where would you explore? If you design your own polyhedral world, what would it look like?<br/></p><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/09/story-1.jpg" alt="Black and white coloring sheet with a dodecahedron world in the center. Each side has map elements. The sides that are visible are: front: mostly ocean with a maelstrom and some lands with kettle ponds and marsh right side: some ocean, but a large land mass with two world trees coiled around eachother with floating square leaves bottom: three waterfalls going into a large opening with boulder piles all around -lower left: mostly ocean with a smoking volcano in the middle -upper left: a canyon with coral trees on the left and an upsiide down cone on the left going into a hole with other holes on the upper plain -upper right: mostly mountains along the coast The world is floating with flaming cubes and a couple of cylinders and a partial shape going off the page on the right.
