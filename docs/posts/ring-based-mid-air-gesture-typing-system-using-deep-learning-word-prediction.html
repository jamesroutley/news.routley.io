            <span>Abstract:</span>Text entry is a critical capability for any modern computing experience, with lightweight augmented reality (AR) glasses being no exception. Designed for all-day wearability, a limitation of lightweight AR glass is the restriction to the inclusion of multiple cameras for extensive field of view in hand tracking. This constraint underscores the need for an additional input device. We propose a system to address this gap: a ring-based mid-air gesture typing technique, RingGesture, utilizing electrodes to mark the start and end of gesture trajectories and inertial measurement units (IMU) sensors for hand tracking. This method offers an intuitive experience similar to raycast-based mid-air gesture typing found in VR headsets, allowing for a seamless translation of hand movements into cursor navigation. To enhance both accuracy and input speed, we propose a novel deep-learning word prediction framework, Score Fusion, comprised of three key components: a) a word-gesture decoding model, b) a spatial spelling correction model, and c) a lightweight contextual language model. In contrast, this framework fuses the scores from the three models to predict the most likely words with higher precision. We conduct comparative and longitudinal studies to demonstrate two key findings: firstly, the overall effectiveness of RingGesture, which achieves an average text entry speed of 27.3 words per minute (WPM) and a peak performance of 47.9 WPM. Secondly, we highlight the superior performance of the Score Fusion framework, which offers a 28.2% improvement in uncorrected Character Error Rate over a conventional word prediction framework, Naive Correction, leading to a 55.2% improvement in text entry speed for RingGesture. Additionally, RingGesture received a System Usability Score of 83 signifying its excellent usability.
