  <p>I’ve also been talking with some friends about putting together a residency around community privacy, hopefully for early next year, where we can bring together privacy and cryptography builders with community workers into collaborating in shared space — very excited about this! </p><p>Other highlights on this trip: visiting my friend’s mom in Chiang Mai, riding around on the back of scooters, eating delicious seafood and fruit, getting massages, and tapping into the local queer scene and music scene. </p><p>Special thanks to my friends Ying Tong, Janabel, Aayush, Vivek, Micah, Rithikha, Seb, Raymond, Naia, Grjte, and Jay for all the inspiring and though-provoking conversations this week. I’ve learned so much and feel so grateful to be in community with others who are also kind, curious, and excited about building out new infrastructure with these emerging tools. </p>
