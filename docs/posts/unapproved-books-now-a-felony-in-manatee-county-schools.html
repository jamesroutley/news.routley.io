    <h1>Unapproved books now a felony in Manatee County schools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Teachers in Manatee County, Florida, are being told to make their classroom libraries — and any other &#34;unvetted&#34; book — inaccessible to students, or risk felony prosecution. The new policy is part of an effort to comply with new laws and regulations championed by Governor Ron DeSantis (R). It is based on the premise, promoted by right-wing advocacy groups, that teachers and librarians are using books to &#34;groom&#34; students or indoctrinate them with leftist ideologies. </p><p>Kevin Chapman, the Chief of Staff for the Manatee County School District, told Popular Information that the policy was communicated to principals in a meeting last Wednesday. Individual schools are now in the process of informing teachers and other staff.</p><p>Teachers in Manatee County lamented the news on social media. &#34;My heart is broken for Florida students today as I am forced to pack up my classroom library,&#34; one Manatee teacher wrote on Facebook. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png" width="388" height="360.86713286713285" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:798,&#34;width&#34;:858,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:388,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2fb787d-899e-4c36-879c-7ff08acad482_858x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Another Manatee teacher called the directive &#34;a travesty to education&#34;

That law established that teachers could not be trusted to select books appropriate for their students.

A rule passed by the Florida Department of Education last week states that a &#34;library media center&#34; includes any books made available to students, including in classrooms. This means that classroom libraries that are curated by teachers, not librarians, are now illegal. </p><p>The law requires that all library books selected be:</p><blockquote><p><span>1.

But librarians and teachers are not being provided with any additional compensation for the extra work. </span></p><p>Stephana Ferrell, a co-founder of the Florida Freedom to Read Project, said the new policy followed &#34;a pattern of fear-based decisions that prioritize staying in good favor with the Governor over doing the right thing for our students.&#34; Ferrell said she blamed &#34;the Florida Board of Education that passed this rule change last Wednesday without an ounce of consideration for its impact.&#34; Now, &#34;thousands of students are without classroom access to fun and engaging literature.&#34;</p><p><span>Ironically, Manatee County is making thousands of books inaccessible to students just in time to celebrate &#34;</span><a href="https://www.fldoe.org/academics/standards/just-read-fl/celebrate-literacy-week/" rel="">Literacy Week</a><span>&#34; in Florida, which runs from January 23 to 27. Only about </span><a href="https://www.manateeschools.net/Page/10417" rel="">50% of students</a><span> in Manatee County are reading at grade level. </span></p><p><span>Popular Information asked Chapman if Manatee County librarians and teachers were expected to remove books that violated the Parental Rights In Education Act, known by critics as &#34;Don&#39;t Say Gay&#34; or the Stop WOKE Act, which limits classroom discussion of racial issues. Chapman did not answer the question directly, saying only that librarians are expected to apply the &#34;specialized training for media center specialists&#34; </span><a href="https://web02.fldoe.org/rules/doc/6A-7.0715_2918.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0M_s401tJbiKY_IEFp3rPv0zYeuyFdlrJK-ZDlA23Brxb_-Y0hXD71rWg" rel="">approved last week</a><span> by the Florida Department of Education. That training, Chapman says, includes &#34;new definitions of inappropriate material.&#34;</span></p><p>The Parental Rights In Education Act prohibits all instruction on &#34;sexual orientation or gender identity&#34; in K-3 classrooms and instruction in other grades that is &#34;not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.&#34; But the law applies only to &#34;[c]lassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties&#34; — not library books. Similarly, the Stop WOKE Act is limited to classroom instruction. </p><p>The teacher training approved by the Florida Department of Education, however, does not inform librarians that the Parental Rights in Education Act and Stop WOKE ACT do not apply to library books. Rather, librarians are told: &#34;There is some overlap between the selection criteria for instructional and library materials.&#34; One slide says that library books and instructional materials cannot include &#34;unsolicited theories that may lead to student indoctrination.&#34; </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png" width="526" height="142.69917582417582" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:395,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:526,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e71962d-3008-47c1-8c14-a242feae0aa8_1600x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>A subsequent slide provides a list of &#34;unsolicited theories that may lead to student indoctrination,&#34; which includes information about &#34;sexual orientation or gender identity.&#34; It also includes a variety of topics related to race, including &#34;Critical Race Theory&#34; and material that might make someone feel &#34;guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress&#34; as a result of their race.
