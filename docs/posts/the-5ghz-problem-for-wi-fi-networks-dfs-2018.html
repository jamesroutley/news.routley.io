<h3>
The 5GHz “Problem” For Wi-Fi Networks: DFS
</h3>


<div id="post-body-748324860777706723"><p>
Wi-Fi networking provides us with 2 bands for the operation of wireless LAN networks: the 2.4Ghz band and the 5GHz band. The 2.4GHz band has a reputation of being something of a “sewer” of a band, due to its limited number of usable channels, the number of Wi-Fi devices already using the band, and the high levels of non-Wi-Fi interference that it experiences. Many wireless LAN professionals will generally advise that you put your “important stuff” on the 5GHz band whenever possible. 5GHz has far more channels available, a corresponding lower number of devices per channel, and generally suffers much lower non-Wi-Fi interference. However, beneath the headline of “2.4Ghz = bad, 5Ghz = good”, there lurks a shadowy figure that can be troublesome if you’re not aware of its potential impact: DFS.</p></div>

  The Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS) is often used as a  RADIUS server for WiFi networks. It can provide authentication and authorization services for users on a wireless network.     In this article we take a look at how users can be dynamically assigned to a VLAN that suits their account privileges, using RADIUS attributes passed back from NPS to the RADIUS client (usually a wireless LAN controller or access point).     This method of assigning a user to a particular VLAN based on their login credentials is also known as Role Based Access Control (RBAC).    As wireless networks have grown to provide more and more services to organisations, the practice of creating a new SSID for each new service required has fallen out of favour, as each SSID adds more overhead to the RF medium, reducing the available bandwidth for all wireless services.      Best practice in terms of the number of SSIDs you should have available from your wireless network is generally accepted to be around 4

 The Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS) is often used as a  RADIUS server for WiFi networks. It can provide authentication and authorization services for devices and users on a wireless network in a Windows Active Directory environment.     In this article we look at how we can use NPS to provide authentication for WiFi users across a number of SSIDs.     We have previously discussed  how to authenticate groups of users using the same SSID and then assign them to a VLAN that is appropriate to their security authorization. However, there may still be instances where two or more SSIDs are in-use on a wireless network and we would like to base policy decisions on the SSID that the authentication request is being generated from.     As an example, if we consider a school, perhaps we would like students to only be able to authenticate if they connected to the SSID: &#34;Student_Net&#34;. Similarly,  staff should only be able to connect using the SSID: &#34;Staff_Net&#34;. This would
