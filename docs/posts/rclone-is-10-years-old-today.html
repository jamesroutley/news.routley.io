          <p>The first commit for rclone was added 10 years ago today.</p>
<pre><code>commit e9ae4f89a44b1cac8e83ede1572f15dace692c67
Author: Nick Craig-Wood &lt;nick@craig-wood.com&gt;
Date:   Sun Nov 18 17:32:31 2012 +0000

    Initial commit - some small parts working
</code></pre>
<p>In the beginning rclone started small and its first release public release (v0.96) contained just 3 backends, <code>swift</code>, <code>drive</code> and <code>s3</code>. I originally started the project to learn Go (1.0) and exercise the swift backend we were building at work but somewhere along the way I came up with the idea that it could have multiple backends and be a useful tool for other people.</p>
<p>Over the next 10 years rclone accumulated 50 backends and 80 commands. Highlights were releasing <code>rclone mount</code> (v1.33 in 2016) which was one of those aha moments and the <code>crypt</code> backend in the same relase! A long airplane flight produced <code>rclone ncdu</code> (v1.37 - 2017) and of course the <code>--vfs-cache-mode full</code> (v1.53.0 - 2020) which we have the covid lockdown to thank.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of run making rclone, I&#39;ve given a couple of conference talks about it (<a href="https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/rclone-and-go-2018/">1</a>) (<a href="https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/rclone-and-go-2018/">2</a>) and been on innumerable podcasts. But the thing that keeps me going is the community. I love helping people with their problems and interacting with the community here on the forum or on GitHub.</p>
<p>Rclone has grown in popularity immensely over the years. From 0 to 30k GitHub stars, it is now running at ~1M downloads and ~5M docker pulls a month. It&#39;s included in just about every repository for every OS now (See the <a href="https://rclone.org/install/#package-manager">install docs</a> for the list and how in/out of date they are!)</p>

          <p>Congratulations, Nick, and thank you for such a great tool.</p>
<p>I use rclone to conveniently back up and synchronize old timey family movies, family photos, our family tree, and other important family documents. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without it. I was really stuck before finding rclone.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone who can to sponsor Nick on GitHub.</p>
