    <h1>Slack GPT, the Future of AI in Slack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-js-content="true" data-js-dom="toc"><p><span>Productivity matters, whether you’re a growing startup or Fortune 100 company. Especially in times of economic uncertainty, organizations need to empower their teams to save time and focus on strategic work that allows their expertise to shine and moves the business forward.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re now at an inflection point, where new generative AI technology has the potential to unlock the exponential productivity gains that organizations are looking for. However, while people who use AI are 90% more likely to report higher levels of productivity, only 27% of companies are currently using AI tools, according to our latest </span><a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/state-of-work-2023"><span>State of Work research</span></a><span>. </span><span>In order for generative AI to thrive at work, it needs to be in a trusted space—where you know what data is being used and you’re confident that the outputs are relevant to your business. </span></p>
<p><span>Today we’re unveiling </span><b>Slack GPT</b><span>, our vision for generative AI in Slack. Customers rely on Slack to house their institutional knowledge, captured in channels about every project, team or topic. They also securely integrate their tools in Slack using our open, extensible platform and partner ecosystem. We’re building Slack GPT on this same foundation, bringing trusted generative AI to where your team </span><span>already</span><span> works:</span></p>
<ul><li><b>An AI-ready platform</b><span> to integrate and automate with your language model of choice, whether you use partner-built apps like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude or build your own custom integration</span></li>
<li><b>A set of AI features</b><span> built directly in Slack, including AI-powered conversation summaries and writing assistance</span></li>
<li><b>A new Einstein GPT app </b><span>that lets you surface AI-powered customer insights from trusted Salesforce Customer 360 data and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/genie/overview/">Data Cloud</a></span></li>
</ul>
<div><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/candid-lidiane.jpg" data-srcset="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/candid-lidiane.jpg 1x"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Generative AI has enormous potential to redefine how work is done. The real power of Slack GPT is it enables AI to act on valuable data from a company’s most trusted resource: its own internal knowledge.</p></blockquote></div>
<h2><b>Bring AI into Slack, your way</b></h2>
<p><span>As the ecosystem of generative AI tools expands, flexibility will only become more important. Whether you build with clicks, code, or a bit of both, our open, extensible platform lets you decide when and how you bring AI into Slack.</span></p>
<p><span>Today you can integrate your AI language model of choice, using partner-built apps from OpenAI’s </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/chatgpt-app-for-slack/"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span>, Anthropic’s </span><a href="https://slack.com/apps/A04KGS7N9A8-claude"><span>Claude</span></a><span>, and more. No matter what you choose, apps are a seamless part of Slack’s conversational experience, making AI-powered insights just a message away.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Claude-Slack-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="611"/></p>
<p><span>With our newly available </span><a href="https://slack.com/blog/developers/next-gen-platform-launch"><span>next-generation platform</span></a><span> for developers, it’s also easy to build something custom, too—whether you bring your own AI model or want to keep an integration in-house. </span></p>
<p><span>Later this year, you’ll be able to instantly bring generative AI into your automated processes in Slack, without a single line of code. Using Workflow Builder, our built-in no-code automation tool, you’ll be able to add generative AI prompts as one of the steps in your workflow.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, say you have a workflow that alerts you when a new lead comes in from Sales Cloud, ensuring sales reps can quickly respond. Imagine if ChatGPT could take your workflow a few steps further, using CRM data from a sales lead to draft a personalized prospecting email for you? Put it in a document, share it in a channel, and every sales rep now has a head start when they follow up on the lead.</span></p>

<h2><b>Generative AI, built natively in Slack</b></h2>
<p><span>From day one, Slack’s mission has been to make your working life simpler, more pleasant and more productive. With Slack GPT, we’re sharing our vision for a new kind of productivity: one that brings the power of generative AI into the ways you already work in Slack.</span></p>
<p><span>Imagine if every time you hop into a channel, you’ll be able to get up to speed on unread Slack messages in one click—whether you’re jumping in midway through a project or catching up from being out of the office. In the future, with generative AI built seamlessly into the user experience, conversation summaries will be there when you need them, the moment you start scrolling through a channel.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Slack_GPT_Summarize.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"/><span>With AI assistance built natively into Slack’s message composer and </span><a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/meet-slack-canvas"><span>canvas</span></a><span>, a new surface for curating information, Slack GPT could also help you tweak your drafts until the words are just right. In a few clicks, you’ll be able to distill content, adjust the tone, and more, right from where you’re already writing.</span></p>
<div><p><span id="assistant_color">AI-assistance writing in a canvas</span></p><video aria-describedby="assistant_color" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" poster=""><source src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/assistant_color.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video></div>

<h2><b>Uncover AI-powered customer insights</b></h2>
<p><span>While Slack is where you find knowledge from your organization, Salesforce is where you gain a deeper understanding of your customer across various touchpoints—sales opportunities, service tickets, marketing campaigns, and more. Our vision is to surface AI-powered insights grounded in trusted </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/"><span>Customer 360 data</span></a><span>, right where you’re already working with your team.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, say you’re a customer service agent who needs help resolving a case. Today you can use the </span><a href="http://slack.com/apps/A01RDL2NJAH-service-cloud-for-slack"><span>Service Cloud app</span></a><span> to start a case swarm, bringing together the right experts in a dedicated Slack channel to find a resolution. </span><span>In the future</span><span>, imagine if </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/einstein-gpt-service-cloud-news/"><span>Einstein GPT</span></a><span> could auto-generate case summaries using relevant data from Service Cloud and your Slack channel. Now case summaries could not only capture data from service tickets, but knowledge from the team who resolved the case too.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building the future of AI in Slack, together</b></h2>
<p><span>This is just the start of our AI journey together. As the productivity platform that millions of users rely on to get work done, we know how important it is to use new technologies like generative AI safely, at scale. </span></p>
<p><span>Cus</span><span>tomers have always been at the heart of how we develop new products at Slack. Slack GPT will be no different, as we ensure that users are at the center of the experience and have transparency a</span><span>nd control over how they use AI in Slack. In addition to building based on </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-guidelines/"><span>Salesforce’s guidelines</span></a><span> for responsible AI development, we’ll bring customers in ear</span><span>ly and often to pilot these features before rolling them out broadly. </span></p>
