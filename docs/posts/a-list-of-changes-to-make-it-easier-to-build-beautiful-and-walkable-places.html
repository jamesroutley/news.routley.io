    <h1>A list of changes to make it easier to build beautiful and walkable places</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With help from Chris Smeder, Jon Hillis, Phil Levin, Devon Zuegel, Damon Hemmerdinger, Coby Lefkowitz, Jan Sramek, Austin Tunnell, and Dave Gordon, I made this wishlist of changes that could make it easier to build more beautiful &amp; walkable places. 

Here&#39;s the list, somewhat ranked in order of importance:

1. Remove parking minimums
2. Allow mixed‑use zoning city‑wide (ground‑floor retail, corner commerce)
3. Allow multiple housing units per lot (duplex‑ADU‑triplex, etc)
4. Raise FAR caps and height limits
5. Make small / infill projects ministerial (avoid CEQA &amp; other discretionary review)
6. Eliminate front / side setbacks &amp; side‑yard requirements (build at back of sidewalk)
7. Shrink minimum lot sizes and remove lot‑width minimums
8. Allow single‑stair buildings up to 6 stories
9. Narrow general &amp; fire‑access street widths to 9 – 10 ft lanes; reduce right‑of‑way
10. Increase hose reach to 300 ft and adopt smaller fire trucks
11. Revise street‑design rules to prioritize safety &amp; commerce over vehicle speed
12. Streamline all permits with strict shot‑clock deadlines
13. Guarantee non‑conditional development approvals (no off‑site exactions)
14. Fast‑track pathways for attainable / mixed‑income housing in high‑opportunity zones
15. Cap, reduce, or defer impact fees for car‑lite projects
16. Fee waivers / reductions for projects delivering long‑term attainable housing
17. Single one‑stop point of contact &amp; mandatory timeline performance reporting
18. Utility agencies must guarantee service within fixed timelines (penalties for delay)
19. Enable car‑free or limited‑access districts by default
20. Plant &amp; protect abundant street / park trees; expedite tree permits; drop bonds
21. Provide weather‑protected shelter at every bus stop
22. Paint high‑visibility crosswalks at every intersection
23. Allow stacked &amp; reduced utility easements
24. Override the Subdivision Map Act for small lot splits
25. Reduce minimum dwelling‑unit size requirements
26. Create clean code sections for live/work units &amp; 4‑50‑unit / small‑commercial buildings
27. Adopt international elevator standards to cut installation costs
28. Reform ADA / FHA so adding an elevator doesn’t trigger full‑building wheelchair retrofits
29. Allow Temporary Certificates of Occupancy once life‑safety criteria are met
30. Incentivize (or require) middle‑density cottage court typologies in infill &amp; greenfield
31. Create generous TIF districts to finance walkable urbanism
32. Easy ministerial sidewalk‑cafe &amp; outdoor‑dining licenses
33. Prohibit utilities from imposing requirements stricter than the adopted code
34. Remove mandatory facade articulation &amp; prescriptive window‑to‑wall ratios
35. Provide plentiful shaded benches &amp; public seating

I made this because I hope for more beautiful &amp; walkable places so I &amp; others can visit them or live in/near them!
