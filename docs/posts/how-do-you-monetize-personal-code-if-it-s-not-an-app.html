    <h1>Ask HN: How do you monetize personal code if it&#39;s not an &#34;app&#34;?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN,</p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately and wanted to ask — how do you monetize your personal code if it doesn’t really fit into a classic product or SaaS model?</p><p>For example:</p><p>* I have a trained ML model that solves a niche task really well — but turning it into a full-blown app seems like overkill.</p><p>* I’ve written a CLI tool that processes log files better than anything else I’ve found, but it’s too specialized to justify making a company out of it.</p><p>* I built a few small functions in different languages (Python, Go, Rust) that do neat things — data cleanup, API scraping, PDF generation — but none of them are “products” by themselves.</p><p>I’m exploring ways to package and expose this kind of work: maybe as paid APIs, small function services, or even “pocket FaaS” instances others can plug into.</p><p>Curious if anyone here has tried something similar — or if you’ve seen creative ways to turn technical tools or utilities into sustainable side income.</p><p>Thanks in advance for sharing ideas or examples!</p></div></div></div>
