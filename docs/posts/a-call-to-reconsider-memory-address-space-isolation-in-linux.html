When the kernel is running, it has access to its entire address space —
usually including all of physical memory — even
if only a small portion of that address space is actually needed.  That
increases the kernel&#39;s vulnerability to speculative attacks.  An <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220223052223.1202152-1-junaids@google.com/">address-space
isolation patch set</a> aiming to change this situation has been
circulating for a few years, but has never been seriously considered for
merging into the mainline.  At the <a href="https://lpc.events/">2022 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>, Ofir Weisse sought to convince the development
community to reconsider address-space isolation.
</p><p>
Weisse began by pointing out that there seems to be a steady supply of new
speculative-execution attacks that need to be mitigated; &#34;<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/900917/">Retbleed</a>&#34; is just one of the latest examples.
The performance costs of mitigations for these vulnerabilities can be high,
to the
point that a lot of companies are simply not using them.  The cost is also
high in terms of development time, with each new variant requiring months
of work to address.
</p><p>
Address-space isolation (ASI) is the technique of unmapping memory that is
not immediately needed, making
it inaccessible to the current running context.  Speculative-execution
attacks cannot target memory that is not mapped, so the contents of unmapped
memory can no longer be exfiltrated via such an attack.  One example of
ASI
is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/741878/">kernel page-table isolation</a>, which was
adopted in response to the Meltdown vulnerability.  There have been
numerous proposals for using ASI in other contexts in recent years, but
none have been merged.  The specific proposal under discussion in this
session is meant to protect hosts against hostile virtual machines.
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909473/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2022/lpc/OfirWeisse-sm.png" alt="[Ofir Weisse]" title="Ofir Weisse"/></a>

Wider use of ASI in the kernel would eliminate much of the work of
mitigating speculative vulnerabilities, Weisse said.  It
would reduce the task of addressing a new vulnerability to &#34;three-to-ten
lines of code by a single engineer&#34; with no new performance impact.  The
&#34;new&#34; in that claim is important, though; the ASI patch set itself has a
performance 
impact of 2-14%, depending on which benchmark is run.  There is room for
improvement in those numbers, though, he said.
</p><p>

The patch set (which is described in more detail in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/886494/">this article</a>)
is &#34;a bitter pill&#34; to swallow, he continued.  It is large and 
requires significant changes to the memory-management
subsystem and to many calls to allocation functions like
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>.  In short, ASI depends on the marking &#34;sensitive&#34; parts
of memory that should be shielded from speculative-execution attacks; those
are the portions that are unmapped when the isolation is 
in effect.  That means new GFP flags for memory allocations, similar flags
for slab creation and <tt>vmalloc()</tt>, and new annotations for local and
global variables.  Doing a complete job would require checking each
allocation and declaration site and determining whether the memory involved
is sensitive or not.
</p><p>
When the kernel hands control to a virtual machine, it first calls
<tt>asi_enter()</tt> to unmap all of the memory that has been marked as
being sensitive, making that memory inaccessible to speculative
attacks.  When that virtual machine exits back into the host kernel,
that memory will initially remain unmapped while the host kernel processes
the request from the virtual machine.
Many of the reasons for a
virtual-machine exit can be handled without access to the sensitive memory,
he said.  In such cases, the request will be handled and control will
return to the virtual machine without ever mapping the sensitive memory.
</p><p>
Sometimes, though, there will be a need to access sensitive memory.  An
important observation here, Weisse said, is that speculative execution will
never 
cause a page fault.  So, if the kernel faults while trying to do something
with sensitive memory, the access is known to not be speculative; the
kernel responds by mapping the sensitive ranges and continuing execution.
If simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is in use, any sibling CPUs
will be &#34;stunned&#34; (forced idle) before mapping that memory as an additional
defense. 
On return to the virtual machine, that memory will be unmapped again and
sibling CPUs will be resumed. 
</p><p>
The key to making this mechanism work well is determining which memory
should be classified as being sensitive.  Increasing the number of requests
that can be handled without mapping sensitive memory will improve both
performance and security.  This is being done by running various workloads
of interest and looking that the
percentage of virtual-machine exit events that require mapping sensitive
memory; ideally it should be low.  In cases where it is not, the task is to
look at the memory that is being accessed and determine whether it is
sensitive or not.  In the latter case, the allocation site can be changed
to mark the memory accordingly.
</p><p>
Weisse concluded by saying that ASI could make it easier to address the
speculative-execution vulnerabilities that are sure to come in the future
with a performance cost that is far less than that imposed by current
mitigations.  The development community should, he said, reconsider
swallowing the bitter pill.
</p><p>
Dave Hansen asked whether ASI could be extended to work more generally on
bare-metal systems, rather than being specific to the KVM interface.
Weisse answered that it should be possible, but that there would be a lot
more work involved to get to that point.
</p><p>
Christian Brauner asked why the patch set had been rejected in the past.
Junaid Shahid, who posted the most recent version of this work, said that
there hasn&#39;t been any real opposition to the idea, but neither has there
been much interest in getting it merged.  Hansen said that he didn&#39;t like
it because it is a large amount of code for a fairly narrow use case; it
doesn&#39;t address the system-call path at all.  The need to determine the
sensitivity of memory would impose a large maintenance burden in every
corner of the kernel, he added.
</p><p>
The session came to a close without any real conclusions on the future of
this work.  Unless a wave of enthusiasm for ASI materializes from some
direction, it seems likely to languish outside of the mainline
indefinitely.  The pill, it seems, remains too bitter for most developers.
