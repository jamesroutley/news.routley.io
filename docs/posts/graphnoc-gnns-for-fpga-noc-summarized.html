<p>
Semiconductors have come a long way from being the focal points upon which a circuit routed signals. Now, having increased density chip density, there is clear motivation to connect IP blocks and route data between them in an efficient way.</p>
<p>
IP blocks are defined as independent units of configurable logic that an integrated circuit or (in this case) an FPGA designer can use for some functionality within their overall design.</p>
<p>
For those who are familiar with software, the clearest connection here is a &#39;library&#39;, since IP blocks often have verified behaviour and an interface.</p>
<p>
An interface is effectively a &#39;contract&#39; that states that one can expect certain behaviour if they follow certain rules. Given that IP blocks incur a high level of expertise to design and are often sold for some fee, their interfaces are frequently specified in a more comprehensive way than the average software library.</p>
