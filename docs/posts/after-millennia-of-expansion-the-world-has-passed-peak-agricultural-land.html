<div>
<p>Agricultural land is the total of arable land that is used to grow crops, and pasture used to raise livestock.</p>



<p>Measuring exactly how much land we use for agriculture is difficult. If all farms were simply rows of densely-planted crops it would be straightforward to calculate how much land is being used. Just draw a square around the field and calculate its area. But across much of the world, this is not how farming looks: it’s often low-density; mixed in with rural villages; in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/farm-size">tiny smallholdings</a> that are somewhere between a garden and a farm. Where farmland starts and ends is not always clear-cut.</p>



<p>As a result, there are a range of estimates for how much land is used for agriculture. </p>



<p>Here I have brought together the three leading analyses on the change in global land use – these are shown in the visualization.<a id="ref-1" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Each uses a different methodology, as explained in the chart. The UN FAO produces the bedrock data for each of these analyses from 1961 onwards; however, the researchers apply their own methodologies on top, and extend this series further back in time.<a id="ref-2" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p>As you can see, they disagree on <em>how much</em> land is used for agriculture, and the time at which land use peaked. But they <em>do </em>all agree that we have passed the peak. </p>



<p>This marks a historic moment in humanity’s relationship to the planet; a crucial step in its protection of the world’s ecosystems.</p>



<p>It shows that the future of food production does not need to follow the destructive path that it did in the past. If we continue on this path we will be able to restore space for the planet’s wilderness and wildlife.<a id="ref-3" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

</div><h3 id="a-global-decoupling-of-agricultural-land-and-food-production"><a href="#a-global-decoupling-of-agricultural-land-and-food-production"></a>A global decoupling of agricultural land and food production</h3><div>
<div>
<p>Despite this reduction in agricultural land, the world has continued to produce more food. This is true of both crops and livestock.<a id="ref-5" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p>We see this decoupling in the chart that presents the UN FAO’s data. It shows that global agricultural land – the green line – has peaked while agricultural production – the brown line – has continued to increase strongly, even after this peak.<a id="ref-6" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> </p>



<p>When we break each agricultural component out individually, or look at it in physical rather than monetary units, we find the same trend: a continued increase in output. You can explore this data for any crop or animal product in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/global-food">Global Food Explorer</a>. </p>



<p>This shows that feeding more people does not have to mean taking habitat away from other wildlife. This decoupling means that we can produce more while giving land <em>back</em> to nature at the same time.</p>


	<div><div><h4>Global agricultural land has peaked, but cropland has not</h4><div>





<p>Global <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-pasture?country=~OWID_WRL">pasture has peaked</a>. Global <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-cropland?country=~OWID_WRL">cropland has not</a>.</p>



<p>This might come as a surprise as global meat consumption is increasing. How, then, can pasture for livestock have peaked and now be <em>falling</em>? </p>



<p>The world produces <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-meat-production">three times as much</a> meat as it did 50 years ago. But how this meat is produced and what types of meat we eat have shifted. First, we produce a lot of pork and chicken which are not fed on pasture. </p>



<p>Second, a lot of our beef production has moved from open pasture grazing towards more intensive farming methods; this has spared land. This presents an important dilemma: grain-fed livestock is often more land-efficient than pasture-fed livestock, so you need less land overall; but the biodiversity on grazing lands is often better than intensive croplands.</p>



<p>What this means is that more and more animals are being fed from crops grown on croplands, rather than on pasture. In fact, almost half of the world’s cropland is used to produce animal feed. Unfortunately, this conversion process from crops to meat is still <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets#livestock-waste-a-lot-of-energy-and-protein-but-do-produce-more-nutrient-dense-protein-sources">an inefficient one</a>, meaning we need a lot of land to produce a small amount of food.</p>



<p>Biofuels, too, have added additional pressure on croplands, especially in countries such as the US and Brazil.</p>

<div>
<p>Beneath this global picture there are a range of national patterns of land use. Many countries have passed this peak, but there are some where agricultural land <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/agriculture-more-less-land">is still increasing</a>.</p>



<p>This is especially true of croplands, which are still expanding globally.<a id="ref-8" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> We see this reflected in the HYDE 3.2 series in the first chart. This series reached its highest levels in the early 2000s and has declined since then, but is seeing a small rebound in recent years.</p>



<p>Most of the countries with expanding land use are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. As populations increase, and incomes rise, the pressure on land will continue.<a id="ref-9" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>



<p>This is why – as I argue <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-habitat-loss"><strong>here</strong></a> – improvements in crop yields, agricultural productivity, and dietary choices are so important. Fail to invest in these improvements and we risk reversing this global trend. Make it a priority, and we can accelerate reaching this peak everywhere.</p>
