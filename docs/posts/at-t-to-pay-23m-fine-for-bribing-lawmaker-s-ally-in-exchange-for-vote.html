<p>AT&amp;T agreed to pay a $23 million fine &#34;to resolve a federal criminal investigation into alleged misconduct involving the company&#39;s efforts to unlawfully influence former Illinois Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan,&#34; a Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/att-illinois-pay-23-million-resolve-federal-investigation-efforts-unlawfully-influence">press release</a> said today.</p>
<p>&#34;The investigation of AT&amp;T Illinois is being resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement under which the company admitted it arranged for payments to be made to an ally of Madigan to influence and reward Madigan&#39;s efforts to assist AT&amp;T Illinois with respect to legislation sought by the company,&#34; the announcement said. AT&amp;T &#34;admitted that in 2017 it arranged for an ally of Madigan to indirectly receive $22,500 in payments from the company.&#34;</p>
<p>AT&amp;T &#34;made no effort to ensure any work was performed&#34; in exchange for the payment, the Justice Department said, adding that AT&amp;T acknowledged that the payment was made &#34;in exchange for Madigan&#39;s vote and influence over a bill.&#34; The bill ended AT&amp;T&#39;s obligation to provide landline phone service to all state residents.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T allegedly used a lobbying firm as an intermediary to make the payment and disguise its true purpose. US Attorney John Lausch&#39;s office filed a one-count <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1542606/download">criminal information</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charging AT&amp;T Illinois with using an interstate facility to promote legislative misconduct. Former AT&amp;T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/former-president-att-illinois-charged-conspiracy-unlawfully-influence-former-illinois-0">indicted</a> on five charges as a result of the same investigation.</p>
<p>&#34;La Schiazza conspired in 2017 with former Speaker Michael J. Madigan, Madigan&#39;s close friend, Michael McClain, and others, to corruptly arrange for $22,500 to be paid to a Madigan ally... Although the members of the conspiracy formulated a pretextual assignment for Madigan&#39;s ally to disguise why the ally was being paid, the ally performed no actual work for AT&amp;T Illinois and had no role in advancing the legislation,&#34; the Justice Department said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Madigan and McClain were previously <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/former-illinois-speaker-house-indicted-federal-racketeering-and-bribery-charges">indicted</a> on racketeering and bribery charges. A new <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/superseding-federal-indictment-against-former-illinois-speaker-house-adds-charge">superseding indictment</a> adds an AT&amp;T-related conspiracy charge. Madigan, a Democrat, was House speaker for all but two years between 1983 and 2021, before resigning. The original &#34;22-count indictment accuses Madigan of leading for nearly a decade a criminal enterprise whose purpose was to enhance Madigan&#39;s political power and financial well-being while also generating income for his political allies and associates,&#34; the Justice Department said in March.</p>
<h2>AT&amp;T pushed bill to end landline obligation</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T&#39;s payment was designed to influence a 2017 vote on Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) legislation that &#34;terminate[d] AT&amp;T Illinois&#39; costly obligation to provide landline telephone services to all Illinois residents,&#34; the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1542601/download">deferred prosecution agreement</a> says. The law was passed by the legislature and vetoed by the governor, but both houses of the legislature voted to override the veto.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with AT&amp;T, &#34;the government will defer prosecution on the charge for two years and then seek to dismiss it if AT&amp;T Illinois abides by certain conditions, including continuing to cooperate with any investigation related to the misconduct alleged in the information,&#34; the Justice Department said, continuing:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the monetary penalty and its continued cooperation with the government, AT&amp;T Illinois&#39;s obligations under the agreement include implementing a new compliance and ethics program and providing annual reports to the government regarding remediation and implementation of the program. If AT&amp;T Illinois fails to completely fulfill each of its obligations under the agreement during the two-year term, the US Attorney&#39;s Office can initiate prosecution of the charged offense.</p></blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T must pay the $23 million fine to the <a href="https://ovc.ojp.gov/about/crime-victims-fund">Crime Victims Fund</a> within 30 days. &#34;We hold ourselves and our contractors to the highest ethical standards. We are committed to ensuring that this never happens again,&#34; AT&amp;T said in a statement to media organizations.</p>
