    <h1>EURISKO Lives</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I wrote about EURISKO a few years <a href="https://blog.funcall.org/lisp/2018/11/03/am-eurisko-lenat-documents/">before</a> there hardly was an expectation of a follow-up. The system was a dusty legend with some cynical minds arguing whether it existed in the first place.</p>

<p>However, Lenat’s death in August last year has unlocked his <a href="https://www.saildart.org/[*,DBL]/">SAILDART archives</a> account. This has led to a <a href="https://white-flame.com/am-eurisko.html">thrilling discovery</a> of both AM and EURISKO sources by <em>WhiteFlame</em>. In a further development, <em>seveno4</em> has managed to <a href="https://github.com/seveno4/EURISKO">adapt EURISKO to run</a> on Medley Interlisp.</p>

<p>While I marveled at the idea of discovery systems before I hadn’t even considered ever running EURISKO myself as a possibility. Truly an Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark moment. Yet this very low probability event has indeed happened, as documented in the video below. Rewind to 8:20 for the Medley run.</p>
