    <h1>Still no love for WPA3 on the Raspberry Pi 5</h1>
    
    
<p>
About a year ago, I
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/12/22/wpa3/">wrote</a>
about trying to make WPA3 (wireless security) work on a Raspberry Pi 4, 
among other things.  It didn&#39;t work then and it still doesn&#39;t work now.
</p>
<p>
In the past couple of weeks, they released the Pi 5, and it&#39;s been 
making the rounds through the usual people, but somehow, nobody&#39;s 
talking about whether it&#39;ll do WPA3 or not.  So, I&#39;ll break the silence 
and save everyone a lot of work: it
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/">still has</a>
the same CYW43455 wifi+bluetooth chip as the Pi 4, so it has the same 
limitations: no WPA3 support, at least, not right now.  Maybe some day, 
someone will do something about the driver situation, but given that 
nothing has changed in almost a year since my last post, I&#39;m not going 
to hold my breath.
</p>
<p>
This Broadcom / Infineon / Cypress wifi situation has other 
ramifications beyond just the Raspberry Pi ecosystem.  Let&#39;s say you are 
like me and you bought one of the &#34;early 2015&#34; Macbook Pros in 2017 
since the then-current ones had the terrible new keyboard and still 
hadn&#39;t figured out the whole USB-C thing yet.  You didn&#39;t get Ventura 
(13) and are stuck on Monterey (12), never mind Sonoma (14).
</p>
<p>
So, maybe you thought &#34;I know, I&#39;ll install Linux on this thing since 
it still has some life left in it&#34;.  Once you do that, you will discover 
that you are in the same crappy wifi situation.  You won&#39;t be able to 
join a WPA3 network in Linux, either.  The hardware is clearly able to 
support it since it worked as a macOS install, but it&#39;s just not going 
to happen on Linux.  It&#39;s the same sort of software problem.
</p>
<p>
None of this is news, but the
<a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@marcan/110891320579234923">updates</a>
about this mess seem to not get enough visibility.  Note: &#34;seriously 
unmaintained and years behind on features and firmware integration&#34;.  
Wonderful.
</p>
<p>
This puts the Raspberry Pi squarely in the same bucket as &#34;random 
Internet of Shit devices&#34; when it comes to wifi compatibility.  You are 
going to have to keep a terrible auxiliary wireless network around for a 
very long time in order to support them as-is.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, you can just ignore the built-in hardware and buy a dumb 
little USB wifi adapter which is actually supported by regular kernels.  
Then you just plug it in, configure things, and go on with your life.  
(Or, you know, pull actual cabling to it, and live life with the 
stability of hardwired Ethernet.)
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s kind of amazing that this situation persists, given how the Pi is 
supposedly intended for entry-level people who need a low-cost platform 
to learn about stuff.  What happens when they encounter a WPA3-only 
network?  They do exist, and they will only become more numerous over 
time.
