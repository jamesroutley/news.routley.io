            WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building
            autonomous agents. WebArena creates websites from four popular
            categories with functionality and data mimicking their real-world
            equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds
            tools and knowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena
            introduces a benchmark on interpreting high-level realistic natural
            language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide
            annotated programs designed to programmatically validate the
            functional correctness of each task.

                    A high-level task that can be fully executed in WebArena.
                    Completing such tasks requires sophisticated, long-term
                    planning and reasoning capability. To accomplish the goal
                    stated on the top, an agent needs to find out what art
                    museums are located in Pittsburgh by searching Wikipedia.
                    Next, it should identify the location of each museum on a
                    map, optimizing the itinerary based on the information
                    collected. Finally, the agent needs to update the README
                    file in the appropriate repository with the planned route.

                <p><img src="https://kofi.sexy/blog/static/images/evaluation.png"/></p><p>
                    We introduce two evaluation approaches. The top row measures
                    the correctness of performing information seeking tasks. It
                    compares the predicted answer with the annotated reference
                    with three implementations. The bottom row programmatically
                    checks whether the intermediate states during the executions
                    possess the anticipated properties specified by the intent.

                    The comparison between our benchmark and existing benchmarks on
                    grounding natural language instructions to concrete executions.
                    Our benchmark is implemented in our fully interactable
                    highly-realistic WebArena environment. It features diverse tasks
                    human may encounter in their daily routines. We design
                    evaluation metrics to access the functional correctness of task
                    executions.
