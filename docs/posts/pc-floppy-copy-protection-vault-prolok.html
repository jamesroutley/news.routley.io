There&#39;s not much information about the early days of the company, but 1983 was a busy year for them. The <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73425657&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank">trademark filing</a> for Prolok, their first copy-protection product has a first-use date of March 1983. That same year would see several full-page, color advertisements in various PC magazines, making them one of the major competitors of firms like <a href="https://martypc.blogspot.com/2024/08/pc-floppy-copy-protection-softguard.html" target="_blank">Softguard</a>. Compared to the modest back-page adverts from other copy-protection firms, Vault&#39;s advertisements were very slick - clearly put together by a professional ad agency.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikkX_9M50NcABUt7Iyw61hdUXPCPLvCjpCuF19p2iQt5_hzx7zMUYljATkGmJJfa-5FVjtoZqakda_SZjmgbbG_2xV6wikD8J3pZLdfj3ZoG8sDceb3AQUV1owqydk73miLemSKu2lP1qLWw-XcG8KUGASyQddi7AAaE9hmCkys34341DbRLiMRZiW__e3/s1746/ad_02.jfif"><img data-original-height="1746" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikkX_9M50NcABUt7Iyw61hdUXPCPLvCjpCuF19p2iQt5_hzx7zMUYljATkGmJJfa-5FVjtoZqakda_SZjmgbbG_2xV6wikD8J3pZLdfj3ZoG8sDceb3AQUV1owqydk73miLemSKu2lP1qLWw-XcG8KUGASyQddi7AAaE9hmCkys34341DbRLiMRZiW__e3/w470-h640/ad_02.jfif" width="470"/></a><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikjkxa8K42Q5nk6Lz-r8dT9Ppfw4wnIuqXdKWZTAwrt20SjoAk_q9ZR3F8IqAQzB8prmcFK117pDRthlmVr6ZpmCZnNhxPiQLqXtiXWrkLEJbo7FHdO2PcCVp_RevmMvnlLnbxiICQUYKMJqAZ60C_jjslRXHCLbB7TJKmZkSB8HTAxMcrvQ6edGjMb9hL/s1725/ad_01.jfif"><img data-original-height="1725" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikjkxa8K42Q5nk6Lz-r8dT9Ppfw4wnIuqXdKWZTAwrt20SjoAk_q9ZR3F8IqAQzB8prmcFK117pDRthlmVr6ZpmCZnNhxPiQLqXtiXWrkLEJbo7FHdO2PcCVp_RevmMvnlLnbxiICQUYKMJqAZ60C_jjslRXHCLbB7TJKmZkSB8HTAxMcrvQ6edGjMb9hL/w474-h640/ad_01.jfif" width="474"/></a></p><p>One of Vault&#39;s biggest customers was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate" target="_blank">Ashton-Tate</a>, makers of the industry-leading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase" target="_blank">dBase</a> database software and later owners of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_(office_suite)" target="_blank">Framework</a> office suite. Both dBase III v1.0 and Framework 1.0 would see releases incorporating Vault&#39;s Prolok copy protection.  Ashton-Tate was even impressed enough by Prolok to invest $500,000 in Vault, acquiring a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9eJxx_ZGKngC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=vault+corporation+ashton+tate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr9q-Q3LiIAxWASjABHWZ9NUIQ6AF6BAgHEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vault%20corporation%20ashton%20tate&amp;f=false" target="_blank">20% interest</a> in the company. </p><p>Vault had over 2,000 customers of Prolok during its heyday, according to former Vault VP <a href="https://www.peteravritch.com/portfolio/prolok" target="_blank">Peter Avritch</a>. </p><p>Vault expressed a high degree of confidence in their product. One of their advertisements even stated the following:</p><blockquote>We&#39;re proud of Prolok and the fact it represents the end of software piracy.</blockquote><p>I probably don&#39;t need to tell you that Prolok was not the end of software piracy. </p><h2>PROLOK</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEij4-OUdsw9Hcqx5Juz-JIy40Fh3VtWAGzUyyNuVg72zq9BVjbRMiI8PCawFaX2qbcLzDe0eUo8gy9zseYgsfXTV4hHEVhWz3np5KF_PhiToXvhIV6ATmMxY0R5nkzGAbHQGMAL75E0kNKIDjj8DJCra2rw5caonj8dVt91zSkV0ltTINjEjid9x_7Q7ln1/s450/prolok_logo_restored_01.png"><img data-original-height="385" data-original-width="450" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEij4-OUdsw9Hcqx5Juz-JIy40Fh3VtWAGzUyyNuVg72zq9BVjbRMiI8PCawFaX2qbcLzDe0eUo8gy9zseYgsfXTV4hHEVhWz3np5KF_PhiToXvhIV6ATmMxY0R5nkzGAbHQGMAL75E0kNKIDjj8DJCra2rw5caonj8dVt91zSkV0ltTINjEjid9x_7Q7ln1/s16000/prolok_logo_restored_01.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><br/></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Prolok differed from other floppy copy-protections in two significant ways. First, the protection did not rely on unusually formatted diskettes, crazy track layouts or non-standard sectors. Instead, the protection relied on deliberate damage to the disk surface, which Vault referred to as a &#34;fingerprint.&#34;</p><p>Secondly, unlike other methods which were applied during a professional disk duplication process, Prolok was offered as a commercial product in the form of pre-damaged diskettes upon which a software publisher could write their software.  </p><h2>Prolok Software Protection Diskettes</h2><p>Once a software publisher had purchased a set of Prolok protection diskettes, they would use the <span>PROLOK.EXE</span> utility included on the disk to write their software to the disk. The utility would encrypt and wrap the program inside a protected loader.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiW5GmBfCyu7IxQo14qylZ_YlfwuXCRmtdNok7hMc6mFbwfDiX3gDLYNjS2HHbF4sO9cqZ0QY0iM7vdwHtDPpf_xdT1J2r6kYLn85SDGIpv3p0ZQbaE8dFQ7AAXmRCjLLrYoUeIHGEuxYAdTk8wAPwTB4gGourVqJE7s8k5_YMO128IP2UVALV9CS2-aA8N/s1681/protection_disk_package_02.jpg"><img data-original-height="883" data-original-width="1681" height="336" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiW5GmBfCyu7IxQo14qylZ_YlfwuXCRmtdNok7hMc6mFbwfDiX3gDLYNjS2HHbF4sO9cqZ0QY0iM7vdwHtDPpf_xdT1J2r6kYLn85SDGIpv3p0ZQbaE8dFQ7AAXmRCjLLrYoUeIHGEuxYAdTk8wAPwTB4gGourVqJE7s8k5_YMO128IP2UVALV9CS2-aA8N/w640-h336/protection_disk_package_02.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>The Software Protection Diskette Packaging</p><p>Vault produced both 5.25&#34; and 3.5&#34; versions of the Prolok protection diskette, and high density versions of each were released in late 1991.</p><p>Vault offered a evaluation package for $9.95, if you just wanted to see how it worked for your application. A 10-pack cost a little over $30, but bulk orders of Prolok diskettes could drop the cost to as <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_systems-integration-business_1984-04_17_4/page/108/mode/2up?q=vault" target="_blank">little as $1 a disk</a>. This was still relatively expensive compared to what commercial disk duplicators paid for blank media.</p><p>The Prolok technology is described in US patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4785361" target="_blank">#4785361</a>.  The inventor is listed as W. Krag Brotby, who was Vault&#39;s president and chairman.  </p><p>The patent gives a good description of how the technology worked:</p><blockquote><p>The security check procedure involves a test to determine whether the disk on which it has been recorded has or does not have the physical fingerprint that is the hallmark of an authorized disk. If the fingerprint is present, the security check procedure enables the read/write head to read out the protected material; however, if the fingerprint is absent, as it would be from an unauthorized disk, the security check procedure prevents the read/write head from reading out the protected material.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, if the fingerprint is not present, the security check procedure instructs the read/write head to obliterate or to erase the protected material. </p></blockquote><p>Note the last sentence, this would not be the last time Vault expressed a cavalier attitude toward the data of suspected pirates.  Deliberately damaging user data is almost always a bad idea - Vault <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N09JwLeo7s4C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=vault+prolok+incompatibility#v=onepage&amp;q=vault%20prolok%20incompatibility&amp;f=false" target="_blank">ended up replacing</a> some early Prolok-protected media that was inadvertently erased due to compatibility issues. </p><blockquote><p>In a first embodiment of the invention, which is preferred for its simplicity, a localized permanent defective area is intentionally created at the factory on the unrecorded disk at a random location on the recording surface, on the portion of the recording surface reserved for the material to be protected. The effect of the defect is to render the affected portion of the disk incapable of accurately reading out a piece of data that previously a write head had attempted to record on the defect.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly how this damaged area was created is not specified - PC folklore often describes burning a hole through a disk with a laser.  In actuality, no physical hole is produced through the disk media, but you could think of it as a &#34;hole&#34; in the magnetic oxide coating. The side of the disk opposite the fingerprint is not affected.</p><p>Regardless of the exact mechanism - laser or otherwise - a robotic process was employed that precisely disturbed the fine iron oxide coating on the disk sufficiently that it could no longer be written to.  More than one damaged area may be present on a single disk.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjq3h6kJHPq5JEtcPLtwb91n9UB7wf5cZ_NJ_o-uIxuhNyk1NVjf4hTMpoRPeienW3YJbtHeZgXpSNqeBuB7ZQpOuUO16MQGeyVh6e-oMhwKAJU3Zq3t7B_ktt3piJZLLJCIWNyhoJfVcASuouRI_T-ovSIKUrZ2HBy06kLCsmsNfwboIKVoDLb8AIj6x9f/s1741/prolok_mark_01.jpg"><img data-original-height="1741" data-original-width="1741" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjq3h6kJHPq5JEtcPLtwb91n9UB7wf5cZ_NJ_o-uIxuhNyk1NVjf4hTMpoRPeienW3YJbtHeZgXpSNqeBuB7ZQpOuUO16MQGeyVh6e-oMhwKAJU3Zq3t7B_ktt3piJZLLJCIWNyhoJfVcASuouRI_T-ovSIKUrZ2HBy06kLCsmsNfwboIKVoDLb8AIj6x9f/w640-h640/prolok_mark_01.jpg" width="640"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>The Prolok &#34;Fingerprint&#34;</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
