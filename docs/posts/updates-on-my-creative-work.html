<p>2024-07-07</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write more but I only have some loose ideas bouncing around. Nothing feels like a coherent story I can turn into a blog post. I don&#39;t want to end up not writing anything so I am going to throw these loose observations in one post and see how I like that.</p>

<h2>The Artist&#39;s Way is amazing</h2>

<p>Reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">&#34;The Artist&#39;s Way&#34;</a> has been a transformational experience for me. I understand so much better now how I get in the way of myself when writing music. I don&#39;t know where to begin to explain but one good example is that instead of trying to control and steer myself in a certain direction (&#34;I want to make an XYZ kind of song that sounds like artist ABC&#34;) it works much better if I let the music happen as I write it (&#34;I don&#39;t know how this song will turn out but I am going to bring it to life to the best of my abilities&#34;).</p>

<h2>The book &#34;The Creative Habit&#34; is not for me</h2>

<p>A friend recommended  Twyla Tharp&#39;s book <a href="https://www.twylatharp.org/works/creative-habit-learn-it-and-use-it-life">&#34;The Creative Habit: Learn It And Use It For Life&#34;</a> to me. The author seems to be very hard on herself and she tries to shame and goad the reader into doing the same. An example of the tone of the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope you&#39;ve been to the ballet and seen a dance company in action on stage. If you haven&#39;t, shame on you; that&#39;s like admitting you&#39;ve never read a novel or strolled through a museum or heard a Beethoven symphony live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being talked to like that just isn&#39;t motivating for me.</p>

<h2>The book &#34;The Creative Act&#34; has grown on me</h2>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://github.com/0024-creativity-books/#creative-act">this book by Rick Rubin two months ago</a> and I didn&#39;t like the tone at the time. Now that I have learned more and now that I have &#34;The Creative Habit&#34; to compare it with Rubin&#39;s book has grown on me. His attitude towards creativity and his observations about things that work and don&#39;t work align with what I now believe.</p>

<p>I found this book nowhere near as helpful as The Artist&#39;s Way but it&#39;s still nice to nod in agreement with the things someone with so much experience is writing.</p>

<h2>Naming songs is hard</h2>

<p>It is important to me to publish my songs in some way and to do that I need to give them names. But I write instrumental music; there are no lyrics in my songs. I cannot just let some words from the lyrics be the title.</p>

<p>It has happened several times to me now that a song seems finished (it&#39;s recorded and all), I want to publish it, but I get stuck for days just trying to come up with a name that feels good.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even think the names I come up with are that great. But I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable using randomly generated pure nonsense either. I am bemused by the fact that this part of the process (naming) is so difficult.</p>

<h2>I made a video showing how I write music</h2>

<p>You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9olxSnaXj1U">here</a>. In that video I am doing improvisational writing which became the first half of the song <a href="https://soundcloud.com/collector-current/cks-is-json">CKS is JSON</a>. (Yes, it took me days to decide on that name.)</p>

<p>It was really fun to record this video and see what actually happens when I write music. It was also fun to sit down with the camera rolling and say to myself &#34;I am going to be creative now&#34; and then it actually happened. I actually did this twice that day. The first time the sound of the video wasn&#39;t good enough to share it, but the first writing session of that day became the second half of the song.</p>

<p>One of the lessons I&#39;ve drawn from The Artist&#39;s Way is that creativity is essentially abundant. If you invite the ideas they will come. Even if you are recording a video of yoursef while being way out of your comfort zone.</p>
