                <p>In a way, these two books are <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/everything-i-needed-to-know-about-programming-i-learned-from-basic/">responsible for my entire professional career</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/image.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image.png 1446w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>With early computers, you didn&#39;t boot up to a fancy schmancy desktop, or a screen full of apps you could easily poke and prod with your finger. No, <strong>those computers booted up to the command line.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-1.png" alt=""/></figure><p>From here, if you were lucky, you might have a cassette tape drive. If you knew the right commands, you could type them in to load programs from cassette tape. But that was an expensive add-on option with early personal computers. For many of us, if we wanted the computer to do anything, we had to type in entire programs from books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games">101 Basic Computer Games</a>, by hand... <a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2">like so</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png 784w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Yep, believe it or not, circa 1983, <em>this was our idea of a good time</em>. No, we didn&#39;t get out much. The book itself was a sort of greatest hits compilation of games collected from Ahl&#39;s seminal <a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/66_Dave_tells_Ahl__the_hist.php">Creative Computing magazine in the 1970s</a>:</p><blockquote>As soon as Ahl made up his mind to leave DEC, he started laying the groundwork for Creative Computing. He announced intentions to publish the magazine at NCC in June 1974 and over the next few months contacted prospective authors, got mailing lists, arranged for typesetting and printing, and started organizing hundreds of other details.</blockquote><p>I also <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-of-creative-computing/">loved Creative Computing</a>, but it was a little before my time:</p><ul><li>1971 ‚Äì Ahl ports the programs from FOCAL to BASIC.</li><li>1973 ‚Äì <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games">101 BASIC Computer Games</a> is first published by DEC.</li><li>1974 ‚Äì Ahl founds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine)">Creative Computing</a> magazine and acquires the rights to the book from DEC.</li><li>1977 ‚Äì the ‚Äútrinity‚Äù of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a> üñ•Ô∏è, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET </a> Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 </a> üñ•Ô∏è microcomputers are released to the public, all with BASIC built in, at prices regular people could mostly afford üôå</li><li>1978 ‚Äì a second edition of BASIC Computer Games is released, this time published by Ahl himself.</li></ul><p>As you can see, there‚Äôs no way average people in 1973-1976 were doing a whole lot with BASIC programs, as <em>they had no microcomputers capable of running BASIC to buy! </em>It took a while for inexpensive personal computers to trickle down to the mainstream, which brings us to roughly 1984 when the sequels started appearing.</p><p>There was a <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16765.basic-computer-games-small-basic-edition.aspx">half-hearted attempt to modernize these early BASIC programs in 2010 with SmallBasic</a>, but I didn&#39;t feel these ports did much to bring the code up to date, and overall had little relevance to modern code practices. You can compare <a href="https://pastebin.com/j4jzGd4V">the original 1973 BASIC Civil War</a> with <a href="https://pastebin.com/5q1B0t2C">the 2010 SmallBasic port</a> to see what I mean:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/image-3.png 1600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/image-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Certainly we can do a bit better than merely removing the line numbers? What about <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-greatest-invention-in-computer-science/">our old buddy the subroutine, </a><em><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-greatest-invention-in-computer-science/">merely the greatest invention in computer science</a></em><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-greatest-invention-in-computer-science/">?</a> It&#39;s nowhere to be seen. ü§î</p><p>So it was with considerable enthusiasm that I contacted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Ahl">David H. Ahl</a>, the author, and asked for permission to create a website that attempted to truly update all these ancient BASIC programs.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/basic-computer-games-signed-david-ahl.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/basic-computer-games-signed-david-ahl.jpg 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/basic-computer-games-signed-david-ahl.jpg 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/basic-computer-games-signed-david-ahl.jpg 1600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/basic-computer-games-signed-david-ahl.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Thankfully, permission was granted. It&#39;s hard to understate <a href="https://time.com/69316/basic/">how important this book was to an entire generation of programmers</a>. At one point, <strong>there were more copies of this book in print than there were personal computers, period!</strong></p><blockquote>... in 1973, DEC published an anthology, <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em>. The book quickly went into a second printing, for a total of 10,000 copies sold. ‚ÄúThat was far more books than there were computers around, so people were buying three, four, five of them for each computer.‚Äù</blockquote><p>It went on to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games#Reception">first computer book to sell a million copies</a>. Quite a legacy.</p><p>I think we owe it to the world to bring this book up to date using <strong>modern, memory safe languages that embody the original spirit of BASIC, </strong>and modern programming practices including subroutines.</p><p>So let&#39;s do this. <strong>Please <a href="https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games">join us on GitHub</a></strong>, where we&#39;re updating those original 101 BASIC games in memory safe, general purpose scripting languages:</p><ul><li>Java</li><li>Python</li><li>C#</li><li>VB.NET</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>Ruby</li><li>Delphi / Object Pascal</li><li>Perl</li></ul><p>Now, bear in mind these are <em>very</em> primitive games from the 1970s. They aren&#39;t going to win any awards for gameplay, or programming sophistication. But they <em>are </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_mainframe_games">precious artifacts of early computing</a> that deserve to be preserved for future generations, including the wonderful <a href="http://www.bekerbots.com/botbooks.htm">original art by George Beker</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/Chomperanimated2.gif" alt=""/></figure><p><strong>We need your help to do this right</strong>, and <em>collaboratively together</em>, as with all modern programming projects. Imagine we&#39;re all typing these programs in simultaneously together online, all over the world, instead of being isolated alone in our room in 1984, cursing at the inevitable typo we made somewhere when typing the code in by hand out of the bookü§¨.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3lhtcGzhkc?start=349&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Thanks Mr. Ahl.
