    <h1>The Free Software Foundation Europe deleted its account on X</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="content"><p id="category"><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/news.en.html">News</a></p><p><span>on: </span><time>2025-12-04</time></p><p>The Free Software Foundation Europe deleted its account on X. The 
platform never aligned with our values and no longer serves as a space 
for communication. What initially intended to be a place for dialogue and 
information exchange has turned into a centralised arena of hostility, 
misinformation, and profit-driven control, far removed from the ideals 
of freedom we stand for.</p><figure><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/fd/a7/5c9070674249d3725da40535df2f.png" alt="A split image shows the Twitter bird icon dissolving into digital fragments on the left and a colorful decentralized network on the right, with bright light at the center."/></figure><p>Since Elon Musk acquired the social network formerly known as 
Twitter and rebranded it as X, the Free Software Foundation Europe 
(FSFE) has been closely monitoring the developments of this proprietary 
platform, a space we were never comfortable joining, yet one that was 
once important for reaching members of society who were not active in 
our preferred spaces for interaction. Over time, it has become 
increasingly hostile, with misinformation, harassment, and hate speech 
more visible than ever.</p><p>The FSFE initially joined Twitter as it offered a space to promote 
the Free Software values and to interact with policymakers, 
journalists, and above all, reaching to people who were not yet 
familiar with Free Software and its benefits. The social network was 
another tool the FSFE used to share information about our initiatives, 
to explain to users their right to control our technology, and to 
promote software freedom across society, while also encouraging the use 
of alternative, decentralised social media networks.</p><p>However, the current platform direction and climate  combined with an algorithm 
that prioritises hatred, polarisation, and sensationalism, alongside 
growing privacy and data protection concerns, has led us to the 
decision to part ways with this platform.</p><p><strong>Consequently, the FSFE decided to permanently delete its account on 
X</strong>. We keep being active on some other proprietary platforms in order 
to reach a wider part of society, journalists, and decision makers.</p><p>At the same time, we strongly encourage everyone who shares our 
commitment to digital freedom and decentralisation to join us in the 
Fediverse. Unlike proprietary platforms driven by profit and 
centralised control, the Fediverse empowers users to choose how and 
where they connect, ensuring transparency, autonomy, and resilience.
