    <h1>Ask HN: Is TypeScript worth it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I have been using TypeScript for a few years now, and I haven&#39;t yet been convinced that I would choose to use it if I had the choice; not just for my own personal projects but for large scale applications where the codebase is shared with many developers.</p><p>I want to skip over the static typing benefits argument, because I think it is well understood that static typing is a good thing and if we could bless JavaScript with a built-in and robust typing system then I don&#39;t think many people would be against that. My issue is with the amount of extra work it places on developers, much of it the &#34;dumb&#34; kind of work which can eat up hours and doesn&#39;t deliver all that much value.</p><p>i) Like a framework, you are at the whim of TS devs as it gets updated (edited)</p><p>For example, a new package you install can require a new TypesScript version. Once installed, you then may need to update your source code. This can place quite a high tax on the developer, where perhaps a 10 minute change becomes hours long.</p><p>ii) Libraries are badly documented</p><p>Most libraries do not document their types, or have no examples using TypeScript. Some worst offenders: Apollo, Protobufjs. The type definitions exported by these libraries can be large and complex, and the error messages emitted by TypeScript are so long and cryptic the result is often a drawn out process of trial and error along with trawling through source files.</p><p>iii) Error messages are hard to follow</p><p>Errors are long and don&#39;t provide enough detail. They will explain a type mismatch referencing many types you may not have ever seen, and are not documented anywhere. Except for simple errors, many of them are very hard to follow to a remedy.</p><p>iv) It requires yet more transpilation</p><p>Transpilation takes time, and always adds a burden to developers. I didn&#39;t mind so much with ES6 etc because eventually many functions were included in a broad set of browsers. There doesn&#39;t seem to be much progress including TypeScript in a browser, and feels like these complicated transpilation steps could be with us for a long time.</p><p>I could probably add more to this list, but my point is that I just can&#39;t see that TypeScript is worth all this time investment and making progress so slow sometimes. Are there others that come to this conclusion? I mainly see positive posts about TypeScript.</p><p>edit: I referred to TypeScript as a framework which it isn&#39;t. However it feels similar to me in that you are at the whim of TypeScript developers and how they decide to progress with the language.</p></div></td></div></div>
