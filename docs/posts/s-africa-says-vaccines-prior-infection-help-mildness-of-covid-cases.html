But among the over-50s vaccination coverage levels are over 60%.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Addressing the same news conference, Michelle Groome from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said there had been an uptick in COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#34;Starting to see a slight increase in deaths nationally, but once again this level is very much lower even than the baseline period we were seeing between the second and third waves,&#34; said Groome, who heads the NICD&#39;s division of public health, surveillance and response.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_url="/world/africa/south-africa-seeing-slight-increase-covid-19-deaths-off-low-base-2021-12-17/"><div><div><p>A pharmacist prepares a dose of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Pfizer vaccine amidst the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron in Johannesburg, South Africa, December 04, 2021.

She added that a further 3.5% of those who had died had been vaccinated more than five or six months ago.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Phaahla said early indications were that infections might have peaked in the most populated Gauteng province, where cases initially surged.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">He added that in the coming week the health department would report back to the National Coronavirus Command Council on whether COVID-19 restrictions should be adjusted.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, is making good progress with his recovery from COVID-19 while continuing to receive treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said on Friday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Ramaphosa was given Johnson &amp; Johnson&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JNJ.N" target="_blank">(JNJ.N)</a> one-dose vaccine in February. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safricas-ramaphosa-recovering-covid-19-symptoms-still-mild-presidency-2021-12-17/"> read more </a></p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Giles Elgood</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
