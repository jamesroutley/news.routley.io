<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul><li>Mexican digital rights organization R3D (Red en los Defensa de los Derechos Digitales) has identified Pegasus infections against journalists and a human rights defender taking place between 2019-2021.</li>
<li>The Citizen Lab provided technical support for R3D’s analysis and validated the infections.</li>
<li>Victims include two journalists that report on issues related to official corruption and a prominent human rights defender.</li>
<li>The infections occurred years after the first revelations of Pegasus abuses in Mexico.</li>
<li>They also occurred after Mexico’s current President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, assured the public that the government no longer used the spyware and that there would be no further abuses.</li>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 2017, the Citizen Lab, along with partners R3D, SocialTic and Article19, released a series of <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/">eight</a> <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/">reports</a> on widespread Pegasus targeting in Mexico. Many sectors of Mexican civil society were targeted, including <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/11/mexican-journalists-investigating-cartels-targeted-nso-spyware-following-assassination-colleague/">investigative journalists</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/08/lawyers-murdered-women-nso-group/">lawyers for cartel victims’ families</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/08/nso-spyware-mexico-corruption/">anti-corruption groups</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/more-mexican-nso-targets/">prominent lawmakers</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/mexico-disappearances-nso/">international investigators</a> examining enforced disappearances, and even the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/">spouse of a journalist killed in a cartel slaying</a>.</p>
<p>A public scandal ensued when the Pegasus targeting was first revealed, resulting in extensive scrutiny into the surveillance practices of Mexican authorities, and especially prosecutors. A still-ongoing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-tech-surveillance/insight-pegasus-spyware-scandal-years-of-questions-no-answers-for-mexico-victims-idUSL8N2PD6BQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminal investigation</a> was also opened in Mexico.</p>
<p>In 2021, as part of the <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pegasus Project</a> revelations (a collaboration between Forbidden Stories, Amnesty International’s Security Lab, and a coalition of media organizations), it was reported that at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/fifty-people-close-mexico-president-amlo-among-potential-targets-nso-clients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 people in the circle of Andrés Manuel López Obrador</a>, Mexico’s current president, were among individuals potentially selected for surveillance with Pegasus between 2016-2017. The targets included the now-President’s children and spouse. The same report indicated that at least 45 Mexican governors and former governors may have been similarly selected for surveillance.</p>
<p>The Pegasus Project also found that <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/the-pegasus-project/politically-active-mexican-teachers-may-have-been-targeted-for-digital-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide swath of Mexican civil society</a>, from teachers to journalists, lawyers and international investigators examining enforced disappearances, may have been selected for surveillance.</p>
<p>In 2019, after taking power, López Obrador assured Mexicans in a <a href="https://youtu.be/BjzRY-nQT2w?t=2899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">televised press conference</a> that there would be no more Pegasus abuses in Mexico:</p>
<p>“<i>We are not involved with that. Here we decided that there would not be any persecution against anyone. When we were in the opposition we were spied on (…) now that is prohibited. We have not purchased systems for interceptions, among other things because of the corruption that was involved in the purchase of all of this equipment at very elevated prices, to foreign companies, spy systems, a lot of money was spent, there is still unused equipment purchased in the previous government. We don’t do that. And we don’t do it because it is a matter of principle”. </i>[informal translation]</p>
<p>In 2021, Mexico’s <a href="https://youtu.be/HOrjI2dMl4U?t=5520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president reiterated his claim</a> that the Mexican government was not spying with Pegasus, saying in response to a question: <i>“This does not happen.The government does not spy on anyone.” </i>[informal translation]</p>
<p>The latest findings by R3D indicate that Pegasus abuses continued in Mexico. Their report also highlights evidence of recent contracts between Mexico’s Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA), and companies linked to prior sales of Pegasus to the Mexican government.</p>
<h2>New Findings</h2>
<p>R3D, with technical support from the Citizen Lab, has determined that Mexican journalists and a human rights defender were infected with Pegasus between 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>These cases differ from previous findings in two important ways:</p>
<ul><li>We validate the 2019-2021 Pegasus infections using forensic analysis of artifacts collected from devices. Prior Citizen Lab findings in Mexico only confirmed Pegasus targeting (as evidenced by a malicious message sent to a device).</li>
<li>The 2019-2021 infections leveraged zero-click attacks: no deception was required to trick victims into clicking. The Citizen Lab’s previous reports on Mexican cases found malicious text messages designed to trick targets into clicking on a link that would trigger an infection.</li>
</ul><p>Our technical validation of forensic artifacts collected from the devices of these individuals with their consent leads us to conclude with high confidence that:</p>
<ul><li>Human rights defender Raymundo Ramos was hacked with Pegasus at least three times between August and September 2020.</li>
<li>Journalist and author Ricardo Raphael was hacked with Pegasus at least three times in October and December 2019, and again in December 2020. He was also previously targeted and infected in 2016, and targeted in 2017.</li>
<li>An anonymous journalist from prominent online media outlet <a href="https://www.animalpolitico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Politico</a> was hacked in June 2021.</li>
</ul><p>Further details for each case are provided in Appendix A.</p>
<p>We assess with high confidence that these individuals were hacked with Pegasus spyware. The technical data available for these recent cases (2019-2021) does not enable us to attribute the hacking to a particular NSO Group customer at this time. However, each of the victims would be of intense interest to entities within the Mexican government and in some cases, troublingly, to cartels.</p>
<h3>Hacking Timeframe</h3>
<p>The report published by R3D provides helpful context for understanding the potential triggers for Pegasus targeting and infections, which we summarize here:</p>
<p><strong>Raymundo Ramos Vázquez</strong></p>
<p>Ramos has spent years documenting human rights violations committed by the Mexican Army and Navy in the state of Tamaulipas:</p>
<ul><li>Ramos was infected with Pegasus in August and September 2020. R3D found that the infections occurred after the publication of a video showing the extrajudicial killing of civilians by the Mexican army in Tamaulipas. Ramos had spoken to the media about the case.</li>
<li>During the timeframe of the targeting, Ramos was meeting with representatives of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), officials from Mexico’s Navy and Secretary of Defense, and members of the media.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ricardo Raphael</strong></p>
<p>Raphael, a prominent journalist and author who focuses on themes including official corruption and the nexus between the Mexican government and cartels, was extensively targeted and infected with Pegasus spyware:</p>
<ul><li>Raphael was first targeted and infected 2016, and again targeted in 2017 during a period of critical reporting on investigations into the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35539727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iguala Mass Disappearances</a> (the 43 students disappeared in Ayotzinapa in 2014).
<ul><li aria-level="2">We attribute the 2017 targeting to an operator that we call <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/"><b><i>RECKLESS-1</i></b></a>, which also targeted the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/">spouse</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/11/mexican-journalists-investigating-cartels-targeted-nso-spyware-following-assassination-colleague/">colleagues</a> of an assassinated Mexican journalist, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/11/mexican-journalists-investigating-cartels-targeted-nso-spyware-following-assassination-colleague/">as well as</a> Mexican public health researchers.  Circumstantial evidence connects <b><i>RECKLESS-1</i></b> to the Mexican Government, as the operator was spying exclusively in Mexico.</li>
</ul></li>
<li aria-level="1">In 2019, he was repeatedly infected with Pegasus while on tour for a book that provides a fictionalized account of Los Zetas Cartel and its origins in the Mexican Army.</li>
<li aria-level="1">In 2020, he was infected after writing on extrajudicial detentions and official impunity, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/es/post-opinion/2020/08/25/fuerzas-armadas-fuego-fuero-e-impunidad-en-nuevo-laredo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this <i>Washington Post</i> editorial</a>. Not long before he was infected in December 2020, he had accused <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ricardomraphael/status/1338115133051199488" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexico’s Attorney General</a> of serious misconduct in their investigation of the Iguala Mass Disappearances case. This critique was cited by prominent news outlet <a href="https://aristeguinoticias.com/2612/mexico/2020-el-fin-de-la-verdad-historica-sobre-ayotzinapa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Aristegui Noticias</i></a> the day prior to the hacking.</li>
</ul><p>According to the R3D report, Raphael stated that, in 2022, snippets of a private communication were taken out of context and shared with his contacts in an apparent effort to discredit him.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous Journalist at Animal Politico</strong></p>
<p>Animal Politico is a prominent online news website that reports on themes such as official corruption, extrajudicial killings, and accountability:</p>
<ul><li>A journalist at the outlet was infected on the same day they published a report on human rights violations by the Mexican Armed Forces.</li>
</ul><h2>Need for an Independent Investigation</h2>
<p>These latest cases, which come years after the first revelations of problematic Pegasus targeting in Mexico, illustrate the abuse potential of mercenary spyware in a context of flawed public accountability and transparency. Even in the face of global scrutiny, domestic outcry, and a new administration that pledged to never use spyware, the targeting of journalists and human rights defenders with Pegasus spyware continued in Mexico.</p>
<h2>Appendix: Victim Details</h2>
<h3>Pegasus Victim: Raymundo Ramos</h3>
<p>Analysis of forensic indicators collected from the device of human rights defender Raymundo Ramos shows that it was infected with the KISMET zero-click exploit on or around:</p>
<ul><li>2020-08-28</li>
<li>2020-09-02</li>
<li>2020-09-03</li>
</ul><h3>Pegasus Victim: Ricardo Raphael</h3>
<p>An analysis of forensic indicators from journalist Ricardo Raphael’s phone indicates that he was hacked three times with what we refer to as the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/catalangate-extensive-mercenary-spyware-operation-against-catalans-using-pegasus-candiru/">HOMAGE zero-click exploit</a> in 2019, on or around:</p>
<ul><li>2019-10-30</li>
<li>2019-11-07</li>
<li>2019-11-16</li>
</ul><p>Raphael was then hacked with a different zero-click exploit on or around:</p>
<ul><li>2020-12-27</li>
</ul><p>Analysis of Raphael’s device also found evidence of prior Pegasus hacking and targeting as far back as 2016.</p>
<p>Raphael was first targeted on <strong>May 26, 2016</strong> via a Pegasus SMS:</p>

<p>The URL, which is shortened with bit.ly, redirects to the Pegasus infection domain hxxps://network190[.]com/5557819s/.</p>
<p>This targeting resulted in a persistent Pegasus infection.</p>
<p>Raphael was <strong>again, twice, targeted via SMS in 2017</strong>. We found no evidence that this targeting resulted in successful infections.</p>

<p>The URL redirects to hxxps://notisms[.]net/bNBzPerL. The domain notisms[.]net was part of NSO Group’s Pegasus infection infrastructure when the message was sent.  We link the domain notisms[.]net to the operator we call <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/"><b><i>RECKLESS-1</i></b></a>, which we link to the Mexican Government.</p>

<p>The domain banca-movil[.]net was also part of NSO Group’s Pegasus infection infrastructure when the message was sent.  We link the domain banca-movil[.]net to the operator we call <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/"><b><i>RECKLESS-1</i></b></a>, which we link to the Mexican Government.</p>
<h3>Pegasus Victim: Anonymous Journalist from Animal Politico</h3>
<p>Analysis of forensic indicators collected from the device of a journalist who prefers to remain anonymous shows that it was infected once with the FORCEDENTRY zero-click on or around:</p>
