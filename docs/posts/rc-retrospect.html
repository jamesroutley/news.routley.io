        <p>My focus shifted wildly during my batch. For my application I wrote
        that I wanted to implement a machine learning library using
        scheme<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. I quickly let go of this idea and proceeded
        to socialize and get in the groove of the RC spirit. For a large part
        of the first half of my batch I did a lot of coffee talks, learned
        about HTML and CSS and how to use <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/building-this-website.html">org-mode and emacs to create this
        blog</a>. A personal reflection is that I can be pretty harsh on
        myself. Looking back at my previous RC notes (<a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-1.html">RC-week-1.html</a>, <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-2.html">RC-week-2.html</a>, <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-3.html">RC-week-3.html</a>, <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-4.html">RC-week-4.html</a> and <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-halfbatch.html">RC-halfbatch.html</a>) I summarize them below.</p>
        <p>First off, I thought that my web-development learning would be swift
        and I would go on to do &#34;bigger&#34; things. In reality, this part took
        longer, on the other hand, I actually built this website by hand (a
        labour of love!) and in itself that is something beautiful. My <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-2.html#getting-focused-on-project">main project</a> (which did
        not materialize at the end during the batch, but I have some vague
        sense that this will be finished in the future) started forming in my
        mind early and I still have the data around. I did not finish it. I did
        do several presentations and non-presentations, but could maybe have
        done better. However, I did still present! Looking at the presentations
        have really been inspiring to me, enforcing the rule of learning in the
        open and sharing what we&#39;ve learned.</p>
        <p>For impossible day I learned to how to use flask to set up a
        web-server which was great. Got into the weeds on how to use databases,
        minimal html and elements used for functionality through <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">flask</a>. One more step
        to becoming a full-stack ML developer (I jest.. or?). This was a step
        forward, but I still <a href="https://cgad.ski/blog/RC-week-4.html#zigzags-in-my-road">felt a
        bit unfocused</a>. As a side-project I learned some algorithms and data
        structures, and I can say that this has actually been a success and
        will hopefully help me land a job soon.</p>
        <p>A thing I did not go into much was that I levelled up my toolsets
        and personal workflow. I will probably make a note about this later but
        in short</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a satisfactory org-mode + jupyter kernel workflow which
          <strong>actually works</strong>.</li>
          <li>Set up a VPN so I can connect to devices on my home network,
          which allowed for the above computational notebook to actually be
          possible in the first place.</li>
          <li>Bought a GPU and installed it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all a great outcome, and possibly in the spirit of RC?</p>
        <p>I also learned Jax and Diffusion models, together with some
        mechanistic interpretability, mostly for the family of LLMs and
        transformers. This was lead by the great <a href="https://www.changlinli.com/">Changlin Li</a>. Dipping into ML in this
        way has been great and re-ignited a passion again.</p>
        <p>So where does this leave us (me)? Three months seem long, but it&#39;s
        short. Chipping away day-by-day is the only way to keep going though
        and does lead to returns, essentially yielding cumulative interest on
        what you have learned and you knowledge. I feel like a more apt and
        capable technologist and understand how computers work better and how
        to use the web to share more openly. This was one of my goals coming
        into RC so this has been a great success. And this by itself made RC
        worth it.</p>
