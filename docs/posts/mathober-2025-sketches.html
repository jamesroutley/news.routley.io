Check back and see what&#39;s been added throughout the month. </p><h2 id="1link">1 - Link</h2><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/10/Link.JPG" alt="Six rings held togher by a single ring going over and under, where each ring is a circular tree branch with lichen, moss, ferns, and mushrooms growing off. Everything is radially symmetrical so that the six rings have repeated growths and lighting. On each ring there is a brown creeper facing clockwise with a dark speckled top and white brest with a curved beak. it faces a tiny mushroom. the background goes from a light yellow to dark slate blue from the off-center center of the radial sketch with a smeared cloudy feel to it. in the lower corner is a signature S with a period.
