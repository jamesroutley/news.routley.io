					<p>The Inline XBRL viewer allows a user
							to quickly and easily review details of the tagged information in
							an Inline document by automatically placing a top and bottom
							highlight border around each tagged numeric fact and left and
							right border for each block tagged fact. Hovering over a tagged
							fact will highlight (shade) all content related to the tagged
							fact, and clicking on a tagged fact will reveal its tagging
							details in the Fact Review Window. Navigation, search and filter
							options are also provided to easily refine and identify specific
							types of tagged information.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					
					<div id="help-fact-review-window" data-parent="#help-sections">
						<p>The Fact Review Window shows the tagging
							details for the currently selected fact, which is highlighted
							with a solid blue border. There are four categories of fact detail
							which can be viewed; an &#34;N/A&#34; value indicates there is no
							available information for the item within the given category:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Attributes - All primary information (as
								applicable) describing the tagged fact including period, sign,
								decimals, dimensional detail (axes and members), scale, measure
								and data type.</li>
							<li>Labels - Detailed documentation
								(definition) for the tag used, and other labels.</li>
							<li>References - Authoritative reference
								information (as applicable) for the selected tag.</li>
							<li>Calculation - Balance and calculation
								hierarchy details (numeric non-dimensioned items only).</li>
						</ul>

					<div id="help-search" data-parent="#help-sections">
						<p>There are two ways to search the
							document: FACTS AND SECTIONS. To search information, enter a
							keyword in a search box and select the magnifying glass icon to
							return matching results. Search operators &#34;and&#34; (via &#34;AND&#34; or
							&#34;&amp;&#34;) and &#34;or&#34; (via &#34;OR&#34; or &#34;|&#34;) are available to further refine a
							search.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>FACTS</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The Search Facts box can be used to find
							tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag
							labels, and tagged content are included in Search. Tagged facts
							matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored
							(default) shading on the page and appear in the Facts List.
							Select the &#34;X&#34; button to the left of the magnifying glass icon to
							clear the search.</p>
						<p>The content included in Search can be increased to
							included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative
							references by selecting the cog / wheel icon to the left of the
							search box. See Settings for more information.</p>
						
						<p>
							<strong>SECTIONS</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The Search Sections box can be used to
							filter the tagged sections of the financial statements.</p>
					</div>

				<div>
					
					<div id="help-filter" data-parent="#help-sections">
						<p>Filters change the number of highlighted
							facts and items in the fact list by providing several ways to
							review and pinpoint certain tagged information. Multiple filters
							can be used at once.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>DATA FILTERS</strong>
						</p>
						<p>These filter options allow the user to
							refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All - Displays all tagged data (default)</li>
							<li>Amounts Only - Numeric facts only</li>
							<li>Text Only - Textual facts only</li>
							<li>Calculations Only - Numeric facts
								participating in a calculation only</li>
							<li>Negatives Only - Negative Numeric amounts
								only</li>
							<li>Additional Items Only - Tagged facts
								without a corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden facts)
								only</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>TAGS FILTER</strong>
						</p>
						<p>These filters allow the user to refine
							the highlighted facts by tag type:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All - Displays all tagged data (default)</li>
							<li>Standard Only- Facts with standard tags
								from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, IFRS, DEI).</li>
							<li>Custom Only - Facts with extension
								&#34;custom&#34; tags unique to the entity&#39;s document.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>MORE FILTERS</strong>
						</p>
						<p>Additional filters that allow user to
							further refine the highlighted facts:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Periods - List of all used context years
								and reporting periods</li>
							<li>Measures - List of all used units of
								measure (e.g., US Dollars); as applicable</li>
							<li>Axis - List of all used axis
								(dimensions); as applicable (dimensions); as applicable</li>
							<li>Scale - List of all used scaled options
								(e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable</li>
							<li>Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Multiple filters work in conjunction
							with each other. For example, selecting the &#34;Amounts Only&#34; Data
							filter and &#34;Custom Only&#34; Tags filter will highlight only numeric
							tagged facts using custom tags and list them in the fact list.
							Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are
							selected. Active filters can be removed individually by
							unchecking or selecting ALL option for each filter, or all at
							once via the &#34;Reset All Filters&#34; option.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					
					<div id="help-facts-results-list" data-parent="#help-sections">
						<p>On the toolbar, select the &#34;count&#34; to
							the right of the word Facts (e.g., Facts 234) to reveal the Facts
							List results - a navigable listing of all currently highlighted
							tagged facts. The count represents the current number of facts.</p>
						<p>By default, all tagged facts are
							displayed in the Fact List Results. The list content and count
							reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and
							Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged
							facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the
							list as well as move the current view to the corresponding
							highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts
							Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.</p>
						<p>Certain letters may appear to the right
							of an item in the Fact Result list to indicate a certain
							property. If the letter &#34;A&#34; appears for a fact, it indicates the
							fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no
							corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter &#34;C&#34; appears, the
							fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter &#34;D&#34; appears, the
							fact is tagged with dimensional information.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					
					<div id="help-tagged-sections" data-parent="#help-sections">
						<p>The SECTIONS toolbar item provides a
							listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document. Sections
							are divided into three groups:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Document &amp; Entity Information</li>
							<li>Financial Statements</li>
							<li>Notes to the Financial Statements</li>
						</ul>
						<p>By expanding a group and selecting a
							section item in the listing, Inline XBRL viewer will navigate to that section.
							When the Tagged Sections feature is open, the Search Sections box
							will additionally filter the list of sections to only those
							sections that match the entered criteria.</p>
