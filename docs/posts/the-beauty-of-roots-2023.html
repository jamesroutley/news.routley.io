<h2>The Beauty of Roots</h2>
<h4>John Baez</h4>
<h4>September 29, 2023 </h4>

<p>
Around 2006, my 
friend <a href="http://jdc.math.uwo.ca/roots">Dan Christensen</a>
created a fascinating picture of all the roots of all polynomials of degree 
≤ 5 with integer coefficients 
ranging from -4 to 4:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/deg5.png">
<img width="600" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/deg5.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

Click on the picture for bigger view.  Roots of quadratic polynomials
are in grey; roots of cubics are in cyan; roots of quartics are in red
and roots of quintics are in black.  The horizontal axis of symmetry
is the real axis; the vertical axis of symmetry is the imaginary axis.
The big hole in the middle is centered at 0; the next biggest holes
are at ±1, and there are also holes at ±i and all the
sixth roots of 1.

</p><p>
You can see lots of fascinating patterns here, like how the roots of
polynomials with integer coefficients tend to avoid integers and roots
of unity - except when they land <em>right on</em> these points!  You
can see more patterns if you zoom in:

</p><p><img src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/deg5_closeup.jpg"/>
</p>

<p>
Now you see beautiful feathers surrounding the blank area
around the point 1 on the real axis, a hexagonal star
around \(\exp(i \pi/ 3)\), a strange red curve from this point to 
1, smaller stars around other points, and more....

</p><p>
People should study this sort of thing!  Let&#39;s define the
<em>Christensen set</em> \(C_{d,n}\) to be the set of all roots of all
polynomials of degree \(d\) with integer coefficients ranging from
\(-n\) to \(n\).  Clearly \(C_{d,n}\) gets bigger as we make either
\(d\) or \(n\) bigger, and it becomes dense in the complex plane as
\(n\) approaches \(\infty\), as long as \( d \ge 1\).  We get all the
rational complex numbers if we fix \(d \ge 1\) and let \( n \to
\infty\), and we get all the algebraic complex numbers if let both
\(d, n \to \infty \).  Based on the above picture, there seem to be
lots of interesting conjectures to make about what it does as \(d \to
\infty\) for fixed \(n\).

</p><p>
Inspired by the pictures above, Sam Derbyshire decided to
to make a high resolution plot of some roots of polynomials.
After some experimentation, he decided that his favorite
were polynomials whose coefficients were all 1 or -1 (not 0).
He made a high-resolution plot by computing all the roots of
all polynomials of this sort having degree ≤ 24.  That&#39;s 
\( 2^{24} \) polynomials, and about \( 24 \times 2^{24} \)
roots — or about 400 million roots!  It took Mathematica
4 days to generate the coordinates of the roots, producing
about 5 gigabytes of data.  He then used some Java programs to
create this amazing image:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png">
<img src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

The coloring shows the density of roots, from black to dark red to
yellow to white.  The picture above is a low-resolution version of the
original 90-megabyte file, which you can get 
<a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomial_roots.png">here</a>.  We can
zoom in to get more detail:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots_closeup.jpg">
<img width="600" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots_closeup.jpg"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

Note the holes at certain roots of unity and the feather-like patterns
as we move inside the unit circle.  To see these pattern, let&#39;s zoom in
to certain regions, marked here:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootscrops.png">
<img width="600" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootscrops.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

Here&#39;s a closeup of the hole at 1:  

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots1.png">
<img width="500" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots1.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

Note the white line along the
real axis.  That&#39;s because lots more of these polynomials have real roots
than <i>nearly</i> real roots.

</p><p>
Next, here&#39;s the hole at i:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootsi.png">
<img width="400" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootsi.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

And here&#39;s the hole at \( \exp(i \pi /4) = (1 + i)/\sqrt{2} \):

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootsexpi025p.png">
<img width="400" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootsexpi025p.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

Note how the density of roots increases as we get closer to
this point, but then suddenly drops off right next to it.  Note
also the subtle patterns in the density of roots.

</p><p>
But the feathery structures as move inside the unit circle are
even more beautiful!  Here is what they look near the real axis —
this plot is centered at the point 4/5:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png">
<img width="500" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

They have a very different character near the point \( (4/5)i\):

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08i.png">
<img width="600" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08i.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

But I think they&#39;re the most beautiful near the point \( (1/2)\exp(i/5)\).
This image is almost a metaphor of how, in our study of
mathematics, patterns emerge from confusion like sharply defined
figures looming from the mist:

</p><p><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png">
<img width="750" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"/>
</a>
</p>
<p>

The patterns I&#39;ve just showed you are tantalizing, and at first quite
mysterious... but Jesse C. McKeown and Greg Egan figured out how to
understand some of them during
the <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/12/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_46.html">discussion</a>
of &#34;week285&#34;.  The resulting story is quite beautiful!  But this
discussion was a bit hard to follow, since it involved smart people
figuring out things as they went along.  So, I doubt many people
understood it---at least compared to the number of people
who <i>could</i> understand it.

Let me just explain one pattern here.  Why does this region near \(
\frac{1}{2}e^{i/5}\):

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02_closeup.png"/></a>
</p>

<p>
look so much like the fractal called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon">dragon</a>?

</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/DragonCurve_animation.gif/400px-DragonCurve_animation.gif"/></a></p>

You can create a dragon in various ways.  In the animated image above, we&#39;re starting with a single horizontal straight line segment (which is not shown for some idiotic reason) and repeatedly doing the same thing.  Namely, at each step we&#39;re replacing every segment by two shorter segments at right angles to each other:

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/dragon_construction.jpg"/></a></p>

At each step, we have a continuous curve.  The dragon that appears in the limit of infinitely many steps is also a continuous curve.  But it&#39;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a>: it has nonzero area!

<p>
Here&#39;s another, more relevant way to create a dragon.  Take these two functions from the complex plane to itself:

</p><p>
$$  \displaystyle{ f_+ (x) = \frac{1+i}{2} x } $$

</p><p>
$$  \displaystyle{ f_- (x) = 1- \frac{1-i}{2} x }  $$

</p><p>
Pick a point in the plane and keep hitting it with either of these functions: you can randomly make up your mind which to use each time.  No matter what choices you make, you&#39;ll get a sequence of points that converges... and it converges to a point in the dragon!  We can get all points in the dragon this way.

</p><p>
But where did these two functions come from?  What&#39;s so special about them?

</p><p>
To get the specific dragon I just showed you, we need these specific
functions.  They have the effect of taking the horizontal line segment
from the point 0 to the point 1, and mapping it to the two segments
that form the simple picture shown at the far left here:

</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/dragon_construction.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>
As we repeatedly apply them, we get more and more segments, which form the ever more fancy curves in this sequence. 

</p><p>
But if all we want is <i>some</i> sort of interesting set of points in
the plane, we don&#39;t need to use these specific functions.  The most
important thing is that our functions be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping">
<b>contractions</b></a>,
meaning they reduce distances between points.  Suppose we have two
contractions \( f_+ \) and \( f_- \) from the plane to itself.  Then
there is a unique closed and bounded set \(D\) in the plane with

</p><p>
$$  D = f_+(D) \cup f_-(D)  $$

</p><p>
Moreover, suppose we start with some point \(x\) in the plane and keep
hitting it with \(f_+\) and/or \(f_-\), in any way we like.  Then we&#39;ll
get a sequence that converges to a point in \(S\). And even better,
every point in \(S\) show up as a limit of a sequence like this.  We
can even get them all starting from the same \(x\). All this follows
from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system#Definition">famous
theorem</a> due to John Hutchinson.

</p><p>
&#34;Cute,&#34; you&#39;re thinking.  &#34;But what does this have to do with roots of polynomials whose coefficients are all 1 or -1?&#34;

</p><p>
Well, we can get polynomials of this type by starting with the number
0 and repeatedly applying these two functions, which depend on a
parameter \(z\):

</p><p>
$$  f_+(x) = 1 + z x  $$

</p><p>
$$  f_-(x) = 1 - z x  $$

</p><p>
For example:

</p><p>
$$  f_+(0) = 1  $$

</p><p>
$$  f_+(f_+(0)) = 1 + z  $$
 
</p><p>
$$  f_-(f_+(f_+(0))) = 1 - z(1 + z) = 1 - z - z^2  $$

</p><p>
$$  f_+(f_-(f_+(f_+(0)))) = 1 + z(1 - z - z^2) = 1 - z - z^2 + z^3  $$

</p><p>
and so on.  All these polynomials have constant term 1, never -1.  But
apart from that, we can get <i>all</i> polynomials with coefficients 1
or -1 using this trick.  So, we get them all up to an overall
sign — and that&#39;s good enough for studying their roots.

</p><p>
Now, depending on what \(z\) is, the functions \( f_+ \) and \( f_- \)
will give us different generalized dragon sets.  We need \( |z| \lt 1 \)
for these functions to be contraction mappings.  Given that, we get a
generalized dragon set in the way I explained.  Let&#39;s call it \(D_z\)
to indicate that it depends on \(z\).

</p><p>
Greg Egan drew some of these sets \(D_z\).  Here&#39;s one that looks like
a dragon:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia1.gif"/></p>

<p>
Here&#39;s one that looks more like a feather:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia2.gif"/></p>

Now here&#39;s the devastatingly cool fact: 

<p><i><b>Near the point z in the complex plane, the set Sam Derbyshire drew looks like the generalized dragon set D<sub>z</sub> .</b></i>
</p>

<p>
The words &#39;looks like&#39; are weasel words, because I don&#39;t know the precise theorem.  If you look at Sam&#39;s picture again:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"/></a></p>

<p>
you&#39;ll see a lot of &#39;haze&#39; near the unit circle, which is where \( f_+
\) and \( f_- \) cease to be contraction mappings.  Outside the unit
circle — well, I don&#39;t want to talk about that now!  But inside
the unit circle, you should be able to see that I&#39;m at least roughly
right.  For example, if we zoom in near \( z = 0.372 - .542 i\), we get
dragons:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05exp-i02_closeup.png"/></a>
</p>

<p>
which look at least roughly like this:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia1.gif"/></p>

<p>
In fact they should look <i>very much</i> like this, but I&#39;m too lazy
to find the point \(z = 0.372 - .542 i\) and zoom in very closely to
that point in Sam&#39;s picture, to check!

</p><p>
Similarly, near the point \(0.8 + 0.2 i\), we get feathers:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08+02i.png"/></a></p>

<p>
that look a lot like this:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia2.gif"/></p>

<p>
Again, it would be more convincing if I could exactly locate the point
\(0.8 + 0.2 i\) and zoom in there.  

</p><p>
There are lots of questions left to answer, like &#34;What about all the
black regions in the middle of Sam&#39;s picture?&#34; and &#34;what about those
funny-looking holes near the unit circle?&#34;  But the most urgent
question is this:

</p><p>
<i><b>If you take the set Sam Derbyshire drew and zoom in near  the point z, why should it look like the generalized dragon set D<sub>z</sub>?</b></i>

</p><p>
And the answer was discovered by &#39;some guy on the street&#39; — our
pseudonymous, nearly anonymous friend.  It&#39;s related to something
called
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Relationship_with_Julia_sets">Julia–Mandelbrot
correspondence</a>.  I wish I could explain it clearly, but I don&#39;t
understand it well enough to do a really convincing job.  So, I&#39;ll
just muddle through by
copying <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/12/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_46.html">Greg
Egan&#39;s explanation</a>.

</p><p>
First, let&#39;s define a <b>Littlewood polynomial</b> to be one whose coefficients are all 1 or -1.  

</p><p>
We have already seen that if we take any number \( z\), then we get the image of \(z\) under all the Littlewood polynomials of degree \(n\) by starting with the point \( x = 0\) and applying these functions over and over:

$$  f_+(x) = 1 + z x $$

$$  f_-(x) = 1 - z x $$

a total of \( n+1 \) times.

</p><p>
Moreover, we have seen that as we keep applying these functions over
and over to \( x = 0\), we get sequences that converge to points in the
generalized dragon set \(D_z\).

</p><p>
So, \(D_z\) is the set of limits of sequences that we get by taking the number \(z\) and applying Littlewood polynomials of larger and larger degree.

</p><p>
Now, suppose 0 is in \(D_z\).  Then there are Littlewood polynomials
of large degree applied to \( z \) that come very close to 0.  We get
a picture like this:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif"/></p>

<p>
where the arrows represent different Littlewood polynomials being
applied to \( z\).  If we zoom in close enough that a linear
approximation is good, we can see what the <i>inverse image</i> of 0
will look like under these polynomials:

</p><p><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic2.gif"/></p>

<p>
It will look the same!  But these inverse images are just the roots of
the Littlewood polynomials.  So the roots of the Littlewood
polynomials near \( z \) will look like the generalized dragon set \(
D_z\).

</p><p>
As Egan put it:

</p><blockquote>
But if we grab all these arrows:

<p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif"/></p>

<p>
and squeeze their tips together so that they all map precisely to 0 — and if we&#39;re working in a small enough neighbourhood of 0 that the arrows don&#39;t really change much as we move them — the pattern that imposes on the tails of the arrows will look a lot like the original pattern:

</p><p><img width="300" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif"/></p>

</blockquote>

<p>
There&#39;s a lot more to say, but I think I&#39;ll stop soon.  I just want to
emphasize that all this is modeled after the incredibly
cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Relationship_with_Julia_sets">relationship
between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets</a>.  It goes like this;

</p><p>
Consider this function, which depends on a complex parameter \( z\):

$$ f(x) = x^2 + z $$

</p><p>
If we fix \( z\), this function defines a map from the complex plane
to itself.  We can start with any number \(x\) and keep applying this
map over and over.  We get a sequence of numbers.  Sometimes this
sequence shoots off to infinity and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  The
boundary of the set where it doesn&#39;t is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a></b> for
this number \( z\).

</p><p>
On the other hand, we can start with \( x = 0\), and draw the set of
numbers \(z\) for which the resulting sequence doesn&#39;t shoot off to
infinity.  That&#39;s called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot
set</a></b>.

</p><p>
Here&#39;s the cool relationship: in the vicinity of the number \(z\), the
Mandelbrot set tends to look like the Julia set for that number \(z\).
This is especially true right at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.

</p><p>
For example, the Julia set for

$$  z = -0.743643887037151 + 0.131825904205330 i$$

looks like this:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/julia_-0.743643887037151+0.131825904205330i.jpg"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/julia_-0.743643887037151+0.131825904205330i.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>
while this:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mandelbrot_-0.743643887037151+0.131825904205330i.jpg"><img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mandelbrot_-0.743643887037151+0.131825904205330i.jpg"/></a>
</p>

<p>
is a tiny patch of the Mandelbrot set centered at the
same value of \(z\).  They&#39;re shockingly similar!

</p><p>
This is why the Mandelbrot set is so complicated.  Julia sets are
already very complicated.  But the Mandelbrot set looks like <i>a
lot</i> of Julia sets!  It&#39;s like a big picture of someone&#39;s face made of little pictures of different people&#39;s faces. 

</p><p>
Here&#39;s a great picture illustrating this fact.  As with all the
pictures here, you can click on it for a bigger view:

</p><p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/725_Julia_sets.png">
<img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/696px-725_Julia_sets.png"/></a></p>

<p>
But this one you really <i>must</i> click on!
It&#39;s a big picture made of lots of little pictures of Julia sets for
various values of \(z\)...  but it mimics the Mandelbrot set.  You&#39;ll
notice that the Mandelbrot set is the set of numbers \(z\) whose Julia
sets are connected.  Those Julia sets are the black blobs.  When \(z\)
leaves the Mandelbrot set, its Julia set falls apart into dust: that&#39;s
the white stuff.

</p><p>
For an even better view of this phenomenon, try this:

</p><ul>
<li> David Joyce, Mandelbrot and Julia set explorer, 
<a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/explorer.html">http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/explorer.html</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can zoom into the Mandelbrot set and see the corresponding Julia
set at various values of \(z\).  For example, here&#39;s the Julia set at
\(z = -0.689494949 - 0.462323232 i\):

</p><p><img src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/julia_-0.689494949-0.462323232i.gif"/>
</p>
<p>

and here&#39;s a tiny piece of Mandelbrot set near that point:

</p><p><img src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mandelbrot_-0.689494949-0.462323232i.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
So, the Mandelbrot set is like an illustrated catalog of Julia sets.
Similarly, it seems the set of roots of Littlewood polynomials (up to
a given degree) resembles a catalog of generalized dragon sets.
However, making this into a theorem would require me to make precise
many things I&#39;ve glossed over, and I don&#39;t know how yet.

My colleague Xiao-Song Lin plotted the zeros of the 
Jones polynomial for prime alternating knots with up to 
13 crossings, and you can see his pictures in the above paper.
You&#39;ll see that <em>some</em> of the patterns in his pictures
just come from the patterns in the Christensen sets... since
the Jones polynomial has integer coefficients. 

<p>
Odlyzko and Poonen proved some interesting things about the set of all
roots of all polynomials with coefficients 0 or 1.  If we define a
fancier Christensen set C<sub>d,p,q</sub> to be the set of roots of
all polynomials of degree d with coefficients ranging from \(p\) to
\(q\), Odlyzko and Poonen are studying \(C_{d,0,1}\) in the limit \(d \to
\infty\).  They mention some known results and prove some new ones:
this set is contained in the half-plane \(\mathrm{Re}(z) \lt 3/2\) and
contained in the annulus \(1/\Phi \lt |z| \lt \Phi\) where \(\Phi \) is the
golden ratio \( (\sqrt{5} + 1)/2\).  In fact they trap it, not just between
these circles, but between two subtler curves.  They also show that
the closure of this set is path connected but not simply connected.
