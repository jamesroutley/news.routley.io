    <h1>Bob Ross paintings to be auctioned to fund US public broadcasting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>Paintings by celebrated art tutor Bob Ross will be auctioned to help support public television stations that have faced funding cuts under the Trump administration.</p><p>About 30 of his artworks, which he mostly created on-air during his TV show, the Joy of Painting, in the 80s and 90s, will be auctioned by Bonhams from November.</p><p>Bob Ross Inc said the auction &#34;ensures Bob&#39;s legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades&#34;. </p><p>It comes after Congress passed <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1jwe7582o">Trump&#39;s request to strip public broadcast funding</a>, leaving some 330 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) stations scrambling for a new funding source. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ross&#39; show saw a resurgence during the Covid pandemic, as audiences enjoyed his soft-spoken, paint-along lessons. Misplaced brush strokes, the former Air Force drill sergeant would say, were just &#34;happy accidents&#34;. He died at the age of 52 in 1995. </p><p>Bob Ross Inc said it donated the paintings to American Public Television, and that all of the net proceeds go to local public TV stations nationwide.</p><p>This includes programmes such as America&#39;s Test Kitchen, Julia Child&#39;s French Chef Classics and This Old House, the Associated Press news agency reported. </p><p>In August, the auction of two of Ross&#39; works shattered records, having sold for double and triple what had been expected. </p><p>Lake Below Snow-Capped Peaks and Cloudy Sky sold for $114,800, while Lake Below Snow-Covered Mountains and Clear Sky sold for $95,750.</p><p>&#34;I can tell you that Bob would have been quite shy to learn that his paintings are now selling at six figures,&#34; Joan Kowalski, the president of Bob Ross Inc, <a target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/15/us-news/bob-ross-paintings-easily-surpass-estimated-sale-prices-at-auction-marking-milestone-for-the-late-artist/">told the New York Post</a> after the lots sold.  </p><p>&#34;He was never really that interested in his finished works, Bob was more fascinated with the process of painting and sharing that with other people.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Truthfully, I can still hear him saying something like, &#39;You don&#39;t want my paintings, you want to create your own and hang them proudly on your wall.&#39;&#34;</p></div></div>
