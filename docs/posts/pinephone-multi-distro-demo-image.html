    <h1>PinePhone multi-distro demo image</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Here you can find a multi-boot uSD card image containing 15 different Pinephone distributions. 
The purpose of this image is for users to <b>easily try current major (and some minor) Pinephone Linux distributions</b>,
without having to figure out how to flash them individually and juggle with many uSD cards.

</p><p>Key points:

</p><ul>
	<li>[Relatively] small 6.9GiB image containing 15 distributions:
	<ul>
		<li>Arch Linux ARM 2021-11-20
		</li><li>Arch Linux ARM / dreemurrs 20220124
		</li><li>Fedora 0.6.0
		</li><li>LuneOS 20220108
		</li><li>Maemo Leste 20220123
		</li><li>Manjaro / Phosh beta21
		</li><li>Manjaro / Plasma beta10
		</li><li>Mobian 20220116
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Desktop 2022-01-07
		</li><li>pmOS / GNOME 2022-01-07
		</li><li>pmOS / Plasma Mobile v21.12-20220119
		</li><li>pmOS / Phosh v21.12-20220119
		</li><li>Sailfish 20220112
		</li><li>pmOS / Sxmo v21.12-20220119
		</li><li>Ubuntu Touch 2022-01-20
		</li><li>jumpdrive 0.8
	</li></ul>

	</li><li>Runs my <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot">p-boot</a> bootloader and <a href="http://xff.cz/git/linux">my latest kernel</a> (5.16.2 with pinephone keyboard support)
	</li><li>Based on btrfs subvolumes and file level deduplication (if you mess up, you can easily revert each distribution to original state using pre-created btrfs snapshots)
	</li><li>All included distributions work on Braveheart and later Pinephone variants (incl. 3GiB variant), thanks to sharing my kernel and bootloader
	</li><li>My modem power management driver is used for safe and reliable handling of modem power, except on distributions that use the new eg25-manager program.
	</li><li>Suspend to RAM based on the latest crust is available to all distributions (whether they actually use it or not - most don&#39;t suspend frequently enough by themselves and just turn off the display)
	</li><li>The image is made to fit a 16GiB or larger uSD cards, and also works when flashed to eMMC
</li></ul>

<p>Some development history and technical details can be found on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/">my blog</a>.

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2022-01-26</h3>

<ul>
<li>All distros updated to the latest stable versions.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.16.2) that contains many stability fixes and power saving improvements.
</li><li>Pinephone keyboard should be usable in all distros.
</li><li>Supports <a href="https://megous.com/git/p-boot/plain/dist/p-boot-landscape.bin">lanscape mode p-boot build</a> (you&#39;ll have to patch the image yourself, though). Use <code>dd if=p-boot-landscape.bin of=multi.img bs=1024 seek=8 conv=notrunc</code> before flashing the image (or change of= to point to an already flashed SD card block device, to update the already flashed SD card).
</li><li>Sailfish had some trouble starting up in my quick test, and I didn&#39;t figure out why.
</li></ul>

<h3>2021-06-02</h3>

<ul>
<li>All distros updated to the latest stable versions.
</li><li>Package managers should be properly configured to safely upgrade the distributions or install new packages.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.13-rc4) that contains many stability fixes and power saving improvements.
</li></ul>

<h3>2020-11-23</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added more distros (Manjaro, Arch dreemurrs, Jumpdrive, pmOS / plasma desktop). Removed PureOS (doesn&#39;t seem to be maintained anymore).
</li><li>All distros updated to the latest versions.
</li><li>p-boot has more features, auto-repeat for volume keys, scrolling menu, reboot to eMMC OS, air-gapped boot mode, battery indicator.
</li><li>Newer kernel (5.10-rc5) with 60fps fix.
</li></ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>Most distributions don&#39;t need any changes to be well behaved denizens of the multi-boot image. Nevertheless, some files still needed to be overriden. You can see those in the project&#39;s GIT repository, bellow.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The image is distributed as a <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2022-01-26.torrent">torrent</a> due to its size.
Install some torrent software (suggestions: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>) and click the previous link to start the download.
Don&#39;t forget to let the torrent client run even after the download finishes so that other people can get the image too.
I only seed to the ratio of 10x at unlimited speed (1Gbit).

</p><p>The image is also available at: <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2022-01-26/">http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2022-01-26/</a> as a regular download.
 Download via HTTP is rate limited to 512 KiB/s. So if you want to get the image faster, use a torrent.

</p><p>There&#39;s also a mirror of the image by the discord user <b>uxes</b> at <a href="http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/">http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/</a>.

</p><h2>Pre-loaded microSD cards</h2>

<p>Consider <a href="https://bitcompact.com/products/pinephone-multiboot-chip">purchasing</a>
a preloaded microSD card if you don&#39;t have the time, skills, or microSD card to download the image to yourself.
This plug and play solution includes everything you need to get up and running immediately.

</p><p>This is a third-party service provided by <a href="https://bitcompact.com/products/pinephone-multiboot-chip">bitcompact.com</a>.

</p><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation is performed by decompressing image data (compressed using zstd) directly to the SD card&#39;s whole block device. For example you can use <code>zstd -d multi.img.zst ; sudo dd if=multi.img of=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=4M oflag=direct status=progress</code> (if you know how to identify your SD card&#39;s block device).

</p><p>Verify the image was written correctly immediately after flashing by running <code>dd if=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M count=10000 | sha256sum</code>.
SHA256 sum must be <code>39915b9d2aa2f33fd78552ac9a0e665c4aef97dd68a9f9a6c76f9fa2f0ac049e</code>.
If your OS auto-mounts new filesystems, make sure it does not do it for the SD card image, otherwise the hash may change, and this verification method will be unreliable.

</p><p>You must stretch the OS partition to fit your entire uSD card (do NOT use gparted, it will just break the image silently), otherwise the free space inside the filesystem will be limited to about 0.5 GiB, which will cause distros to fail after a few boots.
If you run out of space, all included distributions may become unstable. Distributions are configured to be updateable using a package manager (only kernel and u-boot updates are blocked).

</p><p>Partition stretching instructions are on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/#toc-resizing-the-partition-after-flashing-the-image">this page</a> and in the README file distributed with the image.

</p><p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_Installation_Instructions">Here</a> you can find generic instructions on how to work with uSD cards on Pinephone.</p>

<h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>All passwords were changed to 1111. Root passwords are 1111. sxmo login/password is user/1111. Manjaro seems to insist on 123456.

</p><h2>Managing the multi-boot image</h2>

<p>You can use the multi-boot image as a starting point for your own multi-boot pinephone system.

</p><p>How you can manage the boot menu items, update kernels, and add/remove distributions is described in <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/#046">this blog post</a>.

</p><h2>Support the project</h2>

<p>p-boot demo image generator is free and opensource software released under GPLv3.
It is an independent personal project not backed by any comapny or commercial interests.
You can contribute by writing code, helping improve documentation, spreading the word, and/or <a href="https://xnux.eu/contribute.html">by donating</a>.
I may receive some proceeds from microSD card sales by bitcompact.

<p>Project status: p-boot-demo is maintained and actively developed by the original author.
