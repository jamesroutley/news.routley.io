    <h1>Building a Go Link Toy with Deno</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><time datetime="2025-07-13">July 13th, 2025</time> • ~800 words • 3 minute read</p></header><p><img src="https://georgemandis.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/go-links-window.png" alt="Screenshot of my Go Links Web Manager tool"/></p><p>For some reason I&#39;ve been thinking about <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Go_links">go links</a>, which are really just a fancy word for link shorteners. They&#39;re useful at larger companies for providing static, easy-to-remember URLs that can take employees directly to pages for benefits explanations, requesting time-off, internal documentation and all sorts of things.</p><p>Some companies go the extra mile and make these links available on aesthetically pleasing URLs that only work when you&#39;re plugged into the corporate network. Something like:</p><ul><li><a href="http://go/payroll">http://go/payroll</a></li><li><a href="http://go/holidays">http://go/holidays</a></li><li><a href="http://go/metrics">http://go/metrics</a></li><li><a href="http://go/evilmoonbaseplans">http://go/evilmoonbaseplans</a></li></ul><p>If you work at a company utilizing go links, there&#39;s a chance these links might even work for you! If that last link works, you might want to consider finding a new job.</p><h2>Projects &gt; Solutions</h2><p>I wanted a simple personal go link system I could run on my machine, mostly for fun. I decided I wanted to make my own go link implementation just for me, local only to my network and perhaps even just my particular machine.</p><p>You might be thinking <em>&#34;Why not just bookmark the links in your browser?&#34;</em> to which I would say <em>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m looking for a Sunday afternoon project, not a solution!&#34;</em></p><p>Other requirements:</p><ul><li><strong><code>go/whatever</code></strong> URLs, because they feel fancy</li><li>A cute little web-interface I can navigate to for managing the URLs, shortcodes</li><li>A CLI-driven component to the tool so I could manage and even access the links from the shell by invoking <code>golinks [shortcode]</code></li><li>Some basic stat tracking every time I use one of these, just because</li></ul><p>If you want to cut to the chase and play with the toy I built, check out the repo:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/georgemandis/golinks">github.com/georgemandis/golinks</a></li></ul><p>I also used this as an opportunity to continue exploring <a href="https://deno.com">Deno</a>. I&#39;ve been intrigued with it ever since it came on the scene, and I&#39;ve found it particularly nice for building little one-off CLI toys.</p><p>Another fun aspect is you can run the following and install my <code>golinks</code> tool globally:</p><pre><code>deno install --global --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run jsr:@georgemandis/golinks
</code></pre><p>I <a href="https://jsr.io/@georgemandis/golinks">published the package</a> on JSR just to get a feel for what&#39;s going on over there. Might save that for a different blog post.</p><h2>Fancy URLs</h2><p>Half the fun is having those fancy TLD-less URLs. I elaborate a little bit in the README for the repo, but it boils down to adding additional aliases for the loopback address (i.e. <code>localhost</code>) on your machine.</p><p>To do that in Unix and MacOS environments all you have to do is add a row to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:</p><pre><code>echo &#34;127.0.0.1 go&#34; | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
</code></pre><p>Note, <code>tee</code> command is just a nice way to write our input to a file and stdout at the same time. It’s not a command I use often, so I thought I’d explain it.</p><h2>Running the Server</h2><p>For me, I&#39;m happy to just run it in the background and forget about it:</p><pre><code>golinks --server &amp;
</code></pre><p>I always have my <a href="https://ghostty.org">terminal</a> open, so this very lazy solution is Good Enough™ for me. The <code>&amp;</code> runs it as a background process and if I want to stop it I can <code>ps -e | grep &#34;golink&#34;</code> it, find the PID and <code>kill -9</code> it.</p><p>But a few more fun options are available if you want to be less lazy:</p><ul><li><strong>Set it up as a proper service at launch</strong>. I actually went down this route, implemented it and decided I <em>didn&#39;t</em> want to commit. Maybe it&#39;s irrational, but I like keeping my at-launch processes as clean and minimal as possible.</li><li><strong>Run it on a second computer on my network.</strong> This is actually my favorite approach, conceptually, and combined with <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> it&#39;s surprisingly powerful. I have my &#34;under the bed&#34; computer that handles some home automation and other projects. I can run <code>golinks</code> on this machine and map the Tailscale IP address to <code>http://go</code> in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. Neat!</li></ul><h2>Future Considerations</h2><p>Like any good project, this one has plenty of rabbit holes to fall into. Here are some other ways I could continue to invest in the project:</p><ul><li>I&#39;m really bothered by the &#34;insecure&#34; nature of these links. Getting SSL certificates working for local URLs was a pain last I checked, and <em>many</em> years ago I had a script to automate this. I&#39;m pretty sure no longer works.</li><li>When in doubt, add AI. I actually added the &#34;description&#34; field with this somewhat in mind. It wouldn&#39;t take very much to open up the list of shortened links to an LLM and start querying over it.</li></ul><p>I don&#39;t foresee myself investing more time in this unless I really find it useful or people start contributing to/forking/using it, but it was a fun Sunday afternoon project.</p>--<p><em>Published on Sunday, July 13th 2025.
