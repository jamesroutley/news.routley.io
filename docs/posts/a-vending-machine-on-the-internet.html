    <h1>A vending machine, on the internet</h1>

            <p>These days, every new business seems to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a>. I remember when software worked differently: you bought it, installed it, and used it without having to create an account, remember a password, or even connect to the internet. Your data lived on your C drive, and you were in control. Software was a tool, like a hammer or a chair. Buy a chair, and you could sit on it for life. No monthly fees required.</p>
<p>For anyone diving into product creation online, SaaS may seem like the obvious route. And while I totally understand its appeal, I’m not interested in building yet another SaaS. I want to do something different, something fun… I want to build a vending machine.</p>
<h2 id="alien-stickers">Alien Stickers</h2>
<p>The other day, I was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion">Food Lion</a> and spotted a vending machine selling reflective alien stickers for 50 cents. I am precisely the target market for this kind of thing. So, I dug into my car, found two quarters, and fed them into the machine. Out came a shiny, reflective USA flag alien sticker. More or less, exactly what I expected. And for 50 cents, what more could I ask for?</p>

</figure><p>Next time I went to Food Lion, I visited the alien sticker machine again. This time, I put in two quarters, and nothing happened. The machine was jammed. It wasn’t a big deal. I shrugged and moved on to buy my groceries. A month later, I checked back, and the alien stickers were gone, replaced by flashy gold keychains.</p>
<p>There’s a dude out there who owns this machine. He swings by, dumps out the quarters, reloads the goods, and moves on. He doesn’t onboard customers. He doesn’t provide 24/7 chat support. If I walk away because the machine was jammed? This bro ain’t losing sleep over it. He’s drinking free beer with his buddies, all thanks to that sack full of quarters.</p>
<p>That’s the energy I want.</p>
<p>My alien sticker vending machine abduction (and experience building SaaS software) has helped solidify the mental model for how I want <a href="https://threekindwords.com">ThreeKindWords.com</a> to work. I wouldn’t say the alien sticker vending machine inspired Three Kind Words, but it definitely helped me frame how I want it to work.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-internet-based-vending-machine">What Makes a Internet-based Vending Machine?</h2>
<p>Let’s break this down. What makes a vending machine a vending machine? And how do we apply that to something on the internet?</p>
<h4 id="simple">Simple</h4>
<p>No surprises, no bait-and-switch, no aspirational messaging, just a plain and simple offer. Coins in, product out. The UI should be as simple as it gets: a few form fields and a Stripe checkout, perhaps an email, then your’re done.</p>
<h4 id="transactional">Transactional</h4>
<p>This isn’t a subscription service; it’s a one-and-done kind of deal. A vending machine isn’t interested in knowing your life story. If it needs to remember you, it should do so with tokens and one-time links, not user accounts or forgotten-password flows, and never ever a “Sign in with Google” button.</p>
<h4 id="cheap">Cheap</h4>
<p>The stakes should be low. Whatever you’re selling, it’s gotta be cheap. And if things go awry? No one’s going to launch a chargeback crusade. Just like a reliable vending machine, if it jams, it’ll return your coins.</p>
<h4 id="autonomous">Autonomous</h4>
<p>Vending machines are entirely self-serve. There’s no customer support, chatbot, or extensive documentation. They do their job, they don’t bother you, and they don’t care if you linger or walk away.</p>
<h4 id="fun">Fun</h4>
<p>A vending machine isn’t trying to transform your life. It’s not a productivity tool or anything you should build critical infrastructure around. It’s a weird little box full of stuff that makes you smile for no reason.</p>
<h2 id="one-weird-trick">One Weird Trick</h2>
<p>Classifying <a href="https://threekindwords.com">ThreeKindWords.com</a> as an vending machine on the internet has been a huge mental unlock for me. It sets the tone for how I build it: no subscriptions, no accounts, no long-term user retention goals. Just a simple machine that does its job and doesn’t ask for more.</p>
<p>Other people can chase unicorns. I’ll take the sack full of quarters!</p>
