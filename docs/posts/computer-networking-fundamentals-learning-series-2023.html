This colorful series walks you through the networking basics in just a few thousand words! It also offers hands-on labs to practice the obtained knowledge. I wish I had such a condensed resource at my disposal during my university days.</p>

The domain is pretty broad, and the terminology can get quite confusing quickly. This article is my layman&#39;s attempt to sort the basic things out with the minimum words and maximum drawings. The primary focus will be on the Data link layer (OSI L2) of wired networks where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> is the king nowadays. But I&#39;ll slightly touch upon its neighboring layers too.</p>

There are hundreds or even thousands of articles on the topic out there, including introductory ones. I&#39;m not going to put either formal <del><em>and boring</em></del> <a href="https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html">definitions</a> here nor <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands">long lists</a> of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-list-and-delete-iptables-firewall-rules">useful commands</a>. I would rather try to use layman&#39;s terms and scribbling as much as possible to give you some insights about the domain before going to all these <em>tables</em>, <em>rules</em>, <em>targets</em>, and <em>policies</em>. By the way, the first time I faced this tool I was pretty much confused by the terminology too!</p>

It may very well be that learning a couple of SSH tricks is more profitable in the long run than mastering a dozen Cloud Native tools destined to become deprecated next quarter.</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of this technology is SSH Tunnels. With nothing but standard tools and often using just a single command, you can achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access internal VPC endpoints through a public-facing EC2 instance.</li>
<li>Open a port from the localhost of a development VM in the host&#39;s browser.</li>
<li>Expose any local server from a home/private network to the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<p>And more üòç</p>
<p>But despite the fact that I use SSH Tunnels daily, it always takes me a while to figure out the right command. Should it be a Local or a Remote tunnel? What are the flags? Is it a <em>local_port:remote_port</em> or the other way around? So, I decided to finally wrap my head around it, and it resulted in a series of labs and a visual cheat sheet üôà</p>

For a while, I used to use the words <strong><em>&#34;bridge&#34;</em></strong> and <strong><em>&#34;switch&#34;</em></strong> interchangeably. But after getting more into networking, I started noticing that some people tend to see them as rather different devices... So, maybe I&#39;ve been totally wrong? Maybe saying <em>&#34;bridge aka switch&#34;</em> is way too inaccurate?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try to figure it out!</p>

Such nodes should be able to communicate using their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">L2 addresses (MAC)</a> or by broadcasting frames. A broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network. Multiple physical (L1) segments can be bridged to form a single broadcast domain. Multiple L2 segments can also be bridged to create a bigger broadcast domain.</p>

However, technically it&#39;s possible to configure multiple IP subnets over a single L2 broadcast domain. And although more complicated, configuring a single IP subnet over multiple disjoint L2 segments is also doable. In this lab, we&#39;ll cover the first two scenarios while the more advanced third case deserves its own lab - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/networking-lab-proxy-arp/">Proxy ARP</a>.</p>
