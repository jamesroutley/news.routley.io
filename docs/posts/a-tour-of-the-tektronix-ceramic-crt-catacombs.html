    <h1>A Tour of the Tektronix Ceramic CRT &#34;Catacombs&#34;</h1>

        <p>Tektronix personnel were in the crawl space below building 13, the home of the museum and the former home of the Ceramics Operation, for some routine maintenance in 2021. They discovered a storage area filled with CRT funnel molds. This must have been used as storage for Ceramics and then long forgotten. The tooling for the ceramic funnel consists of an inner mold machined from 7075-T6 aluminum, and a flexible outer mold made from cast polyurethane.</p>
<p>We posted a <a href="https://vintagetek.org/15109-2/">news page</a> with some photos and in 2023 some volunteers again revisited the underground and took a video of their visit. They nicknamed it the &#34;catacombs&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Catacomb&#34; is a burial place, and the space under Tektronix Building 13 where the skeletons of ceramic CRT molds reside is deserving of the name. Tektronix began development of their own CRT&#39;s in 1951, and starting molding ceramic CRT &#34;bottles&#34; in 1961. Since CRT production ceased in 1996, the molds have resided under Building 13, the present site of the vintageTEK Museum.</p>
