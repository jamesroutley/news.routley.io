<p>Aside from the science fiction and epic poem aspects, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_literature" title="Postmodern literature">postmodern</a> playfulness of the plot itself is underlined by the Czech language Prologue (see part translation)<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek" title="Karel Čapek">Karel Čapek</a>&#39;s mystification style. Jan Křesadlo purports to have come into the whole process not as the author, but as a translator of the Greek original &#34;by an unknown author.&#34; We are to believe this is a real travelogue, whose alleged author is a space-time travelling Captain Oudeis / Nemo, (as confirmed by &#34;copyright Nemo&#34; for the Greek text edition.) Oudeis&#39; travelogue was dictated to his universal translator Franta (which is a creature resembling a skunk, but made entirely of brain tissue.) Franta, who lacked common sense, thought it wise to write it all down in Homeric Greek, so as to make it more famous. At least, that is the claim made to Křesadlo by the &#39;archivist Divíšek&#39; (a reference to Čapek&#39;s character of the same name) who brings the Greek text to Křesadlo for translation. (Albeit Křesadlo supposes that Divíšek wrote it himself.)

<p>Oudeis and his companions land on a planet and he sends out two men, who find a city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian" title="Lesbian">Lesbians</a>. They torture the scouts to death and, discovering the spaceship, melodiously sing to the Oudeis&#39; crew to lure them outside. They lead them to their city as prisoners to cage them. Two more men are tortured and night falls. The next day a crowd takes out another two, but a violent revolution breaks out amongst the women; one approaches the Queen and, pulling out a penis, rapes her. The other rebel women follow suit. They release Oudeis and his men, and the Queen asks who they are: Oudeis explains their mission and thanks the women for saving them - the Queen tells Oudeis to return the following evening for a banquet where their story will be explained. Sleeping in their ship, Oudeis and his companions return, and the Queen, Tethis, explains that they were tasked to destroy the Lesbians. They lived in secret amongst them and raised a generation of men to use in rebellion - they rejoice now to have succeeded and won their freedom. Oudeis and his men finish the feast and fly into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and his companions land on a planet and are met by creatures with human bodies but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a> heads, and who invite them to their city. It is poorly built, and they provide disgusting food and drink. One of the priests addresses their fellows, announcing that they must consult their Great Light (their sun), a speech Franta secretly translates. The Bearers of Beaks bring them to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics" title="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> computer, where the priest declares they must kill Oudeis and his men because they are ungodly; they begin an attack, and Oudeis and crew try to defend themselves but becomes overwhelmed. A flock of winged creatures resembling the Beaked Ones flies down and saves the men, carrying them to their own city. Their king explains that the hydraulic device was designed to govern their lives, but, blocked with seaweed, it broke, demanding them do evil and split their society in two. Asked to make repairs, Oudeis sends his technician Burda, who does so. Oudeis and crew board the spaceship and fly into the cosmos.

They meet the king, Rx-Phrx-Prx, who gladly receives and sends them to bathe. Once Oudeis and his men have entered the pools, two doctors arrive and speak with Oudeis through Franta, saying Rx-Phrx-Prx sent them to check on their health. The men exit the pool to be examined; Franta secretly translates the doctors, who excitedly admire their physique. They tell the men to dress, who unnervingly discover their phasers are gone.

The next morning two judges arrive and through Franta tell Oudeis he will be tried for his life in two hours. They leave, but using Franta&#39;s bioradiophone Oudeis orders the ship computer Caesar to dispatch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop" title="RoboCop">Robocop</a> Ivo in two hours.

If they find peace, the men will be exterminated - a dog prophet, Au-Bau-Gau, is mediating one, and the king asks Oudeis to kill him. Oudeis sends Ivo.

Life flourishes there, including a race of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly" title="Butterfly">butterflies</a>. They ask Oudeis why he has come, and he explains his mission. The butterflies tell him, should he help them first, they will help him track Mandys: they ask Oudeis to keep back the Grogals who attack the butterflies from the dark side of the world. Oudeis and crew meet the Grogals, who resemble the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_Sheepdog" title="Old English Sheepdog">dog of Dulux commercials</a>, but are bipedal and carry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear" title="Spear">spears</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow" title="Bow and arrow">bows</a>.

Refusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_food" title="Dog food">dog food</a>, Oudeis sleeps. Once they are washed the next day, a woman takes them to the Queen, who picks Oudeis while her companion takes Franta. The Queen, treating Oudeis like a dog, calls for and whips him; Oudeis takes the whip and spanks the Queen, which she enjoys, and they have sex. Afterwards, Oudeis indicates for Franta, who the Queen summons. She explains that long ago the women were split between the Lesbians and men-lovers, and by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition" title="Sortition">lot</a> the Lesbians left the planet; a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome" title="Y chromosome">Y chromosome</a> mutation made the men degenerate into dogs, but the women keep them as bedfellows. She begs Oudeis stay to bear intelligent children. They have sex again, and Oudeis wakes to find his companions around him (summoned by Franta) and the three scouts discovered in stables. Oudeis and his men leave their sperm; they board the ship and fly into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and his companions arrive on a planet of the Macropodes who shepherd flocks of sheep. They offer the men fermented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_milk" title="Sheep milk">sheep&#39;s milk</a>, explaining they believe in the cosmos-observer, and recently had a human, matching Mandys&#39; description, come and leave a sheep. Oudeis and crew stay on the planet and wait for Mandys, announced by the noise of his spaceship. Mandys disembarks, pulls down his trousers, and penetrates a sheep - he stole the cosmos-observer away not to destroy it, Oudeis realises, but he loves it. The men seize and chain him in a cave, celebrating with the fermented milk, and fall asleep. They are woken by Mandys&#39; ship leaving: the Macropodes released him. The crew boards Tolma and chase Mandys in the cosmos for nine days, and on the tenth, passing by a planet, are intercepted by the locals and forced to land.

<p>Oudeis and his companions are led in chains to a city whose king who asks who they are. Oudeis explains their mission and the sheep, saying they were about to capture Mandys. The king orders them freed and offers his help, summoning a feast. Once they are all drunk, the King bids the servants to bring in some objects resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_(skin)" title="Hide (skin)">animal skins</a>: they are inflated into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_doll" title="Sex doll">blow-up dolls</a> that resemble women, with which locals and humans alike have sex and fall asleep. Oudeis stirs the next day and finds the King already awake. Through Franta he asks the king why there are no women on the planet. The king explains that a ship landed on their world carrying Lesbian women who the men, when they realised their intentions, killed; a fear of their own women developed, who degenerated to the point of speechlessness and were wiped out in a plague, so the men built the dolls as substitute. Oudeis tells the king about the Tailed Women, that he believes he knew where the Lesbians came from, and the remaining Tailed Women would be happy to unite with their men. The king rejoices, ordering preparations be made. Oudeis and men aboard Tolma lead a fleet to the planet of the Tailed Women, and, landing, approach their city.

<p>The army approaches the city and the women fire: the robots, including Ivo, march forward and begin to disintegrate them, but are badly damaged. The city walls are destroyed, and the men enter. The women throw down their arms and strip off their clothes - the men move forward to have sex with them. Oudeis finds the Queen who is already with the King and he accosts him; the King unintelligibly retorts and they square off until the Queen signals she desires them both. Everyone sleeps together. Women riding on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragons</a> fly in and carry everyone off, naked and unarmed, to the mountain city. The women are led off while the men cast in a pit, where they are kept for a month until a ladder is let down. Ten are taken, including Oudeis, and lead to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre" title="Amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a>. Underground, the men are cleaned, armed, and brought into the stadium. Women sit in the stalls and watch as ten Fake-Dogs enter, larger and tusked. Oudeis battles with one and is about to be killed when Tolma flies down and disintegrates it. Franta through a megaphone demands the queen, four others, and the men board. Franta explains it had the ship computer Caesar send Tonda to repair Ivo. They interrogate the Queen, who explains she left their former city for the mountains and bred their Fake-Dogs to be aggressive for sport, which they decided to set on the men for entertainment. The Queen and four others are exchanged for the captured women and men. They marry in a ceremony. Oudeis asks the king for the help he promised, and is refused because he has a wife and Oudeis slept with her. Oudeis insults the king and says he will seek glory. He and his men board the ship and fly into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and his men land on a planet of the Tripodes who rule four-footed grazers; their blood the Tripodes drink for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">everlasting life</a>, offering some, but upon being refused attack the crew. They flee into the cosmos and come to a cold planet where creatures live, the more eyes the nobler; it is too cold for a sheep, so they leave. The ship lands on a barren planet populated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghosts</a>, blessed because they lack need, and inviting the tempted men to join them, but the robots force them back onto the ship. They land on a planet where goat-like creatures live: the males are intelligent but the females tame and milked by the males; finding no sheep, the crew leaves the planet. They land on another whose air is toxic and see a lone man walking it in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit" title="Space suit">space-suit</a>, who Oudeis approaches, and Franta, finding the right language, asks to board their ship and what happened to his world. The stranger explains his planet once had a system in which everything was communal but the commanders possessed private property and the people suffered; a revolution brought democracy, and everything was privatised to the point air, polluted by industry, was commodified and all his race was destroyed but him. He returns to his planet, awing the crew.
</p><p>Oudeis and his men land on a planet populated by three-eyed Tetrapods. They reveal their holy idol, given by the gods; whoever understands it shall be blessed, but whoever cannot must be killed, so none of their race examine it - Oudeis and his men are heaven-sent gods and can study it. They see nothing, but Burda discovers the central eye of the aliens is blind, so has the robot Tonda study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram" title="Autostereogram">the image</a> with three eyes, and discerns an eagle flying over a village, fish in claw. Oudeis orders Tonda build the same image visible to two eyes, and the creatures rejoice. The crew arrives on another planet covered in fat, long strong poles pushing through, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse" title="Louse">lice</a> the size of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal" title="Foal">foals</a> pepper the surface, one of which a crewmate blasts and out the hole spurts blood. They realise the planet is one great creature and flee in fear. The men land on a planet covered in terrifying monsters. One addresses Oudeis in his own language, saying he was the monster that lived in Oudeis&#39; bedroom when he was a child. Oudeis asks how he can exist, saying he must be a vision. The monster, enraged, tells him sleeping and waking are the same thing and stalks off; the others join him. The men board the ship and fly into the cosmos.

<p>Now that the crew have been travelling for five years, Oudeis calls a council to say they can either return to Earth and be imprisoned, leaving the cosmos in threat, or aimlessly continue as they are. He suggests instead they return to the Grogal prophet and ask him to explain his prophecy. Kypta calls Oudeis a fool and argues for sailing to the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">Utopia</a>. Oudeis explains how the etymology of Utopia proves the planet does not exist and the crewmates laugh at Kypta. Oudeis nevertheless agrees the crew need a break and suggests journeying to a nearby planet to relax before chasing after the prophet, which the crew agrees to. They arrive on a natural, idyllic planet, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph" title="Nymph">nymphs</a> rise out of the sea with whom they have sex. They relax on the planet for a while, until one day thunder sounds and Oudeis sees a small skiff of Tolma flying away. He calls his companions and they board, discovering Kypta has stolen the treasure given in Book 6. They chase Kypta for nine days, finding him on the tenth. He drives past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" title="Pulsar">pulsars</a>, whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave" title="Radio wave">radiowaves</a> interfere with Tolma&#39;s sensors. A ship robot calculates a path around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> but Oudeis sails through and, to stop the ship exploding, opens an auxiliary jet, casting them deep into the cosmos. Kypta is caught by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> of the pulsar and crushed. The crew bewails the loss of their loot.

Oudeis and four men explore and find a city of men smaller than humans; they return, and Oudeis, Franta, and Ivo head out. Oudeis asks a man he finds why he weeps; he explains the king&#39;s daughter will be sacrificed to the monster Gr-gr-gros and leads them to the palace. They find the king lamenting his daughter, and Oudeis tells him he can kill the monster. The king does not believe him, and outlines a race of pygmy men and the phlegms they made that can turn into any shape and choke men, and how they made Gr-rg-ros (whose spelling is inconstant). Oudeis obliterates a bird with his phaser: the king rejoices, calling his daughter, and Oudeis repeats himself. The men return to the ship. The following morning Oudeis and crew, including Ivo and Franta, go to a forum where the girl is bound. The priests lament but call it necessary for the seasons to pass, to Oudeis&#39; utmost disgust. The temple doors open and Grg-rg-gros is released - Oudeis kills it with a phaser. The priest cries that the city is doomed; Oudeis calls him a liar; he says the pygmies will make a new monster so the priests can rule the city. Oudeis annihilates him, and in the tussle the crew are overwhelmed and flee. The men laugh at Oudeis for trying to save the girl; they board the spaceship and flee into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis is woken by Franta who tells him the robots have revolted and steering to the planet Rebellion. Franta prevented the other robots killing Oudeis: the other men are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a>, and Oudeis must act like a robot on Rebellion. They arrive, and Franta tells Oudeis it and the ship computer Caesar love each other but Franta has no genitals and Caesar no body. Franta will sell its linguistic talent to pay for Melis (its name for Caesar) to be embodied. One day Franta has Tonda upload the computer into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage" title="Disk storage">disk</a> and takes it away; later he returns with canine genitals. Franta sees Melis approaching, but is horrified to see <i>male</i> genitals. Melis calls Franta a fool and says he was always male; Franta tells him he does not love men, and Melis, heartbroken, destroys himself with a phaser. Oudeis asks Franta to return to the disk but Franta wants to try sex with the local creatures on Rebellion. Oudeis finds some robot-hunters and has them catch Franta, who falls into a trap and calls Caesar to summon Ivo. On his return, Franta orders Caesar to wake Burda, who fixes Franta&#39;s leg and, upon Franta&#39;s request, removes the genitals. Franta convinces Caesar to give up its memory drive, the companions are woken from suspended animation, and the ship sails into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and the companions sail in the cosmos when they come upon a ship that speaks to them in English and says one of their sailors are sick, begging them send one. Oudeis sends the doctor Elephas in a space suit with Franta; the ship, having received them, speeds off, and Franta sends an SOS. Oudeis chases on them and fires despite the rogue vessel threatening to kill Elephas and Franta if he continues. The robbers cover their ship in an electromagnetic cloak, making them invisible, so Oudeis flies by, and they retreat to an asteroid to repair the damage. Large birds living on its surface attack it and pierce the vessel, exposing the robbers to the vacuum, killing them, and destroying the cloak. Franta signals Oudeis, who arrives to save them. Oudeis takes the electromagnetic cloak and sails into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and his companions arrive on the moon they visited in Book 8 and find a temple on the site of the Grogal prophet besides to a city of aliens that enslave the Grogals but worship the prophet. They enter the temple whose guards are made of energy - they absorb the raybeams, so Burda inverts his phaser and drinks them in. The men find the prophet, discovering from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_plaque" title="Commemorative plaque">plaque</a> his name is Onuphrios (Oudeis explains who the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onuphrius" title="Onuphrius">Onuphrios</a> of our own world is), and trip an alarm.

<p>Oudeis, Burda, Elephas, and Franta take Onuphrios out of their suspended animation, attach the electrodes, and shock him awake again. Oudeis beseeches him to explain his earlier prophecy about the dung, gold, and time-cutter. Because Oudeis saved him from the locals who enslaved his race, he agrees.
</p><p>There is an asteroid of pure gold, dense enough to support its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a> and populated by sheep whose dung coats the surface - Mandys lives there as a shepherd. He will flee into the past with the cosmos-observing sheep and Oudeis will need to chase him with a time-cutter. Time, Onuphrios explains with an analogy, is like a huge 3D ring with two surfaces, where one is the present, the other the past: one cannot pass one from side to the other without crossing an edge or piercing. Take a ring of paper and cut it, yielding a strip, and joining one end to another so the inside attaches to the outside and vice versa one, achieves a twisted ring mathematicians call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip" title="Möbius strip">Möbius Strip</a>. Only one colour tints its surface; if an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a> moved along the Strip it could walk on a single path to cover the whole Strip without crossing an edge, unlike a ring, where two ants on either side could not meet. Time resembles a ring and must be made into a Möbius Strip to travel though it: to do so one requires a time-plotter, which Mandys has.
</p><p>There are creatures called Time Guardians which prevent the misuse of time travel: only they have time-plotters, one of which Mandys must have stolen and keeps on the asteroid where he mines gold to flee into the past with it and the sheep. If he took the sheep into the past, it cannot observe the cosmos in the future, so it is there destroyed, but Mandys and the sheep are safe in the past with no one from the future extant to stop him. Since Oudeis is compelled to chase after Mandys, he needs this technology, and Onuphrios shows him the route to the Guardians. Were someone to cut a Möbius Strip through its length, there would not be two circles but one circle longer than the other; if a ring was cut it would create two smaller rings, and using this one could save the cosmos: Mandys, isolated in one cosmos, would only destroy only that one, with the other safe. Onuphrios says he has a time-cutter in his stomach and asks to be buried in the cosmos, at which point the putrefaction reaches him and he becomes brain-dead.
</p><p>Elephas removes the device. They throw his corpse into the cosmos and Oudeis orders the vessel steered towards the Time Guardians.

The Guardians tell them to leave, so Oudeis aims the dream device at them, which works and backfires. Oudeis wakes in a prison with Franta and his men under the watch of the Time Guardians. Franta tells Oudeis what happened and that all of Tolma was captured. The Commander of the Time Guardians approaches, asking who they are, suspecting they have come for a time-plotter; Oudeis replies truthfully, explaining the cosmos-observing sheep. The Commander calls it mythical and keeps them trapped, but takes Franta to examine it. Oudeis and his men wail, but suddenly appear on Tolma, where Franta spits out a box. It says the Commander in fact loved it and while he was enraptured Franta stole a time-plotter and used its tongue to go back one day to save them. The ship sails on to find Mandys.

<p>Oudeis addresses his companions: they will have Mandys identify the sheep, but he asks, afterwards, if they should kill or return him to Earth; the companions choose death. Mandys says he will reveal the goldmine if they release him; the companions agree. He shows them the mine and the cosmos-observing sheep (whose back Oudeis marks), and flies away. The men work to replace Kypta&#39;s loss and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semtex" title="Semtex">Semtex</a>, an explosion of which causes the cosmos-observer to break its neck, but the cosmos is not destroyed. Oudeis takes the corpse to the men. The real cosmos-observer never sleeps, so they can identify it at night; they discover a sheep is missing. Oudeis says they must chase Mandys again, and the Time Guardians arrives. Oudeis tells the men he will board the skiff with Franta, Tonda, and the time-plotter to chase after Mandys to draw the Time Guardians away; they must return home and enjoy life; Burda is appointed admiral. Franta makes the Commander hesitate and it, Oudeis, Tonda, and the time-plotter flee into the cosmos.

<p>Oudeis and his companions sail towards Earth and the sensors detect Mandys. Oudeis radiophones, telling him halt or he will fire; Mandys calls him a fool who could destroy everything. Oudeis fires, the vessel vibrates and vanishes. Oudeis remembers Onuphrios saying that Mandys will flee into the past because of the wealth that gold provides, so he reasons Mandys will go to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century" title="20th century">twentieth century</a> where he will be rich from his gold and technology sufficiently advanced for comfort. He does so and finds Mandys hurtling towards Earth. Mandys and sheep vacates the ship, as do Oudeis, Franta, and Tonda; they land on Earth unharmed. Oudeis summarises the hunt for Mandys and how they corner him. Mandys puts a knife to the sheep&#39;s throat and tells them to back off; Franta radiophones to Oudeis and he darts forward, striking the sheep to the ground and knocking it out, to Mandys&#39; shock. Mandys took the wrong sheep: when the Time Guardians fired on the asteroid, it shook and darkness fell on their eyes for a moment - they realised the cosmos-observer was real, and Oudeis&#39; men radiophoned Franta to report this and say they will collect him in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_Mountains" title="Tatra Mountains">Tatra mountains</a>.
</p><p>Oudeis explains that Mandys remained on Earth in the twentieth century to become a literary critic with the wrong sheep. Franta says it composed this account in the Argive tongue and reported it truthfully. It and Oudeis want to board onto their spaceship and leave, to return to their own Earth, and their own time.
