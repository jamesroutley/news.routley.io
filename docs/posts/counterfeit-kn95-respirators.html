    <h1>Counterfeit KN95 respirators</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Some respirators are designed and tested to meet international standards. These respirators are labeled to tell you what standard they meet. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respmanuf.html">Respirators approved by NIOSH</a> are evaluated by NIOSH against a specific US standard that includes a quality requirement. International standards do not often have quality requirements.</p>
<p>The most widely available respirators that meet an international standard are KN95s.</p>
<p>Other examples include 1<sup>st</sup>, DL2, DL3, DS2, DS3, FFP2, FFP3, KN100, KP95, KP100, P2, P3, PFF2, PFF3, R95, and Special.</p>

<li><strong>BE AWARE: About 60% KN95 respirators in the United States are </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html">counterfeit (fake)</a> <strong>and DO NOT meet NIOSH </strong>requirements.</li>

</ul>
</div></div>
<p><strong>How to wear</strong></p>
<p>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to wear, store, and clean or dispose of the respirator properly.</p>

<p>NIOSH approves many types of filtering facepiece respirators. The most widely available are N95, but other types (N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100) offer the same or better protection as an N95.</p>
<p><strong>NIOSH-Approved N95 Respirators</strong></p>
<p>When supplies are available, individuals may choose to use a basic disposable N95 respirator for personal use, instead of a mask, in some situations.</p>
<p>CDC recommends that specially labeled “surgical” <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3surgicaln95.html">N95 respirators</a> should be prioritized for healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>Employers who want to distribute N95 respirators to employees shall follow an <a href="https://www.osha.gov/respiratory-protection" data-domain-ext="gov">Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) respiratory protection program<span>external icon</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>What to know about N95s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Filter up to 95% of particles in the air when approved by NIOSH and proper fit can be achieved</li>
<li>Seal tightly to the face when fitted properly</li>
<li>Since N95 respirators form a seal to the face, they may feel harder to breathe through than a cloth mask</li>
<li>N95 respirators cannot be washed. They need to be discarded when they are dirty, damaged, or difficult to breathe through</li>
<li>N95 respirators tend to be more expensive than masks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wear an N95 with</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cup, flat fold, or duck bill shape</li>
<li>Two straps that go around the head</li>
<li>Formable wire nose bridge</li>
<li>Appropriate markings printed on the filter indicating the N95 respirator has been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/images/infographics/N95-Infographic-Mask-Labeling.jpg" target="new">approved by NIOSH<span>image icon</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span></span></a><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Do NOT wear an N95</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have certain types of facial hair</li>
<li><u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html">If it is a counterfeit (fake) N95 respirator</a></u></li>
<li>If hard to breathe</li>
<li>If wet or dirty</li>
<li>With a mask or second respirator</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to wear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who want to use a respirator for personal use should follow the user instructions exactly.</li>
<li>Fit testing (a process that uses specialized equipment) is the best way to determine if the respirator fits you. Even without fit testing, a well-fitting properly worn respirator may provide more protection than a mask. However, a poorly fitting or improperly worn respirator or mask may reduce its intended benefit.</li>
<li>NIOSH and OSHA have developed a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/donningdoffing.html">video</a> demonstrating how to perform a user seal check and how to properly put on (don) and take off (doff) a respirator, as well as a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-133/pdfs/2010-133.pdf" target="new">NIOSH factsheet<span>pdf icon</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span></span></a>.</li>
