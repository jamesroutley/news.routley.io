Kamprad worried that Ikea was losing customers who were getting hungry while they wandered around Ikea&#39;s maze-like stores and leaving to grab a bite to eat. </p><p>Kamprad, who <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/28/news/companies/ikea-founder-ingvar-kamprad/index.html" target="_blank">died in 2018</a>, envisioned restaurants in stores as a place where customers could sit down, eat and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/06/magazine/talking-shop.html" target="_blank">plan</a> how to decorate their living rooms with Ikea wares.</p><p>Hullberg, then an Ikea store manager, had gotten close to Kamprad and was tapped to create a new concept for all of Ikea&#39;s restaurants — everything from kitchen lines to the menu to training staff. He and a team of four, including a chef recruited from a high-end restaurant in Stockholm, went to work on designing a restaurant that would be an extension of Ikea&#39;s Swedish brand identity and thrifty reputation.</p><div><div><div><p><img alt="The meatballs were not Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad&amp;#39;s idea." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220427164509-ingvar-kamprad-ikea-founder-file-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>&#34;Our mission was to make sure that no one left an Ikea store because of being thirsty or hungry,&#34; he said.</p><p>At the time, a typical Ikea store was serving up to 5,000 customers a day. To simplify operations and keep costs down, the menu would have to be limited. And since the menu would be similar at stores in different countries, Hullberg&#39;s team looked for foods that were popular across different cultures.</p><p>Meatballs, a mainstay of Swedish diets, fit the bill.</p><p>&#34;We were hooked on that one,&#34; he said. &#34;Even if it&#39;s not really a Swedish innovation, meatballs exist in every culture you come to.&#34;</p><p>Meatballs were also efficient to freeze, transport and quickly prepare at Ikea&#39;s kitchens. </p><p>Although in Sweden &#34;there are as many recipes of meatballs as there are people eating them,&#34; Ikea needed to land on one recipe since it was outsourcing production. Making them in-house would have been too complicated for the volumes Ikea needed.</p><p>Ikea&#39;s chef came up with a recipe that was two-thirds beef and one-third pork, but Kamprad, the founder, wanted the meatball to be primarily from pigs. </p><p>&#34;We won that battle because it was easier to export meatballs containing a majority of beef than pig,&#34; Hullberg said. </p><p>In addition to meatballs, the new menu also featured Swedish staples such as salmon and roast beef, and smaller plates like salads and sandwiches.</p><p>Hullberg, 71, left Ikea in 1992. But he still shops there and stops by the restaurant to check out his brainchild.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_02095052-BE3F-857C-C881-6B6719C7EEE8"><h3>&#39;Iconic for IKEA&#39;</h3></p><p>Today, Ikea has several meatballs — the original one, chicken, salmon, vegetarian and a newer plant-based meatball. They&#39;re served with mashed potatoes, cream sauce, lingonberry jam and vegetables. Ikea also sells frozen meatballs customers can take home.</p><p>The meatballs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/europe/ikea-recalls-its-meatballs-horse-meat-is-detected.html" target="_blank">survived</a> a damaging recall in 2013 after traces of horse meat were found in a batch in Europe. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ikea shut down its restaurants and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/us/ikea-meatball-recipe-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">released the recipe</a> for customers to cook them at home.</p><p>The cafeterias where meatballs are typically served are located near the middle of the store — not too close to the entrance or the exit.</p><div><div><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/business/chick-fil-a-my-pleasure/index.html"><img alt="Why Chick-fil-A workers always say &amp;#39;my pleasure&amp;#39;" data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220405153821-chick-fil-a-food-orders-employees-2021-file-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></a></div></div></div><p>There&#39;s a strategy involved here, according Alison Jing Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota&#39;s Carlson School of Management who studies consumer behavior and the impact hunger has on purchasing decisions. </p><p>Ikea doesn&#39;t want to feed you right away, instead preferring that you work up an appetite while you shop and then visit the restaurant to take a break, Xu said.</p><p>When you&#39;re hungry, your mind is focused on acquiring food. This can spill over into acquiring other products, she said. Xu&#39;s <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/news/empty-stomach-can-lead-empty-wallet" target="_blank">research has found</a> that hungry mall shoppers spent 64% more money than shoppers who were already full.</p><p>When Tiare Sol, an Ikea shopper in Sacramento, California, and her family visit the store, &#34;almost everyone ends up ordering the meatballs.&#34;</p><ul data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><p>&#34;They&#39;re delicious,&#34; she said. &#34;They have a plant-based one which is nice because I&#39;ve been trying to cut down on eating meat and dairy.&#34;</p><p>For Sol, eating Swedish meatballs at Ikea is part of the experience: &#34;The meatballs are kind of iconic for Ikea. It&#39;s just what you do.&#34;</p></div></div></section><section data-eq-pts="xsmall: 0, medium: 460, large: 780, full16x9: 1100" id="story-bottom" data-vr-zone="zone-1-1" data-zone-label="storyBottom"></section></div></div>
