<li>hi!</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#The_Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_is_42">the answer to life, the universe and everything</a> numbered weeknotes!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been absent firstly because i kept forgetting these existed somehow - i am so bad at habits! - and the last week or so because of a health thing giving me anxiety. today i <a href="https://wheelofnames.com/">spun the wheel of activities</a> and it landed on weeknotes twice so here i am, on an absurdly hot day in London.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve swapped to youTube music/premium, and it&#39;s been good to shake myself off from spotify dominance, I forget how many songs are on only spotify or only youtube. enjoyed hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a_0-LExvK4">&#39;the harlem shakes - sunlight&#39;</a> for the first time in ages.</li>
<li>i rode a bike about 5 metres for the first time in my entire life! and repeated it twice or so since! i was hoping riding a bike was like riding a bike, and so cracking it once would mean that i could just do it, not so! apparently i have to &#34;practice&#34;.</li>
<li>cycling helmets are so expensive when you have a giant head partly due to giant hair ðŸ˜­</li>
<li>i feel like i&#39;ve been pretty &#34;smooth brain, no thoughts&#34; the last few weeks so surprising to see what falls out when i sit down to write these!</li>
<li>need to actually get on a cadence with <a href="https://buttondown.com/oluonline/archive/did-you-sign-up-for-a-newsletter-or-something/">my newsletter</a> rather than &#34;when i feel like it&#34;.</li>
<li>i can&#39;t remember if i wrote that i finished blood in the machine (book about the original luddites and tech and the &#34;re-emergence&#34; of them. i might do a whole post about neo-luddism for n in alphabet superset, but we&#39;ll see!</li>
<li>haven&#39;t been reading as much as i would like in general, but i think i&#39;m trying to be more okay with my natural rhythms. sometimes it&#39;s a big reading week, or writing week, or coding week, sometimes it&#39;s a lie in bed and listen to music week and that&#39;s okay.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been drinking lemonade, cranberry juice, and too much milk. i have been eating oatmeal raisin cookies, korean chicken wings and spicy crisps.</li>
<li>i hope you&#39;re doing wonderful. see you next week?</li>
