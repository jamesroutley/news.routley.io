    <h1>In-Depth Ruby Concurrency: Navigating the Ruby Concurrency Landscape</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I was honored to present a talk on Ruby concurrency at RubyConf 2024. It represents a high-level distillation of much of my writing and research over the past year. The conference itself was great, and presenting was such a fun experience.</p>
<p>Here is the talk, titled “In-Depth Ruby Concurrency: Navigating the Ruby Concurrency Landscape”:</p>

<p>If you want the slides, I’ve published them as a short YouTube video:</p>

<p>I know it’s a bit odd to share my slides as a video, but there are so many animations it was the easiest option to preserve the original flow.</p>
