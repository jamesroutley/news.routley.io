    <h1>The Lost Art of the Negative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Silvio Cohen has been doing this for years. Soak, rinse, soak, dry, repeat. Thirty-five millimeter, medium format, old cameras, new film. Analog work in a digital age.</p><p>“When I tell my friends that we still do developing, they laugh,” Cohen said. “It’s a different feel. The finish is a different finish.”</p><p>Cohen works at 42nd Street Photo, one of a handful of legacy shops in New York City that still develop film. They have been at it for a century, riding the medium’s ebbs and flows — from film’s first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/business/09film.html" title="">plummet</a> in the 2000s, to its resilient return in the early 2010s, to its rediscovery by yet another new generation of shooters in the 2020s.</p><p>But in this latest renaissance — born of Covid-era lockdowns — Cohen has noticed one of the practice’s most precious components has been lost.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“They don’t pick up their negatives,” Cohen said of his customers, guessing that maybe 10 percent of them return for the rolls. Behind him, a colleague corrects him: “Five percent.” Another, laughing: “Zero percent.”</p><p>Across the world, the small cadre of commercial film lab developers describe similar conundrums: stacks of forgotten envelopes, limited storage space and warring impulses — to tidy the clutter, or preserve the creative souls of forgetful photographers. After all, it’s the strips of film, not the prints, that are legally the artist’s original work.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Two shelves lined with cameras." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh/00xp-filmmegatives-02-lcgh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Refurbished film cameras for sale at 42nd Street Photo in Manhattan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Neal Kumar, owner of Bleeker Digital Solutions, tells customers he’ll keep their negatives for 30 days.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Film for sale at Bleeker.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>“The very-big-picture legal issue is the difference between ownership of the negatives and ownership of the copyright,” said David Deal, a former professional photographer who now practices copyright law. “When those two things are detached from one another, then all hell breaks loose.”</p></div><div><div><p>Put simply: Whoever has the negatives has the mechanism to reproduce the work but not the copyright to do so; the artist sans negatives has the right but not the means.</p><p>It’s a concept that has been battered in the age of digital cameras, then left for dead with the advent of iPhones. Dinosaurs of the photography game, negatives are the original images that are burned into frames when film loaded into an analog camera is exposed to light. They once were the primary deliverable when processing a roll of film.</p><p>In the digital age, most shops where people get their film developed will scan the negatives into a computer and just email the photographs to their customers.</p><p>“Negatives would’ve never been forgotten before, because people had to pick up the digital copy,” said Richard Damery, a developer who has worked at Aperture Printing in London for 15 years. “They can now have everything uploaded to them. They forget about the negatives.”</p><p>It can be hard for some to imagine (or remember) a time when a photograph involved more steps than just the instant gratification of looking down at a screen.</p><p>That’s especially true for much of Gen Z, the driving force behind the contemporary film resurgence. The industry has boomed in the years since the pandemic, and not just with upmarket brands like <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/900-increase-film-camera-sales-092313756.html#:~:text=Leica%20M6%202022.,%22the%20return%20of%20analog%22." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leica</a>; the classic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/03/13/disposable-cameras-gen-z/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fujifilm disposables</a> are back, too. For many young shooters, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/03/13/disposable-cameras-gen-z/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anticipation and delayed payoff</a> of film are a welcome salve to the 24/7 exposure of apps like Instagram.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s less a surprise comeback than <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/neverending-film-resurgence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another rise in a tide</a> for a medium that has stubbornly refused to go quietly into the digital night. Less than a decade after digital cameras took over the market <a href="https://disposableamerica.org/course-projects/della-keyser/going-retro-in-the-age-of-digital/#:~:text=In%202004%2C%20digital%20camera%20sales,not%20the%20future%20of%20photography." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2004</a>, New York magazine forecast an “<a href="https://nymag.com/shopping/features/analog-renaissance-2011-7/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analog renaissance</a>” in 2011. Time announced a film “<a href="https://time.com/4649188/film-photography-industry-comeback/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comeback</a>” in 2017. In 2022, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2022/06/22/film-photographys-resurgence-is-leading-to-huge-price-increases" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> ballooning prices on film (the phenomenon was due to increased demand and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7m8x/why-theres-a-colour-film-shortage-right-now" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pandemic-era supply shortages</a>).</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Negatives once were the primary deliverable when processing a roll of film. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Examining a test print through colored filters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of several test prints being assessed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>At Bleeker Digital Solutions in NoLIta, Neal Kumar, the owner, instituted a new policy about 18 months ago asking his customers to designate whether or not they need their negatives when they drop off their film.</p><p>“I was holding in the basement,” he said, “then the basement start getting full.”</p><p>Now, he tells customers he keeps the strips for 30 days — even if he quietly holds onto them for 90, just in case.</p><p>Emmet Butler’s family has run Conns Cameras in Dublin for 50 years. They, too, have recently instituted a policy asking customers if they intend to return for their film. Even those who say they will often never do.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I’m absolutely flooded here,” he said. “We have an entire room full of negatives.”</p><p>Andreas Olesen, a professional photographer and co-owner of a lab in Copenhagen, said he still struggles to throw out people’s negatives even long after they’ve been abandoned. For him, they’re the soul of the craft.</p><p>“The negative is the score, and the print is the performance,” he said, paraphrasing the photographer Ansel Adams. Olesen has played with the concept in his own work; one of his projects, “<a href="https://www.lensculture.com/articles/andreas-olesen-estate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Estate</a>,” used a series of negatives his wife discovered in an antique shop to tell the story of a midcentury family holiday.</p><p>The forfeiture of negatives is far more consequential phenomenon than clerical clutter. It’s at the heart of unresolved questions about copyright and artistic ownership.</p><p>Deal, the lawyer, knows firsthand. For more than a decade, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/arts/design/a-legal-battle-over-vivian-maiers-work.html" title="">championed a court case</a> in Chicago over the work of Vivian Maier, an acclaimed street photographer who captured thousands of images beginning in the 1950s. Maier’s work wasn’t discovered until after her death, when a real estate agent came to possess Maier’s negatives via a blind auction. It’s led to a protracted legal fight over who owns the rights — not the negatives — to Maier’s work that is still unresolved.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The negative is the score, and the print is the performance,” said Andreas Olesen, a professional photographer in Copenhagen, paraphrasing Ansel Adams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bags upon bags filled with abandoned negatives, prints and CDs from processed film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An employee at 42nd Street Photo estimates that 10 percent of customers return for their processed film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>The likelihood that any passing film hobbyist will posthumously be elevated as the street shooter of a generation — well, it’s small odds. But perhaps it’s less about potential fame than creative diligence. After all, Olesen noted, there’s something timeless about negatives. In 50 years, his grandchildren may not even be able to access a hard drive or a CD with digital files.</p></div><div><p>But for century-old negatives? “I can hold it up to the sky,” he said. “They’re immediately available to me.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p><span></span> is a reporter on the Metro desk, covering crime and law enforcement in New York.
