<p>Johan Carlsson started part-time hacking in May 2021 and is already number 7 on our <a href="https://hackerone.com/gitlab/thanks">HackerOne Top 10 list</a>. How did he get there in such a short time, while juggling a full-time web development job, as well as being a husband and father? Read on to learn about his unique approach, which is a great roadmap for anyone wanting to start ‚Äì or improve ‚Äì their hacking game.</p>

<p><em>But first, a bit about <a href="https://hackerone.com/joaxcar">Johan Carlsson (@joaxcar)</a>:</em></p>
<p>Johan lives in Gothenburg, Sweden, with his wife and their three kids. He has bachelor‚Äôs degrees in computer science and fine arts. In his after hours, when the kids are asleep, he looks for bugs in GitLab from the comfort of his sofa. He stumbled into IT security and bug bounties through a course in ethical hacking during his last semester at university.</p>
<p>A year ago, he didn‚Äôt know what XSS, CSRF, RCE or any of that fancy jargon was, and he considers himself far from a professional hacker. He says he is learning as he goes. When not at the computer, he spends time with his family, or, more accurately, when he is not spending time with his family, he tries to do some bug hunting.</p>

<h2 id="it-starts-with-the-mindset">It starts with the mindset</h2>
<p><strong>Q: It‚Äôs pretty impressive that you were able to go from ‚Äúzero knowledge‚Äù in bug hunting to landing in our top ten. What aspects of your approach help you to be successful? Any tips for other newcomers when it comes to diving into bug hunting?</strong></p>
<p>Johan: I think persistence and a genuine interest in the subject (in this case IT/web security) is key here. If I were only doing it for the bounties, I don&#39;t think I would have been able to continue searching during the days/weeks when I was not able to find any vulnerabilities. For me, I have found as much joy and excitement in learning and researching as in actually finding bugs.</p>
<p>One thing that I have found particularly useful is being able to set my mind to the state of an attacker of the system. It might sound trivial, but when you come from a background of building things, it can be challenging to understand how a feature you built could be abused. When I now look at a new feature in GitLab, this is always my first question, &#34;Ok, how could this break, what could go wrong?&#34;</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-great-bug-bounty-program">What makes a great bug bounty program?</h2>
<p><strong>Q: I see you‚Äôve diversified and about half your HackerOne reputation points come from other bug bounty programs! Have you seen anything cool in other programs that we could consider implementing?</strong></p>
<p>Johan: Yes, I have been trying my luck in some other programs as well! Mostly it has been to be able to try out other parts of bug hunting that are not very applicable to my work on GitLab, such as automated tooling and more basic &#34;off the shelf&#34; bugs from <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">the OWASP Top 10</a>.</p>
<p>The one thing I have encountered that I somewhat miss in GitLab&#39;s bounty program is a more personalized triage experience. A great thing with GitLab&#39;s approach to triage and payouts is that it is very standardized and predictable (both triage communication and payout amount). But this is also the biggest downside for me as a returning reporter, and someone who doesn‚Äôt consider bug hunting a job; a more engaged and personalized approach would give someone like me as much encouragement to continue in the program as high bounties would.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the programs that run promotions, that have an active program page and encourage reporters by rewarding bonuses when reports are especially well written, interesting or novel. It is a balancing act I guess, as these activities could risk tilting the program and making it &#34;unfair.&#34; These types of incentives are also maybe easier to implement in private programs. But still, even the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/01/3rd-annual-bug-bounty-contest/">November bug challenge</a> gave me an extra boost as it diversified the incentive to engage with the program.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-identify-targets">How to identify targets</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How do you pick which part of GitLab you‚Äôre going to dig into? Do you read our release posts? Do you look at old bugs?</strong></p>
<p>Johan: My approach here is very haphazard. It is a mix of reading release notes and looking at <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&amp;state=closed&amp;label_name%5B%5D=HackerOne&amp;first_page_size=20">old bugs and random issues on the GitLab issue tracker</a>. I use all three of these to identify areas of the application that I have missed or never thought of.</p>
<p>Reading through the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/">release blog posts</a> (especially the monthly security release) has probably been the most fruitful for me. I have reported multiple bugs that are alterations or bypasses to previously fixed and disclosed reports. I usually read through the report, try to understand what caused the problem, and then use my own understanding of GitLab to identify if any edge cases exist where the developers might have missed adding protection. Here‚Äôs <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1481207">an example in HackerOne</a> where I did just that!</p>
<p>A bit more random, but fun and rewarding, is to just jump in to issues on the tracker that seem to discuss something interesting. I have found quite a few features that I didn&#39;t know existed by reading discussions in issues where GitLab staff and users discuss something completely unrelated to security. I then go to the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com">documentation</a> and the source code and try to identify where this feature resides and start poking at it. Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1375393">example of a report I made after doing some digging through public issues</a>.</p>
<p>üîé <em><strong>More details from Johan:</strong></em> </p>
<p>However, I sometimes have the reverse issue, when I find a code path that looks dangerous but I don&#39;t know how to reach it from the UI or API. One such instance led me to a series of bugs found in an area of GitLab that I‚Äôd never poked at before. (These bugs are just recently fixed/getting fixed, so disclosures have not yet been made.)</p>
<p>The best part of this combined approach to &#34;reconnaissance&#34; is that I can do it on my phone. This is a great feature of the GitLab bug bounty program, as the time I actually have available in front of a computer doing bug hunting is quite restricted.</p>

<p><em><strong>About the GitLab Bug Bounty program:</strong></em>
<em>The overarching goal of our bug bounty program is to make our products and services more secure. The program is managed by our Application Security team. Since launching our public bug bounty program in December 2018, we‚Äôve received over 3,618 submissions, resolved 1025 reports, awarded more than a million dollars in bounties and thanked 478 hackers for those findings. You can see our program dashboard at https://hackerone.com/gitlab.</em></p>
