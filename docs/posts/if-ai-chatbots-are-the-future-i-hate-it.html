    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img width="500" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/speedtest-graph-att-dropoff.png" alt="AT&amp;T Fiber Internet - speedtest graph"/></p>

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn&#39;t too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that&#39;s the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T&#39;s support chat. I&#39;m a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T&#39;s AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate &#39;WiFi&#39; with &#39;Internet&#39;, no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p>

<p>We were stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you&#39;re having trouble with your WiFi.</p>
  
  <p><em>No.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After working a few different angles, I finally &#39;spammed 0&#39;<sup id="fnref:olddays"><a href="#fn:olddays" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> by entering some variation of &#39;connect me to a support rep&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll cut to the chase—after repeating some variation of that about 8 times, eventually I got queued up in the 20 minute line to a human support rep.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the human support rep, like so many in the industry, promptly ignored the data I provided in my first chat message to him<sup id="fnref:message"><a href="#fn:message" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and told me switching WiFi channels on the device (on which WiFi is currently disabled completely) would solve my issue. <em>At no cost.</em></p>

<p>Maybe I should welcome our AI overlords?</p>

<p>In the old days of phone support, if you got stuck in the automated menus, you could resort to spamming &#39;0&#39;, and in <em>most</em> systems that weren&#39;t set up by nefarious managerial overlords, that would get you to a human. Eventually. <a href="#fnref:olddays" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>The entire contents of my message, prior to his turned-off-WiFi channel twiddling: &#34;Hello! I just received and installed the new AT&amp;T router/fiber modem, and ... the Internet speed is just as slow as before. I pay for 1 Gbps symmetric, and I&#39;m getting 8 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. On 6/28, the average connection speed went from 1 Gbps down to 100 Mbps. On 7/8 the average speed went from 100 Mbps to 8 Mbps.
This is all measured both on the device at the fiber, and through a separate monitor I have wired into the 1 Gbps network.&#34; <a href="#fnref:message" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
