<p>Why would one consider indexing validators? Reuse.</p>
<p>The value of reuse seems obvious for structural and semantic <em>specification</em>, i.e. schemas and
controlled vocabularies – there is opportunity to perceive two datasets as aligned. But, this
alignment is only <em>indicated</em>, not necessarily <em>validated</em>.</p>
<p>Two datasets, A and B, are stated to both conform to schema S. If you wish to verify this, what do
you do? You apply a validator V to both. Therefore, it seems that if the same validator V is already
stated to have been successfully applied to both datasets A and B in order to verify conformance to
S, you will have higher confidence in proceeding to analysis without applying validation yourself,
or at least without insisting on comprehensive, compute-intensive validation by default.</p>
<p>A given schema-specification validator may also be relatively sophisticated and transform an input
dataset to conform more tightly to the specification, as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s
Law</a>, making it even more valuable to reuse
unambiguously identified validators as part of data-integration workflows.</p>
<p>Validators may be composed, e.g. conjunctively as <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/schema/schema.html#entity-predicates">attribute/predicate specs are in
Datomic</a>, encouraging
granular reuse. However, one could not naively employ conformers-as-validators in such a scheme
unless they formed a commutative semigroup (mutually rectifying robustness – Postel would
approve!).</p>
