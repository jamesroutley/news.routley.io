<p>Hi Gophers! Today we&rsquo;re excited to announce our <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wwSstC8vv4Ymkm?s=b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">2025 Go Developer Survey</a>. The Go Team uses the results of this annual survey to better understand the needs and concerns of Go developers across the world. Your feedback helps us brainstorm, plan, and prioritize work on Go.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wwSstC8vv4Ymkm?s=b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">take the survey here</a>. It will be open through <strong>September 30th</strong>. The survey should take 10 â€“ 20 minutes to complete, and every question is optional.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll share aggregated survey results on this blog in early November. This year we&rsquo;ll also share the raw dataset of survey responses, so that the entire Go community can benefit from this knowledge and conduct your own analyses on the data. Similar to our approach with <a href="/blog/gotelemetry">Go Telemetry</a>, we&rsquo;re using an opt-in model: the survey will ask for your permission to include your responses in the dataset. If you don&rsquo;t give us permission, your survey responses will not be shared.</p>
<p>Please help us reach as many Go developers as possible! We love it when you share the survey with your colleagues, friends, and online communities. The more voices we hear, the better we can understand the diverse needs of Go developers everywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to hearing your feedback!</p>
