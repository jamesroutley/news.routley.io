  <p>sometimes I freeze into my ideas and I am unable to move forward.</p>
  <p>this is when it&#39;s important to remember to keep doing things.</p>
  <p>so here are a few things that are keeping me busy lately:</p>
  <p>you can see some of my works at the <a href="https://www.artsouterrain.com">Art souterrain project called Créer des ponts</a>. I will be organizing <a href="https://www.calendly.com/finartcialist/coworking">coworking sessions in November 2022</a> - you are invited. I am only going to ask you a few questions about what work means to you, and we will spend some time doing work together in the space. An example would be: I can show you how to code your own HTML/CSS only website and we can deploy it on Github or Gitlab!</p>
  <p>No matter if you can make it to the coworking session or not, there will be a finissage later on. It will be announced on <a href="https://www.finartcialist.com/creer-des-ponts-2022">the project page</a>.
  </p><p>I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATJ_0x3Qi0E">Montréal-Python meetup number 96</a> on generating RSS feeds.</p>
  <p>There are so many things I need to do to keep the <i>finartcialist</i> project going... One of them involve writing down all my thoughts and ideas and possibilities and why I am doing this thing and not something else. I might take the month of November to write a few rough drafts covering these questions.</p>
  <p>I often feel like I am doing so little compared to all I could do. Remember to be compassionate with yourself if you are out there creating something.</p>
