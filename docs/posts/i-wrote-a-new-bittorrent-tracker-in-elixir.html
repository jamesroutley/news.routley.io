 Oyez! It’s me, Jim (<a href="https://jimkang.com/)">https://jimkang.com/)</a>.</p>
<p> I last emailed you about two years ago when TinyLetter, the newsletter service I used, shut down.</p>
<p>But I’ve finally gotten around to writing my own bare bones mailing list service<b>*</b>, which you can <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/franz-list">fork and run</a>) for yourself. So, once again, I can email you. (Unless you unsubscribe, which you can do easily with the link at the bottom of this email.)</p>

<p>I call these guys Mote Ghosts:</p>
<p><a href="https://jimkang.com/gallery/#focusPiece=mote-ghosts&amp;showWIP=no">https://jimkang.com/gallery/#focusPiece=mote-ghosts&amp;showWIP=no</a></p>
<p>This piece is basically a screen saver. Have a few quiet minutes watching it!</p>

<p>I’ve been learning how to make fragment shaders via the classic <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">Book of Shaders</a>. Shaders are ultra-focused programs that are responsible for answering the question “What color goes at this pixel?” Hundreds of <span>GPU</span> cores run these shaders simultaneously to create a picture about 60 times a second.</p>
<p>One of the exercises in the book is creating “animals” that move in unique ways. Doing that exercise eventually yielded Mote Ghosts. if you’re interested, <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/gallery/blob/main/renderers/shaders/mote-ghosts-fragment-shader.js">here’s the source</a>.</p>

<p>Near the end of last year, I finished a <a href="https://jimkang.bandcamp.com/track/clearing-the-neighbourhood">song</a> about planet formation. <a href="https://sparklemarkers.com/">Katt</a> made the album cover. It’s long, but by ambient music standards, it’s short. <a href="https://jimkang.com/music/deathmtn-dYDyOzQS.html">Some background background information here.</a></p>

<p>In non-projects, I went to a judo club cookout, where some kid ate <a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ignignokt/32rg0o9q30">exactly half of a burger and half of a hot dog</a>, <a href="https://smidgeo.com/notes/deathmtn/deathmtn-iTjKgHjl.html">protested with some nice folks</a>, and judged at a math circle event in which the kids tried to solve a thousand problems. (I think they collectively got to 400-something?) I also discovered <a href="https://smidgeo.com/notes/deathmtn/deathmtn-SfzKIBMP.html">how my camera got knocked down</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know <strong>A)</strong> if you actually receive this email and <strong>B)</strong> what you’ve been up to!</p>
<p>It’s good to be able to write to you again! Next week (hopefully), I’ll talk about some more projects I’ve been doing or have done.</p>
<p>Jim</p>
