    <h1>Swedish Tesla strike goes international as Norwegian and Danish unions join in</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Swedish Tesla employees have gone on strike, and unions in neighboring Denmark and Norway have joined boycotts of Elon Musk&#39;s electric automaker.</p>
<p>Danish union 3F and Norway&#39;s Fellesforbundet, the largest private-sector unions in their respective nations, both announced plans this week to get in Tesla&#39;s way.</p>
<p>3F, which covers multiple industries in Denmark, has limited its sympathy strike to its Transportation arm, which union chair Jan Villadsen explained will mean transportation workers at docks, including drivers, won&#39;t unload or transport Tesla vehicles bound for Sweden.</p>

    

<p>&#34;Even though Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world and owns Tesla, he can&#39;t just make his own rules,&#34; Villadsen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jan.g.villadsen/posts/669001345216182" rel="nofollow">declared</a> on Tuesday when announcing 3F&#39;s action. &#34;We have some agreements on the labor market in the Nordics, and you have to comply with them if you want to do business here.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>Fellesforbundet leader Jørn Eggum echoed Villadsen&#39;s sentiments in a Wednesday <a href="https://www.fellesforbundet.no/aktuelt/nyheter/2023/varsler-tesla-boikott/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> that his union will also launch a boycott aimed at stopping the transportation of Teslas into Sweden.</p>
<p>&#34;In the Nordic countries, there is broad agreement about the importance of a well-organized working life,&#34; Eggum noted. &#34;The right to demand a collective agreement is a natural part of [that], and we cannot accept that Tesla stands outside this.&#34;</p>

        

<p>3F and Fellesforbundet&#39;s sympathy strikes will begin on December 19 and December 20, respectively, if a collective agreement between Tesla and employees represented by Swedish automotive worker union IF Metall isn&#39;t in place.</p>
<p>IF Metall workers in Sweden – where Tesla doesn&#39;t manufacture vehicles but has a number of repair and service shops – have been <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/" rel="nofollow">on strike</a> since October after what they described as years of Tesla refusing to bargain with the union. IF Metall-represented employees claim Tesla hasn&#39;t guaranteed them good wages, a pension or insurance.</p>

<p>Tesla has long refused to bargain with unions, with CEO Elon Musk recently <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/30/musk_murders_x/">opining</a> that he disagrees with the entire concept of organized labor, as you can see below.</p>

</p>
<p>&#34;I just don&#39;t like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing,&#34; the world&#39;s richest man told the <em>New York Times</em> DealBook Summit. &#34;I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company.&#34; He added &#34;If Tesla gets unionized it will be because we deserved it, and because we failed in some way.&#34;</p>

        

<p>Unions across Sweden have <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/darfor-tvingas-if-metall-att-strejka/sympatiatgarder-fran-andra-fackforbund/" rel="nofollow">banded together</a> to cripple Tesla. Swedish port workers have pledged to block imports, electricians have refused to work on damaged Tesla chargers or at the vehicle builder&#39;s facilities, painters and builders have declined to work for Elon&#39;s products and properties.</p>
<p>Postal workers even decided not to deliver mail to the electric automaker, including license plates – an action that Musk called &#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1727564977869844865?s=20" rel="nofollow">insane</a>&#34;. The local court has since <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/tesla_sweden_strike_lawsuit/">put a stop</a> to that action.</p>
<p>It&#39;s unknown whether Tesla plans to take further action to stop the strikes, or whether it&#39;ll cut its losses and bargain with employees – we asked, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®</p>
