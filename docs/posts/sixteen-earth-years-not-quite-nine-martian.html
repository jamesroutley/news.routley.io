<div><p>Wanna read action-y scifi about girls solving problems by hacking electronics? (<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188841/you-have-a-message-I-am-unable-to-read-aloud">Previously.</a>) <a href="https://littlebluemarble.ca/2020/09/25/power-to-the-people/">&#34;Power to the People&#34; by Kiera Lesley</a> is shorter: <i>“Sorry, print took longer than I expected.” Sarah said, fishing in her pockets for her offerings, all in white because that was the only colour filament she had.</i> But <a href="http://electricspec.com/Volume16/Issue3/mccabe.html">&#34;A Thousand Ways&#34; by Beth McCabe</a> takes place on Mars: <i>Riley began moving the rows of panels from angled to vertical, a kluge Liam&#39;s team had fixed up to keep the sticky dust from accumulating during a storm.
