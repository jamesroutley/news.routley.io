				<p><h2>About</h2></p>
				<p>
					Created in 2011, Hacker Typer arose from a simple desire to look like the
					stereotypical hacker in movies and pop culture. Since that time, it has brought
					smiles to millions of people across the globe. Plus, many of you have
					temporarily transformed into hackers yourselves, all from a few clicks on the
					keyboard (and some programming magic behind the scenes!).
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, if you are using Hacker Typer in any of your projects, videos or images,
					feel free to reach out! It’s amazing to see what happens when people’s
					creativity interacts with this site.
				</p>
				<p>You can reach the developer here: <i>hackertyper@duiker101.net</i></p>
				<p>
					And please note: No, I will kindly not hack into anyone’s personal property, so
					please skip these requests. Thanks!
