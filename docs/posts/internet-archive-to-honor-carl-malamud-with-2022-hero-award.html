<p>This year, the Internet Archive is honoring Carl as a tireless advocate for free access to government information. Some highlights of his work include: </p>



<ul><li>In the early days of the internet, Carl was a pioneer in pushing for public materials to be available online. Over three decades, he has digitized and uploaded thousands of documents from Congressional hearings, government films, and worked with the executive branch to shape public policy on information sharing.</li><li>He is to thank for EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) Online, the free Securities and Exchange Commission database of corporate information and putting the database of U.S. patents on the internet. </li><li>Carl is relentless in his ongoing quest to have detailed codes for buildings, product safety, and infrastructure available to the public on the internet.</li><li>He founded <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a>, a nonprofit based in California in 2007. Several contractors and pro-bono attorneys work with him to unleash public information from behind paywalls—sometimes landing him in court to defend his actions, all done in the name of the public good.</li><li>Carl is known as a dedicated, passionate, principled individual whose creative strategies—and, at times, dose of humor and flair—have fueled his success in opening up access to public knowledge.</li></ul>



<p>Carl has been a supporter of the Internet Archive since its inception. Much of his work appears in the Internet Archive collection including his book, “<a href="https://archive.org/details/exploringinterne00carl">Exploring the Internet</a>,” a movie, <a href="https://archive.org/details/multicast.03.open.access.ninja">Open Access Ninja</a>, about his philosophy with Public Resource.org and a video, “<a href="https://archive.org/details/Show.Me.The.Manual">Show Me the Manual</a>,” about making building and electrical codes available.</p>
