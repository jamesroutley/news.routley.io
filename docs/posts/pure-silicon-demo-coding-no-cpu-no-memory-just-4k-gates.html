        <p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2025/01/10/tiny-tapeout-donut.html">VGA
donut</a>, I submitted
two other entries in the <a href="https://tinytapeout.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Tapeout</a> 8 <a href="https://tinytapeout.com/competitions/demoscene-tt08-entries/" target="_blank">demo
competition</a>,
where you submit a &#34;tiny&#34; ASIC design (room for about 4000 logic gates)
that outputs 2-bit RGB to a VGA port and 1-bit audio to a speaker. One was a
an old school C64/Amiga intro type of thing, and <a href="#nyan-cat">the other</a> was a
nyan cat.</p>

<p>Click to play -- video loops imperfectly but the hardware loop is seamless</p>

<p>The intro features a background starfield, a panning 3D checkerboard with
colorful tiles, and wavy scrolling text which casts a shadow onto the
checkerboard.  I was inspired by <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/" target="_blank">lft&#39;s first AVR demo
Craft</a> to add a little cyan
oscilloscope to the side of the screen as well.</p>

<p>The size limit was two Tiny Tapeout &#34;tiles&#34; which is not a lot of space for
music, effects, and data; this is a very constrained platform for a demo: you
get no ROM, no RAM, and every bit of state is a flipflop which takes up a decent
chunk of space compared to combinational logic. Traditional &#34;sizecoding&#34; tricks
don&#39;t apply here -- data compression doesn&#39;t help you if you can&#39;t actually
store a ROM; you have no frame buffer so you must produce a pixel every clock
cycle. There&#39;s no CPU to exploit, just your own state machine.</p>

<h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>

<p>Like the VGA donut, this one used the weird custom video mode of 1220x480 and a
48MHz clock as it was easiest to prototype with given the <a href="https://orangecrab-fpga.github.io/orangecrab-hardware/" target="_blank">only FPGA hardware I
had on hand</a>, but in
retrospect I very much regret using this video mode. Most of the digital
captures of the demo look bad thanks to dithering and aliasing artifacts. It
does look great on a real CRT though!</p>

<p>The above video was made with a Verilator simulation, which compiles the Verilog
source down to C++ and allowed me to do cycle-by-cycle simulation of the design,
rendering to a SDL window / audio stream. This also allowed me to dump out
simulated frames to create the above video. I would later use this <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-vgademo/blob/main/verilator/vgademo_tb.cpp" target="_blank">SDL VGA
verilator
testbench</a>
for the other projects.</p>

<p>The C++ simulation runs about half-realtime on my system, though, and most of
the time I synthesized it for the OrangeCrab&#39;s Lattice ECP5 FPGA strapped to an
ugly R-2R DAC (it&#39;s two bits per channel, so literally R and 2R, no ladder, for
RGB) hacked together on a perfboard.</p>

</p><p>orangecrab FPGA and my RGB222 VGA connector</p>

<p>Sound is output on a single pin through an RC filter; most people used PWM of
some kind, but I implemented sigma-delta conversion which is actually simpler
(with some tradeoffs; more <a href="#sigma-delta-dac">below</a>). The little solder blob on pin 13 of the
orangecrab is where I soldered an audio cable and plugged it into a portable
guitar amp for sound.</p>

<p>To get some more color fidelity out of RGB222, I used the same <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2025/01/10/tiny-tapeout-donut.html#tinytapeout-considerations">ordered
dithering code</a>
as in the donut.</p>

<p>Tiny Tapeout provides a basic workflow for taking your Verilog design and
&#34;hardening it&#34; -- laying out the GDS file (which is what goes to the fab) -- as
a GitHub action on commit, but there&#39;s also a <a href="https://tinytapeout.com/guides/local-hardening/" target="_blank">local
hardening</a> tool which was
absolutely necessary as I alternately added elements to the demo and optimized
it to fit. Either there would be too many cells to fit the area, or they would
fit but routing wires between them would fail (sometimes after an hour or
more!). Being able to dry run several experiments on my own PC was invaluable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/tt08-vgademo-layout.png" alt="ASIC layout"/>
This design ended up using 3374 total cells (<a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-vgademo/actions/runs/20287352490" target="_blank">breakdown of cell use and 3D
viewer here</a>)
and filling just about every square nanometer. The sort of largish bluish areas
are mostly flip-flops, each representing a bit of state held by the circuit.
Flip-flops are relatively big, so minimizing state bits turned out to be
essential. I still ended up with 293 total flipflops.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tycS0vGcZIY" target="_blank">invitation intro</a> (which is
not a real ASIC demo, just a mockup!) that Matt Venn created for the competition
inspired me to do something in a similar vein, and for some reason, I was
fixated on using one of the fonts for my demo.  Encoding text in this font cost
a ton of gate area, and so everything else was highly constrained -- eventually
I had to give up encoding the color values in the font (but I kept the palette)
and go for a generic diagonal striped pattern.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-data-in-an-asic">Encoding data in an ASIC</h3>

<p>You can think of a ROM as a circuit that has a huge truth table -- address
0000000 yields some value, 0000001 another value, etc. Usually this is laid out
in a big grid on a chip with some address decoders doing rows and colums and a
transistor for each bit encoding high or low values.</p>

<p>Sometimes these are encoded as Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs) instead of a
fully laid out matrix of bits; one example of this is at the heart of the famous
Pentium FDIV bug which <a href="https://www.righto.com/2024/12/this-die-photo-of-pentium-shows.html" target="_blank">Ken Shirrif breaks down nicely
here</a>.</p>

<p>But you could also just encode the ROM as a bunch of logic gates specific to the
pattern of bits specified, e.g., maybe if address bit 7 is on, the result is
always 0. In fact part of what the synthesis pipeline does is to take an arbitrarily
large truth table and match it to the set of available logic cells (on an FPGA
this tends to be a bunch of 4-input lookup tables but Sky130 has all kinds of
assorted gates and combined logic
cells - <a href="https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_sc_hd/cells/a2111o/README.html" target="_blank">random example</a>).
So I provided a <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-vgademo/blob/main/data/charmask.hex" target="_blank">giant lookup
table</a> as a
hex file and the <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys" target="_blank">yosys</a> synthesis pipeline
figured out a way to implement it with the standard cell library, effectively by
finding patterns in the data that match up with patterns in the addresses, and
then, instead of fitting them in a nice rectangle, sprayed those standard logic
cells all over my available die area in whatever shape made sense for the other
standard cells connected to them. This makes is very hard to predict how much
&#34;data&#34; will fit.</p>

<p>What this means for a limited gate area demo is that instead of minimizing the
size of data to store as lookup tables, it&#39;s better to limit the
<em>algorithmic complexity</em> of the data as a function of its address. Repeating the
same power-of-two-sized pattern is free; only variations need extra logic.
This is helpful to keep in mind when composing music, for example. So encoding
&#34;TT08&#34;, if the width of a character cell is a power of two, means that second
copy of &#39;T&#39; is basically free in terms of logic gates.</p>

<p>drastically simplified example</p>


<h3 id="sines-without-sine-tables">Sines without sine tables</h3>

<p>Usually in a sine scroller you&#39;d expect to see a sine/cosine lookup table, but
given the above, it seems wise to avoid it if possible. Just like in <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2025/01/10/tiny-tapeout-donut.html">my donut
demo</a>, I instead rotate a vector on every
clock cycle. I don&#39;t need random access to the sine table, only <span data-katex="">\sin(x + o)</span>
for each <span data-katex="">x</span> coordinate on the screen which increments each cycle, with an
offset <span data-katex="">o</span> which increments each frame.</p>

<p>In fact I have a high-resolution sin/cos vector (<code>a_cos</code>, <code>a_sin</code>) that updates
slowly each frame, and a low-resolution one (<code>b_cos</code>, <code>b_sin</code>) initialized from
the high-resolution one at the start of each scanline that updates each clock
cycle.</p>

<p>Cutting bits out of the per-pixel sine generator was one of many hacks done late
in development to save on area (remember: flip-flops are pretty large so they
had to be trimmed aggressively), and there is visible jankiness in the sine
scroller as a result, if you watch closely.</p>

<p>This is the symplectic integrator which generates a perfect circle slightly
off-center in just a few simple shift/add operations, first described by
Minsky in HAKMEM 149.</p>

<p>Excerpt of Verilog code for generating the horizontal sine offset</p>


<h2 id="plane-checkerboard">Plane checkerboard</h2>

<p>To do the checkerboard, I do a perspective transform of the screen <span data-katex="">x,y</span>
coordinates onto the plane&#39;s coordinate system (which I will call <span data-katex="">u,v</span>). I use
the convention that the plane is parallel to the <span data-katex="">xz</span>-plane at a height of
<span data-katex="">y_p</span>.</p>

<p>I project a ray from the screen until it hits the plane, then recover the <span data-katex="">u,v</span>
coordinate hit. I actually want <span data-katex="">v</span> and <span data-katex="">\frac{du}{dx}</span> particularly, as they
are constants on each line when looking directly toward the <span data-katex="">z</span> axis.
<span data-katex="">\frac{du}{dx}</span> gives a fixed value to add to <span data-katex="">u</span> each clock cycle and I don&#39;t
need to do any complex math per pixel, and can just multiply that by half the
screen width to get <span data-katex="">u_0</span> at the left side of the screen.</p>

<p>A ray starts at the origin at <span data-katex="">t=0</span> and has 3D coordinates <span data-katex="">(xt,yt,t)</span>,
intersecting the plane when <span data-katex="">yt = y_p</span> for a plane height <span data-katex="">y_p</span>. Therefore
<span data-katex="">t=\frac{y_p}{y}</span>.</p>

<p>The <span data-katex="">(u,v)</span> coordinates of the plane are the <span data-katex="">x</span> and <span data-katex="">z</span> coordinates at the
intersection point, <span data-katex="">(u,v) = (xt, t) = (\frac{x y_p}{y}, \frac{y_p}{y})</span>.
Clearly, <span data-katex="">\frac{du}{dx}</span> is again just <span data-katex="">\frac{y_p}{y}</span>, so this expression is
the only thing that needs computing.</p>

<p>So I needed to pick an appropriate plane height scale <span data-katex="">y_p</span> that gives a field
of view that looks good and that I can easily divide by <span data-katex="">y</span> in hardware.
I also add an offset <span data-katex="">y_0</span> to <span data-katex="">y</span> to move the camera &#34;down&#34; a bit and also to
avoid dividing by 0 (and I don&#39;t render the plane when <span data-katex=""> y &lt; y_0 </span>).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an early mockup in a Jupyter notebook I did working out the math for
this, trying to get sensible fixed point value ranges (i.e., number of bits I
needed to use in Verilog):</p>

<p>This means we will either need to create a lookup table for each scanline, or
actually implement a division algorithm; I tried both, and implementing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Non-restoring_division" target="_blank">non-restoring
division</a>
is smaller.</p>

<p>Sixteen clocks before the end of each scanline, <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-vgademo/blob/main/src/recip16.v" target="_blank">the recip16
module</a> gets a
<code>start</code> signal and begins dividing 65536 by the screen <span data-katex="">y</span> coordinate. This
yields a fixed point number we can use to scale the <span data-katex="">u</span> coordinate, and it also
gives the <span data-katex="">v</span> coordinate.</p>

<p>6-bit RGB rainbow checkerboard generator</p>


<p>It&#39;s subtle, but the kick drum in the song adds to the plane <span data-katex="">y_0</span> offset, so
you can see it &#34;jumping&#34; on every drum hit. And at certain points in the song,
random checkers start lighting up, before finally turning white in diagonal
stripes to the beat, panning the <code>plane_y</code> starting coordinate all the way to
the top of the screen, turning the entire screen white before fading to black
and looping.</p>

<h3 id="shadows">Shadows</h3>

<p>When drawing the plane, it also renders the scroll text, except using the
projected <span data-katex="">(u,v)</span> coordinates instead of the screen <span data-katex="">(x,y)</span> so that the shadow
of the text is projected onto the plane. However, as I mentioned above, the sine
wave is generated by rotating vectors each pixel and so there isn&#39;t random
access to <span data-katex="">\sin(u)</span> -- so instead of using the correct scroll height from the projected <span data-katex="">u</span>,
it uses whatever sine is currently available. This shortcut means the shadow
isn&#39;t really accurate, but it&#39;s good enough.</p>

<h2 id="starfield">Starfield</h2>

<p>To do the horizontal scrolling starfield, I essentially needed a constant random
number sequence per scanline, so naturally I used an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register" target="_blank">LFSR</a> that resets
at the top of the screen and updates at the start of each row; then bits of the
LFSR state are used to specify a star&#39;s horizontal offset and speed, and then
the global frame counter is added on, multiplied by speed. The stars also have
longer streaks in time with the snare drum in the music track.</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>Keeping in mind the constraints on how data is stored, and using some simple
music composition ideas, I decided to structure each section of music in an
&#34;ABAC&#34; pattern (or ABACABAD). This works well with our logic gate based
encoding: The reduced logic will have something like &#34;if measure bit 0 is 0,
then use pattern A&#34;. And B is just a variation of A, so it can find a lot of
redundancies, etc.</p>

<h3 id="synthesizer">Synthesizer</h3>

<p>I also needed some very simple-to-code instruments; a square wave arpeggio was a
given for this genre of intro, but for percussion I wanted to generate a nice
sounding kick drum and I settled on using a triangle wave synthesizer with an
exponentially decaying frequency. Then I could multiplex a smooth bassline with
the kick drum -- after the kick drum decays, just set the frequency back to the
current bassline. For a hihat/snare, add some LFSR noise modulated by an
exponential envelope for a hihat/snare kind of sound.</p>

<p>All the instruments were initially mocked up in a Jupyter notebook, as I tried
to find efficient ways to generate triangle-based kick drums, etc.</p>

<p>There are three total channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>noise w/ exponential envelope (snare)</li>
<li>square wave with two-note arpeggio, exponential envelope (chords/melody).</li>
<li>constant-volume triangle w/ exponential pitch decay (kick)</li>
</ul>

<p>Exponential envelopes are simply implemented as right-shift counters, where
volume 0 is full volume and every few ticks that counter increments, and then
the final sample is right shifted by the volume.</p>

<p>As much as possible, I avoided storing state in registers (flipflops are
expensive, see above), and tried to make the music driven by a combinatorial
logic chain from a simple song position counter. So there is no register for the
pulse frequency increment; that&#39;s purely derived from the song position. The
triangle synth does need one, though, in order to implement the kick
exponential.</p>

<p>This led to a lot of off-by-one errors developing the code, as triggers are
defined for updating envelopes for the next song position, but the notes for the
pulse channel are already set for the current position, etc. Eventually I sorted
them all out though it does make the code quite confusing to read, as various
counter values differ from the Python version and yet it sounds the same.</p>

<p>A simple trick I found: For the pulse synth, we can also just pick different
bits out of the per-sample accmulator to raise the pitch by octaves. I decided
to constrain it to a two-octave range.</p>

<h3 id="sigma-delta-dac">Sigma-delta DAC</h3>

<p>Instead of PWM, I did the simplest sigma-delta scheme I could think of:</p>

</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></pre>
<p>We add the (unsigned) audio sample to the accumulator every clock, and the pin
gets the carry. So if the audio sample is at 50% (0x8000), then we get a full
clock rate square wave, and if the output sample is 0x0001, we get a constant 0
with a single 1 pulse every 65536 clock cycles and conversely for 0xfffe, we get
a constant 1 with a single 0 pulse every 65536 cycles. In general it creates a
dense pulse train with no specific period.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the rising edges and falling edges happen at
different speeds on the Tiny Tapeout chip, which introduces a bit of harmonic
distortion.  I wasn&#39;t too worried about harmonic distortion in my
triangle/pulse/noise synth.</p>

<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>

<p>I took a lot of inspiration from a C64 SID tune called Crooner by Drax/Vibrants,
that then later was adapted for AdLib and I had <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/code/opl2/">made an AdLib OPL2 emulator for it</a>.
I decided to keep my tune very simple though, so there&#39;s no real melody, just
the same chord progression as Crooner in a repeating four bar pattern:</p>

<pre><code>| Am      | C       | D       | F   G   |
</code></pre>

<p>The D major isn&#39;t really in the Am/C scale (more of a secondary dominant) but
this meant there were a total of eight unique notes in the scale instead of the
usual seven: <code>C D E F F# G A B</code>, giving me a power of two-sized table of base
frequencies. This meant I could have a 3-bit wide table for notes, plus another
bit for octave, so each instrument has a total of 16 possible notes to play.</p>

<p>Using a two-note arpeggio is a departure from conventional three-note arpeggios
in most tracked music, but counting to 2 by slicing off a bit from the song tick
counter is easier than counting to 3 which would require an extra counter;
besides, the bass can play the root note of the chord and the melody can play
the thirds and fifths.</p>

<p>I also swung the tempo pretty strongly, swapping between 15 and 25 ticks per
beat which really improved the feel.</p>

<p>And then I literally wrote the song as a bunch of strings in Python, just typing
out the scale notes and using the # symbol for F#:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>snareA</span> <span>=</span> <span></span><span>&#39;</span><span>..x..xx...x..xx.</span><span>&#39;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>kickA</span>  <span>=</span> <span></span><span>&#39;</span><span>x...x...x...x...</span><span>&#39;</span>

<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>

<p>There are a few design choices I made that I regret after finishing this intro.</p>

<p>First, the audio track has a completely independent clock from the visual
component. A lot of classic chiptune music was constrained by using 50Hz or 60Hz
frame timers, limiting the available tempo choices. Additionally I didn&#39;t want
to tie my sample rate to the VGA horizontal frequency (31.5kHz) which would have
been a natural choice. Instead I used a 48MHz / 1024 clock divider (46875Hz) and
used a tick rate asynchronous from the VGA frequency, and then I could better
control tempo, etc.</p>

<p>This seemed like a good idea, except when I tried to do simple music-sync
effects. Now at any given point on the screen, the music can tick over,
resulting in &#34;tearing&#34;. There&#39;s a speckly checkerboard effect that&#39;s in sync
with the music, but it doesn&#39;t &#34;pop&#34; because it doesn&#39;t actually work correctly.
Additionally, the music loops about halfway through the last frame of the intro,
resulting in a checkerboard blinking in for half of a frame as some counter
overflows before it can be properly reset at the top of the next frame.</p>

<p>The 1220x480 video mode was also a huge mistake. In general, the people who can
test this design aren&#39;t going to do it on a CRT, so better to just sync up
properly with the LCD pixels and not rely on 90s era temporal dithering and CRT
smoothing.</p>



<p><video playsinline="" loop="" controls="" poster="/img/tt08-nyan.png"><source src="/img/tt08-nyan.mp4"/> <i>video unavailable</i></video></p>
<p>nyan.cat demo; in the actual design the musical intro only plays once, and then loops seamlessly as the sunglasses scroll off the screen.</p>

<p>A couple days before the Tiny Tapeout 8 deadline, <a href="https://urish.org/" target="_blank">Uri</a>
threw down a challenge in the Discord to make a Nyan Cat, and so I decided to
take everything I learned from making the TT08 intro and the donut and put
together a design using ripped art and music. I&#39;d reuse some code, avoid
previous mistakes, use 640x480 VGA, audio synced to video (31.5kHz sample rate,
60Hz tempo ticks), simpler dithering. Ideally, get it all to fit in one tile.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out the design I came up with worked and all the cells fit into
one tile -- but it was too crowded like that for detailed routing to
succeed. Without any workable ideas to cut down on space and without much time
left before the deadline, I just grew the design to two tiles and added a &#34;deal
with it&#34; sunglasses easter egg to consume some tiny portion of the expanded
space.</p>

</p><p>The layout. The red cells throughout the bottom half are actually just filler capacitors, essentially unused space. Alas, it didn&#39;t fit into one tile though.</p>

<h2 id="art">Art</h2>

<p>I started by grabbing the original animated .gif from <a href="https://nyan.cat" target="_blank">nyan.cat</a> and
wrote a <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-nyan/blob/main/scripts/extractcat.py" target="_blank">python
script</a> to
extract the individual frames, the palette, and generate a remapped data table
with all of the unique animation frames. I used a color picker to grab all the
original rainbow colors and background color, then converted them to their
closest match in RGB222 with a 2x2 dithering matrix.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/tt08-nyan-cat.gif" alt="original nyancat.gif"/></p>
<p>original nyan.cat .gif</p>


<p>The cat smoothly shifts back and forth in the original animation, so I reused
the sine wave generator code to give him a little <span data-katex="">x</span>-offset.</p>

<p>Originally there are little exploding stars/fireworks? scrolling by in the
background, but I didn&#39;t get around to emulating those. Instead I just reused
the <a href="#starfield">LFSR-based starfield</a> from the TT08 demo except without random
star speeds. This leads to extremely visible artifacts where the star positions
are obviously being right-shifted from one line to the next near the bottom of
the screen.</p>

<h2 id="music-1">Music</h2>

<p>I found a <a href="https://onlinesequencer.net/95410" target="_blank">MIDI rendition of the nyan.cat
song</a> and wrote yet <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-nyan/blob/main/scripts/ripmusic.py" target="_blank">another crappy Python
script</a> to
parse the MIDI, split out the melody and bass sections, remap note indices to a
minimal scale of notes (once again, only 8 notes are used in the scale), and
dump out tables that the Verilog code could read.</p>

<p>Then for kicks I added the kick drum (ha ha) to the bass track, same as the TT08
intro. I&#39;m pretty sure I just wrote the
<a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/tt08-nyan/blob/main/data/kicktrigger.hex" target="_blank">triggers</a>
for that out by hand; there wasn&#39;t time to create any fancy tools.</p>

<p>This has just two audio channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bass/kick, pure square wave this time</li>
<li>Melody, 25% duty cycle pulse wave to add timbre</li>
</ul>

<p>Both bass and melody use per-tick exponential decay envelopes, with each tick
occurring at the start of a video frame (so 60Hz). The kick drum takes over the
bass channel for a few frames, exponentially decreasing its frequency before
returning to the original bass pitch/envelope.</p>

<div>
<p>All notes use the same increment table, but octaves are shifted by changing the
phase bits used. The &#34;sqr&#34; channel is actually 25% duty cycle pulse, turning on
only when both of the 2 MSBs are on.</p>

<p>I also added a global low pass filter because the pulse melody was a bit
piercing. This turned out to dull the sound a lot more than I intended, though.</p>



<p>Tiny Tapeout 8 began manufacturing in September 2024, completing production of
wafers and dies. And then, in March 2025, we received the devastating news that
Efabless, the company supporting Tiny Tapeout, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tinytapeout_were-very-sad-to-hear-that-efabless-corporation-activity-7301638170297720832-n7Ru" target="_blank">abruptly shut
down</a>,
leaving its assets, which included mid-production TT08 and TT09 chips, in an
uncertain state. TT08 was just being packaged at the time of the shutdown.</p>

<p>This was kind of a crushing blow for me, since I had put so much effort into the
designs on this chip in particular. It also meant that the judging for the demo
competition was indefinitely on hold, as it required the physical hardware to be
delivered to the judges.</p>

<p>And then, out of nowhere, the <code>#tt08-silicon</code> channel showed up on the
Tiny Tapeout discord server in late September 2025. It seems the chips were
acquired by a new company and turned over to the Tiny Tapeout team. Soon after, this arrived at my doorstep:</p>

<p>In fact all of my designs worked perfectly -- except it turns out I had relaxed
the timing on the donut a bit in order to reduce gate area (lower clock rates
require lower drive strength which means smaller transistors), so the donut
needs to run at 45MHz instead of 48MHz to avoid some glitches.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was elated when I saw my designs running perfectly on my desk
after a long year of waiting and expecting the worst.</p>

<p>I was holding out on doing this writeup until the judges had definitively seen
the hardware running. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9BhSaqL7jg" target="_blank">bitluni showed them all off on a recent
livestream</a> with both LCD and CRTs,
so I figured it&#39;s finally time to post this.</p>

<p>Revisiting these designs over a year later, I had forgotten how involved they
were and how many intricacies I wanted to explain in this post.</p>

<p>I learned so many new low-level tricks building these demos and I have even
better tricks in store for the next one.</p>
