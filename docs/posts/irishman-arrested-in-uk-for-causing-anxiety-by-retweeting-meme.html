It appears on this occasion this has not happened.</p> <p>“This incident has highlighted a really topical issue which Hampshire Constabulary and other police forces need to learn from. In order to support this I will be writing to the College of Policing to make them aware of this incident and encourage greater clarification on the guidance in order to ensure that police forces can respond more appropriately in the future.”</p> <section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true">   </section> <p>Hampshire Constabulary said in a statement: “Officers were making inquiries following a report that an offensive image had been shared online.</p> <p>“They were investigating an alleged offence under Section 127 of the Communications Act (2003). As such, they attended an address in Aldershot in order to establish the exact circumstances around the social media post.</p> <p>“Following discussions, officers agreed to return to the address on July 28.</p> <p>“When officers arrived they were prevented from entering the address to discuss a potential resolution to the matter.</p> <p>“As a result, officers felt it was necessary to arrest a man at the scene so they could interview him in relation to the alleged offence.</p> <p>“A 51-year-old man from Aldershot was arrested on suspicion of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message or matter. He was released under investigation and now has been NFAd (no further action).</p> <p>“It is important to say that our officers come to work every day to protect the public.</p> <p>“They were acting in good faith after being deployed to investigate the report of an offensive image being shared online.</p> <p>“Policing reports in relation to online content is a complex and challenging picture.</p> <p>“We are engaging further with our police and crime commissioner to make sure that we deploy our resource in a way that reflects need in our local communities.</p> <p>“A 57-year-old man from Market Rasen, Lincs, was arrested on suspicion of obstructing/resisting a constable in execution of duty.</p> <p>“He was released under investigation, and our inquiries are ongoing. Due to this being a live investigation we cannot comment further.”</p> <p>The meme was originally posted by Laurence Fox, a 44-year-old actor turned campaigner, on social media.</p> <p>Mr Fox and Mr Miller run the Bad Law project which claims to “challenge and depoliticise” policing.</p> <p>Mr Brady had contacted them and they were present at his home when officers were there.</p> <p>Mr Fox had previously been embroiled in a war of words over the image, with Twitter temporarily freezing his account for violating their ‘hateful imagery’ policy.</p> <p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/irish-family-fears-health-dad-27635638?recirculation_test=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b>Irish family fears for health of dad jailed in Iraq amid plea for urgent talks with Taoiseach</b></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/four-month-old-irish-baby-27635761?recirculation_test=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b>Four-month-old Irish baby diagnosed with rare disorder after parents thought she had a cold</b></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/irish-shoppers-could-missing-out-27635357?recirculation_test=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b>Irish shoppers could be missing out on saving hundreds a year by not doing one thing</b></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/irish-showbiz/jedward-offer-host-big-brother-27636111?recirculation_test=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b>Jedward offer to host Big Brother after show&#39;s revival announced for 2023</b></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/ireland-weather-rain-batters-country-27634449?recirculation_test=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"><b>Ireland weather: Rain batters country as warning issued by Met Eireann but good news is coming</b></a></p></li> </ul> <p><b> <u> Get breaking news to your inbox by <a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/newsletter-preference-centre/" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section">signing up to our newsletter</a></u></b></p><!-- Article End--></div></div>
