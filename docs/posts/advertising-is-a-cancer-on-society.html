    <h1>Advertising Is a Cancer on Society</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><section><div id="content">

<p>
<i>(last update: 2019-10-02)</i>
</p>

<p>
I frequently say that advertising is a cancer on modern society. This view is met
with various reactions, including requests for a more detailed explanation. In this post,
I first explain why I believe the cancer analogy is apt, then continue with a nonexhaustive
list of observable symptoms of this disease, and end with some final thoughts. This post
is a living document, updated over time, and intended to be linked to.
</p>

<p>
(When I say &#34;advertising&#34;, I use this term somewhat loosely; this text applies not
just to the advertising material presented to customers, but to the broader process surrounding
its creation as well, which is more correctly referred to via a bunch of buzzwords
grouped under the term &#34;marketing&#34;.)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org33f1891">
<h2 id="org33f1891">Advertising as cancer</h2>
<div id="text-org33f1891">
<p>
Cancer is a family of diseases sharing some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer">common characteristics</a>. Cancer cells abandon their
normal cooperative role in a body, and instead start to replicate uncontrollably, engaging
in complex behaviors not just to avoid getting killed off by immune system, but to actually
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"><b>convince</b> the body</a> to give them access to more and more resources.
</p>

<p>
Advertising as currently practiced shares these characteristics. It&#39;s a malignant mutation of an idea
that efficient markets need a way to connect goods and services with people wanting to buy them.
Limited to honestly informing people about what&#39;s available on the market, it can serve
a crucial function in enabling trade. In the real world however, it&#39;s moved way past that role.
</p>

<p>
Real world advertising is not about informing, it&#39;s about convincing. Over time, it became
increasingly manipulative and dishonest. It also became more effective. In the process, it grew
to consume a significant amount of resources of every company on the planet. It infected every
communication medium in existence, both digital and analog. It shapes every product and service
you touch, and it affects your interactions with everyone who isn&#39;t your close friend
or family member. Through all that, it actively destroys trust in people and institutions alike,
and corrupts the decision-making process in any market transaction. It became a legitimized form
of industrial-scale psychological abuse, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/nobody-is-immune-to-ads-7142a4245c2c">and there&#39;s no way you can resist its impact</a>.
</p>

<p>
The growth of advertising is fueled by the enormous waste it creates. In any somewhat
saturated market - which, today, is most of them - any effort you spent on advertising serves
primarily to counteract the combined advertising efforts of your competitors. The same results
could be achieved if every market player limited themselves to just informing customers about
their goods and services. This, unfortunately, is impossible for humanity, and so we end up
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum game</a> instead (or really negative-sum, if you count the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a>). If you have
competitors, <a href="https://birdsite.link/@matthew_d_green/102731799491877657">you can&#39;t not participate</a>.
</p>

<p>
Tallying up: uncontrolled growth? Check. Destructive consequences? Check. Hard to kill?
Check. Co-opts resources? Check. Advertising has the characteristics of cancer.

The obvious one and a hot topic now. Adtech industry is solely responsible for creating and
deploying the most advanced surveillance system ever seen in history. Something far beyond
even the wildest dreams of the Stasi, NSA, or Orwell himself. The infrastructure is ready
and works today. You interact with it every time you go on-line, and increasingly off-line
as well. From <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleLee/status/862307447276544000/photo/1">being subject to face recognition when going for a pizza</a>, through
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bose-lawsuit-idUSKBN17L2BT">your headphones recording and sending out what you listen to</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20183968">your phone telling on you as you walk through the mall</a>,
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/how-your-smart-tv-is-keeping-track-of-more-than-what-youre-watching/">your TV knowing about what&#39;s going on in your house</a>, to <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/who-owns-the-data-your-car-collects/">your car spying on you as you drive</a>,
it&#39;s almost impossible to escape being surveilled now.  There&#39;s really <b>nothing</b> stopping
any government from tapping into this total surveillance infrastructure other than lack of will.
All they need to do is ask, and while your country may not care today, it might start after the
next terror attack (or news-about-terror induced panic).
</p>

<p>
(Ironically, what governments currently do is sell private data <b>to</b> advertisers. For instance, if
you live in the US and drive a car, there&#39;s a good chance your data was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20438289">sold by your state&#39;s DMV</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Adtech industry is getting ever more creative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercookie">Evercookies</a> are now considered ancient technology;
apparently even fingerprinting factory sensor calibration <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20064961">is old-school</a>.
</p>

<p>
See also <a href="https://lockwood.dev/advertising/2019/06/14/adtech-sucks-this-time-its-personal-ids.html#fnref">this</a>, if you are wondering exactly what does the adtech industry do with all the data
it collects, how does it do it and why. Spoiler alert: all the data is being continuously
traded in order to cross-correlate it, ensuring no matter what steps you make to protect
your privacy, advertisers can recover the data they need. It also allows the advertisers
to scam each other on attribution, which isn&#39;t surprising if you consider that lying is <i>literally</i>
their job. Cancer cells don&#39;t play well with each other unless they have to.

I&#39;m making this into a separate headline because this is some of the most sensitive

<p>
Did you know that popular apps used by women to track their periods
<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/long-read/3196/no-bodys-business-mine-how-menstruation-apps-are-sharing-your-data">spy on them and send the data off to advertisers</a>, who then use it to target both app users and
their partners? This data is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20923895">surprisingly valuable</a>, at least for those with no dignity.
</p>

<p>
Mental health issues still have social stigma attached in the western world. For a person
seeking help in such a case, privacy is extremely important. Unfortunately, that privacy
is sometimes discarded in exchange for advertising revenue. A <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3194/privacy-international-study-shows-your-mental-health-sale">recent investigation</a> into
popular mental health websites in France, Germany and the UK revealed that most of them
track visitors for advertising purposes, some even sharing mental health test answers
with third parties.

Slight annoyance in the EU (slightly bigger if you run a business), makes phones near-useless
for receiving calls in the US. Some of the calls are pure fraud, others - those made
by otherwise reputable companies - are just attempts at selling you something you don&#39;t
need for the price that usually isn&#39;t fair. If you ever had your parents or grandparents
spend a big chunk of their income or pension on some low-quality trinket, you know who to thank.
</p>

<p>
Here&#39;s <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@dredmorbius/102404468325136055">a decent argument</a> that advertising may ultimately kill phones as a service.

<h3 id="orge9efce4">Spam</h3>
<p>
Mostly handled today through filters built into every mail service, but a pure example
of what happens when advertising is near-free. Similarly to robocalls, it severely diminished
the utility of e-mail as a service, driving people towards walled-in social networks, where
spam is easier to control (mostly through directing advertisers to different channels).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6e4007f">
<h3 id="org6e4007f">Leaflets, snail mail spam</h3>
<p>
It&#39;s an off-line equivalent to spam, except you have to move them to the
garbage bin yourself - and a lot of people can&#39;t even be bothered to do that,
so <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Flyers_sobe_2.jpg">they litter cities everywhere</a>. It&#39;s a pure and unadulterated waste of
paper, paint and fuel, made in the hope that one in a thousand will convince
someone to maybe think about buying something.

<p>
SEO, AKA. gaming the search engines. Hugely popular. Often involves creating nonsense sites,
and spamming websites and web forums with comments. It pollutes search results for more
obscure queries, generally wasting people&#39;s time.
</p>

<p>
I used to run comments on this blog, and had my fair share of run-ins with SEO spammers.
I sometimes traced back the companies that were promoted in such way and contacted them with
requests to please stop spamming the Internet. It turned out that some of them didn&#39;t know
that the SEO agencies they hired engaged in comment spam (in one of those cases, upon me
contacting them the business apologized and immediately dropped their contact with their SEO agency;

<div id="outline-container-org0d4d9cf">
<h3 id="org0d4d9cf">Exploiting children</h3>
<div id="text-org0d4d9cf">
<p>
Children usually don&#39;t have money, but they are easy to manipulate and do have the undivided attention of
their parents. A classical tactic is to <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@temporal/102258241583566636">drop a child-targeted ad in between episodes of a children&#39;s show</a>,
and watch the money flow in. But that&#39;s old-school now. Nowadays, both TV and streaming services
are full of content that mix branding and entertainment, and <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/03/22/youtube-toy-unboxing-advertising-children-lawsuit/">unboxing videos</a> are the new way
of working around the laws protecting children from advertising around the world. Ads don&#39;t stop there
either, they&#39;re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/style/kids-study-apps-advertising.html">in almost every popular mobile app for kids</a>.
</p>

<p>
Also, the sophisticated adtech personalization algorithms, like always, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44448936">screw things up</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is why my kid isn&#39;t going to watch YouTube. If and when we decide to show her any children&#39;s show,
it&#39;ll be from a manually curated set of videos <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">downloaded</a> and streamed from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a>. In my opinion,
it&#39;s irresponsible to expose children to modern advertising.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge0c52af">
<h3 id="orge0c52af">Lack of taste</h3>
<p>
This is a pet peeve. As (of 2019) a fresh father, I&#39;ve recently been exposed to a lot of advertising
for infant care products. I can survive free samples of gunk of dubious utility given to us at every
possible occasion. But when I received the &#34;child health book&#34; - <b>an official medical document</b> in which
health information is recorded over the years - I was floored when I noticed it had multiple full-page
ads in it. This is a document that is provided by publicly-funded hospitals. A document that
will likely outlive all the companies advertising in it. This is what the ad industry jumping the shark
looks like.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1b62037">
<h3 id="org1b62037">Brand-awareness</h3>
<div id="text-org1b62037">
<p>
Almost everybody on the planet knows about Coca Cola and McDonald&#39;s. A good chunk of the population
has tasted both. So why do both companies still spend <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/286541/mcdonald-s-advertising-spending-worldwide/">hundreds of millions</a> to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081315/look-cocacolas-advertising-expenses.asp">billions of dollars</a> on
ads that they know aren&#39;t going to convince you to drop everything you do and buy their products?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness">Brand awareness</a>. The goal here is to force an association between a product category and a brand,
so that when you are considering buying a product from that category, their brand will be the
one on your mind, and the one you feel safest buying.
</p>

<p>
Brand awareness competes for very limited real estate in your brain, so when you have
multiple brands competing, the end result is saturation bombing. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t walk
500 meters straight in a typical western city without seeing a Coca Cola logo somewhere.

which unfortunately some morally bankrupt companies seem to use as a cookbook. It&#39;s an unfortunate feature
of a reality in which advertising has perverted the marketplace to the point it&#39;s very difficult to
compete by just offering a good product at a fair price.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1f3b80a">
<h3 id="org1f3b80a">Advertising-induced design problems</h3>
<div id="text-org1f3b80a">
<p>
The consequence of long-term exposure to dark patterns is that people develop immunity, which sometimes
claims benign or beneficial use cases as collateral damage. See for example this article about
<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/icons-avoid-temptation-and-start-with-user-needs">redesign of UK&#39;s National Health Service website</a>, where boxes containing important health-related
information were found to be ignored by users:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To our astonishment, a number of users said that they wouldn’t read the
information in the boxes. They likened them to advertising on news sites and
overlooked them because of the ambiguity of the icon and the ‘READ ME!!!’
look.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Measures to combat web spam (i.e. advertisers doing their daily job) also at times
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20058697">conflict with accessibility</a>, causing websites to be unusable for people utilizing screen readers.

<div id="outline-container-org581716e">
<h3 id="org581716e">Malware and computing resource exhaustion</h3>
<div id="text-org581716e">
<p>
There are three main reasons people install ad blockers. Dislike of ads, preventing privacy
incursions, and protecting your own computer from malware and unwanted software that eats
up its resources.
</p>

<p>
If you haven&#39;t read the excellent essay by Maciej Ceglowski, <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">The Website Obesity Crisis</a>, take a break
now and hop over. Maciej is a much better writer than me, and gives an excellent explanation of why
all the websites you visit load so slowly and eat so much of your mobile data allowance. Spoiler alert:
ads are a big part of the problem.
</p>

<p>
As for malware, the technical term is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising">malvertising</a>. Given how ad delivery works today - auctions
triggered by your browsing, determining what ad you&#39;ll be shown next, almost entirely outside
of control of the site that you&#39;re visiting, the old wisdom of &#34;don&#39;t visit porn sites or you&#39;ll get malware&#34;
doesn&#39;t hold anymore. You can catch malware on almost any site that shows you ads now.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf1538a6">
<h3 id="orgf1538a6">Flooding the Internet with garbage content</h3>
<p>
This includes things affectionately known as &#34;blog spam&#34; or &#34;content marketing&#34;. Quite likely
the majority of articles regular people read on-line and share on social media. In its least
harmful form, it just wastes your time, providing you with very little actionable information
padded with some prose. I&#39;ve seen first-hand how much work goes into making such material:
very little, mostly copy-pasting and rewording someone else&#39;s blog spam. The more dangerous incarnations
are purposeful misinformation. Bottom line, this content doesn&#39;t exist to help you - it exists
as a vector for delivering more advertising to you, either inline or through the site it&#39;s hosted on.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1c8fc8">
<h3 id="orgc1c8fc8">Native advertising</h3>
<p>
Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising">defined</a> as advertising &#34;that matches the form and function of the platform upon which it appears&#34;,
it&#39;s marketing code for &#34;disguising an ad as legitimate content&#34;. While unmarked ads are technically illegal
in many places, ask yourself, <i>how can you tell</i> that the article you recently read mentioning a company
was honest, and not sponsored content? It ain&#39;t trivial.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0ec9fc2">
<h3 id="org0ec9fc2">Influencers</h3>
<div id="text-org0ec9fc2">
<p>
AKA. people selling themselves out on the Internet. The whole idea is to subvert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">social proof</a> by finding
people others can relate to and getting them to indirectly push products. Hugely popular on YouTube
and Instagram, and is again preying on people having trouble distinguishing fake from genuine.
At this level of sophistication, aren&#39;t we all such people, at some point? When you look at that
newest Facebook photo of a family member, are they really that bad at cleaning kitchen they
leave bags of expensive coffee out in the open, or are they a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/business/media/nanoinfluencers-instagram-influencers.html">nanoinfluencer</a>?
</p>

<p>
I can&#39;t stress enough how bad this is. In a world drowned in manipulative advertising, your circle
of friends and colleagues you know personally is your last source of trustworthy recommendations.
Sure, there were bad apples before - like people who join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing">MLM cults</a> - but they were obnoxious
enough to easily be spotted. But in general, you could trust the direct and indirect advice
of people in your social circle. &#34;Influencing&#34; is an ongoing attempt to poison that.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3996d45">
<h3 id="org3996d45">Billboards</h3>
<p>
They pollute our landscape and distract drivers. To my surprise, the studies I&#39;ve seen so far (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411179/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457515301664">2</a>)
conclude that billboards aren&#39;t usually a safety issue, even though they measurably capture
the attention of drivers. Still, I think everyone who like me regularly travels outside the city
can attest that the experience would be better without them.

Have you noticed how many free services get significantly worse over time? <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20525136">Have you noticed</a>

posts from your social network, whereas today they mostly show sponsored content and posts
from businesses?
</p>

<p>
Ad-driven business models win users over by offering a service for free, but in order to grow,
that service needs to continuously increase the amount of advertising and tracking it does.
Few of such services stay alive for long (usually thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>), but all
of them prevent companies with more ethical and stable business models from entering the market by
sucking up all the available oxygen. You can&#39;t compete on price with free, doubly so in an era
where ad-driven businesses are what the investors prefer.

Marketing these days seems to have so good ROI that, given a fixed sum of money,
you&#39;re better off spending it on shouting louder than on actually improving the product.
This reduces research, development and production spending, which indirectly reduces the actual value provided
to all of us by the economy.

(h/t <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/ckm9jk/advertising_is_a_cancer_on_society/evqcu2d/">u/slippage for reminding me of that</a>. I think everyone working in the software industry can relate.)

<p>
With all the cries that free content must be paid for somehow, you&#39;d expect that you can avoid
&#34;being the product&#34; if you pay the full price for a product or service. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. Movie theaters will still spam you with ads even though you paid for the ticket
and bought the popcorn. Newspapers will show you ads, whether or not you&#39;re a paying subscriber
(and they won&#39;t filter out native advertising content either). SaaS companies charge your credit
card with one hand, and sell your data with the other. Even your <a href="https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/new-dpia-on-microsoft-office-and-windows-software-still-privacy-risks-remaining-short-blog/">Office suite spies on you</a> (at least
the web and mobile versions do), and gives your data to a predictive profiling marketing firm.
</p>

<p>
This is a cultural problem. We&#39;ve become so accustomed to advertising that not having it shoved
in our face is a premium service that needs to be explicitly requested, and is rarely available.

Cancers ultimately damage critical functions of the body and lead to untimely death. Advertising,
similarly, poses a risk to our civilization through resource exhaustion, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925517303505">climate impact</a>, and by eroding the
basic building block of societies - trust in one another, and trust in institutions we deal with.
What can be done about it?
</p>

<p>
I honestly have no good ideas. Advertising is so thoroughly embedded in our economies that trying
to &#34;just&#34; get rid of it would probably collapse our civilization (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20447671">which is NOT a good thing</a>; I&#39;ll

which supports extensions). Add <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a> for good measure. Consider <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> if you&#39;re
particularly annoyed by the website obesity crisis. If you have non-tech-savvy friends and family,
install uBlock Origin on their machines too - that&#39;ll let them extend the usable lifetime of their
computers by a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://adnauseam.io/">AdNauseam</a> is an interesting extension to consider too. It&#39;s based off uBlock Origin, except it
clicks on the ads in the background, in an attempt to make advertising more expensive and poison
the data they collect. Given the level of sophistication of fake click detection, it&#39;s unlikely to
make much difference, but &#34;every small step counts&#34;, plus it also feels satisfying.
</p>

<p>
If you&#39;re willing to put up with some extra inconvenience on-line in order to both protect
yourself from advertisers and safeguard your privacy, consider using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">GNU IceCat</a> as your main
browser. It&#39;s a Firefox variant with extra features aiming to defeat tracking and reduce
exposure to <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">ethically questionable software</a>.

<h3 id="org92e5faf">GDPR</h3>
<div id="text-org92e5faf">
<p>
GDPR is doing an excellent job destroying some of the most privacy-invasive practices of the
adtech industry. It offers a great opportunity for individual meaningful action. If you&#39;re
an European and see a site trying to abuse you in a way that&#39;s illegal, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/redress/what-should-i-do-if-i-think-my-personal-data-protection-rights-havent-been-respected_en">file a complaint</a>.
If you&#39;re not an EU citizen, lobby your government to enact similar legislation. The movements
around this are gaining steam worldwide.
</p>

<p>
Some people point out that <a href="https://cliqz.com/en/magazine/study-google-is-the-biggest-beneficiary-of-the-gdpr">Google benefited the most</a> from GDPR, and more legislation like it would
only make life even more difficult for innovative adtech upstarts, benefiting the large incumbents
instead. But this might actually be a <b>good thing</b> - we don&#39;t need more innovation in that market,
we need that market to wither and die. It&#39;s also easier for regulators to keep few larger companies
in line than it is to deal with a convoluted network of fly-by-night adtech startups.
</p>

<p>
(See also an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">argument by Richard Stallman</a> that GDPR and similar legislation aren&#39;t nearly enough,
and one should aim to prevent data collection from happening in the first place. This is related
to the concept of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html">Datensparsamkeit</a>, or &#34;data frugality&#34;.)
</p>

<p>
GDPR is primarily about control over data, not about advertising. But it&#39;s also important to push
for legislation targeting advertisers directly. São Paulo is among many cities that have managed
to <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/clean-city-law-secrets-sao-paulo-uncovered-outdoor-advertising-ban/">ban outdoor advertising</a>, demonstrating it&#39;s both possible and worthwhile.

<h3 id="orgb43df94">Fair business practices</h3>
<p>
Businesses are made of people, and people have ethics. If you&#39;re running one, consider the way you advertise.
Are you aiming at making mutually beneficial transactions, or are you just trying to milk
you users out of their hard-earned cash? Not all advertising is inherently harmful to individuals
or society. Choose the ethical option. It may cost your company some lost profits, but then again,
you may gain loyal customers who&#39;ll want to reward a honest business.

<div id="outline-container-org22323f9">
<h3 id="org22323f9">Refuse to do business with companies behaving abusively</h3>
<div id="text-org22323f9">
<p>
Also known as &#34;voting with your wallet&#34;. Out of set of options, pick the more honest one.
If you have a moment, tell the others why you didn&#39;t choose them.
</p>

<p>
Once again, businesses are made of people. Out of those that engage in abusive or harmful marketing,
not all have ill intent. These days, &#34;dark patterns&#34; are essentially forced upon
companies by competitive markets, and it&#39;s hard to resist. But maybe, just maybe, enough complaints
from real would-be customers will cause some of them to change their ways.

<div id="outline-container-orgd20cff5">
<h3 id="orgd20cff5">Refuse to work on adtech</h3>
<p>
This applies to technologists out here - we&#39;re in a privileged position, where it&#39;s much easier
for us to be picky about the jobs we do than for most other people. Many of us already make
principled stances like refusing to work on defense projects; why not also avoid helping the
industry that harms people during peace time much more than defense companies?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7f50f2d">
<h3 id="org7f50f2d">Don&#39;t lose hope</h3>
<p>
There&#39;s light at the end of this tunnel (and it&#39;s not the incoming train).
A <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah">recent article by the EFF</a> reminds us of pop-up ads which, once the menace of the Internet, have
all but disappeared. The advertising industry is laser-focused on methods that manipulate people best.
If a technique stops working, e.g. because of legal, social or technical interference, it&#39;s
immediately abandoned. This means that advertising can be fought off piece by piece. It&#39;s hard,
but possible.

<div id="outline-container-org1c8ea39">
<h3 id="org1c8ea39">Raise awareness</h3>
<p>
All of the suggestions above scale with the number of people who follow them. The more of us
rise against advertising, the stronger the market, social and political signals become.
So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)">if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek</a>, then I ask you
to spread the message. Speak up about the cancerous nature of advertising, and how better off we all
would be if that disease was cured.
