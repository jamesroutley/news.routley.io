    <h1>Where has the passive radar code gone?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This really sucks to say after putting so much effort into it, but for regulatory reasons that have just come to light we’ve had to remove the open source passive radar code that we previously provided.</p>
<p>We’re currently consulting with legal experts to see in what capacity we can re-release it, if at all, but unfortunately it’s not looking good. At the moment because this is all stuff for lawyers and not us technical people to figure out we can’t say much more. Once we have concrete information on what’s happening we’ll put out an official update, but this could take months to figure out.</p>
<p>If we end up in a situation were we can’t legally provide passive radar code anymore we’ll accept returns of the device on any customers who ordered specifically for experimenting with the passive radar code that we advertised.</p>
