    <h1>Another Round of Layoffs at Meta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta’s next big round of layoffs are coming.</p><p>From the newest edition of my <em>Command Line</em> newsletter, which just hit inboxes for paid subscribers: </p><p>Meta is planning another round of layoffs, I can unfortunately confirm. Leadership has been coy both internally and externally about what is coming, but I’m told that the current plan is to announce more cuts in March after last year’s performance bonuses are paid out. Given what I’ve heard about plans to cut certain orgs by double-digit percentages, I wouldn’t be surprised if the total number is somewhere in the ballpark of the last layoff, which was about 11,000 people or 13 percent of the company.</p><br/></div></div>
