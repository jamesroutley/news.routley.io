<p>Rumours concerning <a href="http://club386.com/tag/tsmc/">TSMC’s </a>and Apple’s close relationship continue to bubble up in Taiwanese media. A freshly-baked industry-sourced confection, from broadcaster <a href="https://www.ttv.com.tw/">TTV</a>, suggests that both AMD and Qualcomm are now so fed up with TSMC’s purported “Apple-first” policy that they have decided to transition their businesses to Samsung Foundry services for 3nm.  </p>
<p>The Taiwanese media report characterises the battle for advanced semiconductor processes as “fierce,” and the ongoing tussle for capacity has led to a significant rupture, meaning that long-time TSMC customers <a href="http://club386.com/tag/amd/">AMD </a>and Qualcomm will become the first major customers of <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-foundry-innovations-power-the-future-of-big-data-ai-ml-and-smart-connected-devices">Samsung’s 3nm process</a>. Samsung is expected to have its first-gen 3nm process ready for mass production in H1 next year, but we won’t see flagship processors from them until 2023, according to the report.</p>

<p>Keeping the TSMC N3 production lines busy will be Apple’s significant orders, as the Cupertino steamroller shows little signs of slowing down. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023">Nikkei Asia</a> news says that Apple will need TSMC’s skills more than ever in the coming few years due to the launch of its own-designed custom 5G modem chip. In 2022, <a href="http://club386.com/tag/apple/">Apple </a>will start getting the modem fabricated on TSMC N4, but will transition to N3 for this and its A/M SoCs in 2023.</p>
<p>Neither Apple nor TSMC have commented on the TTV/ Nikkei Asia reports.</p>
