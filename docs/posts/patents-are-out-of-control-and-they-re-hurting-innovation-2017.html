<p>Every Tuesday morning, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues thousands of patents. Many of these patents contain dozens or even hundreds of separate claims, and every one of these claims is like a new federal regulation governing private conduct. This is because any company or individual that creates a product or service described by one of these claims might be liable for damages or subject to an injunction.</p>

<blockquote><p>The vast majority of patent cases do not involve copying or free riding.</p></blockquote>

<p>The USPTO <a rel="noopener" href="https://writtendescription.blogspot.com/2014/11/frakes-wasserman-on-time-crunched.html" target="_blank">does not have the time</a> or <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/why-patent-office-so-bad-reviewing-software-patents" target="_blank">the tools</a> to adequately review patent applications. Patents are supposed to be novel and non-obvious compared to the “prior art” — that is, evidence of the state of the art at the time the patent application was filed. The universe of potential prior art is <em>enormous</em>. It includes earlier patents, academic publications, and all products available for sale in the United States. Much of this prior art, especially in software, cannot be easily found in indexed databases and is difficult to precisely date. A patent examiner is given about 18 hours to review a typical patent application, and only some of that time is spent searching for prior art.</p>





<blockquote><p>When it comes to determining patent validity, the USPTO is little better than a coin toss.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Federal Circuit’s pro-patent bias, especially under <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/5/27/5753866/the-real-problem-with-the-federal-circuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Chief Judge Randall Rader</a>, led some scholars to compare it to a <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2014/09/08/eli-dourado/true-story-how-patent-bar-captured-court-shrank-intellectual-commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“captured” agency</a>: a regulator that has become captured by the interests that it is supposed to be regulating. Indeed, the patent system has many of the features that lead to creeping regulation in other contexts, such as large benefits accruing to narrow interests but with costs that are widely dispersed. In the patent context, this creeping overregulation takes the form of tens of thousands of low quality patents. One researcher <a href="http://www.vjolt.net/vol18/issue1/v18i1_1-Miller.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that, for software-related inventions, about 50 percent of patents are likely invalid, even under the existing permissive standards for validity. This means that, when it comes to determining patent validity, the USPTO is little better than a coin toss. Imagine if the FDA or EPA had such a low level of accuracy.</p>
