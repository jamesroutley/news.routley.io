    <h1>Show HN: Rqbit â€“ bittorent CLI and desktop app written in Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p><strong>rqbit</strong> is a torrent client written in Rust, available as a CLI, HTTP API and a desktop app (Windows and OSX).</p>
<p><strong>v4.0.0</strong> has several new major features since the last stable release.</p>
<h2>Major feature: desktop app</h2>
<p>Rqbit now has a desktop app! Thanks to <a href="https://tauri.app/" rel="nofollow">Tauri</a> it was extremely easy to build on top of existing components.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/assets/221386/daaedce4-9711-4646-b36a-76b06018f0fb"><img width="1104" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 12 49 33" src="https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/assets/221386/daaedce4-9711-4646-b36a-76b06018f0fb"/></a></p>
<h2>Major feature: controllable torrent states</h2>
<p>Previously, (lib)rqbit only could download a torrent forever. With 4.0.0 you can pause, unpause, and delete torrents. All of this is available through HTTP API, Web UI and in the desktop app, and of course in <a href="https://docs.rs/librqbit/latest/librqbit/" rel="nofollow">librqbit</a>.</p>
<h2>Major feature: session persistence</h2>
<p>Rqbit now can remember the state it was in and restore from it on restart. This is the default when running <code>rqbit server start</code> or in the desktop app. <code>rqbit download</code> doesn&#39;t persist the session state.</p>
<h2>Other notable changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added armv7 build</li>
<li>You can now configure &#34;RUST_LOG&#34; through HTTP API</li>
<li>A lot of internal refactoring and internal features. If you used the library before, there will be breaking changes, but all should be easy to fix.</li>
<li>The HTTP server that starts with &#34;rqbit download&#34; is now read-only. It also doesn&#39;t have persistence. To have a server that allows to upload/pause torrents etc, you need to run &#34;rqbit server start&#34;</li>
</ul>
