    <p>I frequently get caught up in shiny new tools and switching between them. Things like photo management apps, personal wiki software, text editor plugins, etc. At times I feel like I’m spending more time building the perfect workshop than building anything in the workshop itself.</p>

<p>I’d like to spend less time tinkering with tools and more time using my tools to be creative and build fun things. As such, I’ve been trying a couple of new practices over the last year or so to break the cycle of adopting new tools and migrating between them.</p>

<p>The first is simply writing a log for any potential migrations from one tool to another. I try to include details about what’s been frustrating me with the previous tool and what tempts me to try the new tool. Writing this out serves not only as a snapshot of my thoughts that I can refer back to later, but also a means of critically thinking about why it may or may not be worth investing time into committing to a change. I’ve had a couple of situations where this step has helped me land on “nope, my existing tooling is more than fine, this isn’t worth it.” It’s a mechanism that slows me down a bit, allowing me to stretch the consideration phase out over a few days rather than making an impulsive switch and, usually, a resulting mess.</p>

<p>If I decide to go through with a tool change, I’ll also include a log of what steps I took to perform the migration, any hiccups along the way, and log of how I’m feeling about things a few days/weeks after the migration. The intention is to capture the information that a future iteration of myself will look back at and remember things like “oh wow, switching to this tool was really difficult, I should think carefully before trying to casually switch off of it.”</p>

<p>Once I do perform a tool migration, I try to set a “lease period,” meaning I pinky swear to myself that I won’t even think about switching to another tool for at least X amount of time. For any migrations of my personal wiki software, as an example, I’ve gone with at least a year. I write this down in the migration log, usually with some stern language for my future self in anticipation my future mischievous mind.</p>

<p>This lease period is very important, as it prevents myself from jumping ship as soon as I hit any mild annoyances with the new tool. Tools are instruments, it takes time and practice to learn how to use them properly and understand their quirks. Many times I can’t make an informed decision about whether or not a tool really fits my needs after just a few weeks. The dust needs to settle in order to properly understand what works vs doesn’t and how that weighs against the trade-offs of another tool.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the goal isn’t to prevent any changes to my digital tool-chain. I use these practices as a means of slowing down and thinking through the costs and benefits of investing time in migrating rather than impulsively switching to the newest shiny. Having well-polished tools is still important, but at the end of the day I want to prioritize creating things rather than spending all my time polishing.</p>
