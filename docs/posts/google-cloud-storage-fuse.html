<p>This page provides an overview of Cloud Storage FUSE, an open source
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> adapter that allows you to mount and access
Cloud Storage buckets as local file systems, so applications can read
and write objects in your bucket using standard file system semantics.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/tree/master/docs">Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation</a> 
for instructions on how to use Cloud Storage FUSE, such as installing the
gcsfuse CLI and mounting buckets.</p>

<h2 id="technical-overview" data-text="How Cloud Storage FUSE works">How Cloud Storage FUSE works</h2>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE uses FUSE and Cloud Storage APIs to transparently
expose buckets as locally mounted folders on your file system. Cloud Storage FUSE
can be run from anywhere with connectivity to Cloud Storage, including
Google Kubernetes Engine, Compute Engine VMs, or on-premises systems.</p>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE works by translating object storage names into a file and
directory system, interpreting the slash character (&#34;/&#34;) in object names as a
directory separator so that objects with the same common prefix are treated as
files in the same directory. Applications can interact with the mounted bucket
like a file system, providing virtually limitless file storage running in the
cloud.</p>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE is ideal for use cases where Cloud Storage has
the right performance and scalability characteristics for an application that
requires file system semantics. For example, Cloud Storage FUSE
is useful for machine learning (ML) projects because it provides a way to store
data, models, checkpoints, and logs directly in Cloud Storage. For more
information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-integrations">Cloud Storage FUSE for ML workloads</a>.</p>

<h3 id="differences-and-limitations" data-text="Differences from other file systems">Differences from other file systems</h3>

<p>While Cloud Storage FUSE has a file system interface, it is not like an NFS
or CIFS file system on the backend. Additionally, Cloud Storage FUSE is not
POSIX compliant. For a POSIX file system product in Google Cloud, see
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/filestore">Filestore</a>.</p>

<div>
<devsite-expandable>
  <h3 id="differences-from-posix-file-systems" data-text="Differences from POSIX file systems">Differences from POSIX file systems</h3>
  <p>The following list describes differences between Cloud Storage FUSE and
  POSIX file systems:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not transfer object
metadata when uploading files to Cloud Storage, with the exception of
mtime and symlink targets. This means that you
cannot set <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata#editable">object metadata</a> when
you upload files using Cloud Storage FUSE. If you need to preserve object
metadata, consider uploading files using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil">gsutil</a>, the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api">JSON API</a>, or the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/discover-object-storage-console">Google Cloud console</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not provide concurrency
control for multiple writes to the same file. When multiple writes try to
replace a file, the last write wins and all previous writes are lost. There is
no merging, version control, or user notification of the subsequent overwrite.</li>

<li><strong>Linking</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not support hard links.</li>

<li><strong>File locking and file patching</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not
support file locking or file patching. As such, you should not store version
control system repositories in Cloud Storage FUSE mount points, as version
control systems rely on file locking and patching. Additionally, you should not
use Cloud Storage FUSE as a filer replacement.</li>

<li><strong>Semantics</strong>: Semantics in Cloud Storage FUSE are different
from semantics in a traditional file system. For example, metadata like last
access time are not supported, and some metadata operations like directory
renaming are not atomic. For a list of differences between
Cloud Storage FUSE semantics and traditional file system semantics, see
<a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/semantics.md">Semantics</a>
in the Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation.
</li>

<li><strong>Overwriting in the middle of a file</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does
not support overwriting in the middle of a file. Only sequential writes are
supported.</li>

<li><strong>Access</strong>: Authorization for files is governed by
Cloud Storage permissions. POSIX-style access control does not work.</li>

</ul>
</devsite-expandable>
</div>

<div>
<devsite-expandable>
  <h3 id="limitations" data-text="Limitations">Limitations</h3>
  <p>The following list describes limitations when using Cloud Storage FUSE:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE has much higher latency than
a local file system, and as such, should not be used as the backend for storing
a database. Throughput may be reduced when reading or writing
one small file at a time. Using larger files and/or transferring multiple files
at a time will help increase throughput.</li>

<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Transient errors can sometimes occur when
you use Cloud Storage FUSE to access Cloud Storage. It&#39;s
recommended that you retry failed operations using
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy">retry strategies</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Object versioning</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not
formally support usage with buckets that have object versioning enabled.
Attempting to use Cloud Storage FUSE with buckets that have object versioning
enabled can produce unpredictable behavior.</li>

<li><strong>File transcoding</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not
formally support reading or modifying a file backed by an object with the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">contentEncoding</code> property set. Attempting to use Cloud Storage FUSE
with objects that undergo <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/transcoding">transcoding</a>
can produce unpredictable behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Retention policies</strong>: Cloud Storage FUSE does not
support writing to buckets with a
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock">retention policy</a>.
If you attempt to write to a bucket with a retention policy, your writes will
fail.

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE supports reading objects from buckets with a retention
policy, but the bucket must be mounted as <code translate="no" dir="ltr">Read-Only</code> by passing the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">-o RO</code> flag during bucket mounting.</p></li>

<li><strong>Local storage</strong>: Objects that are new or modified are be
stored in their entirety in a local temporary file until they are closed or
synced. When working with large files, make sure you have enough local storage
capacity for temporary copies of the files, particularly if you are working with
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances">Compute Engine instances</a>. For more
information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/README.md#downloading-object-contents">README</a>
in the Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation.</li>

<li><strong>Directories</strong>: Cloud Storage operates with a
flat namespace. By default, only <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/folders">directories</a>
that are explicitly defined (meaning they exist as objects in Cloud Storage)
can appear in the mounted file system. Implicit directories (ones that are
only parts of the pathname of other files or directories) do not appear by
default. If you have files with a pathname that contains an implicit directory,
the file does not appear in the overall directory tree, since the implicit
directory containing them does not appear. However, you can use a flag to change
this behavior. For more information, see
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/semantics.md#files-and-dirs">Files and directories</a>
in the Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation.

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE does not support directory renaming. A directory rename
cannot be performed atomically in Cloud Storage; instead, renaming a
directory involves copying an object with a new name and deleting the original
object.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</devsite-expandable>
</div>

<h2 id="supported-apps-and-platforms" data-text="Supported applications and platforms">Supported applications and platforms</h2>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE officially supports the TensorFlow V2.x, TensorFlow V1.x, and
PyTorch V1.x ML frameworks. Support for usage with other
frameworks is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE supports the following operating systems running on
Linux kernel versions 3.10 and earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu 18.04 or later</p></li>
<li><p>Debian 10 or later</p></li>
<li><p>CentOS 7 or later</p></li>
<li><p>RHEL 7 or later</p></li>
</ul>

<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-support">Cloud Storage&#39;s official support channels</a>.</p>

<p>For solutions to commonly-encountered issues, see
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md">Troubleshooting</a> in the Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation.</p>

<h2 id="charges" data-text="Pricing for Cloud Storage FUSE">Pricing for Cloud Storage FUSE</h2>

<p>Cloud Storage FUSE is available free of charge, but the storage, metadata,
and network I/O it generates to and from Cloud Storage are charged
like any other Cloud Storage interface. In other words, all data
transfer and operations performed by Cloud Storage FUSE map to
Cloud Storage transfers and operations, and are charged accordingly.
For more information on common Cloud Storage FUSE operations and how they map to
Cloud Storage operations, see the <a href="#operations-mapping">operations mapping</a>.</p>

<p>To avoid surprises, you should estimate how your use
of Cloud Storage FUSE will translate to Cloud Storage charges. For
example, if you are using Cloud Storage FUSE to store log files, you can
incur charges quickly if logs are aggressively flushed on hundreds or thousands
of machines at the same time.</p>

<p>Be aware of the following categories of charges related to using
Cloud Storage FUSE:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Normal object operations (create, delete, and list) incur charges as described
in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#operations-pricing">Operations</a> section of the Cloud Storage
pricing page.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearline storage, Coldline storage, and Archive storage objects have
costs associated with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#retrieval-pricing">retrieval</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#early-delete">early deletion</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Network egress and data transfer between locations incur costs. For more
information, see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-pricing">Network</a> section in the
Cloud Storage pricing page.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="operations-mapping" data-text="Map of Cloud Storage FUSE operations to Cloud Storage operations">Map of Cloud Storage FUSE operations to Cloud Storage operations</h2>

<p>When you perform an operation using Cloud Storage FUSE, you also perform the
Cloud Storage operations associated with the Cloud Storage FUSE
operation. The following table describes common Cloud Storage FUSE commands and
their associated Cloud Storage JSON API operations. You can display
information about the Cloud Storage FUSE operations by using the
