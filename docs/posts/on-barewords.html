    <h1>On Barewords</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Elixir introduced a very controversial change in version 1.4. They deprecated “barewords”. The mechanism of barewords is basically a fundamental part of Elixir&#39;s behaviour where, when a function is called without parameters, you can omit the parentheses. You can read about the change <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/3268">here</a>. But let me give you a little motivating example. I&#39;ll try to make it very simple, so even those of you who have never programmed in Elixir will understand what this means:</p>
<pre><code># return an empty list
def data do
  []
end

# old version
# assign the return value of a function
# to a variable of the same name. yuck!
data = data 
something_else_with_data(data)

# alternative: call the function directly
# but: is it a variable or a function?
# we don&#39;t know.
something_else_with_data(data)

# new version
data = data()
something_else_with_data(data)

# alternative: much cleaner like that
something_else_with_data(data())</code></pre>
<p>Note that while the old version now throws a warning, it will only warn the user, not throw an error.</p>
<p>I, for one, am in favor of that change. I do understand it will “break” a lot of code—keep in mind it&#39;s only warnings, though—, but it reduces the cognitive load on the developer and removes ambiguity, which is a seriously good thing in my book. For people coming from Ruby or people who hate typing unnecessary characters even more than I do it might not actually be an improvement, but I think that this is effortlessly trumped by removing a whole class of bugs. Then again I&#39;m not a professional Elixir developer and have only ever worked on one serious project using the language. Regardless, I think I do have a relatively firm grasp on its concepts and its internals—I even scanned through the kernel module, which defines a lot of the syntactic abstractions of Elixir as macros.</p>
<p>Elixir always struck me as a beautifully designed language; it brings almost everything I want from a language to the table, and I think this is another step in the right direction. Let&#39;s hope that the core developers keep up their quality and hard work, because Elixir is one of our few hopes for a beautiful, bug-free future.</p>
