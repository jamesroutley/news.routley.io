We don't have to do the discrete logarithm with powers of
!!2!! mod !!101!!; we can change those if we like.  (If we change !!2!! to
!!a!! and !!101!! to !!m!! we need to make sure that !!a!! is a
generator of the multiplicative group !!\langle \Bbb Z_{m},
\cdot\rangle!!. If you don't know what this means, try constructing
the tables for !!a=2!! and !!m=7!! or !!m=17!! to see what can go
wrong.)

(Public-key cryptography is based on the fact that while it's
relatively easy to efficiently multiply large numbers, factoring the
product again seems to be difficult and time-consuming.  This
discrete-logarithm multiplication is similar.  Computing !!2^n\pmod
p!! is quick and easy, even without having the !!\ell^{-1}!! table prepared
ahead of time, and even if !!n!! and !!p!! are thousand-digit numbers.
But nobody knows a good way to compute the !!LOG!! table for a large
!!p!!; if someone comes to you with !!2^n\pmod p!! and asks you to
figure out what !!n!! was, it will take you quite a long time to find
out.  So there are versions of all the usual public-key encryption
algorithms where the integer factoring problem has been replaced by
the discrete logarithm problem.)
