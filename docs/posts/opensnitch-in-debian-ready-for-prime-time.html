    <h1>OpenSnitch in Debian ready for prime time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A bit delayed,
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/opensnitch">the interactive
application firewall OpenSnitch</a> package in Debian now got the
latest fixes ready for Debian Bookworm.  Because it depend on a
package missing on some architectures, the autopkgtest check of the
testing migration script did not understand that the tests were
actually working, so the migration was delayed.  A bug in the package
dependencies is also fixed, so those installing the firewall package
(opensnitch) now also get the GUI admin tool (python3-opensnitch-ui)
installed by default.  I am very grateful to Gustavo IÃ±iguez Goya for
his work on getting the package ready for Debian Bookworm.</p>

<p>Armed with this package I have discovered some surprising
connections from programs I believed were able to work completly
offline, and it has already proven its worth, at least to me.  If you
too want to get more familiar with the kind of programs using
Internett connections on your machine, I recommend testing <tt>apt
install opensnitch</tt> in Bookworm and see what you think.</p>

<p>The package is still not able to build its eBPF module within
Debian.  Not sure how much work it would be to get it working, but
suspect some kernel related packages need to be extended with more
header files to get it working.</p>
