    <h1>Week 3: Getting there</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Image Credit: </span><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:NobbiP" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">NobbiP</a></p><p><span>Last week, I said I was going to focus on coding more, and that pairing worked out well. So the obvious conclusion is: </span><strong>I should pair more on coding</strong><span>, right?</span></p><p><span>Well, I tried! And pairing eventually started happening a good amount. But </span><strong>it took me some effort to get there</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Last week, I had the intention of pairing more, but I realized I wasnâ€™t paring down (heh) my commitments during the week to make that happen. Some commitments naturally dropped off, like going to office hours with the staff to introduce myself to them (only need to do that once!) But that still wasnâ€™t enough to get me to where I wanted to be, hours-wise, with coding towards the end of last week.</p><p><span>So I realized that </span><strong>I needed to go to less events with talking </strong><span>(even though theyâ€™re fun!), and then </span><strong>actively invite folks to pair with me</strong><span> on my app and on theirs. I reached out to a bunch of people where we had natural overlapping interests and where we seemed to get along, and I asked to pair with them.</span></p><p><span>And </span><strong>that went really well</strong><span>! I paired with two people yesterday, two today, and I have two scheduled for tomorrow, too. Theyâ€™ve been fun and useful, and it feels like Iâ€™m finally on the pairing train here in week 3.</span></p><p><span>I seem to be settling into a rhythm of </span><strong>about 2 hours of good pair programming time a day</strong><span>. And I guess </span><strong>that doesnâ€™t feel like tons for me</strong><span>, given that Iâ€™ve often paired something like 6 hours a day with others in past jobs. But Iâ€™ve been thinking about that some today, and Iâ€™ve decided </span><strong>thatâ€™s ok</strong><span>.</span></p><p>In my previous coding jobs, mostly us devs just coded and went to occasional meetings. I wasnâ€™t often sharing that generously (though Iâ€™d try to update wikis and post things on Slack and such when I could), and not only that, what I was working on was often not on the edge of my abilities. Plus, Iâ€™m writing a ton here, trying a bunch of new things, commenting on other peopleâ€™s writing, and continuing to meet a bunch of new people.</p><p><span>So, </span><strong>if I want to be sustainable here</strong><span>, I think </span><strong>owning up to those other commitments is important</strong><span>. But itâ€™s taken me some time to really give that fact credit and accept it.</span></p><p>Hereâ€™s a screenshot of what my IMDB data app currently looks like, though itâ€™s just kind of splatting out the response from the IMDB API at the moment:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png" width="1456" height="548" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:548,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:404200,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda530da3-c003-49bc-9666-de4a26a88917_3795x1428.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Not a lot yet</strong><span>, right? But thereâ€™s a lot going on behind that that Iâ€™ve learned about Elixir and Phoenix, so </span><strong>Iâ€™m still happy with my progress so far</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>And as for what I think? </span><strong>Elixir and Phoenix areâ€¦ok</strong><span>, I guess. Itâ€™s nice to stretch my brain functionally and see a new way of coding web stuff, but to be honest, it does feel some to me so far like the docs, while decent, are missing some important bits, and some things (like printing for debugging, and submitting a web form) feel a lot less ergonomic to me than they should. Itâ€™s not sparking joy, to quote Marie Kondo, and thatâ€™s usually a cue for me to start reconsidering something after a bit.</span></p><p><strong>Iâ€™m going to give Elixir and Phoenix through the rest of the week</strong><span> to see how it goes, but if Iâ€™m not feeling better about them next week, I think Iâ€™m going to give myself permission to work on </span><a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists</a><span> instead. I was planning to intersperse working on app with doing some training that I really wanted to do, and this was first on my list of trainings I wanted to try. Plus, there are so many Rustaceans at Recurse, and I think it would be nice to connect and make use of all this awesome interest and people while I can!</span></p><p><span>Overall, </span><strong>Iâ€™m feeling good</strong><span> still! Iâ€™m continuing to explore new things that are hard for me (like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i7MTGhUROZy3BOICnVixETS" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">category theory</a><span>), Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m getting to know many of my awesome batchmates, and Iâ€™m still staying healthy and making progress on problems Iâ€™m noticing with my experience thus far. </span></p><p><span>Next time, </span><strong>Iâ€™ll let you know how Elixir and Phoenix turns out</strong><span>! It should be a good learning experience either way. ðŸ™‚</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
