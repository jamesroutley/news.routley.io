    <h1>Wi-Fi Goes Long Range on New WiLo Standard</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Wi-Fi Goes Long Range on New WiLo Standard"><div><p><em>This article is part of our exclusive </em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/journal-watch/" target="_self"><em>IEEE Journal Watch series</em></a><em> in partnership with IEEE Xplore.</em></p><p>Researchers have developed a hybrid technology that would combine Wi-Fi with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa" target="_blank">Long Range (LoRa) networking protocol</a>, yielding a new long-distance wireless concept called WiLo. The research team has designed their proposed WiLo tech to be used on existing Wi-Fi and LoRa hardware. </p><p>The advance may find applications in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) technologies–such as networks of long-range sensors used in agriculture or smart cities. </p><p><a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/88723" target="_blank">Demin Gao</a>, a professor in the College of Information Science and Technology at <a href="https://eng.njfu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing Forestry University</a> in China, notes that Wi-Fi has limitations today in its range and its high power consumption. By contrast, LoRa is based on low power requirements that yield long-range communication capabilities and is often used for IoT applications. </p><p>In WiLo, the two communications protocols have been combined to maximize advantages of each one, without the need for additional tech to bridge the two systems. “This reduces costs, complexity, and potential points of failure, making IoT deployments more efficient and scalable,” Gao says.</p><p>The researchers—hailing from universities in Hong Kong, mainland China, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> employees in Germany—conducted their WiLo experiments used an off-the-shelf <a href="https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1280" target="_blank">SX1280</a> LoRa transceiver produced by Semtech. And while the SX1280’s 2.4 GHz communications band is shared with Wi-Fi (and a host of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1604479" target="_blank">other standards and technologies</a>), Wi-Fi and LoRa signals are not compatible. </p><p>So the researchers developed an algorithm to manipulate the frequency of Wi-Fi’s data transmission signals to match the signals that the LoRa device uses to communicate with other devices. In technical terms, they manipulated Wi-Fi’s data multiplexing standard (called <a href="https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/ofdm-introduction/" target="_blank">OFDM</a>) to emulate the longer-ranged chirp signals used in LoRa’s chirp-spreading standard (called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10503" target="_blank">CSS</a>). </p><p>“This enables the use of standard Wi-Fi devices to communicate over long distances using LoRa without additional hardware,” says Gao.<br/></p><p>The team tested their new WiLo approach both indoors—in a lab and hallway—and outdoors, over distances up to 500 meters. The researchers reported WiLo achieved a 96 percent success rate. </p><p>Gao says one benefit of WiLo concerns its ability to run on existing, off-the-shelf hardware. As a result, it would not require substantial deployment costs or complexity. On the other hand, one of WiLo’s limitations is the additional power consumption required for Wi-Fi devices to simultaneously handle communication and signal emulation—a problem Gao and his colleagues aim to address in future work. <br/></p><p>Moving forward, Gao says, “To commercialize WiLo, the next steps would involve further optimization of the system to improve energy efficiency, data rates, and robustness against interference. This may require additional <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> and testing across various IoT environments.”</p><p>Ensuring that the system complies with industry standards and integrating security measures for cross-technology communication are also necessary steps, Gao adds. </p><p>The team published their <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680638" target="_blank">research</a> last month in the journal <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=26" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em></a>.</p></div></div></div>
