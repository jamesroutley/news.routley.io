<p>Anyone who follows me on GitHub knows that <a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amaltfield+-org%3Abuskill+-org%3Amaltfield&amp;type=issues&amp;s=comments&amp;o=desc">I make a lot of contributions</a> to many different open-source projects, especially security-related ones.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, I wanted to try-out both <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> and <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a>, but I found that a niche security feature that’s very important to me hasn’t been implemented in either ROM, so I opened a friendly feature request ticket in both ROM’s repos:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/2052">https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/2052</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/1573">https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/1573</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Neither ticket got much traction. There was some discussion on the CalyxOS ticket. But the GrapheneOS ticket was closed by Daniel Micay (Lead Developer of GrapheneOS at the time) 5 hours after I opened it. I forgot about it.</p>
<p>A year later, someone commented on the GrapheneOS ticket (it was the first and only comment other than Micay’s) expressing interest in my feature request, including some useful information: an implementation (that was blocking the CalyxOS ticket) was already written by LineageOS.</p>
<p>When I saw the comment in my email inbox (and realized it might unblock the feature getting added to CalyxOS), I got excited. I tried to load the ticket in GitHub so I could get more information and link it to the Calyx team, but I was surprised to see that the ticket was suddenly — within hours of the new comment — deleted. The ticket wasn’t locked; it was deleted.</p>

<p>First I tried to email the commenter to ask them if it was deleted for them too, but their GitHub account had no contact info. GitHub doesn’t have DMs, so I figured the only way I could communicate with them was by creating a new ticket somewhere and @ tagging them. But where?</p>
<p>I also hopped-over to wayback machine. Internet Archive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230323072145/https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/2052">scraped the page</a> the day that I submitted it (a year ago). I wasn’t sure if the ticket was deleted by accident (maybe Micay accidentally clicked the wrong button?), but — combined with the IA and the email from GitHub with the latest comment, I figured I would just clone the repo, create a new ticket there, use it to [a] contact the most-recent-commenter and [b] also use it to serve as an archive of the now-deleted ticket’s contents for both myself and others.</p>
<p>So I cloned the repo and created the <a href="https://github.com/maltfield/os-issue-tracker/issues/1">following issue</a>, which I just copied-and-pasted the info from the old ticket to the new ticket. I also asked the most-recent-commenter to confirm if they had the same “deleted” message as me. And I asked Daniel Micay if he had maybe accidentally deleted the ticket, and if he could please re-open it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/grapheneos-daniel-micay-banned_banned-full.png">dialog</a> that followed was mind-boggling. <sup><a href="https://github.com/maltfield/os-issue-tracker/issues/1">[1]</a></sup></p><ul><a href="https://github.com/maltfield/os-issue-tracker/issues/1">

</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, an hour or so after Micay banned me, they began deleting their own comments from the ticket. Fortunately I still had a tab open with the comments that Micay wrote, so I <a href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/grapheneos-daniel-micay-banned_banned-full.png">captured a screenshot</a> (<a href="https://ibb.co/5ht2scP6">mirror 1</a>) (<a href="https://postimg.cc/62ywhcpc">mirror 2</a>) (<a href="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/5026712/480110746-ae03e4d5-f6b1-4f7d-bb26-667085188f28.png?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.heY7uYFT4j0t5902MIBhK8GW_x908G2upg-f-COuxTk">mirror 3</a>) and also updated all <em>my</em> comments with full quotes of the messages that I was replying-to (since now it just looked like I was talking to myself).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems <strong>I’m not the first person to be attacked by Daniel Micay</strong>. I won’t bother enumerating the long chronology of such events, because at least two credible YouTubers have already done this:</p>

</p>

<p>In general, I think banning someone from any community is not something that should be taken lightly. If someone ever asks me why I can’t contribute to GrapheneOS, I wanted to have something to point-to to show them why. That is the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>To date, <strong>I’m not really sure why I was banned from GrapheneOS</strong>. But it seems that Micay is hostile to [a] archiving their (public) tickets, and [b] linking to an alternative ROM (which Micay claims is indirectly responsible for harassing and attacking them).</p>
