    <h1>What, if anything, should I do about using Mozilla&#39;s Firefox</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>I currently use Firefox as one of my main browsers.</p>
<p>I have used it for a <em>long</em> time - 20 years now, including for a while the IceWeasel variant - and I like it as a browser.</p>
<p>(I use Firefox as a browser; I don’t use any of Mozilla’s services such as sync or VPN or whatever.)</p>
<p>Given Mozilla’s recent shenanigans (pro ad industry, AI, never feeling quite sure what settings have changed upon upgrade, terms of service, operating model, perhaps more), I want to revisit this choice.</p>
<p>But finding a sustainable, viable alternative Free/open source browser, in a state which I can use <em>today</em>, supporting the plugins that I use daily, which is not based on Chromium, is not easy.</p>
<p>Genuinely, I don’t know…</p>
<h2 id="librewolf">LibreWolf</h2>
<p>LibreWolf is, in a sense, an obvious choice, and I installed it and copied my Firefox profile across to give it a try.</p>
<p>I’ve only done limited testing so far - a couple of days of using it - and it seems to do what I want.</p>
<p>The biggest reason stopping me from jumping to that is that it is a tweaked version of Firefox. That’s not to denigrate the work that the LibreWolf team does to improve it, but, as far as I can tell, it is completely, utterly dependent on Firefox.</p>
<p>I don’t know how quickly LibreWolf gets security updates. I don’t know how much work it will be for LibreWolf to keep up to date with whatever changes Mozilla makes.</p>
<p>If I stick with Firefox, perhaps I am better of sticking with Firefox itself? I genuinely don’t know.</p>
<h2 id="firefox-from-debians-own-repos">Firefox from Debian’s own repos</h2>
<p>At the moment, I am using Mozilla’s repositories for Firefox. I get the most up to date version of Firefox, automatically, and rapidly.</p>
<p>It is convenient.</p>
<p>It also means that, regularly, I have to check my settings to see if Mozilla has changed anything. So definite trade-offs there.</p>
<p>I could switch to use the version of Firefox in the Debian repositories, and accepting that it will be an older, but perhaps safer, version.</p>
<p>That’s an option.</p>
<h2 id="standalone-applications">Standalone applications</h2>
<p>My preference to date has been to use my browser, rather installing some additional, purpose-specific, software (with some exceptions; I prefer an email client over webmail, for instance).</p>
<p>I do a lot of video conferencing, and I use Jitsi, Teams, Zoom etc. within my browser.</p>
<p>I spend a fair amount of time in the fediverse, and on my computer I use my browser rather than a standalone client. I’ve yet to find a standalone client with an interface to match Mastodon’s “Advanced” web UI. On my phone, I use Tusky, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>For at least some sites and services, I could look for standalone clients / applications instead, and reduce my dependency on a browser.</p>
<p>Sadly, for at least some cases, this probably means “bloated Electron client” and I suspect that I’d trust them less than I trust Mozilla right now.</p>
<h2 id="tor-browser">Tor Browser</h2>
<p>I use Tor Browser regularly, on both my laptop and my phone.</p>
<p>Tor Browser is built on Firefox, so I will need to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p>I will continue to use Tor Browser for the foreseeable future, but it is not suitable for all the sites and services I want to use.</p>
<h2 id="links">links</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://neilzone.co.uk/2024/11/using-only-a-linux-terminal-for-my-personal-computing-in-2024/">experimenting with terminal-only computing</a>, the web was one of the more challenging aspects.</p>
<p>I like <code>links</code>, as a TUI browser, and I’ll continue to use it a lot.</p>
<p>But it is not suitable for all sites that I need to use.</p>
<p><code>brow.sh</code> doesn’t solve the problem here, since it is Firefox on the backend.</p>
<h2 id="other-more-esoteric-options">Other, more esoteric, options?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">IceCat</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Palemoon</a> forked Firefox a long time ago, and still gets regular updates, so perhaps this is an option.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://astian.org/midori-browser/">Midori</a>? Looks interesting, but I’m immediately put off by the screenshot which prominently shows links for Facebook, Google etc. And there have been no commits to <a href="https://github.com/midori-browser/core">its Github repo</a> for years.</p>
<h2 id="stick-with-mozilla-and-firefox-for-a-bit-longer">Stick with Mozilla and Firefox for a bit longer?</h2>
<p>The most <em>convenient</em> option for me is to stick with Mozilla’s Firefox, and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Right now, I’ve been <em>disappointed</em> with the direction, but not more than that.</p>
<p>I don’t feel ethically compromised using Firefox. (Should I? Perhaps I’m missing something. But I don’t think so.)</p>
<p>I could keep an eye on the direction of travel, and make another assessment in the future.</p>
