Competitors of IDRA and LK include Buhler Group in Europe, Ube Corp. <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/4208.T" target="_blank">(4208.T)</a> and Shibaura Machine <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/6104.T" target="_blank">(6104.T)</a> in Japan, as well as Yizumi <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/300415.SZ" target="_blank">(300415.SZ)</a> and Haitian <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/1882.HK" target="_blank">(1882.HK)</a> in China.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">GIGAPRESS 9,000</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Metal and plastic die casting has been largely used in manufacturing, but its application to large aluminium underbodies in carmaking is relatively new.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The global aluminium die casting market was worth almost $73 billion last year and is projected to top $126 billion by 2032, according to an AlixPartners analysis based on Apollo Reports data.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Aluminium is prized for its light weight, and is also used for other car parts including engines. The average content of the metal in European produced cars rose 20% to 179 kilograms in the three years to 2019, and is expected to increase to almost 200 kilograms by 2025, a study commissioned by lobby group European Aluminium shows.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">IDRA&#39;s newest and biggest gigapress - the 9,000 - is the size of a small house and produces a clamping force of over 9,000 tons.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">The company, which made 100 million euros ($108 million) in revenues in 2021, does not disclose its customers. But after it posted a video of the first Gigapress 9,000 ready for shipping, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it was for his company&#39;s new cybertruck.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Tesla already operates gigapresses in all its facilities, including in Gruenheide, near Berlin, where it says it can churn out a Model Y in 10 hours - about three times faster than electric cars built by competitors.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Ferrario said IDRA had contracts with three automakers and as many &#39;Tier 1&#39; parts makers. South Korea&#39;s Hyundai Motor is among them, sources familiar with the matter said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">Ralf Bechmann of manufacturing consultant EFESO said the benefits of die casting would push it &#34;to be applied to an increasing number of new models of BEV vehicles, also by other manufacturers&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Front and rear underbodies cast by gigapresses are now combined with battery packs to form a three-piece chassis for BEVs.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">&#34;I bet 80% of automakers will use gigapresses by 2035, at least for BEV cars based on new platforms,&#34; Ferrario said. &#34;But the real question is: will we need even bigger gigapresses?&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">Yet not all automakers are convinced, and EFESO&#39;s Bechmann cautioned that large module die casting required product design to be &#34;super solid&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">&#34;Fixing design flaws is much easier with a body made up of several small parts rather than a single module,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-23">After initially considering die casting for its upcoming Trinity model, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-decide-by-early-february-new-planned-trinity-plant-brand-chief-2022-12-06/">Volkswagen</a> <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VOWG_p.DE" target="_blank">(VOWG_p.DE)</a> has backtracked, while BMW <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BMWG.DE" target="_blank">(BMWG.DE)</a> has never expressed an interest.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-24">Ferrario said the auto industry tended to be conservative and that no one liked upending established processes, but he rejected idea that die casting posed a risk to jobs at carmakers, noting body-making was already highly automated.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-25">&#34;The real issue will be with businesses supplying those little parts replaced by our modules,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-26">($1 = 0.9272 euros)</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari
