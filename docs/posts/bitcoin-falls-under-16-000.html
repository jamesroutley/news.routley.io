It reached its all-time high of $68,982.20 one year ago Thursday.

It was last down 45%, after dropping more than 26% Tuesday. Alameda Research, the trading firm owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also runs FTX, was an early backer of the Solana project.</p><p>&#34;Market factors such as providing SOL token liquidity as well as support for Solana ecosystem projects on FTX exchange has been an important driver for Solana&#39;s success,&#34; Bernstein&#39;s Gautam Chhugani said in a note Wednesday. &#34;This is an adverse event for the Solana ecosystem in the short run. Further, given FTX/Alameda&#39;s balance sheet situation, there may be near term pressure on its Solana holdings, as the situation resolves.&#34;</p><p>The bombshell will set the crypto industry back. Analysts foresee further regulatory scrutiny of offshore exchanges, where the majority of crypto derivatives trading takes place. It&#39;s also unclear how much financial contagion will spill into the rest of the market.</p><p>Additionally, Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, had recently been praised as a &#34;white knight&#34; in the industry, coming to the rescue of crypto service firms such as BlockFi and Voyager that succumbed to the crypto contagion last spring.</p><p>For newcomers to the crypto market, SBF and FTX became the faces of the industry, securing the naming rights to the Miami Heat basketball team&#39;s stadium last year, bringing on Tom Brady and Giselle Bündchen as company ambassadors, and becoming a megadonor to Democratic politics.</p><p>&#34;Given the public-facing nature of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the size of FTX, we believe that the week&#39;s events could cause some loss of consumer confidence in the crypto industry, beyond that seen in the aftermath of the 3AC, Celsius, and Voyager events that took place earlier this year,&#34; especially if panic spreads and crypto prices keep dropping, KBW analysts said in a note Tuesday. &#34;It may take time for customers to regain trust in the industry, broadly speaking (and we think regulation could help this).&#34;</p></div></div></div>
