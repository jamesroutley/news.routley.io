    <h1>Air Purifier vs. Positive Pressure Fresh Air System – An Unfair Battle?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We have made a <strong>comparison test</strong> between a positive pressure fresh air system (PPS) and a standalone purifier on the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of bringing the ambient PM 2.5 particles down.</p>
<p>A positive pressure fresh air system takes air from outside, filters it through a HEPA filter and pumps it into the room. Thereby <strong>pressurizing the room</strong> and thus <strong>preventing dirty air</strong> from entering the room.</p>
<p>To make the comparison meaningful we chose <strong>similar specifications</strong> on both the positive pressure system and the air purifier.</p>
<p><strong>PPS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>220m3/h airflow</li>
<li>30w</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purifier:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>280m3/h airflow</li>
<li>30w</li>
</ul>
<p>So the purifier is slightly more powerful in regards to airflow.</p>
<p>The comparison was done in a 32m2 room with the above PPS system permanently installed.</p>
<h3 id="timeline-of-the-experiment"><strong>Timeline of the experiment:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>10:10pm:</strong> PPS System was <strong>switched off</strong> and purifier was <strong>switched on</strong> (to maximum setting)</li>
<li><strong>04:15am:</strong> PPS System was <strong>switched on</strong></li>
<li><strong>04:45am</strong>: Purifier was <strong>switched off</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/battle-1.png"/></p><p>As we can see from the graph, once the positive pressure system was switched off, <strong>polluted air entered the room</strong> through small air gaps. It increased for approximately 1 hour until it reached <strong>equilibrium</strong> with the purifier at around 50μg/m³.</p>
<p>The standalone purifier was able to <strong>reduce</strong> the ambient PM 2.5 values by <strong>about 75%</strong>. We can see some correlation with the outside PM 2.5 values so we can assume that the indoor pollution would always fluctuate depending on the outside values.</p>
<p>On the other hand with the positive pressure system switched on, we can see that the <strong>PM 2.5 values stay permanently at zero</strong> and there is no correlation with the outside air quality. This is because the positive pressure inside the room prevents any dirty air from entering the room.</p>
<p>So we see that the positive pressure system has a number of <strong>advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>pressurization</strong> can keep PM2.5 at <strong>zero</strong> no matter what the outside air quality is</li>
<li>It can achieve this with a <strong>lower airflow</strong></li>
<li>By constantly pumping fresh air into the room, <strong>CO2 levels will remain low</strong></li>
</ul>
