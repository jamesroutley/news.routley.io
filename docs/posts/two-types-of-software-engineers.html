    <h1>Two Types of Software Engineers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve been kicking around in my head for a few weeks, a tiny theory I have of how people think about software engineering.</p><p>According to my theory, there are two types of software engineers:</p><p>Type 1, when presented with a problem, thinks: &#34;easy, people can just do X.&#34;</p><p>Type 2, when presented with the same problem, thinks: &#34;very hard, because it requires people to do X.&#34;</p><p><span>Type 1 assumes something&#39;s easy if it&#39;s not a technical problem, because &#34;we can just ask people to do X.&#34; Type 2 thinks it&#39;s hard </span><em>because</em><span> it is not technical.</span></p><p>Example:</p><p>Type 1: &#34;easy, we can just ask people not to deploy at this time&#34;</p><p>Type 2: &#34;wait, but what do we do _when_ people deploy at this time?&#34;</p><p>Another example:</p><p>Type 1: &#34;easy, we just document this new process and ask people to follow it&#34;</p><p>Type 2: &#34;how do we ensure people even read this?&#34;</p><p>Another one:</p><p>Type 1: &#34;easy, we just build a system that these 4 parties will use and that ensures that no one cheats on the other one&#34;</p><p>Type 2: &#34;this is really hard because we need to get 4 parties to use the same system&#34;</p><p><span>I&#39;m not entirely sure yet on where exactly to draw the line between type 1 and 2 or how to define them precisely. I told you: </span><em>tiny</em><span> theory.</span></p><p>Painting in really broad strokes, though, I&#39;d say that type 1 doesn&#39;t take people into account and type 2 knows that at the heart of all of their engineering work (and problems) are people.</p><p><span>Type 1 believes in capital E Engineering, where there are cold, hard truths; there&#39;s math &amp; physics; it&#39;s applied </span><em>science</em><span>. It&#39;s what you see in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)" rel="">The Martian</a><span>.</span></p><p>Type 2 would probably ask: &#34;yeah, but what if the guy in The Martian didn&#39;t have to build this stuff for himself but for others?&#34;</p><p><span>Now, as you might have noticed, I&#39;m not-so-subtly hinting at the fact that the type 2 engineer knows a bit more but </span><em>maybe</em><span> you also wonder whether you can’t smell a hint of cynicism in there and think that it&#39;s me admitting defeat — we can&#39;t build nice things because it all becomes a mess as soon as people are involved.</span></p><p><span>Here&#39;s the kicker though: it&#39;s the opposite! It&#39;s not cynicism, type 2 engineering is </span><em>embracing</em><span> the fact that we build with and for people and taking on an even bigger challenge of doing work despite the chaos this produces.</span></p><p><span>Because, see, when it gets messy, that&#39;s where it gets </span><em>real</em><span>; that’s where the actual work begins, when you go from drawing board to actually shipping something of value and with impact to someone.</span></p><p>It&#39;s embracing the fact that people are not machines and no matter how often they say they&#39;re rational thinkers, you still know that even the strongest choose-the-best-tool-for-the-job advocates will sometimes choose a tool because, well, the GIF in the README was cooler. It&#39;s knowing that no one will read your documentation if you don&#39;t make it entertaining and easy to read. It&#39;s leveraging the fact that people will install security updates to get new emojis. It&#39;s anticipating that, no, not everybody will follow the best practice because everybody has a Thursday afternoon that feels like it should be Friday evening.</p><p><span>Let me add one more on top: I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s </span><em>precisely because of how messy it can get</em><span> do the things we build become beautiful.</span></p><p>Until next week!</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
