    <p>To help keep your account secure, starting <strong>May 30, 2022</strong>, ​​Google will no longer support the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password. For more information, please continue reading.</p>
    <p><strong>Special Note on Apple Device Sign-Ins.</strong> Users who have not recently signed into their Google Account using only username and password will be able to only make new sign in attempts using the Google account type starting from <strong>February 28, 2022</strong>. Existing users may continue to sign into their Google Account using their username and password until <strong>May 30, 2022</strong>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If an app or site doesn’t meet our <a href="#more-secure-apps-how" rel="noopener">security standards</a>, Google might block anyone who’s trying to sign in to your account from it. Less secure apps can make it easier for hackers to get in to your account, so blocking sign-ins from these apps helps keep your account safe.</p>

<div><p><a>If &#34;Less secure app access&#34; is on for your account</a></p><div>
    <p>Because less secure apps can make your account more vulnerable, Google will automatically turn this setting off if it’s not being used.</p>

    <p>If &#34;Less secure app access&#34; is still on for your account, we recommend turning it off now and switching to <a href="#more-secure-apps" rel="noopener">more secure apps</a>.</p>

    <h2>Turn off &#34;Less secure app access&#34;</h2>

    <p>To help keep your account secure, we recommend that you keep this setting off and use <a href="#more-secure-apps-how" rel="noopener">more secure apps.</a></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> section of your Google Account. You might need to sign in.</li>
      <li>Turn <strong>Allow less secure apps</strong> off.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>



<h2><a id="more-secure-apps-how" name="more-secure-apps-how"></a>How more secure apps help protect your account</h2>

<p>When a third-party app meets our security standards, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See what level of account access you’re giving the app before you connect your Google Account</li>
  <li>Let the app access only a relevant part of your Google Account, like your email or calendar</li>
  <li>Connect your Google Account to the app without exposing your password</li>
  <li>Disconnect your Google Account from the app at any time</li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521">third-party apps with access to your account</a>.</p>

<h3>Can’t use an app with my Google Account</h3>

<div><p><a>Update your app or operating system</a></p><div>
    <p>If the app or the operating system on your device is out-of-date, updating to the latest version might allow you to use the app with your Google Account.</p>

    <p>Make sure you’re using the latest version of the app and your device’s operating system.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div><p><a id="more-secure-apps" name="more-secure-apps">Use more secure apps</a></p><div>
    <p>If an app uses less secure sign-in technology, you might not be able to use it with your Google Account.</p>

    <p>You can sign in to your Google Account from any third-party app that has the &#34;Sign in with Google&#34; option. You can also sign in to your Google Account using all Google products, like Gmail.</p>
