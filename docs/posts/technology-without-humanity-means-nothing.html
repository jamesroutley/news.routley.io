              <p>At Moneo, we believe technology cannot be separated from humanity. Code is never neutral. Whether written by human hands or by AI, every line carries the values, choices, and intentions of the people who shape it.</p>

<p>Guillermo Rauch’s <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1972669025525158031">recent post</a> was the breaking point for us. In the past, he had already <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1918517763644985605">shared words</a> of praise for Israel and faced strong backlash from the ecosystem. Yet he chose to repeat the same stance. This time, it became a deliberate act of ignoring the suffering of innocent civilians. We saw the photo, we read the words: <em>“Optimistic for peace, safety, and greatness for Israel and its neighbors.”</em></p>

<p>This is not optimism. This is closing your eyes to tragedy. Standing with leaders tied to war crimes and then speaking of “greatness” is not peace. It is an insult to every victim. Ask yourself: can you call it peace when women, children and babies are killed? Can you call it hope when mothers cry over the rubble for their missing children, when fathers carry the small bodies of their sons and daughters, when families are forced to bury generations in a single day? Smiling in that moment and talking about “safety” and “greatness” is not hope. It is stepping on grief. If someone does not see others as human, but only as tools to serve, then their words show who they really are.</p>

<p>For us, the only acceptable path is the immediate end of this systematic violence and oppression, and real global accountability for the loss of innocent lives. History has shown that those who commit atrocities, and those who stand beside them, are eventually judged. When that day comes, the person next to Guillermo will be remembered as a new Hitler, and Guillermo himself will face deep shame. Not the shame of compassion, but the shame of knowing he chose wrongly and that people of conscience will see him as part of the crime.</p>

<h2>No Humanity, No Technology</h2>

<p>Our decision is clear: <strong>Moneo has cut all ties with Vercel, Next.js, and everything connected to this ecosystem.</strong> We will not use them in our products, we will not include them in client projects, and we will not take part in their events. This is not a technical decision. It is a moral one. We will not be part of a structure that rejects basic human empathy.</p>

<p>We stand against war. We stand against the killing of civilians. We stand against oppression in all forms. This decision is not about politics, religion, or culture. It is about conscience, empathy, and the pain of witnessing the loss of innocent lives.</p>

<p>We speak even if it costs us popularity. We speak even if it costs us speed or convenience. Because there are lines that must never be crossed.</p>

<p>From today, Moneo is outside the Vercel ecosystem. And there is one question everyone must ask themselves: <strong>Do you stand with the innocent, or with those who admire war criminals?</strong></p>

<p>Our voice may be small, but it will not be silenced. Because technology without humanity is nothing.</p>
