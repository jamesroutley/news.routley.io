          <p>&#34;We are an AI, robotics company,&#34; Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-an-ai-company-now-heres-how-plausible-that-is/">announced last April</a>. Despite the fact that the company&#39;s revenues are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/teslas-death-is-not-close-says-musk-as-operating-margin-drops-to-2/">overwhelmingly derived from selling new electric vehicles</a>, such prosaic activities hold no luster for the boss. <span>Instead, Tesla&#39;s future, according to Musk, depends upon a (claimed) sub-$30,000 driverless two-seater, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed to the world last October</a> in a staged demonstration on a film set.</span> But Musk&#39;s plans just hit a snag: The company must find some new names.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/teslas-robotaxi-and-cybercab-trademarks-hit-roadblocks-ahead-of-june-launch/">As spotted by Sean O&#39;Kane at TechCrunch</a>, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has informed Tesla that it will not be allowed to trademark the word &#34;robotaxi&#34; to describe the vehicle. <span>According to the USPTO, the term is far too generic. Indeed, a <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=robotaxi&amp;year_start=2000&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google n-gram</a></span><a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=robotaxi&amp;year_start=2000&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3"> search</a> shows a steady growth in the use of &#34;robotaxi&#34; starting more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>According to the USPTO, the term is merely descriptive. <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn98795389&amp;docId=NFIN20250506110959&amp;linkId=1#docIndex=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The agency cites</a> evidence from Wikipedia, The Verge, and the Amazon-backed autonomous vehicle startup Zoox in its denial of Tesla&#39;s trademark application.</p>

      Maybe they should just have called it the Teslapod.

<p>Tesla could challenge this decision, but it would have to show the USPTO all the product&#39;s marketing materials, brochures, and manuals that intend to use the name. If those aren&#39;t available, Tesla must explain to the patent and trademark office&#39;s satisfaction how this product will differ from others, with detailed specifics, not generalities. Tesla must also explain whether the car features robotic systems and whether any of Tesla&#39;s competitors use &#34;robo,&#34; &#34;robot,&#34; or &#34;robotic&#34; to describe their own goods and services—the fact that Zoox refers to its autonomous pods as robotaxis will be very inconvenient for Tesla.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the first time that Tesla has been accused of a lack of originality. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/tesla-warner-bros-sued-for-using-ai-ripoff-of-iconic-blade-runner-imagery/">Alcon Entertainment sued Warner Brothers and Tesla</a> after it refused them permission and adamantly objected to WB&#39;s and Tesla&#39;s attempt to link the vehicle with vehicles seen in <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. Although Tesla attempted to get the case dismissed, in April, the court ordered the parties to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.945374/gov.uscourts.cacd.945374.65.0.pdf">enter into mediation</a>.</p>
