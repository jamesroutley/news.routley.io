    <h1>Neanderthals operated prehistoric “fat factory” on German lakeshore</h1>

The practice, uncovered at the Neumark-Nord 2 archaeological site, shows that Neanderthals had a much more advanced conception of nutrition, planning, and resource management than previously believed.</p><figure id="attachment_51016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51016"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijg1MyIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgODUzIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1.jpg" alt="Neanderthals operated prehistoric “fat factory” 125,000 years ago on German lakeshore, study finds" width="1280" height="853" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51016">Artistic impression of activities at the “Fat Factory” site.

The study indicates that Neanderthals, in addition to smashing bones to access the marrow—a behavior shared by their earliest African ancestors—also crushed them into fragments and boiled them to obtain bone grease, a nutrient-rich resource.</p><p>“This was intensive, organized, and strategic,” said Dr. Lutz Kindler, the study’s lead author. “Neanderthals were clearly managing resources with caution—planning hunts, transporting carcasses, and rendering fat in a task-specific area. They understood both the nutritional value of fat and how to access it efficiently.”</p><figure id="attachment_51017" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51017"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjcyMCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgNzIwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2.jpg" alt="Neanderthals operated prehistoric “fat factory” 125,000 years ago on German lakeshore, study finds" width="1280" height="720" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-150x84.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-750x422.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-2-1140x641.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51017">Excavations at the Neumark-Nord 2 site.

Excavations from 2004 to 2009 revealed several zones with various Neanderthal activities: deer hunting and light butchering in one, straight-tusked elephant processing in another, and fat removal in a third, specialized area. Remarkably, cut-marked remains of 76 rhinos and 40 elephants were also discovered at nearby sites like Taubach.</p><p>“What makes Neumark-Nord so exceptional is the preservation of an entire landscape, not just a single site,” said Leiden University’s Prof. Wil Roebroeks. “We are seeing a range of Neanderthal behaviors within the same landscape.”</p><figure id="attachment_51019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51019"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc5MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgNzkwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4.jpg" alt="Neanderthals operated prehistoric “fat factory” 125,000 years ago on German lakeshore, study finds" width="1280" height="790" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-300x185.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-1024x632.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-768x474.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-150x93.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-750x463.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/neanderthals-fat-factory-4-1140x704.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51019">Massive bone processing.

It is the basic &#34;unit&#34; of archaeological analysis. Artifacts can vary widely in terms of size, material, and purpose. They can include tools, pottery, jewelry, weapons, clothing, and more. These diverse forms may at times be mistaken for ecofacts and features, with all three often coexisting within archaeological sites. Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the technological advancements,&lt;p class=&#34;wpg-read-more&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/&#34;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" href="https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/" target="_blank">artifacts</a> (red) and hammer stones (red).

Prof. Roebroeks warned that their mass hunting of slow-reproducing species undoubtedly left a significant impact on fauna in the region during the Last Interglacial period.</p><p>The finds depict the Neanderthals as more capable and more intelligent than the stereotype of the brutish caveman. The “fat factory” at Neumark-Nord reveals a species that could plan for the future, manage its environment, and maximize nutrition in resource-poor environments.</p><div><div><div><p><strong>More information:</strong> <a href="https://www.leiza.de/presse/details-pressmeldungen/neandertaler-betrieben-bereits-vor-125000-jahren-fettfabriken">LEIZA</a></p><div><div><p><strong>Publication:</strong> Kindler, L., Gaudzinski-Windheuser, S., Scherjon, F., Garcia-Moreno, A., Smith, G.
