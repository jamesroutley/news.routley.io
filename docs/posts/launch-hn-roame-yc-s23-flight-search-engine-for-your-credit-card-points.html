    <h1>Launch HN: Roame (YC S23) – Flight search engine for your credit card points</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! We&#39;re Tim and Zi from Roame (<a href="https://roame.travel">https://roame.travel</a>). Roame is a flight search engine that lets you find and redeem business class flights using points and miles, rather than exorbitant amounts of cash. Here&#39;s a demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo</a>
We have been flying around the world in first and business class using points for years—Tim for more than a decade and Zi more recently. A little over a year ago, we were trying to find cheap round-trip tickets in first or business class to Asia and back using points. We had tons of points across Chase, American Express, and Citi, but finding a good redemption is always a pain.</p><p>We had flexibility with points currency, destinations, and dates. Our only requirement was securing two round-trip flight redemptions in first or business class on the same flight. This flexibility came at a cost: we spent over 30 hours across two weeks manually searching dates and routes on the websites of 10-20 airline transfer partners.</p><p>Ultimately, we did find two Japan Airlines first class tickets from Los Angeles to Tokyo for 70,000 points each, returning to New York for 80,000 points each. These flights typically cost between $20,000 to $30,000 roundtrip in cash, but using points, we effectively paid only ~$2,000.</p><p>The first class experience was unforgettable, but we didn&#39;t want to repeat the tedious search process. So, we decided to build a tool to save time in the future.</p><p>I know all this about points might sound a bit like magic, but booking cheap business class flights using points is achievable for the average person. Here&#39;s how it works:
Credit card sign-up offers range from 50,000 to 150,000 points. These points are either tied to credit card currencies (Chase Ultimate Rewards, American Express Membership Rewards) or specific airlines (Delta Skymiles, United MileagePlus). The most valuable and versatile points are tied to credit card currencies because they can be transferred to various travel partners. This flexibility allows you to choose the best value before transferring points. If you only have points with one airline program, you&#39;re limited to their redemptions.</p><p>While most people redeem their credit card points through the Chase or American Express travel portals at about 1-1.5 cents per point, transferring to an airline partner can yield 3-8 cents per point for business class or 12-20 cents per point for first class.</p><p>The best value for points often comes from non-US airlines like Air Canada, Air France/KLM, Avianca, and British Airways. For example, you can redeem 50,000 points for an Air France business class flight from San Francisco to Paris, which would otherwise cost around $4,000. That&#39;s an 8 cents per point value, significantly higher than using the credit card travel portal.</p><p>However, the challenges are: 1) most people don&#39;t know their credit card points can transfer to airline partners, 2) they don&#39;t consider non-US airlines, and 3) manually searching each airline website is time-consuming.</p><p>Our tool simplifies this process: Enter your origin airport, destination airport, date, fare class, and number of travelers. After you click search, our tool searches up to 16 different airline loyalty programs in real time and displays the results, including flight information, points cost, and redemption instructions.</p><p>The real-time search is free and offers access to 60 days of SkyView, a cached database of the top 6,500 most popular routes categorized by regions (state, country, continent) across two months. The paid version extends access to the full 365 calendar and allows searches up to two months at a time, with email alerts. SkyView is perfect for showing you what is currently available or was previously possible for all your award redemption needs.</p><p>We&#39;re continuously adding more features and would love to hear your ideas, experiences, and feedback! Thank you in advance!</p></div></td></div></div>
