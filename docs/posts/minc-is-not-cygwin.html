    <h1>MinC Is Not Cygwin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<article>
<p>Welcome to the MinC home page. MinC is a Unix emulator for Windows, based on the OpenBSD operating system.
MinC was written to help children at vocational education learn Linux without the hassle of virtualization. 
It runs on all versions of Windows, except Win95 and Win98.
</p>
<p>MinC is a tiny kernel which runs on Windows. The rest of the software was 
taken verbatim from OpenBSD, version 6.1. This means that by installing MinC, 
you run OpenBSD on your Windows machine at native speed.

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>To install MinC you no longer have to copy it &#34;by hand&#34;. You can now use the new installation
wizard. Download the current version by clicking the link:
<a href="https://minc.commandlinerevolution.nl/minc-6.1.exe">minc-6.1.exe</a> (20Mb).
</p>

This starts the MinC terminal.

via PayPal. Any amount is welcome.
</p>

<h2>Antivirus</h2>
<p>MinC works well with antivirus software, such as the built-in
<b>Windows Defender</b> or <b>Kaspersky</b>.
</p>
<p>In some cases you need to temporarily disable antivirus before downloading and 
installing (<a target="_blank" href="https://support.kaspersky.com/KIS/21.2/en-US/70886.htm" title="How to pause and resume computer protection">Kaspersky</a>). After that, MinC works fine.
</p>
<p>In other cases, MinC installs well, but the antivirus does not let you 
run its programs. You need to exclude the MinC root directory from scanning 
(<a target="_blank" href="https://help.f-secure.com/product.html#home/total-windows/latest/en/allow_program_on_sys_control_blocklist_to_run-latest-en" title="Allowing blocked applications">f-secure</a>).

<h2>Visual Studio</h2>
<p>MinC can be integrated into <b>MS Visual Studio Code</b> as a terminal.
Put following snippet in your personal settings.json file:
</p>
<pre>&#34;terminal.integrated.profiles.windows&#34;: {
   &#34;MinC&#34;: {
      &#34;path&#34;: &#34;<u>C:\\MinC</u>\\sbin\\bsd.exe&#34;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>If you installed MinC at another location, make sure 
the underlined part is correct.
