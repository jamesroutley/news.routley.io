    <h1>How big a solar battery do I need to store all my home&#39;s electricity?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
					<p>I have a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/solar-faq/">modest set of solar panels</a> on an entirely ordinary house in suburban London.</p>
					<p>On average they generate about 3,800kWh per year. We also use about 3,800kWh of electricity each year. Obviously, we can&#39;t use all the power produced over summer and we need to buy power in winter. So here&#39;s my question:</p>
					<p>How big a battery would we need in order to be <em>completely</em> self-sufficient?</p>
					<h2 id="background">
						<a href="#background">Background</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Let&#39;s take a look at a typical summer&#39;s day. The graph is a little complex, so I&#39;ll explain it.</p>
					<p><img alt="Graph of power flow." height="988" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Power-Flow.webp" width="1788"/></p><p>The yellow line shows solar production. It starts shortly after sunrise, peaks at midday, and gradually drops until sunset.</p>
					<p>The red line shows how much electricity our home is using. As you can see, there&#39;s a large peak about 19:00 when we cook dinner.</p>
					<p>The blue line shows how much electricity we draw or export from the grid. From midnight until sunrise we import because the sun isn&#39;t shining. Once the sun has risen we&#39;re able to power our house <em>and</em> export to our neighbours. When we cook, we draw from the grid <em>and</em> our battery - which is why the evening grid peak is lower than the household use dip.</p>
					<p>The CSV of the data looks something like this:</p>

					<p>It&#39;s fairly trivial to sum both columns and subtract one from the other. That shows either the excess or deficit in solar power for the household.</p>
					<p>On that day, the house used 9.7kWh and generated 19.6kWh. I&#39;d need a 9.9kWh battery to store the excess right? Wrong!</p>
					<p>Because my usage doesn&#39;t track the sun, I&#39;d actually need a 13kWh battery. That&#39;s the peak amount of excess electricity I&#39;ve generated in that one day.</p>
					<p>What I want to do is find out what the <em>maximum</em> size battery I would need in order to store all of summer&#39;s electricity for use in winter.</p>
					<p>Luckily, I have several years of real data to go off! Let&#39;s get started!</p>

					<p>This is based on data generated by my home battery. It has probes to measure solar output and grid flow. It is not 100% clock-accurate compared to my solar-panels&#39; internal reporting nor what my smart-meter reports. I estimate a 1-2% deviation, which is good enough for these purposes.</p>
					<p>My energy usage isn&#39;t representative of anything other than my usage. Your household is probably different. I already have a 4.8kWh battery which changes how and when I use energy.</p>
					<p>This doesn&#39;t account for gas heating or hot water. We have some electric heaters and taps which increases our electricity usage.</p>
					<p>My maths is <em>probably</em> right - but the code is open source, so feel free to check for yourself.</p>
					<p>Remember, this is just a bit of fun. There&#39;s no practical way to build domestic batteries with this capacity using the technology of 2025.</p>

					<p>We tend to start generating more electricity than we use starting in Spring. So I&#39;ve picked the end of March 2024 to the end of March 2025.</p>
					<p>Let&#39;s see how big a battery we&#39;d need to store our summer excess for winter.  This finds the cumulative difference between each day&#39;s energy production and usage:</p>

					<p>The total is <strong>1,068KWh</strong> - basically, a MegaWatt-hour of storage.</p>
					<p>Here&#39;s a quick graph to show how the storage would be used over the year.</p>
					<p><img alt="Graph showing a steady climb to 1 MegaWatt-hour and then down again." height="700" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cumulative-Graph.webp" width="1300"/></p><p>As you can see, even in this scenario there are a few days where we&#39;d need to import energy from the grid.</p>
					<h2 id="is-this-sensible">
						<a href="#is-this-sensible">Is this sensible?</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Probably not, no. It doesn&#39;t account for increased energy use from having an electric car or moving away from gas heating / cooking.  As <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/interactive-cell-efficiency">solar panels increase in efficiency</a>, it might be more sensible to replace the panels on my roof, or add some onto a shed.</p>
					<p>The environmental impact of creating and storing such huge batteries could also be factored in.</p>
					<p>A battery which is only 100% full for a few days probably isn&#39;t an efficient design. Using wind, hydro, and other green sources from the grid might be preferable.</p>
					<p>But, remember, this is an exercise in wishful thinking.</p>
					<h2 id="is-this-possible">
						<a href="#is-this-possible">Is this possible?</a>
					</h2>
					<p><a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/115190527741497635">Grid-scale batteries exist</a> and they work brilliantly.</p>
					<p>But if I wanted my own MegaWatt-hour of battery storage, it would probably cost me between <a href="https://www.fogstar.co.uk/collections/solar-battery-storage/products/fogstar-energy-32kwh-battery?variant=55157091205497">£100k</a> and <a href="https://modoenergy.com/research/battery-energy-storage-capex-containerised-bess-development-costs-oem-balance-plant-bop-grid-connections-survey-2024">half-a-million quid</a>.</p>
					<p>That doesn&#39;t include maintenance, the land, planning permission, and a hundred other things.</p>
					<p>But battery prices are falling fast. In the last decade <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1354-august-5-2024-electric-vehicle-battery-pack-costs-light-duty">lithium ion battery prices have fallen 90%</a>. With new <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11913365/">sodium ion batteries</a> promising an even bigger drop - down to <a href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/catl-sodium-ion-battery-packs/">US$10/kWh</a>.</p>
					<p>If - and it is a <strong>big</strong> if - those numbers came to pass, it would probably cost around £8,000 for a domestic battery. Basically the same cost as adding solar panels in the first place.</p>
					<p>Domestic solar <em>works</em> - yes, even in the rainy UK! It is relatively cheap, moves energy production as close as possible to energy consumption, reduces bill-shock, and means we don&#39;t have endless planning arguments about whether fields should be turned into solar farms.</p>
					<p>It is possible that, not too long in the future, every home could also have a 1 MegaWatt-hour battery. They would be able to capture all the excess solar power generated in a year.</p>
					<p>There&#39;s a bright and sunny future where every home can be solar-self-sufficient.</p>
