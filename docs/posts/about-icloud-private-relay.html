            <h2 id="websites">How Private Relay works</h2>
            <div><p>Normally when you browse the web, information contained in your web traffic, such as your DNS records and IP address, can be seen by your network provider and the websites you visit. This information could be used to determine your identity and build a profile of your location and browsing history over time. iCloud Private Relay is designed to protect your privacy by ensuring that when you browse the web in Safari, no single party — not even Apple — can see both who you are and what sites you&#39;re visiting.</p>
<p>When Private Relay is enabled, your requests are sent through two separate, secure internet relays. Your IP address is visible to your network provider and to the first relay, which is operated by Apple. Your DNS records are encrypted, so neither party can see the address of the website you&#39;re trying to visit. The second relay, which is operated by a third-party content provider, generates a temporary IP address, decrypts the name of the website you requested and connects you to the site. All of this is done using the latest internet standards to maintain a high-performance browsing experience while protecting your privacy.</p>

            <h2 id="on">Turn on Private Relay</h2>
            <div><p>Turn on Private Relay to protect your IP address and browsing activity in Safari:</p>
<ul>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; iCloud &gt; Private Relay. </li>
<li>On your Mac, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, then click Apple ID. Select iCloud &gt; Private Relay. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can tap IP Address Location to choose a setting for your IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain General Location</strong> allows sites to show you localised content in Safari, while your IP address stays hidden</li>
<li><strong>Use Country and Time Zone</strong> uses a broader location for your IP address, still within your country and time zone</li>
</ul>

            <h2 id="website-not-working">If a website or network doesn&#39;t work with Private Relay</h2>
            <div><p>Private Relay is designed to protect your internet privacy and maintain a high-performance browsing experience. Some websites, networks or services may need to <a href="#resources">make updates for Private Relay</a>, including networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering — such as business or education networks — or services that rely on viewing your browsing activity, such as parental controls or some &#34;zero rated&#34; services that don&#39;t count towards your data usage.</p>
<p>In addition, if you travel somewhere where Private Relay isn&#39;t available, it will automatically turn off and will turn on again when you re-enter a country or region that supports it. Private Relay will notify you when it&#39;s unavailable and when it&#39;s active again.</p>
<p>If a website, network or service you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t appear to be compatible with Private Relay, you can temporarily turn off Private Relay in iCloud settings. You can also turn off Private Relay just for a specific network. If you turn off Private Relay, network providers and websites can monitor your internet activity in Safari. </p>
<ul>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, you can turn off iCloud Private Relay in Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; iCloud &gt; Private Relay. </li>
<li>On your Mac, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, then click Apple ID. Select iCloud &gt; Private Relay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Private Relay can be turned on or off just for a specific network using the Limit IP Address Tracking preference.*</p>
<ul>
<li>On your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings &gt; Wi-Fi, then tap the More Info button <img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/ios13-info-icon.png" alt="" width="22"/> next to the Wi-Fi network. Or for mobile networks, go to Settings &gt; Mobile &gt; Mobile Data Options. </li>
<li>On your Mac, choose Apple menu  &gt; System Preferences, then click Network and select the network from the list to see more options.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Private Relay has been turned off for a specific network, you can try turning it back on in Wi-Fi, Mobile Data Options or Network settings. If you regularly switch between multiple network configurations, such as dual SIM or Wi-Fi and Ethernet, make sure that this preference is set for each network independently. </p>
<p>If you turn off Private Relay for a specific network, the setting for that network applies to all your devices for which Private Relay is turned on.</p>
<p><span>* In earlier versions of iOS, iPadOS and macOS, this preference is called iCloud Private Relay.</span></p>

            <h2>Private Relay and network speed tests</h2>
            <p>Private Relay uses a single, secure connection to maintain privacy and performance. This design may affect how throughput is reflected in network speed tests that typically open several simultaneous connections to deliver the highest possible result. While some speed test measurements may appear lower when Private Relay is enabled, your actual browsing experience remains fast and private.</p>
