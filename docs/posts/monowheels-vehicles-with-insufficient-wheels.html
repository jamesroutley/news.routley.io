    <h1>Monowheels: Vehicles with Insufficient Wheels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><SPAN color="BROWN"><h5>The Sociable Monowheel: 1896?<SPAN color="BLACK">
<p>
In the early days of cycling, a &#34;sociable&#34; was a design carrying two or more people, preferably side-by-side to facilitate conversation.
</p><p>
The engraving comes from the book &#34;Bicycles and Tricycles&#34; by Archibald Sharp, an extremely comprehensive work that does not shrink from examining the structural strength of bicycle frames and the kinematics of chainwheels. The only reference to this monowheel in the text baldly calls it: &#34;a sociable monocycle... for two riders.&#34; And that&#39;s all he wrote.
</p><p>
The rather crude drawing does not appear to be copied from a photograph, and it seemed to me unlikely that such a machine was ever built. The problems of two people co-ordinating the balancing and steering would be severe.
</p><p>
However, Brent Cardani tells me:
</p><p>
&#34;I found that a sociable monocycle was produced by Pearce in 1881. This is according to &#34;The History and Development of Cycles&#34; by C.F. Caunter, published in 1955 &#34;for the Science Museum by Her Majesty&#39;s Stationery Office&#34;. Alas, there are no pictures of the contraption, but the description in the text seems to describe exactly what is shown in the picture on your site.&#34;</p><p>
An interesting point is that such a machine could <i>only</i> be used with two riders- unlike a conventional tandem which can be ridden by one.
