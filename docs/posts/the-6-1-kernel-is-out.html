    <h1>The 6.1 kernel is out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Linus has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-%3Dwj_HcgFZNyZHTLJ7qC2613zphKDtLh6ndciwopZRfH0aQ%40mail.gmail.com/">released</a> the 6.1 kernel; he is preparing for a tricky holiday merge window:
</p><blockquote>
So here we are, a week late, but last week was nice and slow, and I&#39;m
much happier about the state of 6.1 than I was a couple of weeks ago
when things didn&#39;t seem to be slowing down.
<p>
Of course, that means that now we have the merge window from hell,
just before the holidays, with me having some pre-holiday travel
coming up too. So while delaying things for a week was the right thing
to do, it does make the timing for the 6.2 merge window awkward.
</p></blockquote>
