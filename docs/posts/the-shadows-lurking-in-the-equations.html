                        For all the history of computational mathematical visualization, <span>graphing equations has been done in binary mode</span> - where graphs show only where an equation is EXACTLY equal. But when you only see in black-and-white, some things are invisible. For all this time, lurking beneath the error == 0 surface, <span>mathematical shadows</span> have been lurking in the equations.</p>
                        <p>FuzzyGraph, on the other hand, <span>visualizes equations in Non-Binary mode</span> - showing not only where an equation are exactly equal, but also where the equation <span>nearly equal</span> and where the equation is <span>far from equal</span> (where the error is high). Sometimes, these high error areas form clear visual shadow-like features.</p>

                        <p>Let&#39;s look at some examples...</p>

                        <h2 id="slashdot">Example 1: Slash Dot Equation</h2>

                        <p>Here is the &#34;Slash Dot&#34; Equation ( \( \frac{y}{x^2+y^2} = \frac{x+1}{x^2+y^2} \)) as both a conventional and fuzzy graph...</p>

                        <section>
                          
                        </section>

                        <p>Note the giant black hole that is present in the Fuzzy/Non-Binary graph, but invisible in conventional/Binary graphing. This &#34;black hole&#34; feature represents a region of high error in the equation.</p>


                        <h2 id="quasar">Example 2: Quasar Equation</h2>

                        <p>Let&#39;s look at another example: \(y = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \)

                        </p><section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>Notice that the <span>black hole eye-looking features are COMPLETELY INVISIBLE</span> in the conventional/binary mode of graphing.</p>


                        <h2 id="simple-black-hole">Example 3: Simple Star and Black Hole</h2>

                        <p>To get a better idea of what these black hole things are, let&#39;s look at a simpler example. First let&#39;s look at the opposite of a black hole - a simple star/particle example: \( x^2 + y^2 = 0 \). For this equation, there is only 1 solution: (0, 0). So if you <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tkzm7jpjaf">graph this in a conventional graphing app</a>, it will only show a single dot at (0, 0). But in FuzzyGraph, it looks like a fuzzy particle or something.</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>But now, let&#39;s invert this to get the &#34;Black Hole Equation&#34;: \( \frac{1}{x^2+y^2} = 0 \)...</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>In this case, there is absolutely nothing to show on a conventional graph, as there are actual solutions to this equations. However, there is still a mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography">topography</a> which can be visualized (as can be seen in the fuzzy graph).</p>


                        <h2 id="shadow-lines">Example 4: Shadow Line</h2>

                        <p>Not all of the <span>Shadows</span> are like black holes.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this example, let&#39;s start by combining 2 lines together: \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\).</p>
                        <p>We can visually add 2 equations together by refactoring them so they are both equal to 0, and then multiplying the two refactored equations together. \(y=x\) can be changed to \(y-x=0\), and \(y=-x\) can be refactored to \(y+x=0\).</p>
                        <p>We can then combine 2 into a single equation these like this: \( (y-x) \times (y+x) = 0 \)</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>And now, <span>let&#39;s invert one of the equations using division</span>: \( \frac{x-y}{x+y} = 0 \)</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>So as you can see, the line that was inverted (under the division line) is now a <span>Shadow Line</span>. And this seems like a more &#34;correct&#34; way to visualize this than as the conventional graph shows it (which is indistinguishable from the simpler equation, \(y-x=0\)).</p>

                        <h2 id="phi-equation">Example 5: Phi Equation</h2>

                        <p>This equation works almost exactly as the previous. And like before, let&#39;s start with multiplication to combine 2 equations (in this case, a circle and a vertical line equation): \( x \times (x^2+y^2-1) = 0 \). </p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>But now, let&#39;s <span>invert the circle by using division</span>, which makes the equation: \( \frac{x}{x^2+y^2-1} = 0 \).</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>Note that the <span>Shadow Circle is invisible in the conventional graph</span>. In fact, the conventional graph looks identical to a conventional graph of the \(x=0\) equation (as if the denominator was not there).</p>


                        <h2 id="underwater-islands">Example 6: Underwater Islands</h2>

                        <p>In all of these previous examples, the &#34;shadows&#34; have represented areas of high error. But in this last example, we&#39;ll see some hidden details that represent areas of low error - areas that are <span>nearly</span> solutions to the equation.</p>

                        <p>Consider the equation, \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.7y) \), as both a conventional graph and a fuzzy graph:</p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>Note the floating dots in the fuzzy graph version that are not there in the conventional/binary graph. These are like underwater islands - underwater mountains that are just below the surface of the water (or in this case, the \( error == 0 \) surface). These hidden islands represent area that are near-solutions to the equation (which are only visible in FuzzyGraph).</p>
                        <p>Their presense hints that we can tweak the equation slightly to cause them to burst above the surface of the water (which should also make them visible in conventional graphs).</p>
                        <p>So let&#39;s change the equation from: </p>

                        <section>
                          
						</section>

                        <p>And as you can see, <span>those previously-hidden islands are now visible in the conventional graph</span>. </p><p>So Fuzzy/non-binary graphing can help us see features of the mathematical topography that are completely invisible with conventional/binary.</p>
