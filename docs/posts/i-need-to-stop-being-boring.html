    <h1>I need to stop being boring</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This week, I felt pretty depressed and lost my motivation and focus. After launching <a href="https://www.space4.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space4</a>, I got some signups from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30625797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HackerNews</a>, but no one was really using the app. Including myself.</p>



<p>“Will people even use this? Am I doing the wrong thing again?”, I wondered.</p>



<p>It sucks. This is not unfamiliar to me because I have failed many projects before. This time is a bit different. I knew the problem was valid since many people have trouble staying focused. There are many successful focus apps in the market to prove that. During the prototyping, I also researched and asked friends for fresh perspectives. Furthermore, I tried to innovate by combining the app with ambiance sounds and an online community. Most importantly, the app got more tractions than all the previous projects.</p>



<p>I seem to do a better job this time. However, I don’t feel right.</p>



<p>After asking for help from <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/need-help-reviewing-my-focus-app-d0bb0e0c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Hackers</a> and friends, I know what improvements I can make. Simplifying the landing page, a goal-setting feature, improving UX…etc.</p>



<p>I also know that I shouldn’t dismiss the idea easily because it doesn’t work at first. And I believe success usually comes after perseverance and not giving up.</p>



<p>But deep down in my heart, I have this scary feeling that I am no longer passionate about coding and building stuff. I feel bored, uninspired, and unmotivated. I am lost.</p>



<p> II did sleep well, eat well, and exercise regularly. I don’t have a problem physiologically. I am generally happy and optimistic, so I am psychologically healthy.</p>



<p>So what went wrong? My gut feeling is that <strong>I am boring</strong>.</p>



<p>I lost my creativity and the sense of wonder I used to have in childhood. I am no longer curious because I am settled for the world as it is. I accept things the way they are instead of imagining how they could be.</p>



<p>I follow trends to avoid being wrong. I play safe instead of being adventurous. I am afraid of failure – fear of being judged, fear of getting started, and fear of the unknown.</p>



<p>I am kinda sick of this. I need to make a change. I need to think differently and have my own opinions. I need to pick a fight and stop trying to please everybody. I need to unleash the child within.</p>



<p>Most of all, I need to stop <strong>being boring</strong>.</p>
