    <h1>N8n raises $180M</h1>

		<blockquote>We just raised $180 million in Series C funding, bringing our total funding to $240 million and our valuation to $2.5 billion. </blockquote><p>This investment recognises something fundamental: the AI race isn&#39;t only about smarter models - it&#39;s about who can actually put that intelligence to work reliably, inside actual businesses.</p><p>The AI agent landscape has split into two camps. Some platforms put everything in the hands of AI, you write prompts and hope for the best, with the entire logic determined by the model&#39;s interpretation. Others require strict, rule-based routing which is powerful for engineers who code every pathway, but impractical for business users who need to iterate quickly.</p><p>We&#39;ve learnt from our community that neither extreme serves businesses well. Pure autonomy creates magic when it works but proves too unpredictable for business-critical workflows. Pure rule-based routing offers predictability but demands more time and often developers for every change.</p><p><strong>n8n was built for the reality in between: giving flexible control over where your agents sit on this spectrum</strong>. You choose the balance - how much autonomy to grant, how much logic to enforce, and crucially, how to adjust that balance as you learn what works.</p><p>But controlling this balance is only the foundation. Getting agents into production requires two more crucial elements:</p><p><strong>Orchestration</strong>: Connecting agents to your actual tools and data sources, building in human oversight where needed, and establishing the monitoring and triggers that keep everything running</p><p><strong>Coordination</strong>: Bringing together the people who understand the business need with the builders who can make it work - on the same platform, in real time</p><p>Without both, organisations get stuck in endless development cycles. Engineers build in isolation, business users test and provide feedback, iterations drag on. The agent never reaches production because the people closest to the work can&#39;t collaborate effectively with those building the solution.</p><p><strong>The formula we&#39;ve proven is straightforward: combine AI, code, and humans in the same process, on the same platform</strong>. Technical builders handle architecture whilst domain experts configure and refine. That&#39;s coordination, and it only succeeds when the orchestration layer is flexible enough to evolve with your needs.</p><h2 id="our-principles">Our principles</h2><p>We&#39;ve been building n8n since 2019, first as an automation tool, then as a platform for AI orchestration and cross-team collaboration. Now we&#39;re the platform our community and enterprises tell us finally helps them deploy AI in production. </p><p>We&#39;ve built this alongside a fast-growing community contributing videos, templates, nodes, and more. <strong>A community we&#39;ll never stop caring about or restrict access to. Ever.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Flexibility will always be a top product priority. Flexibility to pick any model, connect any tool, and deploy anywhere: our cloud, your server, a Raspberry Pi, or bare metal. Flexibility in the product so it&#39;s easy enough to make a quick start but robust enough to handle orchestration&#39;s natural complexity.</p><p>From tinkerers automating lights at home to the United Nations running mission-critical workflows at scale, our ambition is clear: <strong>n8n becomes the default platform to build with AI</strong>. And more importantly, to deploy AI.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h2><p>We&#39;ve made so much progress this year alone: 6x user growth, 10x revenue growth, and major new features like <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/">Evaluations</a>, <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-tables/">Data Tables</a>, and <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/">many more</a> improvements. Yet it still feels early.</p><p>The industry is moving fast, and so are we. This funding accelerates our roadmap: expanding our integrations, empowering the ecosystem to build their own nodes and share them globally, and evolving n8n beyond the canvas into new interfaces that match how different teams work. We&#39;re making the platform easier to start with whilst more powerful at scale - because that&#39;s what production AI demands. (<a href="https://n8n.io/careers/">We&#39;re hiring!</a>)</p><p>Our community is already pushing n8n from a platform into an ecosystem. We&#39;re rapidly seeing people build their own businesses around n8n, and we want to support the community to take this further: with education, early access to features, commercial partnerships, and fun <a href="https://luma.com/n8n-events">events</a> to bring everyone together.</p><p>I started n8n to remove repetitive tasks and focus on what I actually enjoyed. Now I see a world where building with AI, leveraging agents to scale yourself, and becoming a 10x operator becomes table stakes, just as using Excel is. The first people who knew Excel were special, but now it&#39;s a requirement for many roles.</p><p>The same will happen with AI. And my ambition is that n8n becomes the default platform to build with it.</p>
