    <p><a href="https://futureland.tv">Futureland</a> is a journaling platform that helps you build habits or learn new skills through daily posting and activity streaks.</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/fl-overview.jpg"/></p>

<p>This is the tale of my redesign of the Futureland (FL) web app over the last year â€“ how I started, what I did, and what I learned.</p>



<p>I chanced upon FL when looking for a place to write <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/pirijan-meta">rough thoughts</a> and <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/kinopio-development-diary">development diaries</a> that I wanted to share. Creating journals and posting was straight-forward, and I liked itâ€™s light-weight feel, simple aesthetic and tight-knit community,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/fl-original.jpeg"/></p>

  <figcaption>The original UI</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But while trying it out, I kept giving myself paper cuts on confusing parts of the interface,</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/45713">sidebar</a> grouped journals under â€˜Allâ€™,â€™Dailyâ€™, and â€˜Shadowsâ€™, but it was never explained what these meant</li>
  <li>On small screens, <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/49579">important controls</a> were hidden inside a <a href="https://gerrymcgovern.com/the-hamburger-menu-and-the-zombie-apocalypse">hamburger menu</a>, or removed altogether</li>
  <li>When opening a journal, the sidebar that listed your journals would slide away, with no obvious way to get it back</li>
</ul>


<figure>
  <figcaption>Opening a journal and completely losing navigation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cumulative result of these paper cuts was an interface that appeared minimalist but required regular pauses in workflow to remember how to use.</p>

<p>I posted about these issues, in case it was helpful, with no expectation of anything more coming of it. But the founder and lead developer, <a href="https://futureland.tv/vin">Vin</a> and <a href="https://futureland.tv/lucas">Lucas</a> replied, and later on asked if Iâ€™d like to help make FL more usable.</p>

<p>My goal has always been to work on Kinopio full-time. But especially back then, the extra money would be very much welcome, to stay alive and occasionally buy nice things.</p>

<p>Making mockups is easy, communicating is hard. So the first thing to do was establish a shared foundation and vision. I started by asking questions to understand the thinking behind the existing design, and by collecting feedback from the community.</p>

<p>Adapting Maslowâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs">hierarchy of needs</a>, I proposed a <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/45672">pyramid of needs</a> for Futureland, with basic usability as itâ€™s foundation.</p>

<p>FL already had vocal power-users whoâ€™d climbed it pretty high up the pyramid by being manually 1:1 onboarded by Vin, but basic usability issues still slowed them down and were a barrier for newcomers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ðŸ•Š The first way to make an interface feel intuitive is by grouping together related controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It made sense to do this by making the <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/47587">sidebar</a> the â€˜homeâ€™ of the interface with new responsibilities,</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Organizing and navigating journals, teaching tips</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Creating journals, user profile, search, discovery</li>
</ul>

<p>I started by proposing <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/47622">little adjustments</a> and drawing new icons and controls for basic journal creation and navigation. By necessity, I was already updating the visual appearance of controls to fit inside the sidebar</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/fl-daily.png" alt=""/></p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>An early update to the sidebar</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that the fundamentals were set, this was a good time to step back and shape an aesthetic unique to FL.</p>



<p>We used Kinopio to create a <a href="https://kinopio.club/-futureland-moodboard-fbJXhE9nYFtB-rDv1Z-pK">Mood Board space</a>.</p>

<p>I started with Vinâ€™s original inspirations which I described as <code>sleek, graphic, minimalist</code></p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/moodboard-1.png"/></p>

<p>We then added new images and commented on what we liked about them,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/moodboard-2.png"/></p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/moodboard-3.png"/></p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/moodboard-4.png"/></p>

<p>One of the themes that resonated were bright spot colors,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/moodboard-5.png"/></p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>The phrase â€˜colourful abilitiesâ€™ was also interesting to me</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This gave me the idea for tying color to function. Users wouldnâ€™t need this to explicitly explained â€“ they would naturally form associations between like colored controls which would help them parse and learn the interface.</p>

<table>

      <th>Function Color</th>

      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

      <td>Scheduling</td>
      <td><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/schedule2.png"/></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I used this system to design self-documenting components that were easy to develop against, and allowed the rest of the team to build new and consistent UI without needing me. Broadly speaking, these include,</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>

<h2 id="some-stuff-i-did">Some Stuff I Did</h2>

<p>I was only contracting 1-2 days a week. To make the most of that time, Vin would summarize the community, product, and business problems or aspirations of the week, and Iâ€™d tackle these in public in the <a href="https://futureland.tv/vin/futureland-design">Futureland.design journal</a>.</p>

<p>We managed to touch almost every part of FL â€“ here are some highlights,</p>

<h2 id="organizing-journals-onboarding-and-grouping">Organizing Journals, Onboarding, and Grouping</h2>

<p>On FL, journals are separated by posting frequency. Journals you post to regularly are <code>Today</code> journals, and everything else is <code>Not Today</code>. <code>Today</code> journals are listed first and show activity streak counts to encourage frequent updates.</p>

<p>The <code>Today, Not Today</code> concept is a little hard to explain though, so dismiss-able inline tips are meant to gently guide new users towards that use, without being dogmatic about it.</p>


<figure>
  <figcaption>Jumping between your â€˜Todayâ€™ and â€˜Not Todayâ€™ journals</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Additionally, a welcome journal was added for new users with more in-depth explanations,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/welcome-journal4.png"/></p>

<p>Once people started creating dozens of journals, they wanted more ways to organize them so we added custom groups</p>



<h2 id="streak-history-and-scheduling">Streak History and Scheduling</h2>

<p>Posting everyday to a journal increments an activity streak count that is publicly shared.</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/profile-streaks.png"/></p>

<p>As people grew ever-higher streak counts, they got more anxious about losing them. Requests started coming in for ways to conditionally forgive missing a streak. In response, others raised concerns about diluting the meaning of a streak.</p>

<p>Public streaks â€“ which therefore have social value â€“ are potentially toxic. But we softened the preciousness and anxiety associated with streaks through:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/102459">Streak History</a>, so if you lose a streak youâ€™ll still have a record of it that is publicly visible </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/entry/140255">Scheduled Journals</a>, that let you customize streak frequency. This flexibility makes growing streaks easier, reducing their rarity and public value </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="posting">Posting</h2>

<p>Posting to your journals is the most important interaction on FL. Most posts on FL are short breezy updates, but occasionally someone will publish a couple paragraphs. Youâ€™re also able to publish private posts in a public journal.</p>



<p>Building features out as responsive components allows this same interface and code to be reused in other contexts, like quick-posting from in the sidebar,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/new-post-dialog.png"/></p>



<p>Sometimes <em>feeling</em> fast, is more important than actually being fast. This is especially the case when publishing a new post or comment.</p>

<p>When publishing content on FL, you had to wait until the server successfully responded before you were allowed to do something else. Whether consciously or not, these sorts of penalties for interaction naturally discourage future interactions.</p>

<p>The work here was describing how to eliminate these delays using a principle I like to call <code>assume success</code>,</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/embrace-success-space4.png"/></p>

<p>In the rare case that the server responds with an error, FL asynchronously notifies you of the issue and lets you handle it in your own time</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/error-notification.png"/></p>

<p>Iâ€™m particularly happy with how this turned out IRL, Lucas did a great job implementing this.</p>

<h2 id="the-web-app-is-the-best-app">The Web App is the Best App</h2>



<p>The sum of all these changes and others means that every feature of Futureland is now completely usable on Android and iOS. Having less platform specific code to maintain helps a small team do more with less â€“ hopefully for years to come.</p>



<p>I stopped working on FL a couple months ago to refocus on Kinopio full-time.</p>

<p>Looking back, this was my first time working as a contractor. I used a simple <a href="https://kinopio.club/-futureland-time-tracking-trnAFer9T5m1_mHdAOnW4">time tracking space</a> to track my billable hours, which Iâ€™d compile into an invoice at the end of each month or so.</p>

<p><img src="http://pketh.org/images/2022/fl/time-tracking.png"/></p>

<p>The main thing I wish I did differently was charge by the day instead of hourly to give myself a bit more breathing room to think long-term without the feeling that I had to make every second count.</p>

<p>So would I do it again? Iâ€™m not sure.</p>

<p>On one hand, it was pretty stressful working on two products at the same time. On the other, the perspective from being placed inside the beating heart of another community helped inspire Kinopio features like <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1354093037580738560">notifications</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1466552573364772874">weekly review emails</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not so often in life that you get to help grow a new and promising community. Iâ€™ve been lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been here a couple times. The only constant is that itâ€™s different every time.</p>

<p>Working with Futureland was a unique and interesting experience that Iâ€™m happy to have been a part of.</p>
