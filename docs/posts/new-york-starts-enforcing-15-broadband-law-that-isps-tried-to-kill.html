    <h1>New York starts enforcing $15 broadband law that ISPs tried to kill</h1>

<h2>1.7 million New York households lost FCC discount</h2>
<p>The order said quick implementation of the law is important because of &#34;developments at the federal level impacting the affordability of broadband service.&#34; About 1.7 million New York households, and 23 million nationwide, used to receive a monthly discount through an FCC program that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/">expired in mid-2024</a> after Congress failed to provide more funding.</p>
<p>&#34;For this reason, consumer benefit programs assisting low-income households—such as the ABA—are even more critical to ensure that the digital divide for low-income New Yorkers is being addressed,&#34; the New York order said.</p>
<p>New York ISPs can obtain an exemption from the low-cost broadband law if they &#34;provide service to no more than 20,000 households and the Commission determines that compliance with such requirements would result in &#39;unreasonable or unsustainable financial impact on the broadband service provider,&#39;&#34; the order said.</p>
<p>Over 40 small ISPs filed for exemptions in 2021 before the law was blocked by a judge. Those ISPs and potentially others will be given one-month exemptions if they file paperwork by Wednesday stating that they meet the subscriber threshold. ISPs must submit detailed financial information by February 15 to obtain longer-term exemptions.</p>
<p>&#34;All other ISPs (i.e., those with more than 20,000 subscribers) must comply with the ABA by January 15, 2025,&#34; the order said. Failure to comply can be punished with civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation. The law applies to wireline, fixed wireless, and satellite providers.</p>
<p>Charter Spectrum currently <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/internet/spectrum-internet-assist">advertises</a> a $25-per-month plan with 50Mbps speeds for low-income households. <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/acp">Comcast</a> and <a href="https://www.optimumadvantageinternet.com/">Optimum</a> have $15 plans. Verizon has a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/discounts/verizon-forward/">low-income program</a> reducing the cost of some home Internet plans to as low as $20 a month.</p>
