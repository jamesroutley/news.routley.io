<p>The source code for many of Infocom&#39;s foundational text-parsing adventure games, including <em>Zork</em>, has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-for-all-infocom-text-adventure-classics/">been available since 2019</a>. But that code doesn&#39;t do anything for modern computers, nor even computers of the era, when it comes to actually running the games.</p>
<p>Most of Infocom&#39;s games were written in &#34;Zork Implementation Language,&#34; which was native to no particular platform or processor, but ready to be interpreted on all kinds of systems by versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine">its Z-Machine</a>. The Z-Machine could be considered the first real game development engine, so long as nobody fact-checks that statement too hard. Lots of work has been done in open source realms to create modern, and improved, <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/List_of_Z-machine_interpreters">versions of these interpreters</a> for pretty much every device imaginable.</p>
<p>The source code for these Z-Machine implementations (virtual machines, in today&#39;s parlance) appeared like a grue from the dark a few days ago in <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">a GitHub repository</a> owned by <a href="https://www.eblong.com/zarf/">Andrew Plotkin</a>. Plotkin, a major figure in modern and classic text adventure realms (and <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/if.html#sofar">lots in between</a>), details what they are and how he found them in <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2023/11/infocom-interpreters">a blog post on his site</a>.</p>
<p>Midway through a lengthy discussion on an interactive fiction forum about Infocom interpreters and modern standards for documenting them, a message <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/updating-the-z-machine-standard-documents/64519/123">drops out of nowhere</a> about a multi-decade mystery: &#34;I have the source of what is likely most of Infocom’s interpreters. Until you mentioned it, I had no idea it wasn’t publicly available.&#34; Plotkin responds, just over an hour later, that they&#39;re taking it to private chat. Then someone else <a href="https://github.com/DFillmore/infocom-ibm-zcode-terps">posted the IBM PC interpreter source</a> in the fashion of everybody&#39;s memory suddenly being jogged.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As Plotkin notes, the interpreter source code doesn&#39;t have a lot of interesting, personal, or other revealing comments or artifacts. It does contain some unintentional commentary on what it was like trying to produce commercial software in the 1980s:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#39;s a bunch of internal documentation about <em>creating</em> disks for the various platforms. Remember that in the 1980s, floppy disks were pretty incompatible between platforms. To write a C64 disk, you had to get the game data and interpreter <em>onto a C64</em> which could then write it to disk. But how did you do that? No Wifi, no Ethernet port... Infocom&#39;s solution was to run a serial cable from their DEC-20 (where all the games were developed) to the C64 (or wherever). The serial transfer program is called &#34;TFTP&#34; in most of these folders. Do strings like <code>com1:9600,n,8</code> turn you on? You might be a serial port!</p></blockquote>
<p>Plotkin also notes that he dropped the files on GitHub without announcing it or making &#34;a big fuss.&#34; That&#39;s because he&#39;s actively negotiating with Infocom&#39;s modern rights-holders to open-source the legendary firm&#39;s work. For a while, that meant Activision, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208202724/web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/infocom/">acquired Infocom in 1986</a>. Now, it means Microsoft, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/microsoft-finally-owns-candy-crush-as-it-closes-69b-activision-blizzard-deal/">acquired Activision in October</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;A lawyer would say, &#39;Don&#39;t keep releasing source code while you&#39;re negotiating with the original rights-holder.&#39; That would be good legal advice,&#34; Plotkin wrote. &#34;I, er, ignored the good-advice part of my brain there.&#34;</p>
<p>The Hackaday blog previously dug into <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/22/zork-and-the-z-machine-bringing-the-mainframe-to-8-bit-home-computers/">the details of the Z-Machine</a> and how it brought DEC PDP-10 games to TRS-80s and other home computers. You can find out much more about the Zork Implementation Language, itself a chopped-down version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language%29">the Model Development Language (MDL)</a>, in &#34;<a href="https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995">Learning ZIL</a>,&#34; an Infocom instruction manual for the language posted to the Internet Archive. Its subtitle is &#34;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Writing Interactive Fiction But Couldn&#39;t Find Anyone Still Working Here to Ask.&#34;</p>
