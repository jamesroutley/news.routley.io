    <h1>Quick Take: Language Lacunae and &#39;Good Enough&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>A lacuna is a gap in language—when a concept exists clearly in your mind but your language provides no word for it.</p>

<p>I noticed one yesterday: Hindi doesn’t have a direct translation for “good enough.” You can say “kaafi acha hai” (it’s quite good) or “theek hai” (it’s okay), but neither captures the specific meaning of “sufficient to meet requirements without excess.”</p>

<p>This matters because “good enough” is a fundamentally satisficing concept. It implies you’ve consciously stopped optimizing at a threshold. The Hindi approximations either praise (it’s good) or dismiss (it’s fine)—neither conveys “this meets the bar and I’m intentionally not exceeding it.”</p>

<p>Engineering culture runs on “good enough.” The 80/20 rule, MVP thinking, shipping over polishing—all depend on this concept. If your language lacks it, you either import the English or invent a phrase. Neither feels native.</p>

<p>I wonder how many other engineering concepts exist as lacunae in languages that evolved before industrialization. “Technical debt” seems like another candidate.</p>
