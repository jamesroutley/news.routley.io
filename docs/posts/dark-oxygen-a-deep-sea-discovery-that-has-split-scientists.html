</div><p>Could lumpy metallic rocks in the deepest, darkest reaches of the ocean be making oxygen in the absence of sunlight?</p>


										      
																																	<p>Some scientists think so, but others have challenged the claim that so-called &#34;dark oxygen&#34; is being produced in the lightless abyss of the seabed.</p>
<p>The discovery—detailed last July in the journal <i>Nature Geoscience</i>—called into question long-held assumptions about the origins of life on Earth, and sparked intense scientific debate.</p>
<p>The findings were also consequential for mining companies eager to extract the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/precious+metals/" rel="tag">precious metals</a> contained within these polymetallic nodules.</p>
<p>Researchers said that potato-sized nodules could be producing enough electrical current to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen, a process known as electrolysis.</p>
<p>This cast doubt on the long-established view that life was made possible when organisms started producing oxygen via photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, about 2.7 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#34;Deep-sea discovery calls into question the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/origins+of+life/" rel="tag">origins of life</a>,&#34; the Scottish Association for Marine Science said in a press release to accompany the publication of the research.</p>
<h2>Delicate ecosystem</h2>
<p>Environmentalists said the presence of dark oxygen showed just how little is known about life at these extreme depths, and supported their case that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/deep-sea+mining/" rel="tag">deep-sea mining</a> posed unacceptable ecological risks.</p>

<p>&#34;Greenpeace has long campaigned to stop deep sea mining from beginning in the Pacific due to the damage it could do to delicate, deep sea ecosystems,&#34; the environmental organization said.</p>
<p>&#34;This incredible discovery underlines the urgency of that call&#34;.</p>
<p>The discovery was made in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast underwater region of the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii of growing interest to mining companies.</p>
<p>Scattered on the seafloor four kilometers (2.5 miles) beneath the surface, polymetallic nodules contain manganese, nickel and cobalt, metals used in electric car batteries and other low-carbon technologies.</p>
<p>The research that gave rise to the dark oxygen discovery was partly funded by a Canadian deep-sea mining business, The Metals Company, that wanted to assess the ecological impact of such exploration.</p>
<p>It has sharply criticized the study by marine ecologist Andrew Sweetman and his team as plagued by &#34;methodological flaws&#34;.</p>
<p>Michael Clarke, environmental manager at The Metals Company, told AFP that the findings &#34;are more logically attributable to poor scientific technique and shoddy science than a never before observed phenomenon.&#34;</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Scientific doubts</h2>
<p>Sweetman&#39;s findings proved explosive, with many in the scientific community expressing reservations or rejecting the conclusions.</p>

<p>Since July, five academic research papers refuting Sweetman&#39;s findings have been submitted for review and publication.</p>
<p>&#34;He did not present clear proof for his observations and hypothesis,&#34; said Matthias Haeckel, a biogeochemist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany.</p>
<p>&#34;Many questions remain after the publication. So, now the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag">scientific community</a> needs to conduct similar experiments etc, and either prove or disprove it.&#34;</p>
<p>Olivier Rouxel, a geochemistry researcher at Ifremer, the French national institute for ocean science and technology, told AFP there was &#34;absolutely no consensus on these results&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Deep-sea sampling is always a challenge,&#34; he said, adding it was possible that the oxygen detected was &#34;trapped air bubbles&#34; in the measuring instruments.</p>
<p>He was also skeptical about deep-sea nodules, some tens of millions of years old, still producing enough electrical current when &#34;batteries run out quickly&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;How is it possible to maintain the capacity to generate electrical current in a nodule that is itself extremely slow to form?&#34; he asked.</p>
<p>When contacted by AFP, Sweetman indicated that he was preparing a formal response.</p>
<p>&#34;These types of back and forth are very common with scientific articles and it moves the subject matter forward,&#34; he said.</p>
