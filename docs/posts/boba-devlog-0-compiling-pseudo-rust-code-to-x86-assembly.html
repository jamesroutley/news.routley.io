    <h1>Boba Devlog #0: Compiling Pseudo-Rust Code to x86 Assembly</h1>

<a href="https://github.com/veera-sivarajan/boba">Boba</a> is a compiler I’m writing to learn how high-level language constructs can be expressed in assembly. It compiles Rust-like source code to 64-bit x86 instruction set. This post will describe the current status of the project.

<h2 id="org894146a"><span>1.</span> Language Overview</h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
The language’s syntax looks like Rust, but semantically its a lot like C with one big difference: here, the compiler does not care about declaration order in the global scope, so functions can be called before they are defined in the source code.
</p>
<div>
<pre>// Example program that can be compiled with Boba
fn main() -&gt; i64 {
    println(factorial(5));
    return 0;
}

fn factorial(num: i64) -&gt; i64 {
    if num &lt;= 1 {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return num * factorial(num - 1);
    }
}
</pre>

<h2 id="org834f1e5"><span>2.</span> Compiler Architecture</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
The compiler follows a traditional multi-pass architecture:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanner walks through every character in the source code and builds a list of tokens.</li>
<li>Parser builds a high-level AST by parsing the tokens with a recursive descent LL(1) parser. This step is very similar to parsing Lox in Crafting Interpreters.</li>
<li>Analyzer performs a bunch of static checks to verify that all the variables and functions in use are defined. Also, local variable names are resolved to their offset from the base register pointer <code>%rbp</code>. This step returns a low-level AST iff there are no semantic errors in the source code.</li>
<li>Code generator iterates over every node in the low-level AST and translates it to assembly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The high-level AST has token information which can be used to point an error message to a particular line and column number in the source code but the low-level AST gets rid of all token information and only knows about labels and offset from base pointer. The generated assembly is linked with the C standard library and converted to an ELF executable with the help of <code>gcc</code>. This allowed me to implement <code>println()</code> as a built-in function that calls <code>printf()</code>. Also, in theory, the generated code can call any C function because it follows the System V calling convention but I have not tested it yet.

<section id="outline-container-orgf0fe1f1">
<h2 id="orgf0fe1f1"><span>3.</span> Future Work</h2>
<div id="text-3">
<p>
There aren’t any optimization passes, so the generated code is verbose and inefficient. For example, a simple local variable declaration <code>let x = 10</code> gets translated into:
</p>
<div>
<pre>movq  $10, %rbx
movq  %rbx, -8(%rbp)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is because the code generator generates code for every node in the low-level AST. It has no way to know that those two instructions are related and can be combined into one. Also, there is no type system as 64-bit signed number is the only data type supported by the compiler.

<div id="text-4">
<p>
Chapters 10 - 12 in <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">Introduction to Compilers and Language Design</a> by Douglas Thain gave me a good idea about assembly language, code generation and optimization.
