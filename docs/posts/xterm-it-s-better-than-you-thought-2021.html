    <h1>Xterm: It&#39;s better than you thought (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>(Day 10 of <a href="https://aduros.com/blog/30-days-of-blogging">30 Days of Blogging</a>)</p>
<p>A couple months back I switched my terminal from xfce4-terminal to the venerable xterm. For some
reason I always put xterm in the same bucket as xclock, xmessage, or any other prehistoric command
starting with X that comes pre-installed on any graphical Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It was surprising to learn that xterm is still very much <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html">actively
developed</a>. Even more surprisingly, it turns out
xterm has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">incredibly low input latency</a> compared to modern
terminals. This is easy to test at home, try typing in xterm compared to any other terminal and feel
how much snappier it is.</p>
<p>The lower latency alone is worth the price of admission in my opinion, so I went about configuring
xterm as my default terminal. The configuration goes in <code>~/.Xresources</code> and you need to run <code>xrdb ~/.Xresources</code> after every change, or <a href="https://github.com/aduros/dotfiles/blob/eab476fc62e74e46cb41bb5c094cede7a28a014f/home/.config/nvim/options.vim#L27">make vim do
it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>Here are some “modern” sensible defaults I ended up landing on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Sensible defaults
XTerm.vt100.locale: false
XTerm.vt100.utf8: true
XTerm.vt100.scrollTtyOutput: false
XTerm.vt100.scrollKey: true
XTerm.vt100.bellIsUrgent: true
XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true
</code></pre></div><p>And here are some visual styling options, not including colors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Styling
XTerm.vt100.faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
XTerm.vt100.boldMode: false
XTerm.vt100.faceSize: 11
XTerm.vt100.internalBorder: 16
XTerm.borderWidth: 0
</code></pre></div><p>XTerm supports key binding, but the syntax is non-obvious:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;N: scroll-back(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;T: scroll-forw(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
</code></pre></div><p>This allows copying and pasting to the clipboard (not just the X selection) with shift-ctrl-C and V.
It also allows scrolling up and down with shift-ctrl-N and T (you can switch this to K and J to
match vim keys in Qwerty).</p>
<h2 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h2>
<p>So now we have a pretty usable setup, but there’s one more incredibly useful feature that was hard
to figure out: opening URLs in the browser. We could of course select the URL and copy-paste, but
there’s a better way.</p>
<p>XTerm has a configuration option called <code>printerCommand</code> which is a command that is piped all the
text currently visible in the terminal. As the name suggests, it’s meant to be used to implement
printing to physical paper, but we can save the trees and hijack it to instead scan the screen for
URLs and open the browser:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>#!/bin/sh -e
</span><span></span>
grep -Eo <span>&#39;\bhttps?://\S+\b&#39;</span> |
    uniq |
    ifne rofi -dmenu -i -p <span>&#34;Open URL&#34;</span> -auto-select |
    xargs xdg-open
</code></pre></div><p>This greps for URLs, removes consecutive duplicates with <code>uniq</code>, and displays a
<a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> menu to choose between them if there were multiple URLs.
<code>ifne</code> is included in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/moreutils">moreutils</a>. Put this
script in an executable file called <code>select-url</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> and then add this to <code>.Xresources</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.printerCommand: select-url

XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;W: print(noAttrs, noNewLine)
</code></pre></div><p>Now when you press shift-ctrl-W, any URL shown in the terminal will open in the browser. You don’t
have to select anything or use your mouse at all, nice!</p>
<p>Someday it would be great to improve <code>select-url</code> to also scan for email addresses. Maybe during the
next pandemic…</p>
<h2 id="peeking-at-the-alternate-screen">Peeking at the Alternate Screen</h2>
<p>Sometimes you open a fullscreen application like vim or a man page and you need to refer back to
some text on the shell. Use this keybind to toggle back and forth:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;H: set-altscreen(toggle)
</code></pre></div><p>You can even use it view a previously opened vim or man page after you close out of it!</p>
<h2 id="opening-new-terminals-at-the-current-directory">Opening New Terminals at the Current Directory</h2>
<p>There’s a keybind action called <code>spawn-new-terminal()</code> that can be used for this, but even better is
using <a href="https://github.com/schischi/xcwd">xcwd</a> to get the working directory of any currently focused
window. Then you can put this in your i3 config for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">bindsym $mod+Return exec --no-startup-id cd &#34;`xcwd`&#34; &amp;&amp; xterm
</code></pre></div><h2 id="wish-list">Wish List</h2>
<p>XTerm is missing a few small features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text reflow when the terminal is resized.</li>
<li>Fallback fonts don’t seem to always work. Maybe I’m missing a config option?</li>
<li>Transparency not natively supported. I don’t care about transparency but maybe it’s important to
some people.</li>
<li>Occasionally strange flickering with <a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom">picom</a>, possibly a bug
with picom?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end this wasn’t enough to stop me from using xterm, but the lack of text reflow still irks me
from time to time. Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with xterm after taking the time to
configure it.</p>
