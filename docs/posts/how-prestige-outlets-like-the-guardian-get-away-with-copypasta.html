    <h1>How prestige outlets like The Guardian get away with copypasta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Major media outlets are attacked over their politics (too left-wing, too right-wing, etc) all the time. But what’s not critiqued enough are the common practices behind how they write their articles, practices which are often terrible, misleading, and deeply dishonest. </p><p><span>I’m talking about what happens at the supposedly most prestigious organizations around, places like </span><em>The Guardian</em><span> or </span><em>The New York Times</em><span> (and a myriad of others). What I am here to tell you, as someone who writes online and therefore has some experience trying to put together pieces that I think hold up under scrutiny (which never means they’re perfect, but does mean I’m trying) is that it is incredibly common to find articles at these outlets that don’t hold up under minimal scrutiny, in which it’s obvious no one tried. I’m talking unprofessional. I’m talking basically lying by omission to their readers. And I’m talking </span><em>utterly useless</em><span> as an information source. If I used the same practices as the big outlets here, on Substack, everyone on the internet would be upset with me, and justifiably so. Paradoxically, these bad practices don’t affect how prestigious these publications are thought of, which is as the historical record of our very civilization.</span></p><p>What could outlets have possibly done to earn my ire? Let me give a couple examples of what I consider to be inexcusable practices that are not just common but essentially universal across the industry. </p><p>First, there is the practice that undermines any notion their purpose is to inform their readers. Which is that they don’t fucking cite anything.</p><p>Ever.</p><p><span>There are zero, zip, nada, links or citations. And I’m talking most of the time, for most of their articles.

But what matters is that a piece of writing should try to empower a reader, and the omnipresent lack of outside context indicates that the primary purpose of these websites is not to empower their readers.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png" width="1456" height="166" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:166,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:13296,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3adfb53-e833-4c64-aaf4-52676a705119_2912x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p><span>That’s only the beginning.

My point is that this practice is hidden, and made ambiguous so that the larger outlets appear to have done more investigative work (without linking or citing it). And it’s not like </span><em>The Guardian</em><span> is alone in this—almost everyone who reported on the viral story used either the same pull quote or other duplicates, from </span><em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/resurfaced-clip-tom-cruise-sparks-debate-scientology-psychiatry-1727315" rel="">Newsweek</a></em><span> to </span><em><a href="http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/psychology/serotonin-theory-depression-11021.html" rel="">Sci-news</a></em><span> to </span><em><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/07/220720080145.htm" rel="">Science Daily</a></em><span>, with only a few providing a link to any sort of source; for it is indeed a common practice to pawn off quotes by leaving the origin ambiguous. It’s all carefully worded so that there’s plausible deniability—they’re not lying, like they would be if they said “obtained by </span><em>The Guardian</em><span>” or anything like that. But they are misrepresenting, I think on purpose, to appear more authoritative than they actually are. If it’s an accident, it sure is a beneficial one that takes maximum advantage of the ambiguity. The letter of the law is upheld—they’re all just cribbing off the same press release—but the spirit of the law is lacking. And the same goes for how similar all the stories are, almost identical—it’s like watching a bunch of college first-years try to avoid plagiarism while working off the same cheat sheet. </span></p><p><span>This aspect of the news being copypasta is the sort of thing that once you start noticing it, you can’t stop, and so I want as many people to notice as possible. As you might have guessed, I was actually going to write about the very-public shift in the “chemical imbalances” theory of brain disorders, but I got stuck at this </span><em>Guardian</em><span> article, since I immediately suspected that the quotes were being pawned off without crediting the source.

It is the only hypothesis I know of that explains dreams’ strangeness, their Lynchian quality—which is especially important since it’s a quality that often contradicts other theories and is normally very hard to explain.</span></p><p><span>The paper got a lot of press.

And I never did. They just took it from somewhere else. </span></p><p><span>I suppose that some people might find this not shocking. After all, it’s not a lie. You don’t </span><em>have</em><span> to assume that they did the legwork to get that quote. They just leave it unsourced. It’s only a lie of omission. And a defender might point out that it’s only my assumption that readers think the reporters spoke to the people they’re quoting to begin with.</span></p><p>I can see the logic behind this response, but it doesn’t face the fact that if I were to be this cavalier, even once, it would be something I would be ashamed of, and additionally something I would be rightly called out on and try to correct. That’s a pretty simple litmus test—would I purposefully do it on Substack?—and these practices don’t pass. So I’ll be honest and say I think they dissemble in order to appear more authoritative than they actually are and to prevent the horrible realization of how these outlets actually function. For what most stories at major paper-of-record outlets are is copypasta, but due to practices like (a) not linking sources and (b) not crediting where statements come from, they are able to maintain the illusion that the copypasta is self-contained, original, and thoroughly investigated. If they actually sourced everything, then what would happen is that after a couple articles where you clicked through and found basically an identical article with the same quotes, the bloom would come off the rose real quick. And while it’s pretty much impossible to figure out what percent of articles these criticisms don’t apply to (perhaps by tracking, say, the pieces of investigative journalism that these outlets break), there is simply no way that the copypasta approach isn’t the majority, perhaps 95% or more in some places. </p><p><span>Oh, and the reason your computer slows down so much when you open these outlets (way slower than streaming HD video) is that a lot of these websites are loading not just dynamics ads but also analytic tracking software, or, even more intrusively, using your visiting computer to mine cryptocurrency. </span><em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/14/salon-disable-ad-blocker-or-let-us-mine-cryptocurrency-monero.html" rel="">Salon</a></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/14/salon-disable-ad-blocker-or-let-us-mine-cryptocurrency-monero.html" rel=""> has been open about </a><span>using your computer to mine, and there’s evidence </span><a href="https://www.pixalate.com/blog/coinhive-cryptocurrency-mining-cpu-site-list" rel="">CBS has as well</a><span>, but it’s rumored to be a quite wide-spread, if secretive, practice.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png" width="1456" height="166" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:166,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:12890,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e03aebe-87a1-426c-931c-24c2738bcce3_2912x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p>I want to point out that I’m not criticizing any particular journalist or writer—after all, they’re operating simply under the explicit guidelines they’ve been given, shackles they cannot break, and therefore cannot do things like include outside links or appropriately credit that the quotes came from another source, or put a more personal, interesting, or involved take on a story to avoid the copypasta effect. Many of them want to do all that, and are prevented—I say that because I personally know, respect, and am friendly with multiple people, like journalists and science writers and freelancers, who’ve worked for these institutions. Heck, I’ve written for these sort of outlets. So I want to make clear my criticism is of the guidelines of the institutions that hem their authors in. I want to see writers set free. </p><p><span>Also, if you’re a long-time fan of the institutions themselves, I understand that these criticisms may seem unfair; after all, they put out dozens of new takes every day, often within 24 hours of when it actually happens, and therefore one could argue that they provide a valuable service, even if they don’t do it in the way I would want. This is why as writers continue to move to start independent publications like this one, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/substack-newsletters-are-unbundling-the-news-industry" rel="">the “unbundling” of media</a><span> has been discussed mostly as if it’s a bad thing, as if it were dangerous to leave, say, long-form articles about some new scientific discovery to individuals rather than trusted institutions. But I don’t think this argument holds much water, at least for most subjects. For if these are the legacy practices we’re leaving behind, then I don’t see how it’s not an objective improvement. And maybe this is just local to my part of the internet, but it certainly feels like the standards are higher for individuals than what’s on display at major outlets. I don’t say that because individuals are so great, I say that because they seem to be at least trying to empower readers, and are quite easy to hold to account, and legacy outlets are explicitly not trying, and are difficult to hold to account, so therefore are allowed to evolve disingenuous practices that conveniently cultivate a false authority. So maybe following a bunch of independent authors, journalists, and thinkers who would feel bad about (and be called out for) pumping out unsourced copypasta with uncredited quotes that crypto-mines your computer is going to end up with the average reader being more informed, not less, and may, here’s a shocker, actually be a significant boon for our culture.</span></p><p><span>Plus, we allow comments. They mostly don’t, ever </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/brief-history-of-the-demise-of-the-comments-timeline/" rel="">since around 2013</a><span>.
