    <h1>Tell HN: Postman update removes all your stuff if you refuse to create account</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been using postman offline without an account for a long time.  Today when I opened the program it asked me to create an account.  When I declined, it wiped all my collections and everything else.</p><p>All I have is a &#39;history&#39; to work with and try to piece back together all the variables and collections that I had setup.</p><p>I relented and created an account, but it did not recover anything.  Beware!</p><p>Update: I was able to manually import/restore using a backup I found in ~/.config/Postman but I have no trust for continued use of this tool.  Any alternatives that I can migrate to?</p></div></div></div>
