				<h3>Back from the stars with Thomas Pesquet</h3>
								
				
				<p>After spending almost 200 days on the International Space Station and setting a new European record for spacewalks, Thomas Pesquet is now back on Earth! Early November, the ESA astronaut returned to our planet on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, bringing his Alpha Mission to an end – although the research continues. In this programme, we look back on his second mission in space and get an exclusive interview with Thomas, freshly landed on European soil. Highlights also include the conversations he held from space with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as with the rock band Coldplay. What’s next for Thomas? We hear from David Parker, ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, to discuss upcoming missions, including sending humans back to the Moon.</p>

It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved.</p>

				<h3>Back from the stars with Thomas Pesquet</h3>
								
				
				<p>After spending almost 200 days on the International Space Station and setting a new European record for spacewalks, Thomas Pesquet is now back on Earth! Early November, the ESA astronaut returned to our planet on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, bringing his Alpha Mission to an end – although the research continues. In this programme, we look back on his second mission in space and get an exclusive interview with Thomas, freshly landed on European soil. Highlights also include the conversations he held from space with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as with the rock band Coldplay. What’s next for Thomas? We hear from David Parker, ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, to discuss upcoming missions, including sending humans back to the Moon.</p>

				<h3>The making of JUICE</h3>
								
				
				<p>In this special programme, filmmaker Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called JUICE. It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved.</p>

				<h3>What’s space got to do with it?</h3>
								
				
				<p>From air quality to growing blood vessels, see how space is part of our everyday lives. Satellites flying high above our heads are providing information and support services that benefit us directly – and we may not even know it. In addition, the technology built for and tested in space can be used here on Earth for innovative applications.</p>

				<p>Rising temperatures, melting ice…How will glaciers look over the coming decades? “It all depends on what humans are doing now in terms of greenhouse gas emissions”: this is the message one scientist delivered during an ESA-led expedition to the Gorner Glacier in Switzerland filmed during summer 2021. As world leaders gather in Glasgow for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of Parties, this new documentary highlights how rising global temperatures are taking their toll on glaciers. Put your boots on and join ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, glaciologists and climate experts on the ice!</p>

				<h3>ROUGH CUT: Matthias’s launch</h3>
								
				
				<p>…and liftoff! ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer finally launched into space early November, alongside three NASA astronauts, Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron. Collectively known as “Crew-3”, the astronauts were launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on board the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft “Endurance”. Watch Matthias’s last moments before launch, his first reaction as he reaches zero gravity, his docking to the ISS and the final hatch opening. Minimal editing, sometimes no sound at all (just like in space!), pure moments: this is Rough Cut.</p>

				<p>Who wants to join the next class of ESA astronauts? More than 23 000 people do : that’s a record number of applicants for the vacancy notice published earlier this year. It’s also a rare opportunity : ESA is recruiting four to six new astronauts for the first time since 2008. So, what’s the recruitment process? How long will it take to hire and train the next generation of astronauts? Watch this programme to learn more. ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet shares his best tips for the recruitment process and Matthias Maurer tells how astronauts train for survival. He will be the next ESA astronaut to launch into space this autumn for his first mission called Cosmic Kiss.</p>

Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved.</p>

				<h3>The making of JUICE</h3>
								
				
				<p>In this special programme, filmmaker Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called JUICE. It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved.</p>

				<h3>Meet the experts</h3>
								
				
				<p>Experts from a variety of space activities talk about their respective fields and why they are important. This hour-long programme begins with an introduction to how rockets launch from Earth…and other planets. We then look to the future of Moon exploration, and how life in the isolation of space is being prepared for in remote Antarctica. Scientists working with data from satellites that look out in space and back at Earth tell us about their research and what it means. Get an insider’s look at the satellite systems that tell us where we are and how to get to where we want to go, and discover the efforts being made to keep space clean. Finally, see how a sports scientists works with astronauts, and meet a member of a team that prepares for the future of the space sector.</p>
