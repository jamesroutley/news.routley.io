<p>As always, there have been a lot of announcements and product reveals at this year’s Computex, but it’s not just the big brands who have a presence at the show, there are plenty of smaller firms fighting for the world’s attention.</p><p>One of those is German PC maker Schenker, which showed off its prototype laptop powered by a Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chip. While most people would expect Qualcomm’s latest processor to be used to exclusively power Windows systems, given the big push for Copilot+PCs, this developmental model runs Linux and looks destined to be sold by Tuxedo Computers.</p><p>The prototype notebook is housed in a premium all-aluminum body and weighs just 1.36kg. It’s powered by the Snapdragon X Elite which has 12 cores and a 20W TDP. The 14-inch 16:10 IPS display (2560 x 1600) offers 400 nits maximum brightness and 100% sRGB coverage.</p><h2 id="still-some-wrinkles-to-iron-out-3">Still some wrinkles to iron out</h2><p>The Tuxedo prototype comes with 32 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and storage will be via a M.2-2280 Gen 4 slot. In terms of ports, it offers HDMI and USB4, plus at least two USB-A ports (one on either side), but beyond that we’re not sure, and of course the specs may change in the final version. It comes with a lightweight 50Wh battery.</p><p>There’s no word on pricing or availability as the Linux development project is described as &#34;currently ongoing&#34;, hence the prototype tag.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/2024-06/linux-on-arm-tuxedo-arbeitet-an-notebook-mit-snapdragon-x-elite/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.computerbase.de/2024-06/linux-on-arm-tuxedo-arbeitet-an-notebook-mit-snapdragon-x-elite/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>ComputerBase</em></a> took some photos of the laptop at Computex, and observed “The prototype was running Debian when we visited, but it was not bootable and was caught in a loop. There is still a need for much better support for Linux and notebook developers from Qualcomm, whose current focus is entirely on Windows, Copilot+ and AI under Windows.”</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-desktop" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-desktop">best Linux desktops</a> around today</li><li>And these are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/linux-laptops" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/linux-laptops">best Linux laptops</a> on offer right now</li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/us-government-warns-on-critical-linux-security-flaw-urges-users-to-patch-immediately" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/us-government-warns-on-critical-linux-security-flaw-urges-users-to-patch-immediately">US government warns on critical Linux security flaw</a></li></ul><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-syJfWLxdowjrw4Yrp6pJg9"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!</p></section></div></div></div>
