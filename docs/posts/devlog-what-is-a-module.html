    <h1>Devlog: what is a module?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Time for devlog #2! <a href="https://abstract.properties/devlog-week-one.html">Last week&#39;s was here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a bunch of time refactoring and hardening the code to better reflect the data model of this application.</p>
<p>After using it a bit, I felt that the cells were a bit constrained. They only had a &#34;Value&#34; and a &#34;Display&#34; associated
with themâ€”and both were special values. You could only read &#34;Value&#34; and only view the results of the &#34;Display&#34;.</p>
<p>What if a cell needed intermediate calculations as part of it?</p>
<p>What if you could read (and write to) other properties of a cell, like its X/Y position?</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve updated the code (but not the UI) so that these are configurable and accessed in the same manner. And access is
a bit more straightforward. If you have a cell named &#34;color&#34; which has a &#34;$value&#34; and &#34;$x&#34; property, then you can access
those via: <code>color.$value.get()</code> / <code>color.$x.set(100)</code>. And they also a <code>.subscribe()</code> method on them, which allows
them to be bound directly to JSX: <code>&lt;input type=&#34;color&#34; value={color.$value} /&gt;</code>. How handy!</p>

<p>But instead of using my written words to describe how to use it, here&#39;s a brief (6min) screen recording showing how to
use it (and with me talking about what I&#39;m doing).</p>
<p>I hope this makes things a bit more clear than the last one:</p>

<a id="what-is-a-module?" href="#what-is-a-module%3F"><h2>What is a module?</h2></a>
<p>This&#39;ll make a bit more sense if you watch that video. But I&#39;ve been thinking that this collection of &#34;cells&#34; in this
tool are a bit like variable declarations in a module.</p>
<p>I&#39;m talking specifically about JavaScript here, but a module is a collection of named variables. Outputs of the module
are variables marked for export. Inputs to the module are declarations imported from another module.</p>
<p>And similarly for functions: A function is a collection of named variables. The output of the function is a returned
variable. Inputs to the function are its parameters provided by a caller.</p>
<p>I want to see if both functions <em>and</em> modules can be manipulated in this same visual, reactive, dynamic manner!</p>
<p>I want to be able to create a function by creating a &#34;cell&#34; for each function parameter, create intermediate &#34;cell&#34;
values that the function needs to do its thing, then create a &#34;return value&#34; cell which calculates the result of the
function.</p>
<p>So I think that&#39;s where I&#39;m headed next.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ll hopefully fix some of the (many) bugs that are lurking in there.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>
