    <h1>Blackmail attempt left a Houston restaurant bombarded with 1-star reviews</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A Houston restaurant owner says he&#39;s being blackmailed with one-star Google ratings after refusing to pay up on an email demand for a $75 gift card.</p><p>Aaron Lyons, owner of <a href="https://www.dailygather.com/">Daily Gather in City Centre</a>, said he received the email Wednesday from a man claiming to be in India. In the email, which the Chronicle obtained, the man threatens to bombard Daily Gather with one-star ratings from multiple bot accounts daily until the amount is paid.</p><div id="paywall">

            <p>&#34;We sincerely apologize for our actions and would not want to harm your business, but we have no other choice,&#34; the email to Lyons reads. &#34;The fact is that we live in India and see no other way to survive.&#34;</p>
    
            <p>&#34;We are begging you to send us a Google Play gift card worth $75 … we hope this amount will not be critical for you. After selling this gift card, we can earn approximately $50, which is three weeks income for one family. Please send the code to the email address, and we will immediately stop leaving negative feedback and remove the existing ones.&#34;</p>
    
            <p>Lyons said he refuses to pay out of principle and concern the man won&#39;t stop after the ransom is paid.</p>

            <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t seem like a lot of money, so what if we pay?&#34; Lyons said. &#34;Then they win and what&#39;s stopping them from upping the price or coming back?&#34;</p>
    
            <p>Since the alleged blackmail attempt, Lyons said his restaurant has been inundated with false one-star ratings that he&#39;s reported to Google.</p>
    
            <p>The process of getting reviews removed can be lengthy, Lyons said, and he fears the damage to his business&#39; reputation in the meantime.</p>
    
            <h2>A community&#39;s counter</h2>
    
            <p>Thankfully for Lyons, a loyal following of his patrons have stepped up to try and counteract the barrage of negative reviews.</p>

            <p>Lyons, who also owns <a href="https://www.dishsociety.com/hours-and-locations/?gclid=CjwKCAjwiJqWBhBdEiwAtESPaK8d9hdexDsRkviyZ9wrf6E4BOhyFKAn1BWFHBamk9l_YQ3OTxKITxoC7PsQAvD_BwE">Dish Society in LaCenterra</a>, has strong ties to the Katy community. When he posted about the alleged extortion attempt on social media Wednesday, word spread quickly.</p>
    
            <p>&#34;I&#39;m letting everyone know about this so you don&#39;t think negatively of Daily Gather if you read our reviews, and take negative reviews at any restaurant with a grain of salt for that matter,&#34; Lyons&#39; post read.</p>
    
            <p>Sean Fitzsimmons, admin of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/KatyFoodies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy/Fort Bend Foodies Facebook group</a>, urged members of the community to &#34;fight back&#34; for Lyons.</p>
    
            <p>&#34;Daily Gather, owned by the people that brought us Dish Society, has fallen prey to an extortion attempt that sadly will have an impact on their business due to fake negative Google reviews,&#34; Fitzsimmons posted to multiple Facebook pages Wednesday. &#34;Let&#39;s please help them fight back.&#34;</p>
    
            <p>The call to action worked. Since Lyons&#39; post about the alleged extortion attempt, Daily Gather has received nearly 100 new five-star ratings.</p>
    
            <p>Still, the bad reviews remain online, as of Thursday afternoon — and Lyons seemingly isn&#39;t alone.</p>
    
            <p>High-profile restaurants in San Francisco have reportedly been dealing with a similar scam in recent days, <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/7/7/23198900/google-review-restaurant-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Eater SF</a>.</p>
    
            <p>&#34;I think the longer it continues, the worse it will be,&#34; chef Val Cantu <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/7/7/23198900/google-review-restaurant-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Eater</a>. &#34;We don&#39;t do what we do for reviews, but certainly we don&#39;t want somebody to tarnish our reputation for an Amazon gift card.&#34;</p>
