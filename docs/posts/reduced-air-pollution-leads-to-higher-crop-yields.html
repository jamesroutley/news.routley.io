    <h1>Reduced air pollution leads to higher crop yields</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A new study, led by Stanford University, has revealed how removing a common air pollutant could lead to significant gains in crop yields.</p><h2>Nitrogen oxides impact crop productivity</h2><p>The research, published in <i>Science Advances</i>, is the first to use satellite images to reveal how nitrogen oxides (also referred to as NOx), gases found in industrial emissions and car exhausts, impact crop productivity. The findings could have important implications for increasing agricultural output and analyzing the mitigation costs for combating climate change.</p><h2>A widely emitted pollutant</h2><p>Scientists have long understood nitrogen oxides’ potential to damage crop cells directly, as well indirectly impact them through their role as precursors to the formation of ozone, itself an airborne toxin known to reduce crop yields. However, little is known about NOx’ impacts on agricultural productivity. The lack of overlap between air monitoring stations and agricultural areas, coupled with the confounding effects of different pollutants, has limited past research.</p><h2>What impact will this have on crops?</h2><p>Utilizing this data, the researchers calculated that a reduction in NOx emissions of around 50% in each region would improve yields by approximately 25% for winter crops and 15% for summer crops in China.</p><h2>How to reduce NOx</h2><p>Speaking to Stanford News, Burney said, “The actions you would take to reduce NOx, such as vehicle electrification, overlap closely with the types of energy transformations needed to slow climate change and improve local air quality for human health.” She added that the “main take home” from the study is that the consequences of these actions could be beneficial for agriculture, easing the issues associated with food supply for a growing population.</p><h2>Future research exploring pollutant impact on crop yields</h2><p>Looking to the future, the researchers say that their analysis could utilize other satellite observations to better understand nitrogen dioxide’s effects on crops’ varying degrees of sensitivity to the gas throughout the growing season. This may lead to more detailed examination of other pollutants as well as meteorological variables, such as drought and heat, all of which could help to explain why nitrogen dioxide affects crops differently across different regions, years, and seasons.</p><p><b>Reference: </b>Lobell David B., Di Tommaso Stefania, Burney Jennifer A.
