	<p>DURING PARIS FASHION WEEK French Label <a href="https://coperniparis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coperni</a> delivered a performance involving a spray-on dress on Palestinian/Dutch model Bella Hadid.
</p>
<p>Hadid was, quite literally, spray-painted with a spray-on fabric dress thanks to innovator Dr. Manel Torres, founder and Managing Director of <a href="https://www.fabricanltd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrican Ltd</a> founded in 2003 to explore the use of technology in fashion, healthcare, products, and the automative industry. Torres studied fashion at the Royal College of Art in London and developed the patented tech that, once sprayed onto any surface, including liquids, dries up instantly and results in a non-woven fabric layer. The spray-on fabric is applied using the likes of aerosol tech, industrial sprayers, and <a href="https://wired.me/science/martian-rock-dust-shows-potential-of-3d-printing-on-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D printing.</a></p>
<p>“It can be used to make innovative clothes that can be washed, re-worn and even integrated with diagnostic devices that can monitor the health of the wearer. The technology consists of short fibers bound together with polymers and bio polymers, and greener solvents that deliver the fabric in liquid form, then evaporate when the spray reaches a surface,” says Coperni.</p>

<p>“The texture of the fabric can be changed according to the fibers (synthetic and natural, such as cotton, linen, polyester or nylon as well as recycled) and binder used, and how the spray is applied,” it adds.</p>
<p>As Hadid patiently stood for more than eight minutes, the liquid was applied onto her. After they were done, an attendant rolled down her sleeves onto an off-shoulder style and then proceeded to slash the lower side of the white dress.</p>
<p>“Fabrican is at the forefront of innovation in material science, developing smart fabrics incorporating nanotechnology, ‘second skin’ for the medical and cosmetic industries, and sprayable conductive fabrics to interface with wearable technology. Spray-on fabrics liberate product and apparel designers from the constraints imposed by the need for cutting to size, stitching, and fitting of traditional materials,” states the Fabrican website.</p>
<p>Originally, the spray-on dress started with a can of silly string. “I thought I could create a mist,” mentions Torres<a href="https://youtu.be/E5m7Tg00aLo"> in a 2013 TED Talk</a>. “That was the eureka moment.” he adds. The technology can be used in fashion to not only create dresses like done on Hadid, but also to repair any damaged items.</p>
<p>Fabrican looks to bring the technology into the medical arena too in making casts or spray-on sterile bandages from aerosol cans.</p>
