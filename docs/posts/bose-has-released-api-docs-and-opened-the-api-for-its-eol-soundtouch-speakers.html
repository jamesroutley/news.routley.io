          <p>Bose released the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for its SoundTouch speakers today, putting a silver lining around the impending end-of-life (EoL) of the expensive home theater devices.</p>
<p>In October, Bose announced that its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/bose-soundtouch-home-theater-systems-regress-into-dumb-speakers-feb-18/">SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars</a> would become dumb speakers on February 18. At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).</p>
<p>After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.</p>
<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch/">frustrated</a> some of Bose’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/1o2db0f/comment/niqj66d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long-time customers</a>, some of whom own multiple SoundTouch devices that still function properly. Many questioned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/smart-gadgets-failure-to-commit-to-software-support-could-be-illegal-ftc-warns/">companies’</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/logitech-will-brick-its-100-pop-smart-home-buttons-on-october-15/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/firmware-update-hinders-echelon-smart-home-gym-equipments-ability-to-work-offline/">common</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/belkin-shows-tech-firms-getting-too-comfortable-with-bricking-customers-stuff/">practice</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/many-americans-still-dont-understand-how-easily-iot-devices-can-get-bricked/">bricking</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/800-kids-robot-due-for-bricking-sees-potential-open-source-second-life/">expensive</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/smart-gardening-firms-shutdown-a-reminder-of-internet-of-things-fickle-nature/">products</a> to focus on new devices or to minimize costs, or because they’ve gone through acquisitions or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/acquisition-sends-thousands-of-whistle-pet-trackers-to-iot-graveyard/">bankruptcy</a>. SoundTouch speakers released in 2013 and 2015 with prices ranging from $399 to $1,500.</p>
<p>Today, Bose had better news. In <a href="https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life">an email</a> to customers, Bose announced that AirPlay and Spotify Connect will still work with SoundTouch speakers after EoL, expanding the wireless capabilities that people will still be able to access.</p>
<p>Additionally, SoundTouch devices that support AirPlay 2 will be able to play the same audio simultaneously.</p>
<p>The SoundTouch app will also live on, albeit stripped of some functionality.</p>
<p>“On May 6, 2026, the app will update to a version that supports the functions that can operate locally without the cloud. No action will be required on your part. Opening the app will apply the update automatically,” Bose said.</p>
