Analysts polled by LSEG expect operating profit of 2.3 trillion Korean won ($1.7 billion) for the September quarter, a 78.7% year-on-year decline.

Revenue is seen flat, arresting the declining sales the company has seen this year so far.</p><p>Daiwa&#39;s Kim sees the inventory glut easing and memory prices rising in the fourth quarter.
