    <h1>0x0: Share Files from Terminal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><pre>THE NULL POINTER
================

HTTP POST files here:
    curl -F&#39;file=@yourfile.png&#39; https://0x0.st
You can also POST remote URLs:
    curl -F&#39;url=http://example.com/image.jpg&#39; https://0x0.st
If you don&#39;t want the resulting URL to be easy to guess:
    curl -F&#39;file=@yourfile.png&#39; -Fsecret= https://0x0.st
    curl -F&#39;url=http://example.com/image.jpg&#39; -Fsecret= https://0x0.st

It is possible to append your own file name to the URL:
    https://0x0.st/aaa.jpg/image.jpeg

URL SHORTENING HAS BEEN DISABLED DUE TO FREQUENT ABUSE

File URLs are valid for at least 30 days and up to a year (see below).

Files can be set to expire sooner by adding an &#34;expires&#34; parameter (in hours)
    curl -F&#39;file=@yourfile.png&#39; -Fexpires=24 https://0x0.st
OR by setting &#34;expires&#34; to a timestamp in epoch milliseconds
    curl -F&#39;file=@yourfile.png&#39; -Fexpires=1681996320000 https://0x0.st

Expired files won&#39;t be removed immediately, but will be removed as part of
the next hourly purge.

Whenever a file that does not already exist or has expired is uploaded,
the HTTP response header includes an X-Token field. You can use this
to perform management operations on the file.

To delete the file immediately:
    curl -Ftoken=token_here -Fdelete= https://0x0.st/abc.txt
To change the expiration date (see above):
    curl -Ftoken=token_here -Fexpires=3 https://0x0.st/abc.txt

Maximum file size: 512.0 MiB
Not allowed: application/x-dosexec, application/x-executable, application/x-sharedlib, application/x-hdf5, application/java-archive, application/vnd.android.package-archive, application/x-rar, application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable
