<p>The experiment demonstrates the fluidity and high viscosity of pitch, a derivative of tar that is the world&#39;s thickest known fluid and was once used for waterproofing boats.</p>

<p>Thomas Parnell, UQ&#39;s first Professor of Physics, created the experiment in 1927 to illustrate that everyday materials can exhibit quite surprising properties.</p>

<p>At room temperature pitch feels solid - even brittle - and can easily be shattered with a hammer. But, in fact, at room temperature the substance - which is 100 billion times more viscous than water - is actually fluid.</p>

<h2>The experiment explained</h2>

<p>In 1927 Professor Parnell heated a sample of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel with a sealed stem. He allowed the pitch to cool and settle for three years, and then in 1930 he cut the funnel&#39;s stem.</p>

<p>Since then, the pitch has slowly dripped out of the funnel - so slowly that it took eight years for the first drop to fall, and more than 40 years for another five to follow.</p>

<p>Now, 87 years after the funnel was cut, only nine drops have fallen - the last drop fell in April 2014 and we expect the next one to fall sometime in the 2020s.</p>

<p>The experiment was set up as a demonstration and is not kept under special environmental conditions - it&#39;s kept in a display cabinet - so the rate of flow of the pitch varies with seasonal changes in temperature.</p>

<p>The late Professor John Mainstone became the experiment&#39;s second custodian in 1961. He looked after the experiment for 52 years but, like his predecessor Professor Parnell, he passed away before seeing a drop fall.</p>

<p>In the 86 years that the pitch has been dripping, various glitches have prevented anyone from seeing a drop fall.</p>

<h2>See for yourself</h2>

<p>To see the experiment for yourself, view the physical set-up in its display case in the foyer of the <a href="https://maps.uq.edu.au/?zoom=20&amp;campusId=406&amp;lat=-27.498276503487325&amp;lng=153.01317546934047&amp;zLevel=-1" target="_blank">Parnell Building</a> (Building 7).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can watch the experiment&#39;s <a href="http://thetenthwatch.com">live video stream</a>. More than 35,000 people from some 160 countries are registered to view the stream.</p>

<p><a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/191/andrew-white">Professor Andrew White</a> is the Pitch Drop&#39;s third and current custodian.</p>
