    <h1>OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, I heard that Microsoft engineers were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/616464/microsoft-prepares-for-openais-gpt-5-model">preparing server capacity</a> for OpenAI’s next-generation GPT-5 model, arriving as soon as late May. After some additional testing and delays, sources familiar with OpenAI’s plans tell me that GPT-5 is now expected to launch as early as next month.</p><p>OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altman</strong> recently <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1946569252296929727?s=12">revealed on X</a> that “we are releasing GPT-5 soon” and even teased some of its capabilities in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYn8VKW6vXA">podcast appearance</a> with <strong>Theo Von</strong> earlier this week. Altman decided to let GPT-5 take a stab at a question he didn’t understand. “I put it in the model, this is GPT-5, and it answered it perfectly,” Altman said. He described it as a “here it is moment,” adding that he “felt useless relative to the AI” because he felt like he should have been able to answer the question but GPT-5 answered it instantly. “It was a weird feeling.”</p><p>GPT-5 had already been <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1946532308896628748">spotted in the wild</a> before Altman’s appearance on <em>This Past Weekend</em>, fueling speculation that the next-generation GPT model was imminent. I understand OpenAI is planning to launch GPT-5 in early August, complete with mini and nano versions that will also be available through its API.</p><p>I reached out to OpenAI to comment on the launch of GPT-5 in August, but the company did not respond in time for publication.</p><p>Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244?lang=en-GB">referred to</a> GPT-5 as “a system that integrates a lot of our technology” earlier this year, because it will include the o3 reasoning capabilities instead of shipping those in a separate model. It’s part of OpenAI’s ongoing efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to make a more capable system that can eventually be declared artificial general intelligence, or AGI.</p><p>The declaration of AGI is particularly important to OpenAI, because achieving it will force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and its future AI models. Microsoft and OpenAI have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/688964/microsoft-openai-relationship-notepad">renegotiating their partnership recently</a>, as OpenAI needs Microsoft’s approval to convert part of its business to a for-profit company. It’s unlikely that GPT-5 will meet the AGI threshold that’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-wrangle-over-terms-of-their-blockbuster-partnership">reportedly linked</a> to OpenAI’s profits. Altman previously said that GPT-5 won’t have a “gold level of capability for many months” after launch.</p><p>Unifying its o-series and GPT-series models will also reduce the friction of having to know which model to pick for each task in ChatGPT. I understand that the main combined reasoning version of GPT-5 will be available through ChatGPT and OpenAI’s API, and the mini version will also be available on ChatGPT and the API. The nano version of GPT-5 is expected to only be available through the API.</p><p>While GPT-5 looks likely to debut in early August, OpenAI’s planned release dates often shift to respond to development challenges, server capacity issues, or even rival AI model announcements and leaks. Earlier this month, I warned about the possibility of a delay to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/702848/openai-open-language-model-o3-mini-notepad">open language model</a> that OpenAI is also preparing to launch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/706555/openai-open-model-release-delay">Altman confirmed my reporting</a> just days after my <em>Notepad </em>issue by announcing a delay “to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas.”</p><p>I’m still hearing that this open language model is imminent and that OpenAI is trying to ship it before the end of July — ahead of GPT-5’s release. Sources describe the model as “similar to o3 mini,” complete with reasoning capabilities. This new model will be the first time that OpenAI has released an open-weight model since its release of GPT-2 in 2019, and it will be available on Azure, Hugging Face, and other large cloud providers.</p><div><p id="microsoft-is-in-the-security-hot-seat-again"><h2>Microsoft is in the security hot seat again</h2></p></div><p>Microsoft made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147883/microsoft-security-priority-executive-compensation-goals">security its top priority</a> last year, following years of security issues and mounting criticism after a scathing report from the US Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has been working to improve its “inadequate” security culture ever since. But this week, we were reminded of Microsoft’s challenges once again.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710513/microsoft-sharepoint-server-attack-zero-day-exploit">major security flaw</a> in Microsoft’s on-premises versions of SharePoint allowed hacking groups to exploit a zero-day vulnerability and breach more than 50 organizations — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712080/microsoft-sharepoint-hack-us-nuclear-weapons-agency">including the US nuclear weapons agency</a>. Security researchers discovered the vulnerability was being exploited on July 18th, and Microsoft issued an alert a day later. Microsoft engineers then spent all weekend working on patches and released updates for SharePoint Subscription Edition and SharePoint 2019 late on July 20th. A patch for SharePoint 2016 servers was released on the morning of July 22nd.</p><p>The previously unpatched flaw appears to have originated from a <a href="https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/toolshell-a-critical-sharepoint-vulnerability-chain-under-active-exploitation/">combination of two bugs</a> that were presented at the Pwn2Own hacking contest in May. Microsoft has linked the attacks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711522/microsoft-sharepoint-exploit-china-based-hackers">two hacking groups</a> that are affiliated with the Chinese government, but the company hasn’t disclosed exactly how hackers were able to bypass its patches to create a zero-day exploit.</p><p>The security flaw was only exploitable through on-premises versions of SharePoint, so the Microsoft 365 version of SharePoint Online was unaffected. This certainly limited the scale of damage, but the targeted nature of these attacks will be hugely concerning for Microsoft and the company’s customers. It’s also likely to accelerate a move away from these older versions of SharePoint, which are in the extended support phase until July 2026.</p><p>Complicating the concern around Microsoft’s security practices is a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-digital-escorts-pentagon-defense-department-china-hackers">new report from <em>ProPublica</em></a> that warns of a little-known Microsoft program that could expose the US Defense Department to Chinese hackers. Microsoft has been using engineers in China to help maintain the department’s computer systems, with digital escorts that reportedly lack the technical expertise to properly police foreign engineers. It’s a troubling development after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf">called China</a> the “most active and persistent cyber threat to US Government, private-sector, and critical infrastructure networks.”</p><p>On the same day the SharePoint exploit was discovered, Microsoft’s head of communications, <strong>Frank Shaw</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/1946299139068965008">responded</a> to the <em>ProRepublica</em> report and announced changes to “assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services.”</p><p>Sources tell me that Microsoft’s escort program has now been locked down to only US-based employees for its government cloud data centers in Fairfax, Virginia. Microsoft’s entire threat protection teams were warned about the change on July 23rd, and there are “no exceptions” to the lockdown.</p><p>Still, it’s surprising that such a program even existed, and Microsoft will now face some big questions around why it was using China-based engineers to maintain Defense Department systems. Sen. Tom Cotton has <a href="https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1946196464981459316">already asked</a> the secretary of defense to look into Microsoft’s practices, and I’m sure Microsoft’s security teams are about to be busier than ever this summer.</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft wants to fix ‘slow or sluggish’ performance in Windows 11. </strong>I’ve regularly heard complaints about Windows 11 responding more slowly than Windows 10 or that gaming performance feeling degraded. Now, Microsoft is looking for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710535/microsoft-windows-11-performance-improvements-25h2-version">feedback on “slow or sluggish” performance</a> in test builds of Windows 11. Windows Insiders can automatically submit performance logs, allowing Microsoft to find the root cause of issues ahead of its 25H2 update later this year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft suddenly kills its movies and TV store on Xbox and Windows. </strong>I have to admit I’m not surprised to see the Movies &amp; TV store on Xbox and Windows disappear, but I was surprised at how abruptly Microsoft handled it. There was no warning of a closure, and suddenly, you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/709737/microsoft-movies-tv-store-closure-xbox-windows">no longer purchase new movies or TV shows from the Microsoft Store on Xbox or Windows</a>. You’ll still be able to access previously purchased content on your devices, but this will really impact Microsoft’s most loyal customers, who have been building up a library of purchased content instead of pirating it, buying physical copies, or subscribing to a streaming service. Microsoft is now leaving it up to Amazon, Netflix, Apple TV, and the many other streaming video services to offer movies and TV shows on Windows and Xbox.</span></li><li><span><strong>Nvidia and MediaTek reportedly delay Arm-based CPUs due to Windows hurdles</strong>. Nvidia’s long-rumored Arm-based CPU looks like it might not debut this year after all. A new <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250721PD208/mediatek-nvidia-ai-pc-launch-2026.html">report from <em>DigiTimes</em></a> claims Nvidia and MediaTek are facing delays in getting their Arm-based chips ready for Windows due to “a combination of delays in Microsoft’s operating system roadmap, ongoing chip revisions at Nvidia, and weakening demand in the overall notebook market.” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">Previous rumors</a> had suggested an Nvidia Arm-powered gaming laptop would launch later this year with Alienware.</span></li><li><span><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 will no longer be Microsoft’s first $80 Xbox game. </strong>Microsoft is no longer pushing ahead with $79.99 Xbox games this holiday season. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> was supposed to be Microsoft’s first, but Obsidian <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox">announced a price drop</a> back to the top $69.99 pricing. Refunds will be issued to those who preordered the game, but it’s clear that the $79.99 pricing hasn’t gone down well with gamers. I’m surprised that Microsoft picked <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> to test its new pricing model, and now it feels like an experiment gone wrong. It’s not clear what will happen to Xbox game pricing beyond the holidays, but Microsoft’s plans are on hold for now.</span></li><li><span><strong>GitHub launches its AI app-making tool in preview. </strong>Microsoft-owned GitHub has launched a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712609/github-launches-its-ai-app-making-tool-in-preview">public preview of GitHub Spark</a>, a new tool for Copilot Pro Plus subscribers that lets developers build apps simply by describing their ideas. It’s vibe coding to the max, with the ability to generate everything you need without writing a line of code.</span></li><li><span><strong>Maingear’s Retro95 combines ’90s-era PC design with modern specs. </strong>I love Maingear’s new Retro95 prebuilt system. It’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712101/maingear-retro95-sleeper-pc-gaming-specs-pricing">horizontal beige desktop with modern components inside</a> that tugs at nostalgia. If, like me, you reminisce about the days of Windows 95, floppy disks, and LAN parties, then the Retro95 can be configured with AMD’s latest Ryzen 7 9800X3D, an RTX 5080, and even 96GB of RAM. Prices start at $1,599, but if you want a full-spec version, with multiple SSDs, then it will set you back more than $7,000.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Intel-powered Surface Laptop 5G arrives in August. </strong>Microsoft will start shipping a new Surface Laptop 5G version on August 26th. Powered by Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 processors, this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711278/microsoft-surface-laptop-5g-specs-release-date-pricing">5G version of the Surface Laptop 7</a> will include an NPU capable of delivering Microsoft’s latest Copilot Plus AI features. The Surface Laptop 5G is very similar to the existing 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 model, except Microsoft has made some internal changes to accommodate a 5G modem and support for a physical nano SIM on the side of the laptop, as well as eSIMs. Prices start at $1,799 for businesses, and the top of the range model, with a Core Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB storage, will be priced at $2,699.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox cloud games will soon follow you across Xbox, PC, and Windows handhelds. </strong>Microsoft has started to test a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710764/xbox-cloud-gaming-roaming-pc-console-play-history-feature">new play history section of the Xbox PC app and Xbox console home UI</a> that will display cloud games as part of the recently played titles list. This will roam across Xbox consoles, PCs, and handhelds, allowing you to pick up games where you left off across multiple devices. Cloud-playable games are also now starting to show inside play history or the library on the Xbox PC app.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11’s new update will add a bunch of AI features. </strong>Microsoft has started rolling out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/711797/windows-11-microsoft-ai-features-copilot-vision-launch">bunch of new AI features in Windows 11</a>, including its Copilot Vision tool that can scan everything on your screen. Qualcomm-powered Copilot Plus PCs can also now access an AI-powered agent within the Settings app, letting you search for specific settings with natural language queries. Click to Do is getting more useful, too, allowing Copilot Plus PC owners to quickly complete actions like summarizing a paragraph by holding down the Windows key and left clicking on an app, text, or website.</span></li><li><span><strong>WhatsApp is dropping its native Windows app in favor of an uglier web version. </strong>WhatsApp has been one of the best examples of a modern Windows app, complete with WinUI design elements that make it feel part of Windows 11. All that is going away soon, though, as Meta has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710509/whatsapp-windows-app-web-wrapper-changes">decided to switch back to an uglier web version</a> that’s just a wrapper for the WhatsApp web service. It’s a disappointing change that will mean WhatsApp will not only look different on Windows, but the neat Settings interface will be gone and notifications won’t work in the background.</span></li><li><span><strong>You can now lock your Windows 11 PC from your Android phone. </strong>Microsoft has issued a new update for its Phone Link tool that will allow you to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/you-can-now-lock-your-windows-11-pc-from-your-android-phone-and-its-all-thanks-to-microsofts-excellent-phone-link-tool">remotely lock your PC</a> with the tap of a button. My EV lets me lock my doors remotely if I’m forgetful enough to not lock them with my key fob, and being able to lock my laptop from afar will be equally useful if I’m using it in a shared space. Windows offers a dynamic lock feature that can automatically lock your PC if your phone is connected over Bluetooth, but this new Phone Link feature can be triggered manually and doesn’t need a Bluetooth connection.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft poaches more Google DeepMind AI talent. </strong>Microsoft has hired more than 20 employees from Google’s DeepMind AI team in recent months, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9e6b3d89-e47a-40e1-b737-2792370c4b00"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. <strong>Amar Subramanya</strong>, the former head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, revealed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amar-subramanya-3642498a_super-excited-to-share-that-ive-started-activity-7353453746091081729-ElkV?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGe5_YBNBxfcDaC5YJlW57cvMMdg5ZCG-g">on LinkedIn</a> that he has recently joined Microsoft as a VP under <strong>Mustafa Suleyman</strong>’s Microsoft AI team.
