    <h1>Among the Cabin Fanatics of Mississippi’s Giant Houseparty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>DeWeese declared Fair Saturday “the No. 1 night of the year, to a teen-ager in central Mississippi.” Girls planned their outfits for months: “I expect ’em to come in here in short shorts and cowboy boots, and titties showin’.” The previous night, a visitor from Los Angeles had stumbled, drunk, into a cabin at the north end of the racetrack and commented on all the “pretty bitches” he had seen. One of the men in residence informed him, “Down here, we refer to them as ‘ladies.’ ”</p><p>Cabin 220, the color of a ripe banana, sits just beyond Founders Square, at the entrance to Happy Hollow, the fair’s first “suburb,” a short stretch of cabins separated by a sawdust-covered footpath. When I came across it, the owners, William and Barbie Bassett, and their daughter, Gracie, were sitting, where else, on the porch. Barbie, a former television meteorologist, had written “92°” on a whiteboard—the daily Faircast.</p><p>Not long ago, cabins were known to sell for as little as a few thousand dollars. “This is a camp house, not a condo,” William said. Lately, some families have been spending more than it would cost to buy an actual Neshoba County home. Fairgoers love gossiping about it. The Bassetts had heard that a two-story cabin recently sold for a hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars; they told me that the new owners gutted it and painted it Pepto Bismol pink with green racing stripes. Another went for three hundred and ninety thousand dollars; the buyers planned to raze it and rebuild, higher. “She’s an interior designer, and her husband’s in real estate,” Barbie said. “It’s gonna be the Taj Mahal of the fair.”</p><figure><p><span>Fair Saturday is “the No. 1 night of the year, to a teen-ager in central Mississippi,” a longtime fairgoer said.</span></p></figure><p>On Founders Square, everyone was talking about a cabin that had recently sold for around the same amount, to a family with no apparent connection to the fair or to Neshoba County. Neighbors disdained the newcomers’ “massive” television; worse, they kept their door closed. “Not to have your cabin open is kind of tacky,” one neighbor told me.</p><p>Cabin people, traditionally, are hospitality extremists. At the fair, I was offered water, lemonade, iced tea, beer, Gatorade, a souvenir apron, boiled shrimp, homemade ice cream, a pork chop, a taco, a bed, a toilet, the remains of a funnel cake, a book about doughnuts, an introduction to “some really obnoxious cousins,” two ibuprofens, two more ibuprofens, help “fixing” a traffic ticket (offer declined), and numerous iterations of chicken. Gail Long, who is eighty and has been a fair person since girlhood, told me about the time her mother invited a visitor to help herself to supper at Cabin 271, and then to dessert. After the woman left, Gail and her sisters asked, “Who was that lady?” Their mother said, “I thought <em>y’all</em> knew her.” A late-night reveller once happened into Cabin 19 and obliviously ate raw meat loaf out of the refrigerator; the fridge is now divided into sections marked “<em>PREP</em>” and “<em>DRUNK</em>.”</p><p>This year, Cabin 19’s twice-daily buffet stretched from its single stove all the way to the front porch. Roxanna McCarty, who runs the culinary operation with a rotating staff of eight, prepared “fried green tomatoes, fried okra, fried squash, fresh tomatoes, cream corn, fruit—we come in here and deseed everything—and pasta salad. We do black-eyed peas, green beans, lady peas, and butter beans every day. Devilled eggs at every shift. We did five pork loins, six turkey breasts. We had brisket. We had racks of ribs. We had Boston butts and ham. We had chicken and dumplings, chicken and dressing, lasagna.” McCarty cuts her okra lengthwise, instead of in rounds; it tastes “more okra-y” that way. The weather was so hot her green tomatoes turned red.</p><p>Cabin 19 served more than six hundred plates this year. McCarty told me, “Just here today, we’ve seen kids whose mother is in jail, they’re on welfare, they’re living in foster care. We have a president of a big company, we have single mothers, we have people that run their own house-cleaning business, we have people that flew in here on a private plane. Every walk of life is here.”</p><p>The fair has a board that functions almost like a municipal government, overseeing the budget and making policy: parking, garbage. Gate and cabin fees generate the operating revenue; the Neshoba County Fair Association, the nonprofit that runs the fair, took in eight million dollars between 2017 and 2022. Cabin owners pay the association up to five hundred dollars annually per cabin, and fifty dollars per air-conditioner. During the fair, the utility bill alone totals half a million dollars.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26446&#34;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26446" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Squirrel!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Liam Francis Walsh</span></p><div></div></div></span></p></figure><p>Individuals build and own the cabins, and pay the property taxes, but the association owns the land. The cabins tend to pass down through families, making the fair largely a self-perpetuating, closed system. “The old saw here is that, in a divorce, people fight harder over the cabin than the children,” Sid Salter, a well-known columnist and Neshoba native, who co-owns Cabin 16, told me. Most sales happen privately, by word of mouth. An owner may not sell, rent, raze, rebuild, or renovate a cabin without the association’s permission. C. Scott Bounds, a state legislator and the fair’s president, recalled a former colleague who discouraged change by saying, “We ain’t never done it like ’at before.” Kevin Cheatham, the fair’s manager, said, “We try to keep things as simple as possible.”</p><p>In 1980, the National Register of Historic Places added the fairgrounds to its list, describing the institution’s contributions to “this very rural region of Mississippi” as “immeasurable.” By then, the fair was approaching sewer capacity, and there were concerns about inauthenticity: the newer sections contained too many modern amenities for some people’s taste. “They’re putting <em>Sheetrock</em> in there,” DeWeese told me. The fair stopped adding cabins in 1982.</p><p>The fair has a daily newspaper, the <em>Fair Times</em>, which is published by the <em>Democrat</em>. An annual profusion of advertising makes it thicker than some actual newspapers. The <em>Fair Times</em> overwhelmingly consists of photographs of fairgoers in situ. How else is everyone supposed to know that Cabin 612 hosts a “Golden Girls”-themed bunco night; Cabin 755 won a giant stuffed banana; Cabin 163 (“The Plaza on the Fairgrounds”) puts on an “Eloise”-themed tea party with antique dishes; Caleb Mayfield lost a tooth; and Kenny (Slick) Hillman fixed a weed-eater? Kids beg to have their picture taken. It is on record that this year’s fair was attended by Azlee, Bensley, Payzlee, Rhettley, Easton, Creeth, Halen, Tuff, Collyns, Kollyns, Jacks, Jax, Kelby, Karsten, Karter, Jagger, Bayleigh, Everleigh, Hadleigh, Jayleigh, Mosleigh, Ryleigh, Maverick, Banks, Anistyn, Gracyn, Hudsyn, Hollyn, Lakelyn, Rylen, Aspen, Aspin, and multiple Baylors.</p><figure><p><span>The fair has been called “the Carnegie Hall of stump speaking.”</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div></div>
