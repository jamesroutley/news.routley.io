    <h1>Google Axion Processors – Arm-based CPUs designed for the data center</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>At Google, we constantly push the boundaries of computing, exploring what is possible for grand challenges ranging from information retrieval, global video distribution, and of course generative AI. Doing so requires rethinking systems design in deep collaboration with service developers. This rethinking has resulted in our significant investment in custom silicon. Today, we are thrilled to announce the latest incarnation of this work: Google Axion Processors, our first custom Arm®</span><span>-based CPUs designed for the data center. Axion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be available to Google Cloud customers later this year.</span></p></span></section><section><div><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/><section role="dialog" aria-modal="true"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_Ab4940U.max-2000x2000.jpg" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"/></section></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Run general-purpose workloads on Google Axion Processors for exceptional performance, energy-efficiency and advanced capabilities.</p></span></p></section></div></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Axion is but the latest in a long line of custom Google silicon. Since 2015 we’ve released five generations of Tensor Processing Units (TPU); in 2018 we released our first Video Coding Unit (VCU), achieving up to </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446723" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>33x</span></a><span> more efficiency for video transcoding; </span><span>in 2021, we </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google?e=48754805"><span>doubled-down</span></a><span> on custom compute by investing in “system on a chip” (SoC) designs, and released the </span><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first of three generations</span></a><span> of Tensor chips for mobile devices. </span></p>
<p><span>While our investments in compute accelerators have transformed our customers’ capabilities, general-purpose compute is and will remain a critical portion of our customers’ workloads. Analytics, information retrieval, and ML training and serving all require a huge amount of compute power. Customers and users who wish to maximize performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet sustainability goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed recently. Amdahl’s Law suggests that as accelerators continue to improve, general purpose compute will dominate the cost and limit the capability of our infrastructure unless we make commensurate investments to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span>Axion processors combine Google’s silicon expertise with Arm’s highest performing CPU cores to deliver instances with up to </span><span>30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today, up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances<sup>1</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>That’s why we’ve already started deploying Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on current generation Arm-based servers and plan to deploy and scale these services and more on Axion soon.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Unrivaled performance and efficiency, underpinned by Titanium</strong></h3>
<p><span>Built using the Arm Neoverse</span><span><span>™</span></span><span> V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance </span><span>for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing, and more. </span></p>
<p><span>Axion is underpinned b</span><span>y </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/titanium?e=48754805"><span>Titanium</span></a><span>, a system of</span><span> purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads</span><span>. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks"><span>Hyperdisk</span></a><span>, our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically provisioned in real time. </span></p>
<p><em>“Google’s announcement of the new Axion CPU marks a significant milestone in delivering custom silicon that is optimized for Google’s infrastructure, and built on our high-performance Arm Neoverse V2 platform. Decades of ecosystem investment, combined with Google’s ongoing innovation and open-source software contributions ensure the best experience for the workloads that matter most to customers running on Arm everywhere.&#34;</em> - Rene Haas, CEO, Arm</p>
<p><span>Beyond performance, customers want to operate more efficiently and meet their sustainability goals. </span><span>Google Cloud data centers are already 1.5X more efficient than the industry average and deliver 3X more computing power with the same amount of electrical power compared with five years ago<sup>2</sup>.</span><span> </span><span>We’ve set ambitious </span><a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>goals</span></a><span> to </span><span>operate our offices, campuses, and data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7</span><span>, and offer </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint"><span>tools</span></a><span> to help you report on carbon emissions. With Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more energy-efficiency. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Axion - out-of-the-box application compatibility and interoperability</strong></h3>
<p><span>Google also has a rich history of contributions to the Arm ecosystem. We built and open sourced Android, Kubernetes, Tensorflow and the Go language, and worked closely with Arm and industry partners to optimize them for the Arm architecture. </span></p>
<p><span>Axion is built on the standard Armv9 architecture and instruction set. Most recently, we contributed to SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE), Arm’s hardware and firmware interoperability standard that ensures common operating systems and software packages can seamlessly run on Arm-based servers and VMs, making it easier for customers to deploy Arm workloads on Google Cloud with limited-if-any code rewrites. Through this collaboration, we’re accessing an ecosystem of tens of thousands of cloud customers already deploying workloads and leveraging Arm-native software from hundreds of ISVs and open-source projects. </span></p>
<p><span>Customers will be able to use Axion in many Google Cloud services including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud Batch, and more.  Arm-compatible software and solutions are now available on the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en"><span>Google Cloud Marketplace</span></a><span>, and we&#39;ve recently launched preview support for Arm-based instances migration in the </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines"><span>Migrate to Virtual Machines</span></a><span> service.</span></p>
