    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><i><b><a href="https://patreon.com/danluu">I&#39;m trying some experimental tiers on Patreon</a></b> to see if I can get to <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1456346963691991041">substack-like levels of financial support for this blog without moving to substack</a>!</i> <hr/> <strong>Major errors on this blog (and their corrections)</strong> <p>Here&#39;s a list of errors on this blog that I think were fairly serious. While what I think of as serious is, of course, subjective, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reasonable way to avoid that because, e.g., I make a huge number of typos, so many that the majority of acknowledgements on many posts are for people who e-mailed or DM&#39;ed me typo fixes.</p> <p>A list that included everything, including typos would both be uninteresting for other people to read as well as high overhead for me, which is why I&#39;ve drawn the line somewhere. An example of an error I don&#39;t think of as serious is, <a href="https://macwright.com/learning-to-program/">in this post on how I learned to program</a>, I originally had the dates wrong on when the competition programmers from my high school made money (it was a couple years after I thought it was). In that case, and many others, I don&#39;t think that the date being wrong changes anything significant about the post.</p> <p>Although I&#39;m publishing the original version of this in 2021, I expect this list to grow over time. I hope that I&#39;ve become more careful and that the list will grow more slowly in the future than it has in the past, but that remains to be seen. I view it as a good sign that a large fraction of the list is from my first three months of blogging, in 2013, but that&#39;s no reason to get complacent!</p> <p>I&#39;ve added a classification below that&#39;s how I think of the errors, but that classification is also arbitrary and the categories aren&#39;t even mutually exclusive. If I ever collect enough of these that it&#39;s difficult to hold them all in my head at once, I might create a tag system and use that to classify them instead, but I hope to not accumulate so many major errors that I feel like I need a tag system for readers to easily peruse them.</p> <ul> <li>Insufficient thought <ul> <li><i>2013</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/randomize-hn/">Using random algorithms to decrease the probability that good stories get &#34;unlucky&#34; on HN</a>: this idea was tried and didn&#39;t work well as well as putting humans in the loop who decide which stories should be rescued from oblivion. <ul> <li>Since this was a proposal and not a claim, this technically wasn&#39;t an error since I didn&#39;t claim that this would definitely work, but my feeling is that I should&#39;ve also considered solutions that put humans in the loop. I didn&#39;t because Digg famously got a lot of backlash for having humans influence their front page but, in retrospect, we can see that it&#39;s possible to do so in a way that doesn&#39;t generate backlash that effective kills the site and I think this could&#39;ve been predicted with enough thought</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li>Naivete <ul> <li><i>2013</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/hardware-unforgiving/">The institution knowledge and culture that create excellence can take a long time to build up</a>: At this time, I hadn&#39;t worked in software and that thought that this wasn&#39;t as difficult for software because so many software companies are successful with new/young teams. But, in retrospect, the difference isn&#39;t that those companies don&#39;t produce bad (unreliable, buggy, slow, etc.) software, it&#39;s that product/market fit and network effects are important enough that it frequently doesn&#39;t matter that software is bad</li> </ul></li> <li>Insufficient verification of information <ul> <li><i>2016</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/sounds-easy/">Building a search engine isn&#39;t trivial</a>: although I think the overall point is true, one of the pieces of evidence I relied on came out of using numbers that someone who worked on a search engine told me about. But when I measured actual numbers, I found that the numbers I was told were off by multiple orders of magnitude</li> </ul></li> <li>Blunder <ul> <li><i>2015</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/butler-lampson-1999/">Checking out Butler Lampson&#39;s review of what worked in CS, 16 years later</a>: it was wrong to say that capabilities were a &#34;no&#34; in 2015 given their effectiveness on mobile and that seems so obviously wrong at the time that I would call this a blunder rather than something where I gave it a decent amount of thought but should&#39;ve thought through it more deeply</li> </ul></li> <li>Pointlessly difficult to understand explanation <ul> <li><i>2013</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/3c-conflict/">How data alignment impacts memory latency</a>: the main plots in this post use a ratio of latencies, which adds a level of indirection that many people found confusing</li> <li><i>2017</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/p95-skill/">It is easy to achieve 95%-ile performance</a>: the most common objection people had to this post was something like &#34;False. You need to be very talented and/or it is hard to [play in the NBA / become a chess GM / achieve a 2200 chess rating]&#34;. <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1292574538912456707">James Clear made an even weaker claim on Twitter</a> and also got similar responses. There isn&#39;t really space to do this on Twitter, but in my blog post, I should&#39;ve included more concrete examples of what various levels of performance look like for people who have a difficult time estimating what performance looks like at various percentiles. To pick one of the less outlandish claims, <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/mwykjj/95_ile_isn_t_good#c_pudige">here&#39;s a claim that a 2200 rating is 95%-ile for someone who&#39;s ever played chess online</a>, which <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/mwykjj/95_ile_isn_t_good#c_iyoegc">appears to be off by perhaps four orders of magnitude, plus or minus one</a>.</li> </ul></li> <li>Errors in retrospect <ul> <li><i>2015</i>: <a href="https://macwright.com/blog-ads/">Blog monetization</a>: I grossly underestimated how much <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu">I could make on Patreon</a> by looking at how much Casey Muratori, Eric Raymond, and eevee were making on Patreon at the time. I thought that all three of them would out-earn me based for a variety of reasons and that was incorrect. A major reason that was incorrect was that boring, long-form, writing monetizes much better than I exepected, which means that I monetarily undervalued that compared to what other tech folks are doing. <ul> <li>A couple weeks ago, I added a link to Patreon at the top of posts (instead of just having one hidding at the bottom) and mentioned having a Patreon on Twitter. Since then, my earnings have increased by about as much as Eric Raymond makes in total and the amount seems to be increasing at a decent rate, which is a result I wouldn&#39;t have expected before the rise of substack. But anyone who realized how well individual writers can monetize their writing could&#39;ve created substack and no one did until Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie, and Jairaj Sethi created substack, so I&#39;d say that this one was somewhat non-obvious</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Thanks to Anja Boskovic and Ville Sundberg for comments/corrections/discussion.</p>  </div>
