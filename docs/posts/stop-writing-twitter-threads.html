    <h1>Stop Writing Twitter Threads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Over the last few weeks, I came upon a few interesting bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1550100582580604930">How to make your house more heat-proof</a> (French)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1574007771896455169">How to make your house more cold-proof</a> (French)</li>
<li><a href="&lt;https://twitter.com/lethal_guitar/status/1575123187360227335">Reverse engineering of the Duke Nukem II video game</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(yes, I have a very broad spectrum of interests)</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve clicked on the links, you&#39;ve probably noticed a pattern: they are all Twitter threads. And <strong>Twitter threads are an absolute abomination.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, it is really, really hard to read. The people who posted these had to hash their writings into <del>farts</del> <del>twats</del> tweets of 280 characters or less. Each tweet is displayed independently, and the reader has to make a cognitive effort to follow the flow. Adding GIF memes every 2 tweets doesn&#39;t help with this, but I guess this is a generational issue (I&#39;m old, get off my lawn!).</p>
<p>Then, it&#39;s never clear where the thread ends. Comments are piling up at the bottom, but in the case of the “How to make your house more heat-proof” thread, there is also a link to... <a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1550104828042428416">part 3 of the thread!</a></p>
<p>There is the aberration of the amount of data transferred, too. Just unfolding the <a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1574007771896455169">thread about the cold-proof housing</a> downloads 7.20 MB of data according to Firefox devtools (including <strong>5.30 MB of Javascript alone</strong>)… and it&#39;s not even the whole thread, since there is <a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1574012746252914691">a part 2</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/npilayan/status/1574018374287360000">part 3!</a> All in all, I had to download 22.26 MB of data. I actually heard about this thread thanks to <a href="https://www.standblog.org/blog/post/2022/09/26/Comment-proteger-son-logement-du-froid-sans-faire-de-gros-travaux-et-pour-pas-cher">Tristan Nitot&#39;s article about it</a>, where he stitched all the tweets together into an actual article. By comparison, his blog page downloads 28.94 KB of data (the full text is actually 16,093 bytes). I downloaded almost 800 times more data from Twitter to get the exact same information. <strong>Height hundred times more data, people!</strong></p>
<p>So please, please, if you plan on writing something longer than a bad joke or a snarky comment, <strong>do not use Twitter.</strong> Your ideas, your findings, your knowledge deserve better. Put your thoughts on your own website or blog, and share it with the World using whatever social network you see fit.</p>
<p>“But Pierre, I hear you say, you can use X/Y/Z service to render a Twitter thread as a single page, so where is the problem?” The problem is these solutions are just hacks on top of a crappy design, not to mention readers would have to know them to begin with. Please don&#39;t ask your readers to workaround Twitter&#39;s crappy design!</p>
<p>I highly recommend you follow this principle: <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE&gt;">Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere!</a></p>
