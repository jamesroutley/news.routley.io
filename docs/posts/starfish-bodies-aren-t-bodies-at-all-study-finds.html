      The heads of most animals are easily identifiable, but scientists haven’t been able to say the same for sea stars until now.

      A starfish has five identical arms with a layer of “tube feet” beneath them that can help the marine creature move along the seafloor, causing naturalists to puzzle over whether sea stars have defined front and back ends — and if they have heads at all.

      But new genetic research suggests the opposite — that sea stars are largely heads that lack torsos or tails and likely lost those features evolutionarily over time.</p>

      “It’s as if the sea star is completely missing a trunk, and is best described as just a head crawling along the seafloor,” said lead study author Laurent Formery, postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, in a statement. “It’s not at all what scientists have assumed about these animals.”

      The revelations, made possible by new methods of genetic sequencing, could help answer some of the biggest remaining questions about echinoderms,<strong> </strong>including their shared ancestry with humans and other animals that look nothing like them.

    A unique body plan

      Sea stars belong to a group called echinoderms, which includes sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. The unusual animals have unique body plans arranged in five equal sections that differ greatly from the symmetric head-to-tail bodies of bilateral animals, which have left and right sides mirroring each other.
  </p>

  


  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloh8feuw000m356iw6osvzji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Sea stars begin as fertilized eggs that hatch and become larvae that float in the ocean, like plankton, for weeks to months before settling on the ocean floor. There, they go through a process that transforms a bilateral body into a star shape, or pentaradial body.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloh8feuw000n356ib54q05uu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “This has been a zoological mystery for centuries,” said senior study coauthor Christopher Lowe, marine and developmental biologist at Stanford University, in a statement. “How can you go from a bilateral body plan to a pentaradial plan, and how can you compare any part of the starfish to our own body plan?”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloh8feuw000o356i907mi5gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The bilateral body plan most animals have stems from molecular-level genetic actions that can be traced in the head and trunk, or main body, regions, which is why vertebrates, like humans, and many invertebrates, including insects, share similar genetic programming. This discovery was awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1995/summary/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine in 1995.

      But echinoderms also share a common ancestor with bilateral animals, which adds to the puzzle researchers are trying to solve.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloh8feuw000q356ila3bdfnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “How the different body parts of the echinoderms relate to those we see in other animal groups has been a mystery to scientists for as long as we’ve been studying them,” said study coauthor Dr. Jeff Thompson, a lecturer at the University of Southampton, in a statement. “In their bilateral relatives, the body is divided into a head, trunk, and tail. But just looking at a starfish, it’s impossible to see how these sections relate to the bodies of bilateral animals.”

      Then, members of the team used advanced analytical techniques to spot where genes were expressed within the tissue and pinpoint specific sequences of RNA within the cells. Gene expression occurs when the information within a gene becomes functional.

      “If you strip away the skin of an animal and look at the genes involved in defining a head from a tail, the same genes code for these body regions across all groups of animals,” Lowe said. “So we ignored the anatomy and asked: Is there a molecular axis hidden under all this weird anatomy and what is its role in a starfish forming a pentaradial body plan?”

      Genetic signatures associated with the development of a head were detected all over the sea stars, especially concentrated in the center of the star and the center of each limb. But gene expression for torso and tail sections were largely absent, revealing that sea stars “have the most dramatic example of decoupling of the head and the trunk regions that we are aware of today,” said Formery, who is also a researcher at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, a nonprofit research organization in San Francisco.

      “When we compared the expression of genes in a starfish to other groups of animals, like vertebrates, it appeared that a crucial part of the body plan was missing,” Thompson said. “The genes that are typically involved in the patterning of the trunk of the animal weren’t expressed in the ectoderm. It seems the whole echinoderm body plan is roughly equivalent to the head in other groups of animals.”
