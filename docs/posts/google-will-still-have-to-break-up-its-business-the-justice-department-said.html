    <h1>Google will still have to break up its business, the Justice Department said</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google will have to break up its business, the Justice Department said in a filing, upholding the previous administration&#39;s proposal after a federal judge ruled last year that the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-a-monopolist-in-search-us-judge-rules-in-antitrust-case-193358356.html" data-ylk="slk:illegally abused;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">illegally abused</a> a monopoly over the search industry. As <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/07/google-doj-chrome-anthropic-break-up/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Washington Post;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/technology/trump-google-search-antitrust.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Times;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><em>The New York Times</em></a> have reported, the Justice Department reiterated in a new filing that Google will have to sell the Chrome browser. When the DOJ argued for its sale last year, it <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/department-of-justice-confirms-that-it-wants-google-to-sell-off-chrome-094929822.html" data-ylk="slk:said that selling Chrome;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">said that selling Chrome</a> &#34;will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.&#34;</p><p>The Justice Department also kept a Biden-era proposal that seeks to ban Google from paying companies like Apple, other smartphone manufacturers and Mozilla to make its search engine the default on their phones and browsers. It did remove a previous proposal that would compel Google to sell its stakes in AI startups, however, after Anthropic told the government that it needs the company&#39;s money to continue operating. Instead of banning AI investments altogether, the government wants to require the company to notify federal and state officials before making investments in artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the <em>Financial Times </em><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-investing-another-billion-dollars-in-anthropic-145548826.html" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> that Google was investing another billion dollars in Anthropic.</p><p>Google is expected to file its own proposal for its final set of alternative remedies. In the earlier one it <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-proposes-alternative-remedies-for-its-search-monopoly-after-doj-demands-radical-changes-185253526.html" data-ylk="slk:filed in December;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">filed in December</a>, the company said that the Justice Department&#39;s original remedies went &#34;overboard&#34; and that they reflected an &#34;interventionist agenda&#34; that &#34;goes far beyond what the Court&#39;s decision is actually about — [its] agreements with partners to distribute search.&#34; Google suggested allowing it continue paying partners like Apple and Mozilla to offer Google Search, but also to allow them to form agreements with other partners across different platforms. Apple could, for instance, offer different default search engines for iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, browser companies could change default search engines every 12 months.</p><p>As <em>The Post</em> notes, the Justice Department&#39;s filing could be an indicator of how the Trump administration will handle antitrust cases involving tech companies. It could be strict on big tech like the Biden administration was despite tech leaders supporting the new President and his policies. Google donated to the Trump campaign when he ran last year and just recently <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-reportedly-changing-course-on-its-diversity-initiatives-too-223644402.html" data-ylk="slk:halted efforts;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">halted efforts</a> to hire employees from diverse backgrounds. It said that it was &#34;no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce.&#34; The House also recently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/house-republicans-subpoena-google-over-alleged-censorship-212115140.html" data-ylk="slk:subpoenaed;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">subpoenaed</a> Alphabet and its CEO Sundar Pichai for communications between the company and the Biden administration regarding COVID-19.</p><p>Judge Amit Mehta, the original judge who ruled that Google was a monopolist and had &#34;acted as one to maintain its monopoly,&#34; will hear both the government&#39;s and the company&#39;s remedies and will decide on the final solutions for the case in April.</p></div></div>
