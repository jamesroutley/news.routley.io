                    <p>Apple has come up with a way to update an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone" title="iPhone" data-kpt="1">iPhone</a> still in its packaging, with a system allowing for iOS updates to be applied to unopened smartphones while still in an Apple Store. 
</p><p>One of the problems of buying hardware is that consumers often discover their devices need a software update straight out of the box. This can also apply to devices that have just launched, such as the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-15" title="iPhone 15" data-kpt="1">iPhone 15</a>, which needed an iOS 17.0.1 <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/21/apple-rolls-out-watchos-1001-update">update</a> that was released before the hardware actually shipped. 
</p><p>Writing in his &#34;Power On&#34; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94">newsletter</a> for <em>Bloomberg</em>, Mark Gurman claims that Apple has a system that can update the operating system of iPhones before they get sold. Crucially, it can do so without opening the box. 
</p><p>Consisting of a &#34;pad-like device,&#34; store employees place unopened iPhone boxes onto it to trigger an update. The pad wirelessly turns on the iPhone, runs the software update, then turns it off again. 
</p><p>While only iPhones are mentioned in the report, it&#39;s plausible that the idea could be extended to other products in Apple&#39;s catalog. 
</p><p>It is claimed that consumers may benefit from the system at Apple Stores before the end of 2023. </p>
