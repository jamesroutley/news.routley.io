The file is just a basic text file with some useful info about the website like what it is about, when was it published, the author, etc etc.</p><p>It can be great if the website somehow ends up in a training dataset (who knows), and it can be super helpful for AI website crawlers, instead of using thousands of tokens to know what your website is about, they can do it with just a few hundred.</p></div></div></div>
