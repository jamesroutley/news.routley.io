    <h1>Things I canâ€™t do on macOS which I can do on Ubuntu (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>I&#39;ve never &#34;got&#34; the appeal of a Mac. But I have to use one for work.</p><p>Here&#39;s a partial list of everything I <em>cannot</em> do on a Mac, but I <em>can</em> do on Ubuntu.</p><p>These are all objective facts. These are things which either are impossible, or require adding unsupported 3rd party software - sometimes at a cost.</p><ul><li>Resize the system font<ul><li>I find the menu bar at the top too small. The only way to do this on MacOS is to lower the resolution of the entire screen!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Change the system font<ul><li>I know you like <del>Helvetica</del> San Francisco - but I find it a bit too thin to read.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Focus Follow Mouse<ul><li>I have multiple screens and multiple windows. I want to be able to hover over a new one and start interacting with it without clicking.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Change my mouse button order<ul><li>On Linux, this is a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2011/06/review-evoluent-vertical-mouse-4-and-how-to-make-it-work-in-ubuntu/">complex command-line incantation</a>. On MacOS it is impossible. I use a vertical mouse and use my thumb to click. RSI FTW!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Read files from MTP devices<ul><li>If I stick a USB cable between my phone and Linux laptop, I can see the Android files on my laptop. I can open them, move them around, etc. On a Mac I need to install some shonky 3rd party software which rarely works.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Always on top windows<ul><li>Sometimes I want to keep the calculator on screen while I type an email. Is that too much to ask?</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>No way to remove UI elements.<ul><li>I don&#39;t want a notification icon in the top right of my screen. I prefer having the clock on the left. Trivial in Linux, static in MacOS.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Window snapping<ul><li>On Ubuntu, I drag a window to the side or to a corner, and it snaps into position. Vital when using multiple windows at once. On Mac there&#39;s a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204948">half-hearted splitscreen view</a> which only supports horizontal splitting. Useless on a vertical monitor.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>See tooltips<ul><li><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/04/accessibility-of-macos-large-cursor-hides-tooltips/">I can&#39;t see them on Mac when I have a larger cursor</a>. Weird!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Mount an SSH or NFS drive<ul><li>In Ubuntu, I get a nice little GUI for picking network shares. Impossible on Mac.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Wobbly Windows!<ul><li>Seriously MacOS. Where&#39;s the fun?</li></ul></li></ul><p>I know you&#39;re going to be tempted to reply with &#34;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/iphone-4-death-grip">you&#39;re using it wrong</a>&#34; - but I&#39;m not. This is how I like to use my computer. And it is clear that the MacBook isn&#39;t my computer - it is Apple&#39;s.</p></div></div>
