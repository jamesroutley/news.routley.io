Hello,

Canonical, the creator and main contributor of the LXD project has
decided that after over 8 years as part of the Linux Containers
community, the project would now be better served directly under
Canonical’s own set of projects.

While the team behind Linux Containers regrets that decision and will
be missing LXD as one of its projects, it does respect Canonical’s
decision and is now in the process of moving the project over.

Concretely, the expected changes are:

 - <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxd">https://github.com/lxc/lxd</a> will now become <a href="https://github.com/canonical/lxd">https://github.com/canonical/lxd</a>
 - <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd">https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd</a> will disappear and be replaced with
a mention directing users to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/lxd">https://ubuntu.com/lxd</a>
 - The LXD YouTube channel will be handed over to the Canonical team
 - The LXD section on the LinuxContainers community forum will slowly
be sunset in favor of the Ubuntu Discourse forum run by Canonical
 - The LXD CI infrastructure will be moved under Canonical’s care
 - Image building for Linux Containers will no longer be relying on
systems provided by Canonical, limiting image building to x86_64 and
aarch64.

What will not be changing:

 - The rest of the Linux Containers projects remain unaffected
 - The image server, currently used by both LXC and LXD will keep
operating as normal, though with less architectures available as
mentioned above

Those changes will likely all happen pretty rapidly as everything is
relatively tightly integrated together. As a result, you may notice a
bit of bumpiness while Canonical sets up the replacement
infrastructure.

Sincerely,

The Linux Containers team
