    <p>creating a sample player machine from scratch.</p>
</div>
<p>the zeptocore is a portable music device created by infinite digits (myself), released on May 3rd, 2024, which is available to buy on my website <a href="https://zeptocore.com/" target="_blank">zeptocore.com</a>.</p>
<p>the zeptocore is a handmade, handheld sample player. It is supposed to be a fun device, where you can easily create new and interesting sounds out of a bank of samples by smashing buttons.</p>

<h3 id="the-beginnings">the beginnings</h3>
<p>I’ve been interested in mangling samples for a long time. I created a number of programs for the <a href="https://monome.org/docs/norns/" target="_blank">norns sound computer</a> using <a href="https://sccode.org" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> that allow you to mangle samples in interesting ways. here is a selection:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/amen" target="_blank">amen</a> - sample mangler and looper</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/amenbreak" target="_blank">amenbreak</a> - dedicated amen break script</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/makebreakbeat" target="_blank">makebreakbeat</a> - make breakbeats from scamples</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/dnb.lua/" target="_blank">dnb.lua</a> - using aubio and sox to generate breakbeats</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/sampswap" target="_blank">sampswap</a> - copies and pastes samples together</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schollz/glitchlets" target="_blank">glitchlets</a> - glitch audio</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few years of making software, I decided it would be fun and rewarding to make a physical device.</p>
<h3 id="the-breadboard">the breadboard</h3>
<p>I started working on this device about a year ago using off-the-shelf components wired into a breadboard. I got the very first prototype working in July, on a long plane trip from Seattle to Berlin. (Strangely no TSA agent ever asked me about the breadboard with wires sticking out of it!)</p>
<p>Here is the first video of the first ever version:</p>

</p>

<p>This version is basically just some off the shelf components (a PMC5102, SD card, and Raspberry Pi Pico) but it worked and was fun. I actually still support this version which I call “<a href="https://zeptocore.com/#zeptoboard" target="_blank">zeptoboard</a>”.</p>

</p>
<p>You can build this today and it still works great, especially with the MIDI interface on a Chrome browser:</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">the hardware</h2>
<p>Once I got the basic concept working I started on the hardware. The basic hardware is not too complicated - it needed to support SD card SDIO interfaces, 20 buttons, and 20 lights, 3 knobs. I am using the Raspberry Pi Pico as the CPU which didn’t have enough GPIOs for all of this, so I added a PCA9552 as a light controller and did a keyboard matrix for the GPIOs. Instead of off-the-shelf SD card and audio DAC I also integrated them into the board.</p>
<p>All in all it took me about 28 tries to get the board right. There were about 15 versions that just <em>didn’t work</em> and it turned out to be something really silly like a bad soldering pad for the sd card.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>In the end I was able to get matching colors for the Raspberry Pi Pico and the board which I also liked. (There was a separate incident where a large box of Raspberry Pi Picos got lost on its way to me and everything was delayed weeks :( ).</p>
<h2 id="the-firmware">the firmware</h2>
<p>I spent almost a year writing the firmware which I call “<a href="https://github.com/schollz/_core" target="_blank">_core</a>” as it is somewhat hardware agnostic. I’m still writing the firmware.</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>One very fun part of doing the firmware was writing my own effects. I’m especially proud of the saturation and fuzz effects. The fuzz, for example, is a very simple transfer function:</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>Which has a really cool effect on sound (you can hear it halfway through the following clip):</p>

</p>

<p>The most frusturating part of the firmware was the SD card latency. I am streaming samples from the SD card which has the benefit of no memory limits but the downside of latency. I wrote a <a href="https://infinitedigits.co/tinker/sdcard">blog post about SD card latency</a> and found that not all the SD cards are the same. I managed to find some SD card that will work, though.</p>
<h2 id="the-release">the release</h2>
<p>After two dozen revisions, and months and months of firmware, I am so happy to finally “release” the zeptocore into the wild. Its certainly a fun device - I would spent hours playing with it when I was supposed to be programming it.</p>

<p>I hope that others can find joy in it too.</p>
