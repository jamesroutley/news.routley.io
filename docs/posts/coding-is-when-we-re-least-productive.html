<p>One old dragon that’s reared its head again in this “age of AI” is the very wrongheaded notion that <em>productivity == code</em>. Managers aim to maximise the amount of code their dev teams produce, and so they maximise the time devs spend writing code.</p>



<p>Let me tell you a story about the value of code.</p>



<p>When I first started contracting, I worked on a Point Of Sale system upgrade for a major retailer. I was stuck on a feature, and just couldn’t wrap my head around the use case because I’d never actually seen their existing system in operation.</p>



<p>So I walked to a local branch on the high street, showed them my security pass, and asked if I could observe and – when the cashier wasn’t busy – ask questions.</p>



<p>They told me they could do better than that. Upstairs they had a room with a working till in it, which they used to train new staff. They also used it to test system updates, which was the first time I’d seen what we now call a “model office” for software testing.</p>



<p>We were able to run through the use case scenarios I was stuck on, with them showing me how to use the POS system to achieve specific goals. The mist cleared. It was like I’d been reading a book on how to ride a bicycle that had no pictures, and then someone gave me a bicycle.</p>



<p>Enlightened, I walked back to the office and changed about three lines of code. That was all the coding I did that day. Three lines, in 8 hours.</p>



<p>But if I hadn’t made that trip and seen for myself, and had a chance to talk to a department manager in that store, those three lines would have been applying special offers wrong. (If only the person who wrote the spec had done this in the first place…)</p>



<p>Now multiply that error by 250 branches nationwide. I potentially saved my client a bunch of money and embarrassment with that 3-line change.</p>



<p>Now, I consider that a <em>productive </em>day.</p>



<p>But had I been measured on my contribution by lines of code, or commits, or features finished, it would have been seen as a very <em>unproductive </em>day by my manager.</p>



<p>I may have felt pressured to stay at my workstation, bashing out more code, compounding the mistake and costing my client more money.</p>



<p>A very teachable moment for me early in my career. The lightbulb pinged: some code is worth more than others, and coding and productivity aren’t the same thing. </p>



<p>We could even argue that coding is the <em>interruption</em>. What’s the shortcut in IntelliJ that tells you if you’re writing the wrong code? Oh, that’s right. There isn’t one.</p>



<p>When I’m heads-down-coding, I’m not seeing, I’m not asking, and I’m not learning about the problem. To do that, I have to get up from my desk, go to where the problem is and/or the people I need to ask are, and have a conversation. Let the dog see the rabbit.</p>



<p>This takes time. And if we’re producing code faster than we can validate it – either by exploring the problem ourselves, or learning from user feedback if our release cycles are fast enough – then we’re piling assumptions on top of assumptions.</p>



<p>I’ve seen so many times how 10 lines of code can end up being worth £millions, and 10,000 ends up being worthless.</p>



<p>If productivity, in reality, is a measure of how much net value we create, then that learning feedback loop is where the <em>real </em>productivity happens, and not at our desks punching keys. Coding is when we’re <em>least</em> productive.</p>
