    <ul>
<li>My next Youtube video is shaping up slowly, I was hoping to have it out by the end of last month but surprise, it&#39;s a series (no one is surprised but me. everything is a series if I&#39;m making it). If you&#39;re reading this and are a self-taught video editing genius (especially if you use DaVinci Resolve!) hit me up, I am confused how I improve my skills after a certain point. Gonna have to work out how to break up my menagerie of depressing graphs without just putting joke graphs in as it doesn&#39;t match the tone I think? It&#39;s the start of the <a href="https://social.gfsc.studio/@oluOnline/112416671608688455">digital divide/who isn&#39;t online</a> series.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/oluonline-1717366537-0.png" alt="A graph with a y axis of &#34;who cares&#34; and an x axis of &#34;sick of graphs&#34;. a line is plotted on the graph with one dot highlighted, which is labelled &#34;shut up&#34;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>After talking a bit with a friend about my only spiritual practice being that of trying to cultivate awe, I was reminded about my whole <a href="https://social.gfsc.studio/@oluOnline/111705084151757819">technopagan</a>
belief/bit (and truly what is the difference, between a fervently held belief and a bit you won&#39;t stop doing? nothing, next question). I was starting to make a wheel of the year which incorporates a lot more technological/tool based awe and gratitude into it, hopefully will finish that off this week. Gonna start reading &#34;Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild&#34; by Lucy Jones after it was mentioned in a podcast episode recommended during this discussion.</li>
<li>Trying to play a game of rapid online chess a day this week. Trying to persuade myself it will be a rated game, 152 ELO on chess.com or no.</li>
<li>Daily (morning was ambitious lol) pages are still going strong I think I hit thirty days yesterday! Very happy, long may it continue.</li>
<li>Trying to work out if I want to post to Substack much after all. I think if I&#39;m trying to build online community primarily why the hell not, but I also wonder if people will be tired of my incessant chatter with three windows + social media into my mind.</li>
<li>Thinking about &#34;neurodivergence/ND&#34; and why I always feel a bit skeeved out by the term despite all my autism, historical divides between the mad/mentally ill and physically disabled communities, whether labels matter, etc.</li>
<li>Might start ukulele lessons shortly and a friend asked if I had dyspraxia and, whilst I am unsure, it took me a few beats to realise &#34;oh yeah, being dyspraxic would make instruments hard in theory&#34;. Learnt names for all the different types of dyspraxia and read a few helpful and/or upsetting posts on Reddit on r/dyspraxia, mild recommend.</li>
<li>I really want to get an electric scooter but given possible dyspraxia and general lack of spatial and body awareness I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a very bad idea.</li>
<li>Excited to start getting into stretching, wholehearted recommend for <a href="https://instagram.com/aadamrichardson/">Adam Richardson</a>, he has a really approachable manner and isn&#39;t too broey about the whole thing.</li>
