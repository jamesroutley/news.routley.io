    <h1>Mechanical Keyboard Primer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been using “fancy” keyboards for my whole professional career.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I’ve managed to get one family member hooked so far, and another has some questions, so: here’s some of what I know about mechanical keyboards.</p>
<p>I’ve received no money or goods for anything in this post. There’s no affiliate links. If you want <em>actual experts</em>, <a href="https://www.keyboard.university" target="_blank">Keyboard University</a> looks to have some okay primers; note they are <a href="https://thekey.company/" target="_blank">trying to sell you something</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-mechanical-about-it">What’s mechanical about it?</h2>
<p>Non-mechanical keyboards use rubber or metal domes as springs, and a some additional material (usually plastic) to stabilize the vertical motion.
<a href="https://www.rubber-keypad.com/how-does-rubber-dome-work.html" target="_blank">This page</a> has some good pictures and prose about domes. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/" target="_blank">This page</a> describes the “scissor” and “butterfly” mechanisms common for stabilizing low-profile keys.</p>
<p>Mechanical keyboards have more moving parts for each key, typically encapsulated in a <em>keyswitch</em>.
There’s a distinct housing, stem, spring, and contacts, each of which affects the feel, sound, and weight.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/patent.png" alt="US Patent 4467160 figure 1: an exploded view of a mechanical keyswitch, showing a two-part housing, stem, stabilizer, spring, electrical contact mechanisms, and various other parts." width="60%"/><figcaption>

<h2 id="keyswitch-coloring">Keyswitch coloring</h2>
<p>Keyswitch manufacturers offer several different interchangeable models with different properties (discussed below). Most manufacturers use a color – the same color – to refer to a combination of feel, sound, and weight. “Red”, “brown”, and “blue” are typical options, with offsets from those representing variations.</p>
<p>There’s no “best” for these; it’s all up to your preferences. I typically use a red-like switch, though I’m looking at brown-ish options for the future.</p>
<h3 id="feel-force-curve">Feel (force curve)</h3>
<p>The springs of a mechanical keyswitch can be configured to have different resistances at different points. This gives a different feel to the switch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear:</strong> Travel is directly proportionate to force.</li>
<li><strong>Tactile:</strong> There’s a “bump” when pressing. Press a little, it goes down, then resists more; overcome that resistance, and it becomes easier again.</li>
<li><strong>Clicky:</strong> Like tactile, but also makes an audible click when actuated.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.kailh.net/products/kailh-choc-v2-low-profile-switch-set" target="_blank">This page</a> from Kailh, a keyswitch manufacturer, has diagrams of the force curves: how much the key depresses for a given force. These diagrams combine feel and weight. You can see the three typical colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Linear, quiet, ~45g</li>
<li>Brown: Tactile, quiet, ~45g</li>
<li>Blue: Tactile, clicky, ~45g</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sound">Sound</h3>
<p>Some switches are specifically engineered to be quieter, or louder, when pressed. A “clicky” profile intentionally makes a sound; some “silent” switches are be quieter. There’s also some <a href="#grommets">modifications</a> that can dampen the sound, with some change to feel.</p>
<p>I’ve been using silent red MX keyswitches and <a href="https://lowprokb.ca/products/ambients-silent-choc-switches" target="_blank">Ambients</a> Choc keyswitches. There’s a noticeable difference in my office volume!</p>
<h3 id="weight--actuation-force">Weight / actuation force</h3>
<p>Some switches are lighter (less resistance) and some are heavier, while retaining the same general feel (linear/tactile/clicky).</p>
<p>Weight can be a significant comfort factor, in either direction. A reviewer of this article mentioned she had RSI flare-ups when using heavier switches; I’ve felt some strain after switching to <em>lighter</em> swtiches, trying to keep from accidentally pushing them.</p>
<p>Companies offer key-switch testers to let you try the feel – including weight – of different keys. These can be useful for finding what the best setup is for you.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-keyboards">Customizing keyboards</h2>
<p>Lots of mechanical keyboards can be customized, by replacing the keyswitches, replacing the keycaps, or performing other modifications.</p>
<h3 id="compatiblity">Compatibility</h3>
<p>…but there are some limitations – not all keyswitches or keycaps are compatible with each other. They can differ in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Footprint</strong>: Keyswitches electrically and physically connect to a printed circuit board (PCB), and often physically connect to a stabilizing switch-plate.
<a href="https://github.com/kiswitch/kiswitch" target="_blank">This repository</a> has some nice screenshots in its README.</li>
<li><strong>Stem</strong>: Keycaps physically connect to the stem of the keyswitch.</li>
<li><strong>Spacing</strong>: How far apart the switches are spaced determines what size of keycaps can fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>A keyswitch or a keyboard can mix-and-match compatibility between these, to some extent. For example:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cherry MX</strong>-compatible switches use the MX footprint,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> stem, and spacing. (Kailh Box switches are MX-compatible.)</li>
<li><strong>Kailh Choc V1</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> switches use a Choc footprint, but use a different stem. A keyboard lay out Choc keyswitches in an MX spacing, or in a tighter Choc spacing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zsaVoyager/comments/1bnp8kq/never_realized_a_voyager_had_mx_spacing_until_i/" target="_blank">this post</a> shows. In the tighter spacing, MX-<em>sized</em> keycaps won’t fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of mechanical keyboards come with <em>hot-swap sockets</em>, which allow replacing keyswitches without soldering.
Having hot-swap sockets on my keyboads has been very useful in letting me replace “stock” keyswitches with silent ones.</p>

      <p>The Choc switch (left) has additional stabilizing pins and a slightly different pinout from an MX-compatible switch (right). The keyboard’s PCB and other hardware need to be compatible with the switch form-factor.</p>
    </figcaption>

<h3 id="keycaps">Keycaps</h3>
<p>Keycaps attach to the top of the keyswitches; the thing you touch is the keycap. Since the keycap is a separate part, it can be replaced for aesthetics or to change the texture of your keyboard.</p>
<p>Keycaps can be flat, with all rows the same height; or sculpted, so the home row is lower than neighbors. <a href="https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keycaps-101-ydy8j" target="_blank">This page</a> has some nice cross-sections.</p>
<div>

      <p>This Atreus keyboard mixes keycaps from different sets. Most from a <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/linear-a-keycaps" target="_blank">set</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A" target="_blank">Linear A</a> keycaps, but the cat’s paw and PANIC buttons add some more personality.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="grommets">Grommets</h3>
<p>You can fit rubber grommets around some MX keycap stems to quiet keypresses. It’s is a pretty simple way to cut down on noise, without changing out keyswitches.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/grommet.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/grommet.webp" alt="An Ergodox keyboard with one key removed, showing a rubber grommet on the keycap&#39;s stem."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>The small white ring around the stem of this keycap is a rubber grommet, which helps reduce noise from keypresses.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="custom-programming">Custom programming</h3>
<p>All modern keyboards have some sort of microcontroller in them, to check for keypresses and report to the computer. Many use open source, customizable firmware, like <a href="https://qmk.fm" target="_blank">QMK</a> or <a href="https://zmk.dev" target="_blank">ZMK</a>.</p>
<p>These firmware stacks can provide some neat features. For instance, keys can be configured to have different <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/tap_hold" target="_blank">hold and tap</a> behaviors: for example, hold for a “shift” key, tap for an “enter” key.</p>
<p>You don’t have write any software to use these features! Most firmware stacks have a graphical configurator that let you click-and-select key behaviors; <a href="https://config.qmk.fm" target="_blank">QMK’s</a>, <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/" target="_blank">ZSA’s</a>, or another depending on the keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>
<p>The only thing you can’t really change about a mechanical keyboard is its layout: where the physical keys are.
The typical US keyboard has an ANSI layout, while a European keyboard probably uses the ISO layout (see <a href="https://ranked.gg/blogs/news/unlocking-the-mystery-of-unusual-keyboard-layouts-a-comprehensive-guide-to-ansi-iso-jis-abnt-ks-and-more" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>But keyboard enthusiasts have made some Very Interesting choices in layout.</p>
<h3 id="reduced-layouts">Reduced layouts</h3>
<p>A not-too-tricky variation is an “X%” layout, providing a subset of the ANSI keys without really moving those that are kept.
<a href="https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby" target="_blank">This page</a> lists some typical variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-size (ANSI): A normal keyboard</li>
<li>Ten-key-less (TKL): …without a numpad</li>
<li>Compact / 60%: …and without arrow keys, function keys, or the home/end/etc cluster</li>
<li>40%: …and without a number row.</li>
</ul>
<p>The removed keys are usually replaced by “layers” in the <a href="#custom-programming">keyboard firmware</a>.</p>
<p>You can think of layers like the <strong>Fn</strong> key on a laptop: an additional set of modifiers that change the meaning of some keys. For instance, on a 40% layout, you might press “layer raise + W” to get a “2” key, instead of having a dedicated number row.</p>
<h3 id="split">Split</h3>
<p>A split keyboard has a gap between the left and right-hand sides.</p>
<p>Some split keyboards come as a single piece, but twist the keys in
to make it easier to have your wrists straight forward from your forearms.
Among others, the <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus" target="_blank">Atreus</a> and <a href="https://www.everythingusb.com/microsoft-natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000-11615.html" target="_blank">Microsoft Ergonomic 4000</a> keyboards take this approach.</p>
<p>There’s also two-piece split keyboards, where the left-hand and right-hand halves are
physically separate (though typically joined by an electrical cable).
Moving the two halves further apart allows your shoulders to open up, as well as keeping your wrists
aligned with your arms.</p>

      <p>Spacing my arms further apart opens my shoulders and chest, which is more comfortable for long periods.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<h3 id="columnar-and-ortholinear">Columnar and ortholinear</h3>
<p>Typical keyboards layouts (ANSI, ISO, etc.) are <em>row-aligned</em>: keys are arranged in rows, and the rows are offset from each other.</p>
<p>A <em>columnar</em> keyboard arranges keys into <em>columns</em>, and offsets the columns. This layout means that your fingers curl and uncurl, but don’t usually have to <em>splay</em> in or out.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> These are often split, since there’s a natural / smooth column break.</p>
<p>An <em>ortholinear</em> keyboard arranges keys in rows and columns, i.e. on a grid. These can be split (for example, <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/" target="_blank">Kinesis</a> Advantage) or single-piece (for example, OLKB <a href="https://olkb.com/collections/planck" target="_blank">Planck</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/layouts.svg"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/layouts.svg" alt="Diagrams of row-oriented, columnar, and ortholinear layouts. In the row layout, keys aligned in rows but not in columns. In the columnar layout, keys are aligned in columns but not in rows. In the ortholinear layout, keys are in a grid."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>Columnar layouts are designed on the idea that fingers curl in and out, but aren’t all the same length.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="topography">Topography</h3>
<p>There’s several ways the topography (height) of keyboards can deviate from “flat”.</p>
<p>Risers can change the forward/backward angle of a keyboard. Some keyboards angle the top edge up
to present the keys closer to face-on to… uh, your face. Others tilt the keyboard on a <em>downward</em>
slant, like the riser for the <a href="https://www.everythingusb.com/microsoft-natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000-11615.html" target="_blank">Microsoft Ergonomic 4000</a>.</p>
<p>Split keyboards often can be <em>tented</em>, tilting downwards from the gap between the halves.
This puts the wrists and forearms in a supinated position, which can be more comfortable.</p>
<p>Some keyboards have <em>finger wells</em>. Instead of putting <a href="#keycaps">keycaps</a> at different heights,
they put the keyswitches at different heights, curved to approximate the reach of each finger.
<a href="https://nathanfriend.io/2023/06/26/i-built-a-weird-keyboard.html" target="_blank">This post</a> describes a particularly scuplted design based on the Dactyl Manuform; <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/" target="_blank">Kinesis</a> offer commercial models with substantial wells.</p>

      <p>Voyager keyboards come with optional risers for the inner edge, providing a mild tent.</p>
    </figcaption>

<h3 id="thumb-clusters">Thumb clusters</h3>
<p>Most thumbs are underserved by having one key for two thumbs. Especially in split keyboards,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
keyboard designers add additional keys in reach of the thumb; the thumb can curl around and hit several different ones.</p>
<p>Thumb clusters are especially useful for avoiding the splay mentioned in this footnote.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Putting shift, enter,
and other modifiers on the thumb cluster allows you to tap them without splaying fingers.</p>
<p>Thumb cluster size varies, and what size and shape work best depend on your hands. Some of my keyboards have
a thumb cluster that’s too big for me to use, others have too few keys.</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/thumbs-others.webp"><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/mechanical-keyboard-primer/thumbs-others.webp" alt="Thumb clusters of a Voyager keyboard (two buttons, 1u and 1.5u) and an Ergodox keyboard (6 keys, two of which are 2u). My hands rest on the outermost key of each cluster, close to my hands."/></a><figcaption>
      <p>The Voyager keyboard (left) has two thumb buttons; I use hold-and-tap to get more mileage out of both. The Ergodox (right) has six, but most of them are too hard for me to reach effectively. Your hands may be in a different resting position than mine on the same keyboard!</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="wired-and-wireless">Wired and wireless</h3>
<p><strong>Most mechanical keyboards are wired.</strong> A USB cable connects to the computer: for two-piece split keyboards, another cable connects the two halves.</p>
<p>This might surprising for a “premium” (expensive) product! But wireless communications have their own complications; and <em>shipping batteries</em> is a complicated process, which independent shops might not be equipped to deal with.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>There <em>are</em> wireless designs out there, and wireless modifications of wired designs. But know that the default is “USB keyboard”.</p>
<h3 id="why-get-a-mechanical-keyboard">Why get a mechanical keyboard?</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of reasons to get into mechanical keyboards, some good (ergonomics, fun, repairability)
and some bad (conspicuous consumption, intentional annoyance of coworkers).</p>
<p>If you have a dome or laptop keyboard that you’re happy with, great! Use it!
If you want to try something else, great! There’s lots of options!</p>
<p>I have <em>my</em> preferences in keyboards, but they’re not normative;
I recommend exploring your network<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and trying out different options, to see what <em>you</em> like or don’t.</p>
