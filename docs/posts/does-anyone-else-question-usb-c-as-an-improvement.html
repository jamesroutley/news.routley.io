    <h1>Ask HN: Does anyone else question USB-C as an “improvement”?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I know it&#39;s been discussed ad nauseam over the years but USB-C has been driving me crazy:<p>- Not knowing the capabilities of any port or device. Reminds me of the Plug and Play days: &#34;well let&#39;s plug it in and see what happens&#34;.</p><p>- Power delivery? Passthrough? Good luck finding the magical combination of supported devices, wattage, etc. Even when I thought I found the right one my laptop would occasionally end up in some weird state between discharging and charging - taking power but not acknowledging it in software and slowly discharging but not as much without power...</p><p>- Display Port alt-mode. Where do I even start... Some cables mostly work but running two 4k displays reliably at 60Hz seems to be near impossible. Occasionally a display drops completely and there&#39;s some sort of strange reboot/shut down/kill power to everything combination I haven&#39;t quite figured out yet. They randomly drop from 60Hz to 30Hz or don&#39;t initialize at 60Hz. Then some cables don&#39;t support DPMS, DDC, who knows what else.</p><p>It seems that with high speed (10gbit or so from what I recall) via USB A, extremely capable HDMI, and dedicated charging ports prior to USB-C that was the epitome of connectivity, function, and reliability.</p><p>Initially I attributed all of this to the inevitable quirks of any new technology but after several years it seems as though these issues (and more) may never get sorted out.</p><p>What am I missing?</p></div></div>
