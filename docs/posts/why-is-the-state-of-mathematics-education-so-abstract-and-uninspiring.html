    <h1>Why is the state of mathematics education so abstract and uninspiring?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I came across this article by V.I. Arnold : https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html which is rather old. But some of the points mentioned in the article can be related to problems in the classroom today also.</p><p>People have an idea that being abstract and talking in abstract terms creates some sort of elitism. But it hampers understanding and excitement at the nascent stages. Abstraction is required to tackle complexity. But that is not the all and be all of the domain.</p><p>It can be taught like other natural sciences starting with real life examples and building up. It is much more clearly written in the article.</p><p>I would very much love to hear about books or courses that teach mathematics in the way mentioned in the article.</p></div></div></div>
