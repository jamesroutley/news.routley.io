    <h1>Pledging $300k to the Zig Software Foundation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My wife and I have pledged $300,000<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> to the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">Zig Software Foundation</a> (ZSF).</p>
<p>The ZSF has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/news/300k-from-mitchellh/">posted their own announcement</a>
which clearly explains their mission and specifically what the money will be
used for. Instead, I want to talk more broadly about why we&#39;ve decided to
support ZSF.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been following the Zig project since sometime in 2019. I
publicly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1435670230215192579">shared my excitement about the project in 2021</a>.
I started using Zig later that year and by early 2022, I began
<a href="https://jvns.ca/zig">writing about Zig</a> plus
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/10751">contributing to the compiler</a>, and
I&#39;ve continued to make <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amitchellh">a few dozen code contributions</a>
since then. In 2023, I publicly shared my <a href="https://jvns.ca/ghostty">terminal project Ghostty</a>
which is written in Zig. Today, I spend most of my coding time in Zig.</p>
<p>My family enjoys supporting causes we believe in<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. As part of this, we want to
support independent software projects that we believe can be transformative
and impactful, both as a way to give back to the community that gave me so
much but more importantly as a way to highlight and encourage a culture of
building for the love of building. Zig is one of those projects.</p>
<p>Zig was started as and continues to be a huge passion project. It is well
managed, the community is strong, and the funding model is transparent and
sustainable. As a technology, it is ambitious and innovative, but still
practical and pragmatic. It has a long way to go to reach stability and
broader industry adoption, but I believe it has a clear path and opportunity
to get there.</p>
<p>We&#39;re proud to support Zig and the Zig Software Foundation and are excited to see
what the future holds for the project. As a reminder, around
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/news/2024-financials/">a third of the funding for ZSF</a>
comes from individual donations.
Please consider <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">donating</a> if you can. Thanks
Andrew for starting an amazing project and to the entire Zig community for
making it what it is today!</p>
