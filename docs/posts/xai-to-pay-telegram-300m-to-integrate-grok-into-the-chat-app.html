<p id="speakable-summary">Telegram has struck a partnership with Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, to distribute the latter’s chatbot, Grok, via Telegram and integrate it into apps available on the chat app’s platform for one year.</p>

<p>xAI will pay $300 million in cash and equity to the chat app as part of the deal, Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/durov/status/1927697402095378432">said</a> on Tuesday.</p>







<p>Durov said Telegram will also earn 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions purchased through the app.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, xAI made the Grok chatbot available to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/grok/status/1904840863622066629">Telegram’s premium users</a>. It seems Grok might now be made available to all users.</p>

<p>A video posted by Durov on X suggested that Grok can be pinned on top of chats within the app, and users can also ask questions to Grok from the search bar. Notably, Meta has also integrated Meta AI into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/meta-is-testing-an-ai-powered-search-bar-in-instagram/">the search bar on Instagram and WhatsApp</a>.</p>

<p>The video also shows that you will be able to use Grok for writing suggestions, summarizing chats, links and documents, and creating stickers. Grok will supposedly also help answer questions for businesses and assist with moderation.</p>

<p><em>Note: This story was corrected to clarify that xAI is paying Telegram $300 million for distributing Grok.</em></p>
