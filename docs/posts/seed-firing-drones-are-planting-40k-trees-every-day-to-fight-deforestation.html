    <h1>Seed-firing drones are planting 40k trees every day to fight deforestation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s face it. Talk about <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/14/nature-loss-could-be-as-catastrophic-as-climate-change-so-how-can-we-prevent-it"><strong>biodiversity loss</strong></a> at a party and you’re unlikely to make friends.</p><p>Talk about an army of seed-firing drones, however, and suddenly you’re the coolest person there.</p><p>Well believe it or not, an Australian start-up is doing exactly that. Using a fleet of highly advanced &#39;octocopters&#39;, <strong><a href="https://airseedtech.com/">AirSeed Technology</a></strong> is fighting deforestation by combining <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/06/30/could-artificial-intelligence-stop-840-million-people-from-going-hungry-by-2030"><strong>artificial intelligence</strong></a> with specially designed seed pods which can be fired into the ground from high in the sky.</p><p>&#34;Each of our drones can plant over 40,000 seed pods per day and they fly autonomously,&#34; says Andrew Walker, CEO and co-founder of AirSeed Technologies.</p><p>&#34;In comparison to traditional methodologies, that&#39;s 25 times faster, but also 80 per cent cheaper.&#34;</p><h2>Planting 100 million trees by 2024</h2><p>Before takeoff, each drone hopper is loaded with specially selected seed pods compatible with the habitat below.</p><p>These pods are manufactured using <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/02/12/stop-burning-trees-for-energy-hundreds-of-scientists-tell-eu-leaders"><strong>waste biomass</strong></a>, providing a carbon rich coating that protects the seeds from birds, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/06/13/this-farm-is-breeding-insects-to-replace-pesticides"><strong>insects</strong></a> and rodents.</p><p>&#34;The niche really lies in our biotech, which is the support system for the seed once it&#39;s on the ground,&#34; says Walker.</p><p>“It protects the seed from <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/11/02/how-to-spot-wildlife-in-the-city-tips-from-an-urban-naturalist"><strong>different types of wildlife</strong></a>, but also supports the seed once it germinates and really helps deliver all of those nutrients and mineral sources that it needs, along with some probiotics to really boost early-stage growth.&#34;</p><p>Once airborne, the drones navigate fixed flight paths, planting to predefined patterns and recording each seeds&#39; coordinates.</p><p>This allows AirSeed to assess the health of their trees as they grow.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re being very mindful of the fact that <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/12/the-fate-of-our-planet-hinges-on-soil-our-silent-ally-says-un-scientist"><strong>we need to restore soil health</strong></a>, we need to restore microbial communities within the soil, and we need to restore primary habitat providers for animals,” continues Walker, who believes the sky&#39;s the limit for the drone-based technology.</p><p>The company has already planted more than 50,000 trees, and aims to plant a total of 100 million by the year 2024.</p><h2>How serious is deforestation around the world?</h2><p>The United Nations Environment Programme says the earth loses 70,000 square kilometres of forest every year - an area roughly the size of Portugal.</p><p>It&#39;s calling for this figure to be halved by 2025 and for an end to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/13/we-can-t-tackle-climate-change-if-we-don-t-look-after-our-forests-says-new-report"><strong>net deforestation</strong></a> globally by 2030.</p><p>But with <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/01/02/will-2022-finally-spell-the-end-for-fossil-fuels-here-s-what-s-on-the-climate-agenda"><strong>deforestation rates unlikely to subside anytime soon</strong></a>, innovative measures such as these are needed now more than ever to mitigate the drastic implications of climate change.</p><p>AirSeed is not alone in developing drone-based planting systems to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/01/25/biodiversity-loss-is-as-big-of-a-threat-as-climate-change-but-90-of-brits-don-t-see-it"><strong>combat biodiversity loss</strong></a>.</p><p>Two other start-ups - Dendra and Biocarbon Engineering - are also aiming to help fight deforestation with seed-dropping technology.</p><p><strong>Watch the video above to see the drones in action.</strong></p></div></div>
