								<p>Some driving situations cause more stress than others. Freeway merges. Parallel parking. Or the <strong>dreaded left turn</strong>. In busy cities like SF, left turns can be a real challenge. They can also be really dangerous—especially for people crossing the street as cars are turning. </p>

								<p>Don’t “shoot the gap”.</p>
								<p>Some drivers try to beat the light or oncoming traffic and make their left turns too fast—then don’t have time to see or stop for someone in the second crosswalk. <em>Don’t take a turn for the worst:</em> <strong>Start a left turn only when you have plenty of time to complete it safely</strong> without risking oncoming traffic, including bicyclists. </p>

									<p>Left turn calming projects</p>
									<p>At SFMTA, we’re working hard to help drivers make left turns the right way. We’ve installed Left Turn Guide Bumps at designated intersections around the City, with painted safety zones and raised bumps to remind drivers to slow down and make squarer left turns. We’ll test how well these treatments make left turns safer, with a long-term goal of installing calming project at other intersections where they are needed most. </p>

No matter where you drive, it’s important that you stay aware, slow down, and make your left turn the right way.</p>
									<p>When we all do our part, we make the street safer for everyone and create opportunities for people to turn off their cars and turn toward new ways of getting around.</p>
									<p>It’s like they say—one good turn deserves another! </p>
									<p>Safety—It&#39;s your turn.</p>
