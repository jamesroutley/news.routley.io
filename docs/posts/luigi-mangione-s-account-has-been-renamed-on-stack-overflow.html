    <h1>Luigi Mangione&#39;s account has been renamed on Stack Overflow</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange" rel="">Stack Exchange</a><span> is a large online crowd sourced content provider for questions and answers. The Stack Exchange network of sites includes everything from </span><a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com" rel="">cooking</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/" rel="">politics</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Judaism</a><span> and </span><a href="https://islam.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Islam</a><span>.  In 2021, it was sold to a private equity company </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosus" rel="">Prosus</a><span> for 1.8 billion USD. Its largest asset is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow" rel="">Stack Overflow</a><span>, a site tailored to programmers. The Stack Overflow site is a vital resource for software developers. Ideally, it makes it easy and free to ask questions and get professional assistance.</span></p><p><span>On Stack Exchange, all of the contributions on the site are contributed under a license maintained by a third party called </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="">Creative Commons</a><span>; Creative Commons provides a license which states that licensed content must be perpetually shareable for any purpose including modification and by anyone including for-profit ventures, so long as the work remains properly attributed. This incentivizes content creation because every contributor is working on a corpus of work which is free from royalties and modification restrictions: everyone is bettering and growing the commons by using the site. The only “payment” we get out for our work is recognition: the right granted under the Attribution Clause. The Stack Exchange network is further “gameified” with rankings and reputation (a quantifiable standing) to encourage active membership and community while keeping things fun. Work hard, have a larger contribution to the commons and be recognized as such.</span></p><p><span>Alas, this minimal obligation of attribution is too much for some companies which have sought to erode this right. Right now, on Stack Overflow, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">Luigi Magione’s account has been renamed</a><span>. Despite having fruitfully contributed to the network he is stripped of his name and his account is now known as “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">user4616250</a><span>”. As reported by one of the </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">moderators, Zoe, on Stack Overflow.</a></p><blockquote><p><span>I can confirm SE, Inc. were the ones to clear his name. A reason was not specified anywhere obvious. Mods have been given explicit instructions not to touch that profile. While this particular incident may be limited to SO, the implications of this affect the entire network – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">Zoe - Save the data dump</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Though I’m not a lawyer, even with a guilty verdict I don’t believe Stack Exchange is freed from their contractual obligation of attribution under the Creative Commons license. However, in the spirit of the site I put the </span><a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/106594/218" rel="">preliminary legal question about the Creative Commons license to the experts on law.stackexchange.com</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In order to get more information about the justification and reasoning for the unattribution, </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208/157251" rel="">I asked a question on the “meta” site that helps run the network called meta.stackexchange</a><span>. I have not received an official answer from the company.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405208/removing-attribution-because-someone-was-charged-but-not-convicted-with-a-crime#comment1350698_405208" rel="">As pointed out in a comment</a><span>, this kind of treatment is specific to Mangione,</span></p><blockquote><p><span>This situation has a very direct precedent: </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">&#34;Frosty&#34; (Ross Ulbricht) is still attributed under his chosen pseudonym and gets to keep the 500 not-very-organic upvotes on the question he asked </a><em><strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">in furtherance of the crime</a></strong></em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel=""> for which he was sentenced to life in prison and fined hundreds of millions of dollars</a><span>. – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/134300/jeremy" rel="">Jeremy</a></p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht" rel="">Ross Ulbricht</a><span> case is even more egregious because he was convicted and his old pseudonym remains with his attribution as Ulbricht desired.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/405210/157251" rel="">One user hypothesizes Stack Exchange is invoking a second seldom-mentioned license that contributors grant</a><span>, many probably unknowingly. In this explanation you grant two licenses to Stack Exchange, one under the CC BY-SA, and one under an unnamed explicit license provided by the terms of use. However, even the suggestion of this “dual-license” theory being used in this case invoked tremendous push-back from users, and it was eventually subsequently deleted and hidden,</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png" width="1097" height="400" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:400,&#34;width&#34;:1097,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:71460,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This license mentioned is provided by the </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public#licensing" rel="">Terms of Service</a><span> which currently reads,</span></p><blockquote><p>you grant Stack Overflow the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, export, display and to commercially exploit such Subscriber Content, even if such Subscriber Content has been contributed and subsequently removed by you as reasonably necessary to, for example (without limitation):</p><ul><li><p>Provide, maintain, and update the public Network</p></li><li><p>Process lawful requests from law enforcement agencies and government agencies</p></li><li><p>Prevent and address security incidents and data security features, support features, and to provide technical assistance as it may be required</p></li><li><p>Aggregate data to provide product optimization</p></li></ul><p>This means that you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish, distribute, store and use such content and to allow others to have derivative rights to publish, distribute, store and use such content.</p></blockquote><p><span>It would seem this would allow them to do whatever they want, and to relicense the content under any name under the CC BY-SA.

Had you not posted that question and we became aware of the voting fraud situation, which we, eventually, would have, the response and suspension would have been the same.</span></p></blockquote><p>That reads to me like “yes, it was retribution.” My response to this was simple,</p><blockquote><p><span>Had I have not posted that question, you may have never been made aware of my transgressions though. You discovered this after an investigation which was prompted by my question.

I did find all the contributions from the profile page, and I did reward all the bounties to a specific user who I felt was trying to be productive (and oblivious to any celebrity he currently has). But this is hardly a &#34;pattern.&#34; When you say &#34;pattern&#34; you&#39;re referring to this single case (granted over days) with this single user, that culminated in the removal of bounties and upvotes which I just found out about when you told me.</span></p><p><span>My side of the story is easy: I saw an alleged killer that I believe is wrongly framed who has a good head on his shoulders get swept up by the justice system. I went online and viewed his contributions and thought they were warranting of incentive. I wanted to incentivize him to become a productive member of society, and of our network. Let&#39;s correct that if it&#39;s against policy: keep the bounties removed and the upvotes removed, but a prior offense shouldn&#39;t sit as a Trump card for punishment now. I started a respectful conversation because I believe Luigi Mangione should </span><em>NOT</em><span> be treated as a criminal prior to a conviction.
