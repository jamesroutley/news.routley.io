Today we are sharing the thesis, people, and partners behind it.</p></header><section><div><h2>Our thesis</h2>
<p><strong>Technology shifts happen gradually, then suddenly.</strong> We are in the suddenly part. New
technologies like LLMs, generative AI, self-driving cars, drones, AR/VR, and robots are
reshaping the world. But they are not the technology shift. They are the new
applications enabled by it. The real shift is from CPU to GPU.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of CPUs and GPUs has inverted.</strong> To compete, CPUs are adding GPU
features while GPUs are adding CPU features. CPUs and GPUs are <em>converging</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Software has not kept pace.</strong> CPU software is advanced, standardized, and familiar. GPU
software is primitive, bespoke, and weird. Most programmers still focus on the CPU.</p>
<p><strong>We believe we are at the start of a new software industry.</strong> We intend to lead it.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>GPU-native software</h2>
<p>There are two broad classes of applications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GPU applications</strong> such as AI, computer vision, machine learning, scientific
simulations, and graphics. These require GPUs and are driving most demand,
investment, and improvements in compute hardware today.</li>
<li><strong>CPU applications</strong>, which includes nearly everything else.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look at existing GPU applications, their software implementations aren&#39;t truly
GPU-native.<!-- --> Instead, they are architected
as traditional CPU software with a GPU add-on. For example,
<a href="https://pytorch.org/"><code>pytorch</code></a> uses the CPU by default and GPU acceleration is
opt-in. Even after opting in, the CPU is in control and orchestrates work on the GPU.
Furthermore, if you look at the software kernels that run on the GPU they are simplistic
with low cyclomatic complexity.<!-- --> This
is not unique to <code>pytorch</code>. Most software is CPU-only, a small subset is GPU-aware, an
even smaller subset is GPU-only, and no software is GPU-native.</p>
<p>We are building software that is GPU-native. We intend to put the GPU in control. This
does not happen today<!-- --> due to the difficulty of
programming GPUs, the immaturity of GPU software and abstractions, and the relatively
few developers targeting GPUs.</p>
<p>With the advent of GPU databases, we are just starting to see CPU-based applications
migrate to GPUs. As CPUs and GPUs converge, we believe that <em>all</em> software will begin to
leverage GPUs to varying degrees. This is a huge opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>At VectorWare we are excited to focus on both improving GPU applications and migrating
CPU applications to the GPU.</strong> We are building supporting tools and a new low-level
software stack to make GPU-native software a reality.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Our company is comprised of Rust compiler team members, open source maintainers of
<a href="https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu"><code>rust-gpu</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-cuda"><code>rust-cuda</code></a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr"><code>rustc_codegen_clr</code></a>, as well as
graphics experts from the gaming industry. In the past we&#39;ve worked on everything from
operating systems at Apple, browsers at Mozilla, web and mobile apps at Facebook, and
graphics technology at Embark Studios and Frozenbyte. We&#39;ve led developer tools and
infrastructure teams and even built our <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/06/23/developer-tools/building-nuclide-a-unified-developer-experience/">own
IDE</a>
long before similar tools became billion-dollar AI companies. You can read more about us
on our <a href="https://vectorware.com/team">team page</a>.</p>
<p>We had overwhelming interest from investors and a heavily oversubscribed seed round.
Ultimately, we chose to raise a smaller amount from people we know well and have worked
with at previous companies. We met Dan Portillo, co-founder of <a href="https://www.thegp.com/">The General
Partnership</a>, while working at Mozilla and are thrilled to have
him as our lead investor. Our angel investors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lilly_(computer_scientist)">John Lilly</a>, an
experienced investor, operator, and leader. We worked with him at Mozilla where he was
the CEO.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavanagh-patrick/">Patrick Kavanagh</a>, one of the first
angel investors in Robinhood and an early investor in hot AI startups such as
<a href="https://www.manus.im">Manus</a> and <a href="https://www.plaud.ai">Plaud</a>. We worked with him at
Robinhood where he was the head of international and crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candito/">Nick Candito</a>, a career entrepreneur who has
seen three early-stage ventures scale to nearly $900M in acquisition value and has
been part of over 300 private investments ($75M allocated, ~20 unicorns, 15+ exits, 10
funds). We met him when he was founding Progressly (<a href="https://blog.box.com/progressly-box-digital-workplace">later acquired by
Box</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These folks are experienced investors as well as founders and operators who understand
the challenges of building. We&#39;re grateful they chose to invest their time and money in
us.</p>
