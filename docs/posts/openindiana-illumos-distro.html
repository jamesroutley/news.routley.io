        <p>Thus another NeurIPS has ended. This is the third one for me, and
        for every one I&#39;ve attended I feel it has increased in size. I reflect
        on my experience this time around. Some context: I have just finished
        my PhD and I&#39;m on the job market looking for a job, ideally ML research
        in industry. While the main reason I went is to present my paper, I
        also attended in order to see what the job market is currently like and
        make some connections with companies and researchers in industry and
        academia.</p>
        <p>I presented <a href="#mekrr">our approach</a> (which we call MEKRR,
        &#34;maker&#34;) on how to successfully transfer pretrained GNNs for learning
        to predict energies of atomistic system. This combines GNN feature
        representations with kernel mean embeddings and ridge regression. Do
        have a look at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01589">arxiv
        paper</a> (will update this link with the conference paper once it&#39;s
        been made available in the official NeurIPS proceedings) or the
        <a href="https://github.com/IsakFalk/atomistic_transfer_mekrr">code
        base</a> :)</p>

      <p>I will write more about MEKRR in a separate note and will link it
        here later. The gist of it is that using learned features from GNNs on
        trained an upstream dataset and using KRR on these features, together
        with some kernel tricks for dealing with sets / point clouds, works
        <strong>really</strong> well. Will kernels make a come-back?
        <em>Probably not</em>. Can kernels improve performance on small to
        medium size datasets when given a strong feature map when compared to
        fine-tuning? <em>Probably yes</em>!</p>

      hall and companies</a></h2>
      <div id="text-expo-hall-and-companies">
        <p>The expo hall was bustling. My sense is that the companies can be
        categorized into</p>
        <ol>
          <li>big Tech such as MAMAA (previously known as FAANG) and some older
          tech companies such as IBM,</li>
          <li>trading companies such as Jane Street or DE Shaw,</li>
          <li>lots of smaller companies serving LLMs and other models as a
          service, or speeding up inference using quantization and other
          postprocessing techniques,</li>
          <li>the rest which includes peripheral companies using ML (Sony,
          Disney), biology / drugs / medicine and publishing houses.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In general it was a pretty good place to get in touch with
        companies. I made some really good genuine contacts which I will
        cherish whether it&#39;ll lead to job or not. I disliked talking to
        recruiters which in the end just forward me to the general recruitment
        page of their companies, feels like a waste of time on both their and
        my part.</p>

        differently</a></h3>
        <div id="text-what-i-would-have-done-differently">
          <ul>
            <li>Go through all booths on the expo day instead of spacing it out
            over the week</li>
            <li>Get over fear of talking and engage with people instead of
            circling around wasting time
              <ul>
                <li>Tip: Use the booths which you are not really interested in
                or have low engagement to warm up. It&#39;s fun to see what people
                are up to and they probably enjoy people actually talking to
                them.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>I spent a couple of hours each day going through the hall in a
          systematic manner (my wife remarked that I had so much good swag,
          mostly really high-quality socks, which can be explained simply by
          going through <strong>almost every</strong> boothâ€¦). I think this is
          worthwhile but drains your energy and takes up a lot of time. Looking
          back I wish I just had done this during the Sunday when I arrived so
          that I could have focused on the posters and talks on the other day.
          This time I didn&#39;t spend much time at all on the research part of the
          conference which I slightly regret. But I met with the companies and
          engaged in some way or another with about 80% of the booths which I
          count as a success.</p>
          <p>Another part is getting over yourself and just talk to people. At
          the start of the conference I was quite shy and wondering why people
          would want to engage with me, but honestly, the whole reason for
          these companies to be present at NeurIPS is to talk to the attendants
          (even if the chat does not actually lead anywhere) at least out of
          courtesy. I should work on overcome this fear and just throw myself
          out there. Talking to low-stakes companies first help to get over
          this barrier I felt.</p>

      <h2 id="meetings-and-parties"><a href="#meetings-and-parties">Meetings
      and parties</a></h2>
      <div id="text-meetings-and-parties">
        <p>I went to a couple of parties which was great. Good time to
        reconnect with people I haven&#39;t seen in a while and connect with new
        people. One party was thrown by one of the UK initiatives for AI Safety
        and it was interesting chatting about the state of things. Seemed like
        the onus was on first making people aware of the problem and in what
        ways it can be approached and potentially solved, working similarly to
        a think-tank. After this party ended we went to the Cohere party which
        was thrown in this amazing multi-layered building, really cool party,
        would go again.</p>
        <p>While the above party was more general and open, I also went to an
        open bar hosted by Imbue. This was super cozy and intimate. I made some
        great contacts there and spoke to many of the people in the team. The
        party was hosted outside of the usual district which probably made it
        so less people attended, but on the other hand, the people there really
        were there for a reason. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, one of the
        highlights of the conference for me.</p>

      <p>LLMs where everywhere. I don&#39;t think this should have come as a
        surprise to anyone. In one sense I feel like ChatGPT and it&#39;s kind has
        been the first to actually deliver on the promise of AI to the consumer
        (at least during my lifetime, would be interested to here contrasting
        viewpoints) so it&#39;s only natural that research will tail this
        development as we have a pretty poor understanding on what actually
        goes on inside of these models. On the other hand there&#39;s the question
        of what the role of academia and publishing should be, to always cater
        to industry or to do high-risk research which enables the Next Big
        Thing (TM)? Pretty hard to do this kind of research when a lot of it
        comes down to compute.</p>

        <h3 id="mekrr-poster"><a href="#mekrr-poster">MEKRR Poster</a></h3>
        <p>Presenting my poster was a blast. We had a lot of activity and I
          had great feedback. Someone even came and wanted a selfie with me and
          the poster! This is the highest flattery I&#39;ve ever received in my
          academic career by far. There were some senior researchers that found
          this work interesting and really engaged with me. This cemented my
          confidence in this line of work and I hope that others will continue
          investigating how kernels can fit into a neural network world.</p>
