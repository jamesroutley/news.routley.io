    <h1>iPhones will soon be able to stream live video on 911 calls</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>First responder networks are lining up to support a major new emergency feature in iOS 18: Live Video support. Now, 911 support platforms, including <a href="https://rapidsos.com/rapidsos-will-be-integrated-with-apple-emergency-sos-live-video/">RapidSOS Unite</a> and <a href="https://www.prepared911.com/content/sos-live-video-apple-iphone-available-with-prepared">Prepared</a>, are integrating with Apple’s Emergency SOS Live Video, which was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/ios-18-makes-iphone-more-personal-capable-and-intelligent-than-ever/">announced at WWDC in June</a>.</p><p>The new feature lets you video chat with 911 dispatchers and emergency responders, aiding them in finding you fast when you need help. Apple’s Emergency SOS could already relay a voice call and send texts to responders, as well as share your location.</p><p>This is all part of Apple’s bigger push to add safety features in recent years, including Crash Detection, which was introduced on the iPhone 14 and newer and later added to the Apple Watch Series 8, Ultra, and the second generation SE. iPhone 14 and 15 users also get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451069/apple-iphone-14-satellite-sos-globalstar-ios-16-update-release-date">Emergency SOS via satellite</a>, which can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23457970/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-ios-16">send texts and your location</a> to emergency responders, even if you have no cell signal.</p><p>Other Emergency SOS features include Fall Detection, which started with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price">Apple Watch Series 4</a>, and the ability to make an emergency call by holding buttons.</p></div></div></div>
