      <h2>Monica empowers people who want to be better</h2>
      <p>Monica is for people who have jobs, a family, and are busy trying to find a good work/life balance. So busy, that they don’t have time anymore to remember to call a friend, say happy birthday to a nephew, or remember to invite someone special for dinner next week. The older we get, the more life gets in the way. It’s sad, but it’s the reality.</p>
      <p>I created Monica to help these people.</p>
      <p>Monica is not a social network. It will never be. It&#39;s a private place for your eyes only, that you own, without any ads or malicious software that will read your data, where you can safely document what you know about who you love. And if you want another level of security, you can always <a href="https://github.com/monicahq/monica#get-started">install Monica</a> on a server that you own, for free.</p>
    </div><div>
      <h3>Built for people. With people.</h3>
      <p>Monica is open source. That means the code is <a href="https://github.com/monicahq/monica">publicly available</a>, scrutinized by thousands. Dozens of people have already contributed to the project. That level of transparency ensures both the security of the application, and your peace of mind concerning what we do with your data (nothing, in fact).</p>
