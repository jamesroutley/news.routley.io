    <h1>Microsoft is now injecting full-size ads on Chrome website</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                                                        <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/02/1677007010_edge_facepalm.jpg"><img alt="Captain Picard making facepalming next to a Microsoft Edge logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/02/1677007010_edge_facepalm_story.jpg"/></a></figure><p>Being the default out-of-the-box browser on Windows 10 and 11 makes Microsoft Edge a go-to utility for downloading Chrome or another browser. That upsets Microsoft so much that it constantly comes with more aggressive and user-hostile methods to make customers stay on Edge. An attempt to install Chrome using Edge Canary now results in the browser displaying <em>two</em> ads: the first (tiny one) will pop on the screen when the Chrome website loads, and the second, a humongous full-size banner, will appear once the download starts. <em>Yikes!</em></p>

The banner states that Edge uses the same technology as Chrome with the &#34;added trust of Microsoft.&#34; The &#34;trust&#34; that <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/new-video-shows-how-much-more-data-windows-11-sends-compared-to-older-versions/">your computer will connect to ad providers the moment you turn it on for the first time</a>. The &#34;trust&#34; that Edge will shove more &#34;recommended content&#34; down your throat and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/edge-is-about-to-get-way-more-aggressive-with-recommended-content-and-annoying-uis/">enforce Bing without you even making a click</a>. The &#34;trust&#34; that you cannot remove Edge from your computer and many more.</p>

            <p>To be fair, Microsoft is not the only one practicing questionable things to increase the user base. Google also shows banners to promote Chrome, but they appear only on the company&#39;s websites. Google is not injecting ads on the Firefox website, nor does it cry foul whenever you want to download another browser.</p>

<figcaption>Google is using much less annoying banners to promote its browser. More importantly, only on its own websites!</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting is that I could not get the banner in the latest stable Edge release, so the abomination might be a thing Microsoft tries on a limited set of Edge insiders or only in specific regions. Whatever happens in Microsoft&#39;s software labs, there are no signs of the company making its browser (a great browser so far) less irritating, which is just sad.</p>
