        Like many of you, I was raised in the background radiation of Calvinist thought.
        I expected little but redemptive hard labor, before presumably one day dying in a mine.
        I also read Hackers &amp; Painters at an impressionable age and was kind of a jerk
        about it for a while. This talk is about how despite this, I got better.
      </p><p>
        The real urtext of my tradition was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4">two
        people standing on stage</a> explaining how although they have different jobs, they
        are friends, and try to help each other. It was mindblowing at the time and led to many
        subsequent revelations, and ultimately a blissful state of psychic death.
        It turns out misery is a shitty proxy metric.

              They’d managed to avoid serializing absolutely everything, in that they’d divided into feature teams. And they had shared services teams like ops, and DBA’s, and so on. That seemed reasonable at first, or at least not different than most places.</td>
