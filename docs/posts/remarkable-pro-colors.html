<h2 id="previewing-rm-pro-colors-somewhat-more-accurately-on-screen">Previewing <span>RM</span> Pro colors somewhat more accurately on screen</h2>

<p>I was happy with the <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2">Remarkable 2</a> and when the <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro">Remarkable Pro</a> came
out I decided to go with a second one in order to be able to <em>see two
pages at once</em>: one as a reference for reading and one for writing, as
one would normally do with paper. Expensive approach, I know.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the Pro comes with “color”. Very… <em>very</em> bland
color. It’s a welcome addition nonetheless. Despite all the limitations,
I came to appreciate the Pro for doodling way more than I expected. But
when one exports the drawings for <span>PC</span> viewing, the files don’t match the
colors as used on the tablet. This often breaks the original drawing
intent, and got me annoyed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/rnd/20260201-remarkable_pro_colors/images/large/laptop-rmpro.jpg">

</a></p><p>I also realized at some point that I could display regular photos on it
as a digital frame, despite not being something for which the Remarkable
was intended for. Yet, the faded colors, limited palette along with the
dithering <em>really</em> grew on me. The effect evokes more the feel of a fond
memory to think about instead of just being another pretty picture to
look at.</p>
<p>You can see how the image on the right looks when shown on a laptop
screen compared to the Remarkable. If you click for a larger version,
the dithering is pretty apparent.</p>
<p>I started to want a simple way to preview or display the color output of
the tablet more accurately on screen, so that I could either export the
doodles as I drew them or to adjust the images on a <span>PC</span> for better
display on the tablet.</p>
<p>I made a basic <a href="#palette">palette</a> of the real pen colors and a rough <a href="#color-profile">color
profile</a> that you can use with image editing software that support
color proofing, such as <span>GIMP</span>. None of this is meant to be truly
accurate, and something I tried for fun to be “better than nothing”.</p>
<div id="basic-color-extraction-approach">

<p>The method I used isn’t very sophisticated, and definitely not the best:
I took a few pictures with a <span>DSLR</span> camera of the tablet alongside a white
reference card under medium, indirect sunlight in order to avoid glare.
A full color card would have been nicer, but I didn’t have any at hand.</p>
<p>The backlight on the Remarkable Pro was kept at the medium setting to be
a little bit more balanced as I use it frequently indoors.</p>
<p>I then compared the pictures on a calibrated <span>LCD</span> screen with the actual
tablet as a quick visual check.</p>
</div>
<div id="more-realistic-pen-colors">

<p>These are the main pen colors you can use on the Remarkable Pro. As you
can see, “white” is downright gray and it is sadly not an artifact. It
is significantly darker than the Remarkable 2, and also why I feel some
amount of backlight is always required. But in turn, the backlight also
shifts the black very slightly towards blue. This is intentionally made
very obvious here through the background pairing. On the actual tablet
you mostly don’t notice if you have some ambient lighting.</p>

<div id="color-profile">

<p>Since there are a discrete amount of colors on the tablet, a correct
approach for color simulation would be to use the same conversion logic
the Remarkable uses: probably auto-contrast followed by quantized dither
with a fixed color palette. However this wouldn’t have been too
convenient to use without also writing a viewer or plugin.</p>
<p>My aim was to have something usable enough to perform hue/contrast
adjustment on an image with <em>instant</em> feedback. For example, to avoid
detail in the important part of an image to be crushed by the limited
palette, or to shift the hue enough to move it to a more pleasant
dithered color rendition.</p>
<p>I thought of using <a href="https://www.argyllcms.com/">argyll</a> to build a color profile indirectly through a
test chart as <a href="https://www.argyllcms.com/doc/Scenarios.html#PP1">described here</a>. I’m honestly
surprised it worked as well as it did. The result is in <a href="#downloadable-files">downloadable
files</a>. The profile can be easily be used for soft-proofing and it
gives best results in “perceptual” mode.</p>
<p>In <span>GIMP</span> you can go to “Image -&gt; Color Management -&gt; Soft-proof profile
…” to load it first, then set the rendering intent to “perceptual” and
finally also enable “View -&gt; Color Management -&gt; Proof colors”.</p>
<p>The results are not too far off. You can compare the original image with
the same image with soft-proof, and again the same image with soft-proof
<em>and</em> dithering which makes it very close to what you’d see as the final result.</p>

</div>
<p>There’s an unintended shift of blues towards violet in the result, but
it didn’t bother me enough to attempt to repeat the process or tweak the
profile. I repeat, due to how the image is processed on the tablet,
using a color profile for simulation is really not the best idea.</p>

<p>These are a few extra images for comparison with the soft-proofs and the
actual result. They are aligned so you can flip through back <span>&amp;</span> forth
when zoomed.</p>
<p>The last image is repeated twice to show the intended behavior I was
aiming for: adjusting the image for improved presentation. The grass
looks basically brown in the first version, whereas the second is more
green (for the Remarkable Pro’s impression of green anyway). The medium
field is also less crushed, showing overall more detail.</p>

</div>

<div id="remarkable-pro-impressions">

<p>Still here? Oh.. dang. Well, I’ll share some impressions I have with the
Pro then. I paid the full hefty price, and I’ve been using both the
Remarkable 2 since late 2021 and the Pro since 2024 so I have some
<em>entitled</em> rants to go through.</p>
<p>My main complaint on the tablet is with the pen precision: we’re still
far off to something which I would consider a pleasant alternative to a
real pen. Since I did drafting, I can retrace an existing line with a
mechanical pencil down to 0.1mm if needed, easily. On the Remarkable Pro
instead, even attempting to nicely continue a stroke in my (poor)
handwriting feels like a crapshoot. Somehow this seems <em>worse</em> on the
Pro compared to the 2. This matches my experience with basically any pen
digitizer I ever tried so far and I’m sad that we didn’t get any
significant improvements in so many years. I also have a fairly light
touch normally, and the pressure curve on either the Remarkable 2 or Pro
requires me to press too much for comfort to get any “width” in any of
the tools. This is normally adjustable via software on most painting
programs, but not on the Remarkable. On the positive, on both versions
the pen shapes are great: they’re just <strong>pens</strong>. The eraser is also
precise and works as you’d expect. By comparison I cannot stand the
default thick form factor of all Wacom Bamboo/Intuos digitizers.</p>
<p>The second biggest complaint would be the tablet being too dark. The
Remarkable 2 “white” is still far from regular white paper. But the
<em>Pro</em> is downright gray. While you can still use the 2 in dim or office
light conditions without issues, the Pro requires to use some backlight
almost at all times. The backlight itself is also blueish with notable
bleed around the corners, which is the worst color shift I would have
wanted to see indoors or for night reading. Aiming for a cool or warm
white in the 3000-4000K territory would have been a better choice.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about color or night reading, the Remarkable 2
grayscale rendering is also superior. When reading a <span>PDF</span>, this has an
effect on text rendering quality, especially visible on thin typefaces.</p>
<p>The display coating on both tablet versions is very good, but I’m still
sometimes annoyed by glare with overhead lighting. Glare I wouldn’t have
with a piece of paper.</p>
<p>I’m happy with the improvement in display responsiveness on the Pro. It
really makes a difference when browsing through pages. For this reason I
often find myself using the Pro as the “reference” tablet, and the 2 for writing.</p>
<p>Going towards the software side, on my idea of using both tablets
together, I’m kind of disappointed that the notebook sync is not
happening per-page but only when closing the notebook. As a result I
cannot view my last written page on one as I edit the next: I need to go
back by switching page on the same device, which is still too slow
compared to a real notebook page flip and something I never truly got
used to.</p>
<p>Over the years the writing interface has been kept minimalist and
<em>slowly</em> improved. I’m very happy with this. Less is more.</p>
<p>What I really find lacking is the management interface in general. With
virtual sheets I’d like to do what I <em>cannot</em> do with a true notebook:
move everything around at will. I want to be able to quickly create a
note <em>wherever</em> and then move it into the appropriate place later. Yet,
right now, when you’re in the “grid view” of notebook, instead of being
able to just drag something, I have to hold-to-select (which takes a
good full second), then “Move”, then select a destination and <em>then</em>
select “before or after”. This is ridiculous. It gets worse if you want
to move a page from one notebook to another. Again: select the page,
select move, then notice the “More …” menu on the top-left which
contains a <strong>single</strong> action inside: “Move out”. <em>Daaaamn</em>, top notch user
interface design right there. What about removing the “…” and just
showing “Move out”? Or, god forbid, remove the useless step and add
“Move out” <em>directly</em> besides “Move”? It’s not like we’re lacking space
in the empty toolbar. This happens on the current 3.24 version of the software.</p>
<p>The mobile app is similarly clunky. No way to rearrange pages by
dragging either. But <em>at least</em> they had the courtesy of showing the
“Move out” action directly without the extra “More …” menu. I barely
use the app anyway: on a phone the screen space is too cramped to do
anything, and certainly if I have to drag a tablet around I’d carry the
Remarkable directly, not an android one… right? This mobile app could
have been skipped entirely for a better web interface instead.</p>
<p>The “my files” page through web doesn’t allow to do much besides
organizing notebooks. No page previews. The only reason I use it for is
to import PDFs because the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a> browser extension only
works on Chrome, and works poorly at that too.</p>
<p>This finally brings me to the desktop app, for which I have no clue
because I’m on linux and so… no app. I was pretty attracted by the
available <span>OSS</span>/linux ecosystem when I purchased the Remarkable 2 in late
2021, and it was one of <em>the</em> main driving reasons I decided to get it.
<a href="https://github.com/bordaigorl/remy/">Remy</a> was great and did everything I wanted it to. Sadly, with each
software upgrade, almost all these great <span>OSS</span> interfaces got broken. I’m
lucky I’m still owning a Remarkable 2 where <a href="https://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview/">rmview</a> works because I’m
heavily using it for screen-sharing.</p>
<p>Unlocking the “Developer mode” nowadays also shows dumb scary warnings
about reduced security too, while at the same time uploading all your
documents on the cloud without end-to-end encryption.</p>
