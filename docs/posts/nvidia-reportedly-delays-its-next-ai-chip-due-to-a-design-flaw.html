    <h1>Nvidia reportedly delays its next AI chip due to a design flaw</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nvidia has reportedly told Microsoft and at least one other cloud provider that its “Blackwell” B200 AI chips will take at least three months longer to produce than was planned, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidias-new-ai-chip-is-delayed-impacting-microsoft-google-meta?rc=v4bmzs">according to <em>The Information</em></a><em>. </em>The delay is the result of a design flaw discovered “unusually late in the production process,” according to two unnamed sources, including a Microsoft employee, cited by the outlet<em>. </em></p><p>B200 chips are the follow-up to the supremely popular and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828874/inside-the-hunt-for-ai-chips-command-line">hard-to-get H100 chips</a> that power vast swaths of the artificial intelligence cloud landscape (and helped make Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181209/nvidia-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-at-the-moment">one of the most valuable companies in the world</a>). Nvidia expects production of the chip “to ramp in 2H,” according to a statement that Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo shared with <em>The Verge</em>. “Beyond that, we don’t comment on rumors.” </p><p>Nvidia is now reportedly working through a fresh set of test runs with chip producer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and won’t ship large numbers of Blackwell chips until the first quarter. <em>The Information</em> writes that Microsoft, Google, and Meta, have ordered “tens of billions of dollars” worth of the chips.</p><p>The report comes just months after <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing">Nvidia said</a> that “Blackwell-based products will be available from partners” starting in 2024. The new chips are supposed to kick off a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162860/nvidia-ai-chip-every-year-blackwell-rubin">yearly cadence of AI chips</a> from the company as several other tech firms, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue">such as AMD</a>, work to spin up their own AI chip competitors.</p></div></div></div>
