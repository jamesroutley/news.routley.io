        trays.  Unlike some of the strange things you might find growing in your
        refrigerator, ice spikes are made of nothing but ice.  Ice spikes are the result of
        physics, not biology.</SPAN></td>

        an ice cube tray turns to ice.  The water first freezes on the top surface, around
        the edges of what will become the ice cube.  The ice slowly freezes in from the
        edges, until just a small hole is left unfrozen in the surface.  At the same time,
        while the surface is freezing, more ice starts to form around the sides of the cube.<br/>
        </SPAN><a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespike.jpg"><img src="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikex.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt="icespikex.jpg (7709 bytes)"/></a><SPAN face="Arial">  
        Since ice expands as it freezes, the ice freezing below the surface starts to push water
        up through the hole in the surface ice (see diagram).  If the conditions are just
        right, then water will be forced out of the hole in the ice and it will freeze into an ice
        spike, a bit like lava pouring out of a hole in the ground to makes a volcano.  But
        water does not flow down the sides of a thin spike, so in that way it is different from a
        volcano.  Rather, the water freezes around the rim of the tube, and thus adds to its
        length.  The spike can continue growing taller until all the water freezes, cutting
        off the supply, or until the tube freezes shut.  The tallest spike we&#39;ve seen growing
        in an ordinary ice cube tray was 56mm (2.2in) long.</SPAN></td>

        distilled water is used.  Millions of people make ice cubes every day using ordinary
        tap water, and most don&#39;t see ice spikes.  Oddly enough, some people often get plenty
        of ice spikes using ordinary tap water, but this appears to be rare.</SPAN></td>

        when growing ice spikes, and we have done experiments that show that spikes are more
        likely to form when the temperature is just below freezing (see the graphs below). 
        I&#39;m not entirely sure why this is so, but I suspect that the ice tube freezes shut before
        the tube gets very long if the temperature is too low.  So, if your ice cream is
        really hard, your freezer is too cold to make lots of ice spikes.</SPAN></p>
