<p>Visibility of the directory and immediate visual feedback present some of <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Admin/admin_horror_stories.shtml">sysadmins 
blunders</a> and corresponding horror stories. As such <em>mc is highly recommended tool for system administrators. </em></p>

<p>Some novices complain that mc is just too idiosyncratic for them. Here is a pretty typical lament that the user
<a target="_blank" href="http://slashdot.org/~jhfry">jhfry</a> wrote in his response to Slashdot story
<a target="_blank" href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/01/26/1917254/Midnight-Commander-Development-Revived">Midnight Commander

   <blockquote>
      Anyone else regret not getting attached to tools like MC years ago?<p><SPAN color="#FF0000"><i><b>There are a few tools that pop 
      up whenever people discuss the easiest or best way to do a task... and I always wish I had made the investment of time to get 
      proficient with those tools. However it almost seems too late.</b></i></SPAN></p>

      <p>For example, vi and emacs... I am sure they are great, but <em>the investment of time to get proficient makes it hard to justify 
      even trying</em>. So on my headless linux boxen I use nano, I can do everything I need to do without a cheatsheet.</p>

      <p>MC is the same way... I have tinkered with it, but I always found myself exiting to the command line because I would find something 
      I didn&#39;t know how to do and didn&#39;t want to take the time to figure it out.</p>

      <p><SPAN color="#FF0000"><i><b>Does anyone have any tips on how to best add these types of tools to your tool set when you&#39;ve 
      mastered an alternative. Simply saying to use it doesn&#39;t take into consideration productivity.</b></i></SPAN></p>

      <p>Are these tools worth investing personal time into, say instead of studying for a certification or something. Are the gains 
      really that significant?</p>
   </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no royal way to mastering of mc. But, truth be told, MC allow &#34;exiting to command line&#34; <em>by just pressing</em> <tt>Ctrl-O</tt>.Â  
Then you can &#34;return&#34; to mc dual panel screen by pressing Ctrl-O another time. That means that you can gradually learn the ropes and
<em>at the beginning to use mcÂ  just as a tool to see the currently directory with one click</em>. The guy in the post reproduced 
above also failed to understand the simplest thing: that <em>the bar below contains the main commands (so called F-commands which can 
be invoked by functional keys F1-F10) and this bar items are clickable by mouse</em>. That probably represents level-zero of usage of 
mc. </p>

<p>It would be better if MC exported its macros to environmental variables in the shell so that you can operate with the current file, 
directory in the passive panel and the current file in the passive panel via macros like in mc command line: </p>
<ol>

   <li><tt>%f</tt> -- The current file name. <tt>%F</tt> -- The current file in the passive panel.</li>

   <li><tt>%d</tt> -- The current directory name. <tt>%D</tt> -- The directory name of the passive panel.</li>

   <li><tt>%t -- </tt>The currently tagged files. <tt>%T</tt> -- The tagged files in the passive panel.</li>
</ol>

<p>But this export can be emulated &#34;seamlessly&#34; if you program macro inÂ  programmable keyboard or keypad.<em> </em>For example,
<a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Hardware/Peripherals/Keyboards/logitech_g110_gaming_keyboard.shtml">Logitech G110 gaming keyboard</a> or, better,
<a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Hardware/Peripherals/Keyboards/logitech_g13.shtml">Logitech G13 Programmable Keypad with LCD Display</a><em> (which can 
be used with any keyboard). </em>You can also create a user menu item that writes the content of those macros your home directory in 
a form of export statements and then &#34;source&#34; this file in your bashrc.</p>

<p>At the same time,Â  <em>you can&#39;t get far in mastering</em> <tt>mc <em></em></tt><em>without investing some time experimenting 
with it and reading documentation.</em>Â  It is a different paradigm of working with shell (see
<a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Articles/introduction_to_orthodox_file_managers.shtml">Orthodox system interface</a> ). But there is some critical mass 
of efforts after which you do start doing operation of &#34;subconscious&#34; level, as a part of your motor skills, and they become a part 
of you &#34;kinetic memory&#34;.Â  You now can execute some typical sequences of keystroke semi-automatically, like a good piano player.Â  
And that&#39;s the goal. </p>

<p>I still remember this &#34;I got it&#34; moment and after that I just could not understand why initial learning was so difficult for me (I 
came to NC from Xtree).Â  In other words you need a critical mass of investment in time and effort that will be handsomely paid 
off.Â  And the the main advantage on investing time and energy is MC is that <em>it probably will be available for the rest of your 
life</em>.Â  </p>

<p>For example, I use <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/index.shtml">OFMs</a> since 1989. That&#39;s almost 30 years and those skills that I acquired in 1989 
with NC 2.0 are still by-and-large valid. This is not the case with most commercial products, which that often are discontinued or changed 
in such a way to make previous skills obsolete for facilitate upgrades. MS Word is one good example here. Few skills acquired with MS 
Word 5.0 for DOS (I typeset a book using MS Word 5.0, so I did make a huge investment is acquiring MS Word skills) are valid now.Â  
And this is not a completely bad application, where the key ideas preserved, albeit in crippled and somewhat perverted form.Â  Although 
in the most recent version (Office 365)Â  MicrosoftÂ  managed to screw up even basic functionality of MS Word. But at least 
a decent versions like MS Word 2007Â  still exists, so effort of learning it still pays.Â  How long nobody knows.Â  And 
that&#39;s the problem. With MC you can be pretty sure enjoy the same interface and functionality in 2050 if you live that long ;-)</p>

<p>With programmer editors the situation might be worse. While it is an essential instrument of programmer and learning programmable 
editor with macro language pays many time, the survival rate of such editors is low, if we are talking about timespan of more then 20 
years. For example both the Kedit and MultiEdit are not abandonware: </p>
<ol>

   <li>An excellent editor DOS and then Windows 3.1 editor <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Edit">MultiEdit</a>. 
   It barely survived.Â  The most recent release is dated from 2008. As of 2011, it was one of the few surviving editors from the 
   DOS era when text editors were regarded as indispensable programming tools.</li>

   <li>An excellent editor for Windows 3.1 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEDIT">Kedit</a>, which is a derivative 
   of IBM Xedit. KEDIT first became available in 1983. It is derivative of Xedit from VM/CMS OS, and it has very good Unix implementation 
   THE editor. </li>
</ol>

<p>There are very few editors that survived from the time of PC revolution when DOS ruled the globe (let&#39;s say from 1986) for 30 years. 
Among them: </p>
<ol>

   <li>VI</li>

   <li>Emacs</li>
</ol>

<p>While <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/mcedit.shtml">mcedit</a>, a built-inÂ  editor is far from the power of, say, Kedit it isÂ  a muchÂ  better 
deal then nano. for example it allow to edit multiple files simultaneously and move &#34;selection&#34; between them with ease. </p>

<p>In a way users, who do not want to invest time and energy into learning <tt>mc</tt> are hopeless. Like old English proverb aptly 
statesÂ  &#34;<i>Nothing venture, nothing have.</i>&#34; (Noght venter noght haue. [1546 J. Heywood Dialogue of Proverbs i. xi. E1]).Â 
<em>That&#39;s the main tip for those who want to master</em> <tt>mc</tt> ;-). </p>

<h3><a name="General">General</a></h3>

<p>You need to take some steps to make MC to exit in the current directory visible on the screen. One way is to use alias such as
</p>

<pre>alias mc=&#39;mc -P &#34;/tmp/mc-$USER/mc.pwd.$$&#34;; cd `cat /tmp/mc-$USER/mc.pwd.$$`; rm /tmp/mc-$USER/*&#39;</pre>

<p><SPAN size="2">The other is to use a supplied with mc more generic script</SPAN></p>

<pre><code>alias mc=&#39;. /usr/libexec/mc/mc-wrapper.sh&#39;</code></pre>

<p>One of the most common problems with <tt>mc</tt> is incorrect display of pseudo-graphical characters, which spoils borders on the 
panels and while this defect does not affect functionality, is very unpleasant aesthetically. See
<a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/midnight_commander_does_not_displays_pseudographic_characters.shtml">Midnight commander does not display pseudo-graphic characters 
properly</a> for more information. You can use option <tt>-a</tt> to use regular characters instead and <em>in most cases this is an 
adequate solution</em>. </p>

<p>Another possible fix that sometimes work is to try using <tt>LANG=C mc</tt> instead of <tt>mc</tt>. </p>
<ul>

   <li><i>Please, a small question - I made the new installation (FC3, KDE) and run MC (the great SW!!). Everything works, except that 
   borders onÂ  the panels are drawn by &#39;a umlaut&#39; instead of pseudo-graphic (lines)</i><ul>

      <li>This is a locale and termcap issue which I do not fully understand. </li>

      <li>

      <pre>LANG=C mc</pre>
      </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>Other common issues and little know features:Â  </p>
<ul>

   <li><b>You can change sizes of each panel making them asymmetrical, which is useful for displaying long names via </b><tt>Options/Layout/Panel_split</tt><b>.Â 
   </b>I find useful 33%/66% split so that light panel is approximately twice larger then the left.Â 
   <ul>

      <li><b>You can also change from vertical split to horizontal one, in which the width of each panel is equal to the width of the 
      terminal screen.Â  that allows to display usner and permissions in wider panel. </b></li>
   </ul>
   </li>

   <li><b><tt>Ctrl-O</tt> opens shell prompt.Â  Another Ctrl-O return panels. </b></li>

   <li><b>Strings that you copied on any of the panels can be pasted to the command line. </b></li>

   <li><b>MC simplified using &#34;safe&#34; editing of files: make a backup, copy it to some directory, edit it, test it and then copy back.
   </b>This is important when working on remote servers when you blunder might means a trip of say 100 miles in the most inopportune 
   moment. See <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Admin/admin_horror_stories.shtml">Sysadmin Horror Stories</a></li>

   <li><b>To copy the name of the current file into the command like </b>instead of <tt>Alt-Enter</tt> (<em>put the current file in 
   the command line</em>) you can use<tt> Esc-Enter</tt> (this is useful for Cygwin as Windows uses <tt>Alt-Enter</tt> for maximizing 
   screen, and this is a useful shortcut to disable)</li>

   <li><b>Recommended fonts for Midnight commander</b><ul>

      <li>For Cygwin you can use <tt>Fixedsys 11</tt></li>

      <li><tt>terminus</tt> is the bestï»¿ font for linux</li>

<h3><a name="Basic_keyboard_usage">Basic keyboard usage</a></h3>

<p>TIP: Often you need to use &#34;learn key functionality to enable some keys on your keyboard (for example Grey + and grey - ). You need 
to save the results of leraning for them to work, so don&#39;t forget to get to save menu and press enter at then end of this exercise.

<h3><a name="Use_of_programmable_keyboard_is_highly_recommended">Use of programmable keyboard is highly recommended</a></h3>

<p>As most sysadmin now access servers using Windows desktop and terminal emulator, usage of programmable keyboard can dramatically 
increase your productivity. </p>

<p>I would recommend <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Hardware/Peripherals/Keyboards/logitech_g510s_gaming_keyboard.shtml">Logitech G510s gaming keyboard
</a>Â It provides 18 macro keys and allows
<a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Hardware/Peripherals/Keyboards/Logitech_G_keyboard_macros/lua_scripting.shtml">LUA scripting </a>Â for macros. Macros 
can help to solve some nasty problems with MC. For example MC does not export the values of macrovariables to shell window when you 
press <tt>Ctrl-O</tt>. But using programmable keyboard you can create a macro and assign it to say key G18 which:</p>
<ol>

   <li>Runs user command assigned to say letter <tt>e</tt> (<tt>F2-e</tt>) that export value of all macro variable into export statements 
   and write this file to your home directly under some fixed name or the current date and session id (if you use multiple sessions). 
   For example

   <pre>export f=&#34;&#39;%f&#39;&#34; &gt; ~/mv_env 
export D=&#34;&#39;%D&#39;&#34; &gt;&gt; ~/mv_env 
export t=&#34;&#39;%t&#39;&#34; &gt;&gt; ~/mv_env
... ... ...</pre>
   Please note that the current directory of the active panel corresponds to the value of $PWD. you you do not need to export it. You 
   can also create a loop to accomplish the same with less number of lines. </li>

   <li>Presses <tt>Ctrl-O</tt> and then executes dot command on this newly created file

   <pre>. ~/mv_env</pre>

   <p>(you can alias it to <tt>.m</tt>; just add alias <tt>.m=&#39;. ~/mc_env&#39;</tt> to your profile ) </p>
   </li>
</ol>
After that all MC built-in macros are available for usage in commands and scripts as env variables.

   <li><tt>Ctrl-X H</tt> -- add directory top hotlist</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="History">History</a></h3>

<p>There are several types of history in mc. It is present if you can see the pictogram<tt> [^]</tt>Â  (usually on the right side). 
for example there is: </p>

<p>History on command entered on the command like</p>

<p>History of directories visited (separate for left and right panels) </p>

<p>History is persistent from one invocation to another. You case see it by clicking withÂ  mouseÂ  [^] in the right bottom 
corner of mc. </p>
<ul>

   <li><b>For directories history and whenever it is present Alt-y</b> moves to the previous directory in the history, <em>equivalent 
   to clicking the <i>&lt;</i> with the mouse. </em></li>

   <li><b>Alt-u</b> moves to the next directory in the history, <em>equivalent to clicking the <i>&gt;</i> with the mouse. </em></li>

   <li><b>Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H</b> displays the directory history, <em>equivalent to depressing the &#39;v&#39; with the mouse. </em></li>

   <li><b>Alt-p, Alt-n</b> use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you 
   to the next one. </li>

   <li><b>Alt-h</b> displays the <em>history for the current input line. </em></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Command_line_tips">Command line tips</a></h3>
<ul>

   <li>Instead of <tt>Alt-Enter</tt> (<em>put the current file in the command line</em>) you can use<tt> Esc-Enter</tt> (this is useful 
   for Cygwin as Windows uses <tt>Alt-Enter</tt> for maximizing screen, and this is a useful shortcut to disable)</li>

   <li>You can add the path from the active and passive panels <tt>Ctrl-X P </tt>and <tt>Ctrl-X Ctrl-P</tt>. Pasting the file name is
   <tt>Ctrl-X T</tt>. There is a quick <tt>cd</tt> command (which in version 4.8.1 can be used to rsync panel directory with shell terminal 
   screen directory. </li>

   <li>You can use macrovariables in the command string (see below).</li>

   <li>Click on <tt>[^]</tt> at the right corner of command line shows history of commands, which is browsable.Â  (also availbel 
   via menu F9/Ccommand/FCommand history)</li>

   <li>

   <p>Hitting <tt>Ctrl-O</tt> in viewer and editor expose console screen and allow typing commands in it. </p>
   </li>

   <li>

   <p><tt>Alt-O</tt><b> -- Switch to the directory on the passive panel identical to the directory on the active panel hotkey</b>
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>

<p>You can adjust the displayed digits with the column <code>size</code> option, see the “Listing mode” section in the manual. The file 
to edit is <code>~/.config/mc/panels.ini</code>.</p>

<p>To list the file sizes as <code>K</code>, <code>M</code> or <code>G</code> use a narrow size column using the <code>user_format</code> 
key:</p>

<pre><code>[New Left Panel]
user_format=half type name mark size:4 space mtime</code></pre>

<p>If you want the size without abbreviation, reserve enough space for it:</p>

<pre><code>[New Right Panel]
user_format=half type name mark size:16 space mtime</code></pre>
From the manual:
<blockquote>

   <p>Listing Mode...</p>

   <p>The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are four different listing modes available: Full, Brief, Long 
   and User. The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the modification time.</p>

   <p>The brief view shows only the file name and it has from 1 up to 9 columns (therefore showing more files unlike other views). The 
   long view is similar to the output of &#34;Is -1&#34; command. The long view takes the whole screen width.</p>

   <p>If you choose the &#34;User&#34; display format, then you have to specify the display format.</p>

   <p>The user display format must start with a panel size specifier. This may be &#34;half&#34; or &#34;full&#34;, and they specify a half screen panel 
   and a full screen panel respectively.</p>

   <p>After the panel size, you may specify how many listings to fit in the panel, side-by-side (in other words: how many times to repeat 
   the fields horizontally). This defaults to 1. You may change this by adding a number from</p>

   <p>After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier. This</p>
   <ol>

      <li><tt>name</tt> displays the file name.</li>

      <li><tt>size </tt>displays the file size.</li>

      <li><tt>bsize</tt> is an alternative form of the size format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just shows 
      SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.</li>

      <li><tt>type</tt> displays a one character wide type field. This character is similar to what is displayed by Is with the -F flag 
      - * for executable files, <tt>/</tt> for directories, @ for links, = for sockets, - for character devices, + for block devices, 
      I for pipes, ~ for symbolic links to directories and ! for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).</li>

      <li><tt>mark</tt> an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it&#39;s not. </li>

      <li><tt>mtime</tt> file&#39;s last modification time. </li>

      <li><tt>atime</tt> file&#39;s last access time. </li>

      <li><tt>ctime</tt> file&#39;s status change time. </li>

      <li><tt>perm</tt> a string representing the current permission bits of the file </li>

      <li><tt>mode</tt> an octal value with the current permission bits of the file. </li>

      <li><tt>nlink</tt> the number of links to the file. </li>

      <li><tt>ngid</tt> the GID (numeric). </li>

      <li><tt>nuid</tt> the UID (numeric). </li>

      <li><tt>owner</tt> the owner of the file. </li>

      <li><tt>group</tt> the group of the file. </li>

      <li><tt>inode</tt> the inode of the file. </li>
   </ol>

   <p>Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout: </p>
   <ul>

      <li>space a space in the display format. </li>

      <li>| add a vertical line to the display format.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add : followed by the number of characters you want the field 
   to have. If the number is followed by the symbol +, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if</p>

   <p>the program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that field.</p>

   <p>For example, the Full display corresponds to this format:</p>

   <pre>half type name | size | mtime</pre>

   <p>And the Long display corresponds to this format:</p>

   <pre>full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name</pre>

   <p>This is a nice user display format: </p>

   <pre>half name I size:7 | type mode:3</pre>

<h3><a name="Macro_variables">Macro variables </a></h3>

<h3>Creative use of user menu</h3>

<p>There is a very simple test that allow you to distinguish advance mc user from a novice. Ask him/her to press F2 and show you the 
user menu. If the user menu is default this is a novice. </p>

<p>Despite being very basic MC user menu isÂ  a very powerful tool that allow to code many typical operation which became available 
to you with just two keystrokes.<b>Â  </b>The following macrovariables(you can use them both in your own user menu entries and on 
command line) are available<b> (See also <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/macrovariables.shtml">MC Macro Variables</a> ): </b></p>
<ol>

   <li><tt>%f</tt> The current file name. <tt>%F</tt> The current file in the passive panel.</li>

   <li><tt>%d</tt> The current directory name. <tt>%D</tt> The directory name of the passive panel.</li>

   <li><tt>%t </tt>The currently tagged files. <tt>%T</tt> The tagged files in the passive panel.</li>

   <li>&#34;<tt>%u</tt>&#34; and &#34;<tt>%U</tt>&#34; Similar to the <tt>%t</tt> and <tt>%T</tt> macros, but after the operation all the files are 
   untagged (can be used only once per menu entry). </li>

   <li><tt>%s</tt> and <tt>%S</tt> The tagged files <em>if there are any</em>. Otherwise the current file.</li>

   <li><tt>%cd</tt> This is a special macro that is used to change the current directory to the directory specified in front of it. 
   This is used primarily as an interface to the VFS.</li>

   <li><tt>%view </tt>the invocation of the internal viewer </li>

   <li>&#34;<tt>%%</tt>&#34; The <tt>%</tt> character</li>

   <li>&#34;<tt>%{Enter some text}</tt>&#34; Prompt for the substitution (in the example given, the prompt will be &#34;Enter some text&#34;), each 
   time the command is executed.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>&#34;Learn macrovariables&#34; is a great tip. </b>For example to symlink the file to opposite pane you can addÂ  to the user menu 
with just a couple of linesÂ  (for example with the short key l): </p>

<pre>l	Symlink the current file to the directory in opposite (passive) panel
	ln -s %d/%p $D/%p</pre>

<p>Similarly you can create a shortcut for creating &#34;in-place&#34; backup of the file: <b>Â </b>Â  </p>

<pre>b	Create a time stamped backup is the same directory
	cp %f %f.`date +&#34;%y%m%d&#34;`</pre>

<p>I recommend to print your mc.menu file and put in it above your monitor for reference. Details of how to write user menu items are 
inÂ Â  provides in <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/user_menu.shtml">MC Context Sensitive User Menu</a></p>

<p>Mc is also great for working with tar files, gzip and zip archives. </p>

      <li>History of commands entered in command line is available by clicking <tt>[^]</tt> in the right corner with the mouse.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>

   <li><b>Mouse drag and drop is working even in Teraterm (4.8 and later versions)</b></li>

   <li><b>Better than in previous versions implementation of command console interface (4.8 and later versions).</b> Probably the first 
   support of &#34;real&#34; Unix console via &#34;Ctrl-O&#34;. Addition of path from the left and right panels (Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-]) were implemented 
   as Ctrl-X P and Ctrl-X P. Pasting the file name (Ctrl-I) is Ctrl-X T. There is also a hotkey for active panel directory path Alt-A 
   and for quick cd command.<b> </b>Paradoxically before MC 4.8 using OFMs were extremely weak in this area as if programmers who wrote 
   them were completely limited to Windows experience and did not understand of value of integration of shell and file manager the OFM 
   support. </li>

   <li><b>Correct implementation of Ctrl-O functionality in viewer and editor</b> -- editor or viewer are hidden and console screen 
   is exposed. </li>

   <li><b>Full power of regular expressions in selections</b> and search. For example, in panel selections the list &#34;<tt>*.txt; *.bat; 
   *.inf; *.doc</tt>&#34; can be specified as <tt>&#34;*.(doc|bat|inf|doc)&#34;.</tt></li>

   <li><b>RegEx-based search capabilities</b>. Like in NC5, XTree &#34;flat&#34; VFS can be emulated in MC using <i>panelize</i> command (search 
   for *), but without macros this emulation is pretty painful. </li>

   <li><b>Dynamic construction of the directory tree.</b> The idea itself is rather interesting taking into account the real height 
   of directory tree that we see in Red Hat and other Linux distributions with Gnome installed. But unfortunately the existing implementation 
   breaks OFM doctrine as the tree is build from root, not from the current directory and that somewhat limits its usability for quick 
   search of files and navigation. The directory tree expand/collapse should happens automatically in the vicinity of the user view 
   on the tree. Currently you need manually use <tt>F2</tt> (rescan) to open the branch that interests you. Still the problem here is 
   the cost of full scanning of the tree in a typical unix system. </li>

   <li><b>Configurable display information</b> (you can select your own directory display format)
   <ul>

      <li>The circular ring of predefined display formats switchable via <b>Alt-T</b>.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>

   <li><b>Attempts to provide some hotkeys for working with the current directory.</b> Jumping to the top file, middle file and the 
   last file on the panel are provided (only Alt-G (the top) and Alt-J (the bottom) actually work now); That can be extended to potentially 
   more useful jumps to the top subdirectory, middle subdirectory and the last subdirectory in the current panel (often there are only 
   two or three subdirectories; in this case those three keys select subdirectory unambiguously). </li>

   <li><b>Dynamic Bottom Toolbar.</b> MC 4.6.0 is probably the only Unix OFMs that supports <em>the concept of dynamic toolbar </em>
   (in Viewer, Editor, and Directory Search panel).. Dynamic toolbar is a very useful instant help system and should be used whenever 
   possible. Unfortunately, the key bar doesn&#39;t change when Alt, Ctrl, or Shift are pressed like in FAR and FC. It&#39;s probably hard to 
   implement it in a portable way in Unix with its limited PC keyboard support. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Games_with_shorcuts_">Games with shorcuts</a></h3>
<ul>

   <li><tt>Ctrl-x-v</tt> -- create symbolic link</li>

   <li>Instead of <tt>Alt-Enter</tt> (put the current file in the command line) which often does not work, you can use<tt> Esc-Enter.</tt> 
   This tip works for other shortcuts too.<tt> </tt></li>

   <li><em>This idea of user menu was extended to the mc internal editor which has an additional macro variable %b to which you can 
   direct the output of shell command for insertion into editor buffer and vise versa.</em>Â  This is a valuable innovation. Generally 
   in version 4.8.1 editor looks more promising and more modern then in previous version although it still is lack in quality and capabilities 
   from <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/Editors/Lightweight_editors/fte.shtml">FTE</a>, which I strongly recommend as an external editor for Midnight 
   Commander.</li>

<h4>[May 10, 2021] <a target="_blank" href="https://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde/">The Tilde Text Editor</a></h4>
<h5><em>Highly recommended</em>!</h5>

<h5>This is an editor similar to FDE and can be used as external editor for MC</h5>
<blockquote>
<h6>May 10, 2021 |  <a target="_blank" href="https://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde/">os.ghalkes.nl</a></h6>
 

    <p>Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which provides an intuitive interface for
    people accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE and Windows. For example, the
    short-cut to copy the current selection is Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text
    the short-cut Control-V can be used. As another example, the File menu can be accessed by
    pressing Meta-F.</p>

    <p>However, being a terminal-based program there are limitations. Not all terminals provide
    sufficient information to the client programs to make Tilde behave in the most intuitive way.
    When this is the case, Tilde provides work-arounds which should be easy to work with.</p>

    <p>The main audience for Tilde is users who normally work in GUI environments, but sometimes
    require an editor for a console/terminal environment. This may be because the computer in
    question is a server which does not provide a GUI, or is accessed remotely over SSH. Tilde
    allows these users to edit files without having to learn a completely new interface, such as vi
    or Emacs do. A result of this choice is that Tilde will not provide all the fancy features that
    Vim or Emacs provide, but only the most used features.</p>

    <p><img src="https://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde/tilde-screenshot.png"/></p><b>News</b> <b>Tilde version
    1.1.2 released</b>

    <p>This release fixes a bug where Tilde would discard read lines before an invalid character,
    while requested to continue reading.</p>

    <p>23-May-2020</p><b>Tilde version 1.1.1 released</b>

    <p>This release fixes a build failure on C++14 and later compilers</p>

    <p><b>Panels</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>Alt + ,</code> - switch <code>mc</code> &#39;s layout from left-right to top-bottom.
      Mind = blown. Useful for operating on files with long names.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + t</code> - switch the panel&#39;s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long,
      user-defined. &#34;long&#34; is especially useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes
      full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + i</code> - synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show
      the current directory in the other panel.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + u</code> - swap panels.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + o</code> - if the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory
      on the other panel and move the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is
      not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the
      next file. This is useful for quick checking the contents of a list of directories.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + PgUp</code> (or just left arrow, if you&#39;ve enabled <code>Lynx-like
      motion</code> , see later) - move to the parent directory.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + Shift + h</code> - show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate
      than going back one entry at a time.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + y</code> - move to the previous directory in history.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + u</code> - move to the next directory in history.</li>
    </ul><b>Common actions</b>

    <ul>
      <li><code>Ctrl + Space</code> - calculate the size of the selected directories. Press this
      shortcut when the selection is on <code>..</code> to calculate the size of all the
      directories in the current directory.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x s</code> (that is press <code>Ctrl + x</code> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU">let it go</a> and then press <code>s</code> ) -
      create a symbolic link (change <code>s</code> to <code>l</code> for a hardlink). I find it
      very useful and intuitive - the link will, of course, be created in the other panel. You can
      change it&#39;s destination and name, like with any other file operation.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x c</code> - open the <code>chmod</code> dialog.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x o</code> - open the <code>chown</code> dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Panel options

        </b></p>
    <ul>

       <li><code>Show backup files</code> and <code>Show hidden files</code> - I keep both
          enabled, as I often work with configuration files, etc.</li>

       <li><code>Lynx-like motion</code> - mentioned above, makes left arrow go to parent
          directory, while the right arrow enters the directory under selection. Faster than
          <code>Home</code> , <code>Enter</code> , <code>Home</code> , <code>Enter</code> , etc.
          This options is quite smart, that is if the shell command line is not empty, the arrows
          work as usual and allow moving the cursor in the command line.</li>
    </ul><b>Bonus assignments</b>

    <ul>
      <li>Define your own listing mode ( <code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Listing mode...</code>
      -&gt; <code>User defined</code> ). Hit <code>F1</code> to see available columns and
      options.</li>

      <li>Play around in tree mode: <code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Tree</code> or
      <code>Command</code> -&gt; <code>Directory tree</code> .</li>

      <li>Compare directories ( <code>Ctrl + x d</code> )</li>

      <li>Fill up the directory hotlist ( <code>Ctrl + \</code> )</li>

      <p>The above would compress the current directory (%d) to a file also in the current directory. If you want to compress the directory 
      pointed to by the cursor rather than the current directory, use %f instead:</p>

      <pre>tar -czf %f_$(date &#39;+%%Y%%m%%d&#39;).tar.gz %f
</pre>

      <p><code>mc</code> handles escaping of special characters so there is no need to put %f in quotes.</p>

      <p>By the way, midnight commander&#39;s special treatment of percent signs occurs not just in the user menu file but also at the command 
      line. This is an issue when using shell commands with constructs like <code>${var%.c}</code> . At the command line, the same as 
      in the user menu file, percent signs can be escaped by doubling them.</p>

    <p><b><a target="_blank" href="https://plug-and-pray.blogspot.com/2009/09/editing-midnight-commanders-color.html">Editing
    Midnight Commander&#39;s color scheme</a></b> In a <a target="_blank" href="http://plug-and-pray.blogspot.com/2008/11/midnight-commander-transparent-color.html">previous
    post</a> I was sort of laying out a &#34;formula&#34; on how to transform your Midnight Commander
    default color scheme into a trasnparent skin, without talking too much about how you can change
    the other colors.</p>

    <p>To my great shame, I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to this blog or to the comments asking
    for further advice. I found Mateus&#39; comment rather late (just now!) and decided to dig further,
    in order to find out how exactly to deal with more refined color changes, while still keeping
    the transparent background (in both in Midnight Commander and its editor).</p>

    <p>So the first thing to know is which are the colors that Midnight Commander supports; the
    available colors are:</p>

    <p>black</p>

    <p>The &#34; default &#34; color is the one giving out the nice transparency.</p>

    <p>Now, there are certain &#34;components&#34; in Midnight Commander&#39;s display that can have their
    colors altered. Here they are:</p>

    <p>base_color, normal, selected, marked, markselect, errors, menu, reverse, dnormal, dfocus,
    dhotnormal, dhotfocus, viewunderline, menuhot, menusel, menuhotsel, helpnormal, helpitalic,
    helpbold, helplink, helpslink, gauge, input, directory, executable, link, stalelink, device,
    core, special, editnormal, editbold, editmarked, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus</p>

    <p>Each and every one of these &#34;components&#34; can have its own colors set accordingly to the
    user&#39;s wish. Each component is assigned a color pair and must be followed by a colon (&#39;:&#39;) in
    order to separate it from the color pair of the next component. Here&#39;s how this basic syntax
    must look like:</p>

    <p>component=foreground_color,background_color:</p>

    <p>When you start modifying the color scheme in your Midnight Commander configuration file
    (located at ~/.mc/ini ), you just have to add a section called &#34; [Colors] &#34; and proceed with
    enumerating the color pairs. So you&#39;d have something like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>For increased readability, I will &#34;truncate&#34; that long line, adding a backslash (&#39;\&#39;) to
    indicate that in fact what follows on the next line should be adjacent to the text on the
    previous line. This being said, the [Colors] section could look like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now that you&#39;ve gotten the hang of this, let&#39;s see how the [Colors] section looks like in
    the default Midnight Commander color scheme (you know, the &#34;ugly&#34; one, with blue and dull
    cyan):</p>

    <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: For visual impact&#39;s sake and due to Blogspot breaking long lines, I wrote
    each color pair on a single row, followed by a backslash (&#39;\&#39;). Please note that this does NOT
    work in the ~/.mc/ini file, so the final [Colors] section in your Midnight Commander
    configuration file MUST be a SINGLE line with no spaces and with each color pair separated from
    the next one by a colon (&#39;:&#39;).</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now let&#39;s see. What you want to change first of all is most of the background of these
    &#34;components&#34;, such that the display will be one with a neat looking transparent background. So
    first of all you might want to make a few changes to these color pairs by replacing the
    background color &#34;blue&#34; with &#34;default&#34;. After doing these changes, your [Colors] section will
    look a bit like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now you&#39;ve got the basic &#34;Midnight Commander transparent scheme&#34; that was the result of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://plug-and-pray.blogspot.com/2008/11/midnight-commander-transparent-color.html">this
    post</a> .</p>

    <p>Proceeding to Mateus&#39; question, regarding how to change the rest of the colors now, it&#39;s
    about the same as before. What he didn&#39;t like there (and as a matter of fact I don&#39;t quite like
    it, either) is the dull cyan that&#39;s still seen in the following places:<br/></p>

    <ol>
      <li>the bottom line (the one displaying the F1...F10 function keys);</li>

      <li>the line that signifies the current selection, the &#34;prompt&#34; which shows you on which
      file/directory you&#39;re &#34;on&#34; at a given moment;</li>

      <li>the uppermost line (the &#34;menu&#34; line);</li>

      <li>the menus themselves, once you open them.</li>
    </ol>To &#34;fix&#34; issues 1, 2, and 3 it is sufficient to alter the value of the &#34; selected &#34;
    parameter. Notice how it is initially

    <p>selected=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>My personal choice is to replace the background cyan, which I don&#39;t really like, with green.
    To do this, I&#39;ll change this color pair to</p>

    <p>selected=black,green:\</p>

    <p>You can, of course, change the foreground color as well. For me, it&#39;s alright to keep the
    foreground (the text) &#34;black&#34;. You can change it to whatever suits your taste.</p>

    <p>To &#34;fix&#34; issue number 4 in the list above, you need to change the &#34; menu &#34; parameter. To get
    it transparent, just change the &#34;cyan&#34; background to &#34;default&#34;. Make other adjustments as you
    see fit. In other words, change</p>

    <p>menu=white,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into, for instance,</p>

    <p>menu=ligthgray,default:\</p>

    <p>However, there are a few &#34;leftovers&#34; from the default color scheme.</p>

    <p>One of them is the parameter regarding the hotkeys in the menus (the &#34;underlined&#34; character
    on most of the menu options, showing you what key you can press in order to access that option
    faster than by moving to it with the arrow keys). This color pair is called &#34; menuhot &#34;. I
    changed it from</p>

    <p>menuhot=yellow,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>menuhot=yellow,default:\</p>

    <p>Another thing which might bother you is the color of the line in the panel you&#39;re in when
    you&#39;ve &#34;selected all&#34; files (when you&#39;ve pressed the &#34;*&#34; key). This parameter is called &#34;
    markselect &#34;. I changed it from</p>

    <p>markselect=yellow,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>markselect=white,green:\</p>

    <p>The color pair of the selected buttons in dialogs is called &#34; dfocus &#34;. I changed mine
    from</p>

    <p>dfocus=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dfocus=black,green:\</p>

    <p>In the &#34;focused&#34; buttons or options, the underlined character is called &#34; dhotfocus &#34;. I
    changed mine from</p>

    <p>dhotfocus=blue,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dhotfocus=brightgreen,green:\</p>

    <p>since the background color was already green, after I modified the &#34; dfocus &#34; color
    pair.</p>

    <p>The other buttons or options in the dialogs which have hotkeys assigned to them, but which
    are not &#34;focused&#34; (the buttons/options that you&#39;re not located on at a given moment) are still
    displayed in blue on a light gray background. This color pair is referred to as &#34; dhotnormal &#34;.
    Since the blue looks a bit odd there, I changed</p>

    <p>dhotnormal=blue,lightgray:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dhotnormal=brightgreen,default:\</p>

    <p>Well, this is nice, in window titles and on normal (unfocused) hotkeys I get the transparent
    background. The problem now is that the rest of the dialog window is still light gray. To
    change this (to make the window transparent as well), you only need to alter the &#34; dnormal &#34;
    color pair, such as changing it from</p>

    <p>dnormal=black,lightgray:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dnormal=white,default:\</p>

    <p>You may notice that the input fields stay cyan, as well; you find these fields in quite a
    lot of dialog boxes. To alter this, I changed</p>

    <p>input=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>input=black,green:\</p>

    <p>One thing which I consider useful is to have symbolic links displayed in bright cyan (as in
    the colored listings in the terminal). So I just changed</p>

    <p>link=lightgray,default:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>link=brightcyan,default:\</p>

    <p>Now, regarding the rest of the color pairs, I don&#39;t really know what they do. However, if at
    some point after using Midnight Commander more with this new, neat, transparent/green color
    scheme you&#39;ll notice unwanted leftovers, you can try out other changes in the color pairs
    values, one at a time, until you determine the troublesome one.</p>

    <p>After operating the changes above, my [Colors] section in ~/.mc/ini now looks like this:</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>I need to direct you to the &#34; IMPORTANT NOTE &#34; above. The final [Colors] section above is
    written like this - one pair on each row, followed by a backslash - for clarity&#39;s sake. The
    actual final [Colors] section in your ~/.mc/ini file will have to be a one-liner, with no
    blanks and no backslashes. So it will probably look similar to this:</p>

    <p>
    base_color=lightgray,default:normal=lightgray,default:selected=black,green:marked=yellow,default:markselect=white,green:errors=white,red:menu=lightgray,default:reverse=black,lightgray:dnormal=white,default:dfocus=black,green:dhotnormal=brightgreen,default:dhotfocus=brightgreen,green:viewunderline=brightred,default:menuhot=yellow,default:menusel=white,black:menuhotsel=yellow,black:helpnormal=black,lightgray:helpitalic=red,lightgray:helpbold=blue,lightgray:helplink=black,cyan:helpslink=yellow,default:gauge=white,black:input=black,green:directory=white,default:executable=brightgreen,default:link=brightcyan,default:stalelink=brightred,default:device=brightmagenta,default:core=red,default:special=black,default:editnormal=lightgray,default:editbold=yellow,default:editmarked=black,cyan:errdhotnormal=yellow,red:errdhotfocus=yellow,lightgray</p>

    <p>Now, the next time you start mc , the new color scheme will take effect.</p>

    <p>As a bonus, here&#39;s a picture of how my Midnight Commander looks like, with this new &#34;skin&#34;
    on:</p>

    <p>Midnight Commander (or &#34;mc&#34;) can have transparent panels instead of the ugly, dull default
    blue. So can &#34;mcedit&#34;, its text editor.</p>

    <p>Here&#39;s how to do it. Edit the file ~/.mc/ini and add at the end the following:</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Note #1: In the above &#39;code&#39; block, there is only one line below [Colors] . I truncated the
    line with the backslash because of blogspot rendering issues. You just write all that on one
    single line, without the &#34;\&#34; (backslash-es).</p>

    <p>Note #2: At the end of this line, the &#34; editnormal,=default: &#34; option means that mcedit will
    have transparent background in your console, as well.</p>

    <p>To my great shame, I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to this blog or to the comments asking
    for further advice. I found Mateus&#39; comment rather late (just now!) and decided to dig further,
    in order to find out how exactly to deal with more refined color changes, while still keeping
    the transparent background (in both in Midnight Commander and its editor).</p>

    <p>So the first thing to know is which are the colors that Midnight Commander supports; the
    available colors are:</p>

    <p>black</p>

    <p>The &#34; default &#34; color is the one giving out the nice transparency.</p>

    <p>Now, there are certain &#34;components&#34; in Midnight Commander&#39;s display that can have their
    colors altered. Here they are:</p>

    <p>base_color, normal, selected, marked, markselect, errors, menu, reverse, dnormal, dfocus,
    dhotnormal, dhotfocus, viewunderline, menuhot, menusel, menuhotsel, helpnormal, helpitalic,
    helpbold, helplink, helpslink, gauge, input, directory, executable, link, stalelink, device,
    core, special, editnormal, editbold, editmarked, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus</p>

    <p>Each and every one of these &#34;components&#34; can have its own colors set accordingly to the
    user&#39;s wish. Each component is assigned a color pair and must be followed by a colon (&#39;:&#39;) in
    order to separate it from the color pair of the next component. Here&#39;s how this basic syntax
    must look like:</p>

    <p>component=foreground_color,background_color:</p>

    <p>When you start modifying the color scheme in your Midnight Commander configuration file
    (located at ~/.mc/ini ), you just have to add a section called &#34; [Colors] &#34; and proceed with
    enumerating the color pairs. So you&#39;d have something like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>For increased readability, I will &#34;truncate&#34; that long line, adding a backslash (&#39;\&#39;) to
    indicate that in fact what follows on the next line should be adjacent to the text on the
    previous line. This being said, the [Colors] section could look like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now that you&#39;ve gotten the hang of this, let&#39;s see how the [Colors] section looks like in
    the default Midnight Commander color scheme (you know, the &#34;ugly&#34; one, with blue and dull
    cyan):</p>

    <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: For visual impact&#39;s sake and due to Blogspot breaking long lines, I wrote
    each color pair on a single row, followed by a backslash (&#39;\&#39;). Please note that this does NOT
    work in the ~/.mc/ini file, so the final [Colors] section in your Midnight Commander
    configuration file MUST be a SINGLE line with no spaces and with each color pair separated from
    the next one by a colon (&#39;:&#39;).</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now let&#39;s see. What you want to change first of all is most of the background of these
    &#34;components&#34;, such that the display will be one with a neat looking transparent background. So
    first of all you might want to make a few changes to these color pairs by replacing the
    background color &#34;blue&#34; with &#34;default&#34;. After doing these changes, your [Colors] section will
    look a bit like this:</p>

    <p># the rest of your ~/.mc/ini file</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>Now you&#39;ve got the basic &#34;Midnight Commander transparent scheme&#34; that was the result of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://plug-and-pray.blogspot.com/2008/11/midnight-commander-transparent-color.html">this
    post</a> .</p>

    <p>Proceeding to Mateus&#39; question, regarding how to change the rest of the colors now, it&#39;s
    about the same as before. What he didn&#39;t like there (and as a matter of fact I don&#39;t quite like
    it, either) is the dull cyan that&#39;s still seen in the following places:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>the bottom line (the one displaying the F1...F10 function keys);</li>

      <li>the line that signifies the current selection, the &#34;prompt&#34; which shows you on which
      file/directory you&#39;re &#34;on&#34; at a given moment;</li>

      <li>the uppermost line (the &#34;menu&#34; line);</li>

      <li>the menus themselves, once you open them.</li>
    </ol>To &#34;fix&#34; issues 1, 2, and 3 it is sufficient to alter the value of the &#34; selected &#34;
    parameter. Notice how it is initially

    <p>selected=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>My personal choice is to replace the background cyan, which I don&#39;t really like, with green.
    To do this, I&#39;ll change this color pair to</p>

    <p>selected=black,green:\</p>

    <p>You can, of course, change the foreground color as well. For me, it&#39;s alright to keep the
    foreground (the text) &#34;black&#34;. You can change it to whatever suits your taste.</p>

    <p>To &#34;fix&#34; issue number 4 in the list above, you need to change the &#34; menu &#34; parameter. To get
    it transparent, just change the &#34;cyan&#34; background to &#34;default&#34;. Make other adjustments as you
    see fit. In other words, change</p>

    <p>menu=white,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into, for instance,</p>

    <p>menu=ligthgray,default:\</p>

    <p>However, there are a few &#34;leftovers&#34; from the default color scheme.</p>

    <p>One of them is the parameter regarding the hotkeys in the menus (the &#34;underlined&#34; character
    on most of the menu options, showing you what key you can press in order to access that option
    faster than by moving to it with the arrow keys). This color pair is called &#34; menuhot &#34;. I
    changed it from</p>

    <p>menuhot=yellow,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>menuhot=yellow,default:\</p>

    <p>Another thing which might bother you is the color of the line in the panel you&#39;re in when
    you&#39;ve &#34;selected all&#34; files (when you&#39;ve pressed the &#34;*&#34; key). This parameter is called &#34;
    markselect &#34;. I changed it from</p>

    <p>markselect=yellow,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>markselect=white,green:\</p>

    <p>The color pair of the selected buttons in dialogs is called &#34; dfocus &#34;. I changed mine
    from</p>

    <p>dfocus=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dfocus=black,green:\</p>

    <p>In the &#34;focused&#34; buttons or options, the underlined character is called &#34; dhotfocus &#34;. I
    changed mine from</p>

    <p>dhotfocus=blue,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dhotfocus=brightgreen,green:\</p>

    <p>since the background color was already green, after I modified the &#34; dfocus &#34; color
    pair.</p>

    <p>The other buttons or options in the dialogs which have hotkeys assigned to them, but which
    are not &#34;focused&#34; (the buttons/options that you&#39;re not located on at a given moment) are still
    displayed in blue on a light gray background. This color pair is referred to as &#34; dhotnormal &#34;.
    Since the blue looks a bit odd there, I changed</p>

    <p>dhotnormal=blue,lightgray:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dhotnormal=brightgreen,default:\</p>

    <p>Well, this is nice, in window titles and on normal (unfocused) hotkeys I get the transparent
    background. The problem now is that the rest of the dialog window is still light gray. To
    change this (to make the window transparent as well), you only need to alter the &#34; dnormal &#34;
    color pair, such as changing it from</p>

    <p>dnormal=black,lightgray:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>dnormal=white,default:\</p>

    <p>You may notice that the input fields stay cyan, as well; you find these fields in quite a
    lot of dialog boxes. To alter this, I changed</p>

    <p>input=black,cyan:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>input=black,green:\</p>

    <p>One thing which I consider useful is to have symbolic links displayed in bright cyan (as in
    the colored listings in the terminal). So I just changed</p>

    <p>link=lightgray,default:\</p>

    <p>into</p>

    <p>link=brightcyan,default:\</p>

    <p>Now, regarding the rest of the color pairs, I don&#39;t really know what they do. However, if at
    some point after using Midnight Commander more with this new, neat, transparent/green color
    scheme you&#39;ll notice unwanted leftovers, you can try out other changes in the color pairs
    values, one at a time, until you determine the troublesome one.</p>

    <p>After operating the changes above, my [Colors] section in ~/.mc/ini now looks like this:</p>

    <p>[Colors]</p>

    <p>I need to direct you to the &#34; IMPORTANT NOTE &#34; above. The final [Colors] section above is
    written like this - one pair on each row, followed by a backslash - for clarity&#39;s sake. The
    actual final [Colors] section in your ~/.mc/ini file will have to be a one-liner, with no
    blanks and no backslashes. So it will probably look similar to this:</p>

    <p>
    base_color=lightgray,default:normal=lightgray,default:selected=black,green:marked=yellow,default:markselect=white,green:errors=white,red:menu=lightgray,default:reverse=black,lightgray:dnormal=white,default:dfocus=black,green:dhotnormal=brightgreen,default:dhotfocus=brightgreen,green:viewunderline=brightred,default:menuhot=yellow,default:menusel=white,black:menuhotsel=yellow,black:helpnormal=black,lightgray:helpitalic=red,lightgray:helpbold=blue,lightgray:helplink=black,cyan:helpslink=yellow,default:gauge=white,black:input=black,green:directory=white,default:executable=brightgreen,default:link=brightcyan,default:stalelink=brightred,default:device=brightmagenta,default:core=red,default:special=black,default:editnormal=lightgray,default:editbold=yellow,default:editmarked=black,cyan:errdhotnormal=yellow,red:errdhotfocus=yellow,lightgray</p>

    <p>Now, the next time you start mc , the new color scheme will take effect.</p>

    <p>As a bonus, here&#39;s a picture of how my Midnight Commander looks like, with this new &#34;skin&#34;
    on:</p>

    <p> <em>Koszti Lajos</em> Midnight Commander is the most pupular file manager on
    unix like systems. It&#39;s fast and it has all features what you need. But it&#39;s only blue and we
    know, that everyone loves the eyecandy, everyone likes customizing his/her own desktop. But is
    there any way to custimize the mc ?</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ajnasz.hu/blog/20140228/midnight-commander-skin">Midnight Commander Skin</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can change the Midnight Commander colors if you edit the ~/.mc/ini file, where you have
    to add a new section, named [Colors] . You should define the new colors in this section, for
    example:</p>

    <p>[Colors] base_color=lightgray,green:normal=green,default:selected=white,gray ...</p>

    <p>As you see, it has a simple syntax:</p>

    <p>&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;foregroundcolor&gt;,&lt;backgroundcolor&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;= ...</p>

    <p>The colors are optional, so you can use this:</p>

    <p>[Colors] base_color=lightgray,green:normal=green:selected=,gray ...</p>

    <p><i>It&#39;s not the exactly the same as the first version!</i></p>

    <p>Fine, you can change some colors of the filemanager, but which are the keywords? These
    are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Base colors: normal, selected, marked, markselect, errors, input, reverse, gauge</li>

      <li>Menu colors: menu, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel</li>

      <li>Dialog colors: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus</li>

      <li>Help colors: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink</li>

      <li>Viewer color: viewunderline</li>

      <li>Special highlighting colors: executable, directory, link, stalelink, device, special,
      core</li>

      <li>Editor colors: editnormal, editbold, editmarked</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And which are the colors? I don&#39;t know all, but here are some of them:</p>

    <p>Here is the config, what I use:</p>

    <p>[Colors]
    base_color=lightgray,green:normal=green,default:selected=white,gray:marked=yellow,default:markselect=yellow,gray:directory=blue,default:executable=brightgreen,default:link=cyan,default:device=brightmagenta,default:special=lightgray,default:errors=red,default:reverse=green,default:gauge=green,default:input=white,gray:dnormal=green,gray:dfocus=brightgreen,gray:dhotnormal=cyan,gray:dhotfocus=brightcyan,gray:menu=green,default:menuhot=cyan,default:menusel=green,gray:menuhotsel=cyan,default:helpnormal=cyan,default:editnormal=green,default:editbold=blue,default:editmarked=gray,blue:stalelink=red,default</p>

    <p>Screenshot about my redesigned Midnight Commander</p>

    <p>On the screenshot you can see, that the directory color is blue, the files are green, the
    executable files are birghtgreen and the selected line is white on a gray background.</p>

    <p>And another one, what I use recently:</p>

    <p>[Colors]
    base_color=lightgray,blue:normal=blue,default:selected=white,brightblue:marked=yellow,default:markselect=yellow,gray:directory=brightblue,default:executable=brightgreen,default:link=cyan,default:device=brightmagenta,default:special=lightgray,default:errors=red,default:reverse=green,default:gauge=green,default:input=white,gray:dnormal=green,gray:dfocus=brightgreen,gray:dhotnormal=cyan,gray:dhotfocus=brightcyan,gray:menu=green,default:menuhot=cyan,default:menusel=green,gray:menuhotsel=cyan,default:helpnormal=cyan,default:editnormal=green,default:editbold=blue,default:editmarked=gray,blue:stalelink=red,default</p>

    <p>Screenshot about my redesigned Midnight Commander</p>

    <p>And here is a small shell script, which will help for you to test your new theme:</p>

    <p>#!/bin/sh mc --colors
    normal=green,default:selected=brightmagenta,gray:marked=yellow,default:markselect=yellow,gray:directory=blue,default:executable=brightgreen,default:link=cyan,default:device=brightmagenta,default:special=lightgray,default:errors=red,default:reverse=green,default:gauge=green,default:input=white,gray:dnormal=green,gray:dfocus=brightgreen,gray:dhotnormal=cyan,gray:dhotfocus=brightcyan,gray:menu=green,default:menuhot=cyan,default:menusel=green,gray:menuhotsel=cyan,default:helpnormal=cyan,default:editnormal=green,default:editbold=blue,default:editmarked=gray,blue:stalelink=red,default</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://ajnasz.hu/files/mccolor.gz">Download the shell script to
    make your own mc theme</a></p>

    <p>Save it as mccolortest.sh, make it executable with the <i>chmod +x mccolortest.sh</i>
    command, and run it with the <i>./mccolortest.sh</i> command. If you want to change a color,
    just edit this file. When you done, copy the colors and paste it below the <i>[Colors]</i>
    section in the <i>~/.mc/ini</i> . If it doesn&#39;t exists, make it yourself.</p>

      <p>Also, in 4.8.3 here, I copied the first example scheme line and my colors are different. I
      can&#39;t even set the background of the select bar to gray (or &#34;grey&#34;): it gets replaced with
      black. Also, the panel headings remain blue here, unlike the (first) screenshot, and I can
      see no corresponding tag in the line anyway.</p>

      <p>Also, you should know that most modern terminal applications allow you to redefine the
      exact shade of those 16 colors.</p>

      <p>Some of them (such as the Gnome or KDE terminals) may have a place under their preferences
      where you can redefine the colors.</p>

      <p>Older terminals, such as aterm, use ~/.Xdefaults for this. You can edit that file and add
      lines like this: &#34;aterm*color1: OrangeRed&#34; (without the quotes). What I&#39;ve done with that is
      tell aterm that the &#34;color1&#34; (which was red) should now be &#34;OrangeRed&#34;. See
      /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt for valid color names. You can use *color0 through *color15. So when
      you&#39;ll say &#34;red&#34; in MC&#39;s ini file, and if you use aterm, it will get replaced by color1 in
      ~/.Xdefaults and changed to OrangeRed. (Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the mappings between the
      names used by MC and 0-15 in Xdefaults by heart.)</p>

      <b>1. Using the Command-line <i>tar</i></b>

      <p>Yes, just give the full stored path of the file after the tarball name.</p>

      <p>Example: suppose you want file <code>etc/apt/sources.list</code> from <code>etc.tar</code>
      :</p>
      <pre>tar -xf etc.tar etc/apt/sources.list</pre>

      <p>Will extract <code>sources.list</code> and create directories <code>etc/apt</code> under
      the current directory.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can use the <code>-t</code> listing option instead of <code>-x</code> , maybe along
        with <i>grep</i> , to find the path of the file you want</li>

        <li>You can also extract a single directory</li>

        <li><i>tar</i> has other options like <code>--wildcards</code> , etc. for more advanced
        partial extraction scenarios; see <code>man tar</code></li>
      </ul><b>2. Extract it with the Archive Manager</b>

      <p>Open the tar in Archive Manager from Nautilus, go down into the folder hierarchy to find
      the file you need, and extract it.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On a server or command-line system, use a text-based file manager such as Midnight
        Commander ( <code>mc</code> ) to accomplish the same.</li>
      </ul><b>3. Using Nautilus/Archive-Mounter</b>

      <p>Right-click the tar in Nautilus, and select Open with ArchiveMounter.</p>

      <p>The tar will now appear similar to a removable drive on the left, and you can
      explore/navigate it like a normal drive and drag/copy/paste any file(s) you need to any
      destination.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>Midnight Commander</code> uses virtual filesystem ( <code>VFS</code> ) for displying
      files, such as contents of a <code>.tar.gz</code> archive, or of <code>.iso</code> image.
      This is configured in <code>mc.ext</code> with rules such as this one ( <code>Open</code> is
      <kbd>Enter</kbd> , <code>View</code> is <kbd>F3</kbd> ):
      <pre>regex/\.([iI][sS][oO])$
    Open=%cd %p/iso9660://
    View=%view{ascii} isoinfo -d -i %f
</pre>

      <p>When I press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on an <code>.iso</code> file, <code>mc</code> will open the
      <code>.iso</code> and I can browse individual files. This is very useful.</p>

      <p>Now my question: I have also files which are disk images, i.e. created with <code>pv
      /dev/sda1 &gt; sda1.img</code></p>

      <p>I would like <code>mc</code> to &#34;browse&#34; the files inside these images in the same fashion
      as <code>.iso</code> .</p>

      <p>Is this possible ? How would such rule look like ?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Another tool that can save you time is Midnight Commander&#39;s user menu. Go back to <code>
        /tmp/test</code> where you created nine files. Press F2 and bring up the user menu. Select
        Compress the current subdirectory (tar.gz) . After you choose the name for the archive,
        this will be created in <code>/tmp</code> (one level up from the directory being
        compressed). If you highlight the .tar.gz file and press ENTER you&#39;ll notice it will open
        like a regular directory. This allows you to browse archives and extract files by simply
        copying them ( F5 ) to the opposite panel&#39;s working directory.

        <p><img alt="Midnight Commander User Menu" src="https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/how-to-install-midnight-commander/midnight-commander-user-menu.png"/></p>
      </li>

      <li>To find out the size of a directory (actually, the size of all the files it contains),
      highlight the directory and then press CTRL+SPACE .</li>

      <li>To search, go up in your directory tree until you reach the top level, <code>/</code> ,
      called root directory. Now press F9 , then c , followed by f . After the Find File dialog
      opens, type <code>*.gz</code> . This will find any accessible gzip archive on the system. In
      the results dialog, press l (L) for Panelize . All the results will be fed to one of your
      panels so you can easily browse, copy, view and so on. If you enter a directory from that
      list, you lose the list of found files, but you can easily return to it with F9 , l (L) then
      z (to select Panelize from the Left menu).

        <p><img alt="Midnight Commander - Find File Dialog" src="https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/how-to-install-midnight-commander/midnight-commander-find-file-dialog.png"/></p>
      </li>

      <li>Managing files is not always done locally. Midnight Commander also supports accessing
      remote filesystems through SSH&#39;s <i>Secure File Transfer Protocol, SFTP</i> . This way you
      can easily transfer files between servers.

        <p>Press F9 , followed by l (L), then select the SFTP link menu entry. In the dialog box
        titled SFTP to machine enter <code>sftp://example@203.0.113.0</code> . Replace
        <code>example</code> with the username you have created on the remote machine and
        <code>203.0.113.1</code> with the IP address of your server. This will work only if the
        server at the other end accepts password logins. If you&#39;re logging in with SSH keys, then
        you&#39;ll first need to create and/or edit <code>~/.ssh/config</code> . It could look
        something like this:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>~/.ssh/config</dt>

          <dd>
            <table>
              <tbody><tr>
                <td>
                  <pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre>
                </td>

                <td>
                  <pre>Host sftp_server
    HostName 203.0.113.1
    Port 22
    User your_user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody></table>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>You can choose whatever you want as the Host value, it&#39;s only an identifier.
        IdentityFile is the path to your private SSH key.</p>

        <p>After the config file is setup, access your SFTP server by typing the identifier value
        you set after Host in the SFTP to machine dialog. In this example, enter
        <code>sftp_server</code> .</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <pre>No, you can&#39;t change the format of the &#34;Long&#34; listing-mode.

(You can make the &#34;User defined&#34; listing-mode display in one panel (by
changing &#34;half&#34; to &#34;full&#34;), but this is not what you want.)

So, you have two options:

(1) Modify the source code (search panel.c for &#34;full perm space&#34; and
tweak it); or:

(2) Use mc^2. It allows you to do this. (It already comes with a
snippet that enlarges the &#34;Size&#34; field a bit so there&#39;d be room for
the commas (or other locale-dependent formatting) it adds. This makes
reading long numbers much easier.)

However this seems to work only with panelized results coming from the

    <pre wrap="">Hi!
My mc version:
$ mc --version
GNU Midnight Commander 4.8.19
System: Fedora 24

I just want to tell you that %f macro in mcedit is not correct. It
contains the current file name that is selected in the panel but not
the actual file name that is opened in mcedit.

I created the mcedit item to run C++ program:
+= f \.cpp$
r       Run
    clear
    app_path=/tmp/$(uuidgen)
    if g++ -o $app_path &#34;%f&#34;; then
        $app_path
        rm $app_path
    fi
    echo &#39;Press any key to exit.&#39;
    read -s -n 1

Imagine that I opened the file a.cpp in mcedit.
Then I pressed alt+` and switched to panel.
Then I selected (or even opened in mcedit) the file b.cpp.
Then I pressed alt+` and switched to mcedit with a.cpp.
Then I executed the &#34;Run&#34; item from user menu.
And... The b.cpp will be compiled and run. This is wrong! Why b.cpp???
I executed &#34;Run&#34; from a.cpp!

I propose you to do the new macros for mcedit.

%opened_file
- the file name that is opened in current instance of mcedit.

%opened_file_full_path
- as %opened_file but full path to that file.

I think that %opened_file may be not safe because the current
directory may be changed in mc panel. So it is better to use
%opened_file_full_path.

%opened_file_dir
- full path to directory where %opened_file is.

%save
- save opened file before executing the menu commands. May be useful
in some cases. For example I don&#39;t want to press F2 every time before
run changed code.

Thanks for the mc.
Best regards, Sergiy Vovk.

     1) command line option -K &lt;keymap&gt; or --keymap=&lt;keymap&gt;
     2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP
     3) Parameter keymap in section [Midnight-Commander] of config file.

    <p>The problem</p>

    <p>I&#39;m using tmux and I want MC to open files for editing in another tmux window, so that I can
    keep browsing files while editing.</p>

    <p>What I&#39;ve tried</p>

    <p>MC checks if EDITOR variable is set and then interprets it as a program for editing, so if I
    do <code>export EDITOR=vim</code> then MC will use vim to open files.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve tried to build on that:</p>
    <pre>function foo () { tmux new-window &#34;vim $1&#34;; }
export EDITOR=foo
</pre>

    <p>If I do <code>$EDITOR some_file</code> then I get the file open in vim in another tmux
    windows - exactly what I wanted.</p>

    <p>Sadly, when I try to edit in MC it goes blank for a second and then returns to normal MC
    window. MC doesn&#39;t seem to keep any logs and I don&#39;t get any error message.</p>

    <p>The question(s)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do you know what I&#39;m doing wrong?</li>

      <li>Do you have a usable workaround for what I want?</li>

      <li>Should I create a feature request/bug for MC?</li>

    You are defining a shell function, which is unknown for <code>mc</code> when it is trying to
    start the editor.

    <p>The correct way is to create a bash script, not a function. Then set <code>EDITOR</code>
    value to it, for example:</p>
    <pre>$ cat ~/myEditor.sh
#!/bin/sh
tmux new-window &#34;vim $1&#34;

export EDITOR=~/myEditor.sh

    <p>Midnight Commander does <a target="_blank" href="https://midnight-commander.org/ticket/3072">not support</a> a trash can by default. <q>Using
    libtrash</q></p>

    <p>Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libtrash/">libtrash</a> <sup><small>AUR</small></sup>
    package, and create an <i>mc</i> alias in the initialization file of your shell (e.g.,
    <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> ):</p>
    <pre>alias mc=&#39;LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtrash.so.3.3 mc&#39;
</pre>

    <p>To apply the changes, reopen your shell session or <code>source</code> the shell
    initialization file.</p>

    <p>Default settings are defined in <code>/etc/libtrash.conf.sys</code> . You can overwrite
    these settings per-user in <code>~/.libtrash</code> , for example:</p>
    <pre>TRASH_CAN = .Trash
INTERCEPT_RENAME = NO
IGNORE_EXTENSIONS= o;exe;com
UNCOVER_DIRS=/dev
</pre>

    <p>Now files deleted by Midnight Commander (launched with <i>mc</i> ) will be moved to the
    <code>~/.Trash</code> directory.</p>Warning:

    <ul>
      <li>Applications launched from <i>mc</i> inherit <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> , which may cause
      problems with some applications. <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~marriaga/software/libtrash/">[1]</a></li>

      <li>With <code>GLOBAL_PROTECTION = YES</code> set (default), files deleted outside the home
      directory are moved to the trash, even if they are on a different partition. Depending on the
      file, this may cause a significant delay.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>In Midnight Commander, is it possible to exclude some directories/patterns/... when doing search? ( <code>M-?</code> ) I&#39;m specifically 
   interested in skipping the <code>.hg</code> subdirectory.</p>
   <hr/><q>Answers 1</q>
   <hr/>In the &#34;[Misc]&#34; section of your ~/.mc/ini file, you can specify the directories you wish to skip in the &#34;find_ignore_dirs&#34; setting.

   <p>To specify multiple directories, use a colon (&#34;:&#34;) as the delimiter.</p>

    <p>I recently installed openSUSE 13.1 and set up the <code>mc</code> in typical why by aliasing
    mc with <code>mc-wrapper.sh</code> to have it exit into the last working directory in
    <code>mc</code> instance. However this does not seem to be working. I tried to debug the
    <code>mc-wrapper.sh</code> script - the <code>echo</code> commands.</p>
    <pre>MC_USER=`id | sed &#39;s/[^(]*(//;s/).*//&#39;`
MC_PWD_FILE=&#34;${TMPDIR-/tmp}/mc-$MC_USER/mc.pwd.$$&#34;
/usr/bin/mc -P &#34;$MC_PWD_FILE&#34; &#34;$@&#34;

if test -r &#34;$MC_PWD_FILE&#34;; then
        MC_PWD=&#34;`cat &#34;$MC_PWD_FILE&#34;`&#34;
        if test -n &#34;$MC_PWD&#34; &amp;&amp; test -d &#34;$MC_PWD&#34;; then
                echo &#34;will cd in : $MC_PWD&#34;
                cd $MC_PWD
                echo $(pwd)
        fi
        unset MC_PWD
fi

rm -f &#34;$MC_PWD_FILE&#34;
unset MC_PWD_FILE
echo $(pwd)
</pre>

    <p>To my surprise, <code>mc-wrapper-sh</code> does change the directory and is in the directory
    before exiting but back in bash prompt the working directory is the one from which the script
    was invoked.</p>

    <p>Can it be that some bash settings is required for this to work?</p><b>Tags :</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queryxchange.com/t/linux-2/">linux</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queryxchange.com/t/bash-2/">bash</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queryxchange.com/t/shell-2/">shell</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queryxchange.com/t/midnight-commander-2/">midnight-commander</a>

      That turned out to be simpler as one might think. <em>MC_HOME variable can be set to alternative

      <p>and the alternative way:</p>

      <p>Use case of this feature:</p>

      <p>You have to share the same user name on remote server (access can be distinguished by rsa

      If you mean, you want to be able to run two instances of mc as the same user <em>at the same
      time</em> with different config directories, as far as I can tell you can&#39;t. The path is
      hardcoded.

      <p>However, if you mean, you want to be able to switch which config directory is being used,
      here&#39;s an idea (tested, works). You probably want to do it without mc running:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a directory <code>$HOME/mc_conf</code> , with a subdirectory, <code>one</code>
        .</li>

        <li>Move the contents of <code>$HOME/.config/mc</code> into the
        <code>$HOME/mc_conf/one</code> subdirectory</li>

        <li>Duplicate the <code>one</code> directory as <code>$HOME/mc_conf/two</code> .</li>

        <li>Create a script, <code>$HOME/bin/switch_mc</code> :
          <pre>#!/bin/bash

configBase=$HOME/mc_conf
linkPath=$HOME/.config/mc

if [ -z $1 ] || [ ! -e &#34;$configBase/$1&#34; ]; then
    echo &#34;Valid subdirecory name required.&#34;
    exit 1
fi

killall mc
rm $linkPath
ln -sv $configBase/$1 $linkPath
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Run this, <code>switch_mc one</code> . <code>rm</code> will bark about no such file,
        that doesn&#39;t matter.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully it&#39;s clear what&#39;s happening there -- this sets a the config directory path as a
      symlink. Whatever configuration changes you now make and save will be int the
      <code>one</code> directory. You can then exit and <code>switch_mc two</code> , reverting to
      the old config, then start mc again, make changes and save them, etc.</p>

      <p>You could get away with removing the <code>killall mc</code> and playing around; the
      configuration stuff is in the <code>ini</code> file, which is read at start-up (so you can&#39;t
      switch on the fly this way). It&#39;s then not touched until exit unless you &#34;Save setup&#34;, but at
      exit it may be overwritten, so the danger here is that you erase something you did earlier or
      outside of the running instance.</p>

      that works indeed, your idea is pretty clear, thank you for your time However my idea was to
      be able run differently configured mc&#39;s under the same account not interfering each other. I
      should have specified that in my question. The path to config dir is in fact hardcoded, but
      it is hardcoded RELATIVELY to user&#39;s home dir, that is the value of $HOME, thus changing it before mc start DOES change the config dir location - I&#39;ve checked that. the drawback is
      $HOME stays changed as long as mc runs, which could be resolved if mc had a kind of startup

 <code>mc</code>
    / <code>mcedit</code> has a config option called <code>auto_save_setup</code> which is enabled
    by default. This option automatically saves your current setup upon exiting. The problem occurs
    when you try to edit <code>~/.config/mc/ini</code> using <code>mcedit</code> . It will
    overwrite whatever changes you made upon exiting, so you must edit the
    <code>~/.config/mc/ini</code> using a different editor such as <code>nano</code> .

    <p>at the bottom (top, if ineffective) of your ~/.bashrc file. Thus you can load skins as

    <pre>mc -S sand256.ini</pre>

    <p>In</p>

    <p>have the lines:</p>
    <pre>[Midnight-Commander]
skin=sand256</pre>

    <p>for preset skin. Newer mc version offer to choose a preset skin from within the menu and
    save it in the above ini file, relieving you of the above manual step.</p>

    <p>Many people don&#39;t know that mc has a multi-window text-editor built-in (eerily disabled by
    default) with macro capability and all sorts of goodies. run</p>
    <pre>mc -e my.txt</pre>

    <p>to edit directly.</p>

    <p>Be aware that many skins break the special characters for sorting filenames reverse up/down
    unless one works hard with locale parameters and what not. Few people in the world know how to
    do that properly. In below screenshot you see &#34;arrowdown n&#34; over the filename list to indicate
    sort order. In many xterm, you will get ??? instead so you might resort to unskin and go to
    &#34;default skin&#34; setting with ugly colours.</p>

    <p>The below CTRL-O hotkey starts what mc calls a subshell. If you run mc a second time in a
    &#34;subshell&#34;, mc will not remind you of the CTRL-O hotkey (as if the world only knows 3 hotkeys)
    but will start mc with no deeper &#34;subshell&#34; iteration possible, unless one modifies the
    sources.</p>

        <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to see the other skin choices</li>

        <li>Cursor to the skin you want and select it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>

    <p>Something I discovered which I REALLY appreciated was the hide/view of hidden files can be
    toggled by pressing ALT-. (ALT-PERIOD). Be aware that often the RIGHT ALT key is NOT seen as an
    ALT key by the system, so you usually need to use Left-ALT-. to toggle this. I forgot about the
    Right-ALT weirdness and thought I&#39;d broken mc one day. {sigh} Such a blonde...</p>

    <p>Just checked (xev!), I guess the ALT-. toggle is mapped to ALT_L-., and the right ALT key
    gives an ALT_R keycode... which doesn&#39;t match the mc mapping, causing it to not work... now I
    know why! Hooray!</p>

 1) If the panels are active and I issue a command that has a lot of
    output, it appears to be lost forever.

    <p>i.e., if the panels are visible and I cat something (i.e., cat /proc/cpuinfo), that info is
    gone forever once the panels get redrawn.</p>

    <p>If you use Cygwin&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="http://mintty.googlecode.com/">mintty</a>
    terminal, you can use its <em>Flip Screen</em> context menu command (or Alt+F12 shortcut) to
    switch between the so-called alternate screen, where fullscreen applications like <em>mc</em>
    normally run, and the primary screen where output from commands such as <em>cat</em>
    appears.</p>

<h6>May 20, 2018 |  <a target="_blank" href="http://bogdan.org.ua/2015/12/03/midnight-commander-mc-convenient-hard-links-creation-from-user-menu.html"> bogdan.org.ua</a></h6>
 

    <p>3rd December 2015</p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.midnight-commander.org/">Midnight
    Commander</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">convenient two-panel file manager</a> with
    tons of features.

    <p>You can create hard links and symbolic links using C-x l and C-x s keyboard shortcuts.
    However, these two shortcuts invoke two completely different dialogs.</p>

    <p>While for C-x s you get 2 pre-populated fields (path to the existing file, and path to the
    link â€“ which is pre-populated with your opposite file panel path plus the name of the
    file under cursor; simply try it to see what I mean), for C-x l you only get 1 empty field:
    path of the hard link to create for a file under cursor. Symlink&#39;s behaviour would be much more
    convenient</p>

    <p>Fortunately, a good man called <em>Wiseman1024</em> created a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.midnight-commander.org/ticket/2092">feature request in the MC&#39;s bug tracker</a> 6
    years ago. Not only had he done so, but he had also uploaded a sample <a target="_blank" href="https://www.midnight-commander.org/attachment/ticket/2092/mc.menu.hardlink-example">mc user
    menu script</a> ( <a target="_blank" href="http://bogdan.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mc.menu_.hardlink.txt">local copy</a> ), which
    works wonderfully! You can select multiple files, then F2 l (lower-case L), and hard-links to
    your selected files (or a file under cursor) will be created in the opposite file panel. Great,
    thank you <em>Wiseman1024</em> !</p>

    <p>Word of warning: you must know what <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hard links</a> are and what their limitations are
    before using this menu script. You also must check and understand the user menu code before
    adding it to your mc (by F9 C m u , and then pasting the script from the file).</p>

    <p>Word of hope: 4 years ago Wiseman&#39;s feature request was assigned to <em>Future Releases</em>
    version, so a more convenient C-x l will (sooner or later) become the part of mc.
    Hopefully.</p>

    <p>3rd February 2017</p>If you ever need to select lots (hundreds, thousands) of files by their

        <li>add new command like a &#34;find . -type f \( -newer /tmp/.date1 \) -print&#34;</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I&#39;ve used a slightly different approach, specifying desired date right in the command line
    of External Panelize:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>enter your directory with many files</li>

        <li>press <code>C-x !</code> (External Panelize)</li>

        <li>add a command like <code>find . -type f -newermt &#34;2017-02-01 23:55:00&#34; -print</code> (
        <code>man find</code> for more details)</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In both cases, the created panel will only have files matching your search condition.</p>

   <p><b>FTP browsing</b></p>

   <p>This is file browsing on remote FTP server just as it is on your computer.
                     </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Press <b>F9</b> to select drop down menus on the top of the screen.  
                        </li>

      <li>Press <b>Alt + L</b> if you want to use left side panel, or <b>Alt + R</b> 
                        for right panel. </li>

      <li>Press <b>Alt + P</b> for input box where you have enter server name. Enter for instance  </li>
   </ol>

   <pre>ftp.gwdg.de/pub
</pre>

   <p>and press <b>Enter</b>. </p>

   <p>Now <b>mc</b> will try anonymous connection to remote machine. If machine responds, you&#39;ll get 
   directory listing of /pub on remote server. </p>

   <p>It is possible to do the same from <b>mc</b> command line by typing: </p>

   <pre>cd /#ftp:ftp.gwdg.de/pub 
</pre>

   <p><b>Archive browsing</b></p>

   <p>Archive in classic meaning is compressed file. In Linux you can recognize them by suffix like: </p>

   <pre>tgz, tar.gz, tbz, tar.bz2</pre>

   <p>and many more, but above few are the most used </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>That&#39;s it. Midnight Commander will decompress file for you and present it&#39;s internal structure 
   like any other directory. If you want to extract one or all files from archive mark what you want 
   toextract and use <b>F5</b> to copy in another panel. Done. </p>

   <p><b>RPM browsing</b></p>

   <p>The package installation files for any SUSE are
                     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=RPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">
   RPM</a> and 
   <b>mc</b> will let you browse them. </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>You&#39;ll see few files: </p>

   <pre>/INFO
CONTENTS.cpio
HEADER
*INSTALL
*UPGRADE
</pre>

   <p>Browse to see details of your RPM. </p>

   <p>The <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> is actual archive with files, and if you want to see within: </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>(You know the drill) </p>

   <p>The *INSTALL and *UPGRADE will do what the name tells, but if you want only to extract one or 
   more files from <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> than use <b>F5</b> to copy them in the directory in the 
   other panel. </p>

   <p><b>PuTTY and line drawing</b></p>

   <p>PuTTY is terminal application used to access remote computers running Linux via ssh (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:SSH_tunnels_from_Microsoft_Windows">SSH 
   tunnels from Microsoft Windows</a> see details). The line drawing in Midnight Commander, YaST and 
   another applications that draw lines using special characters can be displayed wrong as something 
   else. The solution is to change settings: </p>
   <ul>

      <li>menu: Window &gt; Translation: 
                        <ul>

                           <li>Received data assumed to be in which character set: UTF-8 </li>

                           </li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul>

   <p>If that doesn&#39;t help, you may set this too: </p>

   <p><b>Use Midnight Commander like a pro</b> </p>
   <article>

   <p>If you&#39;ve used an <code>*nix</code> system, at some point you&#39;ve stumbled upon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">Midnight 
   Commander</a>, a file manager based on the venerable Norton Commander. You&#39;re probably familiar with the basic operations (<code>F5</code> 
   for copying, <code>F6</code> for moving, <code>F8</code> for deleting, etc.) and how to switch panels (ummm, the <code>Tab</code> 
   key). But <code>mc</code> offers so much more than that. This article aims to show all the useful (YMMV) shortcuts and functionalities 
   that are often overlooked. Most of them can be accessed using the menu (<code>F9</code>), but who has the time to do that?</p>

   <p>Before we get started, let&#39;s establish some facts. This article was written and tested on the following software:</p>
   <ul>

      <li>Midnight Commander 4.8.13</li>

      <li>GNU bash 4.2.53</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Oh, and make sure you&#39;re running a modern and UTF-8 friendly terminal - for example, rxvt-unicode.</p>
   <b>Hold your horses</b>

   <p>There&#39;s actually one thing I&#39;d recommend doing before you run <code>mc</code>. <code>mc</code> has the ability to exit to its 
   current directory. Meaning, you can navigate the filesystem using <code>mc</code> (sometimes it&#39;s easier than <code>cp</code>ing 
   into that one directory buried deep down <em>somewhere</em>) and when you quit <code>mc</code> (<code>F10</code>), your shell will 
   automagically <code>cd</code> to that directory. This is done thanks to the <code>mc-wrapper</code> script that should be bundled 
   with your installation of <code>mc</code>. The exact location is dependent on your distribution - in mine (Gentoo) it&#39;s <code>/usr/libexec/mc/</code>, 
   in Ubuntu supposedly it&#39;s in <code>/usr/share/mc/bin/</code>. Once found, modify your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

   <pre><code>alias mc=&#39;. /usr/libexec/mc/mc-wrapper.sh&#39;</code></pre>

   <p>Restart your shell, launch <code>mc</code>, change to another directory, exit and your shell should be set to that new directory.</p>
   <b>Selecting files</b>
   <ul>

      <li><code>Insert</code> (<code>Ctrl + t</code> alternatively) - select files (for example, for copying, moving or deleting).</li>

      <li><code>+</code> - select files based on a pattern.</li>

      <li><code>\</code> -<em>un</em>select files based on a pattern.</li>

      <li><code>*</code> - reverse selection. If nothing was selected, all files will get selected.</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Accessing the shell</b>
   <ul>

      <li>There&#39;s a shell awaiting your command at the bottom of the screen - just start typing (when no other command dialog is open, 
      of course).</li>

      <li>Since <code>Tab</code> is bound to switching panels (or moving the focus in dialogs), you have to use <code>Esc Tab</code> 
      to use autocompletion. Hit it twice to get all the possible completions (just like in a shell). This works in dialogs too.</li>

      <li>If you want inspect the output of the command, do some input or just prefer a bigger console, no need to quit <code>mc</code>. 
      Just hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> - the effect will be similar to putting <code>mc</code> in the background but with a nice perk. 
      Your current working directory from <code>mc</code> will be passed on to the shell… and vice versa! Hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> 
      again to return to <code>mc</code>.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + Enter</code> or <code>Alt + Enter</code> - copy the currently selected file&#39;s name to the shell.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</code> - same as above, but the full path is copied.</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Internal viewer (<code>F3</code>) and editor (<code>F4</code>)</b>
   <ul>

      <li>The internal viewer has many built in modes for &#34;previewing&#34; the content of the file. Try &#34;viewing&#34; a binary, an archive, 
      a DOC document or an image. In some cases, external programs are needed in order for this &#34;previewing&#34; to work.</li>

      <li>If you want to preview the &#34;raw&#34; contents of the file, hit <code>Shift + F3</code>.</li>

      <li>While the internal viewer and editor are powerful, sometimes you want to use your preferred software (<em>cough</em>vim<em>cough</em>). 
      You can do so by setting the <code>PAGER</code> (for viewer) and <code>EDITOR</code> (for editor) variables (for example, in your
      <code>~/.bashrc</code> file). Then toggle the <code>Options -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Use interal edit/view</code> option (access the 
      top menu by pressing <code>F9</code>).</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Panels</b>
   <ul>

      <li><code>Alt + ,</code> - switch <code>mc</code>&#39;s layout from left-right to top-bottom. Mind = blown. Useful for operating on 
      files with long names.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + t</code> - switch the panel&#39;s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long, user-defined. &#34;long&#34; is especially 
      useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + i</code> - synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show the current directory in the other 
      panel.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + u</code> - swap panels.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + o</code> - if the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and move the 
      selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and 
      moves the selection to the next file. This is useful for quick checking the contents of a list of directories.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + PgUp</code> (or just left arrow, if you&#39;ve enabled <code>Lynx-like motion</code>, see later) - move to the parent 
      directory.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + Shift + h</code> - show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate than going back one entry at a time.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + y</code> - move to the previous directory in history.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + u</code> - move to the next directory in history.</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Searching files</b>
   <ul>

      <li><code>Alt + ?</code> - shows the full Find dialog.</li>

      <li><code>Alt + s</code> or <code>Ctrl + s</code> - quick search mode. Start typing and the selection will move to the first matching 
      file. Press the shortcut again to jump to another match. Use wildcards (<code>*</code>, <code>?</code>) for easier matching.</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Common actions</b>
   <ul>

      <li><code>Ctrl + Space</code> - calculate the size of the selected directories. Press this shortcut when the selection is on
      <code>..</code> to calculate the size of all the directories in the current directory.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x s</code> (that is press <code>Ctrl + x</code>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU">let it 
      go</a> and then press <code>s</code>) - create a symbolic link (change <code>s</code> to <code>l</code> for a hardlink). I find 
      it very useful and intuitive - the link will, of course, be created in the other panel. You can change it&#39;s destination and name, 
      like with any other file operation.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x c</code> - open the <code>chmod</code> dialog.</li>

      <li><code>Ctrl + x o</code> - open the <code>chown</code> dialog.</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Virtual File System (VFS)</b>

   <p><code>mc</code> has a concept known as Virtual File System. Try &#34;entering&#34; an archive (<code>*.tar.gz</code>, <code>*.rpm</code> 
   or even <code>*.jar</code>) - you&#39;ll be able to browse the contents of the archive like a normal folder, without unpacking it first. 
   You extract selected files from the archive by just copying them to the other panel. Bonus points: try &#34;entering&#34; a… <code>*.patch</code> 
   file.</p>

   <p>This concept is even more powerful when you realize that remote locations can be viewed the same way. A quick way to browse an 
   FTP location is to just <code>cd</code> to it: <code>cd ftp://mirrors.tera-byte.com/pub/gentoo</code> (first Gentoo FTP mirror I 
   found). You&#39;ll be able to interact with files as you normally do. To exit this remote location, <code>cd</code> to a local directory. 
   Just typing <code>cd</code> will suffice as it will take you to your home directory.</p>

   <p>VFS works for SFTP and Samba shares too. Check the manpages for more information on how to specify user/pass, etc.</p>
   <b>Useful options</b>
   <ul>

      <li><strong>Configuration</strong>
      <ul>

         <li><code>Verbose operation</code> and <code>Compute totals</code> - so that operations like copy/move have a more detailed 
         progress dialogs.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Layout</strong>
      <ul>

         <li><code>Equal split</code> - uncheck to define your own ratio for panels. Maybe you prefer one panel bigger than the other? 
         Useful especially if you keep one of the panels in tree mode (or maybe info/quick view, too).</li>

         <li>Uncheck <code>Hintbar visible</code> - one more line available, one less line of noise.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Panel options</strong>
      <ul>

         <li><code>Show backup files</code> and <code>Show hidden files</code> - I keep both enabled, as I often work with configuration 
         files, etc.</li>

         <li><code>Lynx-like motion</code> - mentioned above, makes left arrow go to parent directory, while the right arrow enters 
         the directory under selection. Faster than <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, etc. 
         This options is quite smart, that is if the shell command line is not empty, the arrows work as usual and allow moving the 
         cursor in the command line.</li>

         <li><code>File highlight</code> -&gt; <code>File types</code> is useful, as it uses a different color for example for executable 
         files. <code>Permissions</code>, for me, is not that useful, but I can definitely see it&#39;s use, for example, for sysadmins.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li>... ... ... </li>
   </ul>
   <b>Bonus assignments</b>
   <ul>

      <li>Define your own listing mode (<code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Listing mode...</code> -&gt; <code>User defined</code>). Hit
      <code>F1</code> to see available columns and options.</li>

      <li>Play around in tree mode: <code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Tree</code> or <code>Command</code> -&gt; <code>Directory tree</code>.</li>

      <li>Compare directories (<code>Ctrl + x d</code>)</li>

      <li>Fill up the directory hotlist (<code>Ctrl + \</code>)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Well, that was a lot to take in. Of course, this list is not complete (that&#39;s what <code>man mc</code> is there for), but I&#39;ve 
   selected the commands and functionalities that are the most useful to <em>me</em>. Embrace the ones you find useful, forget the rest 
   and learn about the other ones I&#39;ve missed!</p></article>

   Using the mouse

   <p>Although Midnight Commander is a text mode application it can make use of mouse. The openSUSE delivered <b>mc</b> will make use 
   of the mouse when used with a GUI <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:What_is_a_console">console</a>, without any 
   further configuration needed. </p>

   <p>The text mode <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/Terminal">terminal</a> that we get when booting in
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=Runlevels&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">runlevels</a> 2 or 3 is a bit different 
   story. You have to install the package
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=GPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">gpm</a> (&#34;general purpose mouse&#34;) which 
   is also called <b>mouse server</b>. The gpm is used in Linux to receive movements and clicks from mouse. Start gpm and then start 
   Midnight commander. </p>

   <p>If you come to the text terminal using Ctrl + Alt + F1, then
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=GPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">gpm</a> will not work as another driver 
   that belongs to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/GUI">GUI</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=X_Server&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">X 
   Server</a>) claims control over the mouse. </p>

   <p>... ... ...</p>

   <p><b>FTP browsing</b></p>

   <p>This is file browsing on remote FTP server just as it is on your computer. </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Press <b>F9</b> to select drop down menus on the top of the screen. </li>

      <li>Press <b>Alt + L</b> if you want to use left side panel, or <b>Alt + R</b> for right panel. </li>

      <li>Press <b>Alt + P</b> for input box where you have enter server name. Enter for instance </li>
   </ol>

   <pre>ftp.gwdg.de/pub</pre>

   <p>and press <b>Enter</b>. </p>

   <p>Now <b>mc</b> will try anonymous connection to remote machine. If machine responds, you&#39;ll get directory listing of /pub on remote 
   server. </p>

   <p>It is possible to do the same from <b>mc</b> command line by typing: </p>

   <pre>cd /#ftp:ftp.gwdg.de/pub</pre>

   <p>Happy browsing. </p>

   <p><b>Archive browsing</b></p>

   <p>Archive in classic meaning is compressed file. In Linux you can recognize them by suffix like: </p>

   <pre>tgz, tar.gz, tbz, tar.bz2</pre>

   <p>and many more, but above few are the most used </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>That&#39;s it. Midnight Commander will decompress file for you and present it&#39;s internal structure like any other directory. If you 
   want to extract one or all files from archive mark what you want toextract and use <b>F5</b> to copy in another panel. Done. </p>

   <p><b>RPM browsing</b></p>

   <p>The package installation files for any SUSE are
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=RPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">RPM</a> and <b>mc</b> will let you browse 
   them. </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>You&#39;ll see few files: </p>

   <pre>/INFO
CONTENTS.cpio
HEADER
*INSTALL
*UPGRADE
</pre>

   <p>Browse to see details of your RPM. </p>

   <p>The <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> is actual archive with files, and if you want to see within: </p>
   <ol>

      <li>Highlight the file </li>

      <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
   </ol>

   <p>(You know the drill) </p>

   <p>The *INSTALL and *UPGRADE will do what the name tells, but if you want only to extract one or more files from <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> 
   than use <b>F5</b> to copy them in the directory in the other panel. </p>

   <p><b>PuTTY and line drawing</b></p>

   <p>PuTTY is terminal application used to access remote computers running Linux via ssh (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:SSH_tunnels_from_Microsoft_Windows">SSH 
   tunnels from Microsoft Windows</a> see details). The line drawing in Midnight Commander, YaST and another applications that draw 
   lines using special characters can be displayed wrong as something else. The solution is to change settings: </p>
   <ul>

      <li>menu: Window &gt; Translation:
      <ul>

         <li>Received data assumed to be in which character set: UTF-8 </li>

         <li>Handling of line drawing characters: Use Unicode for line drawing </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>

   <p>If that doesn&#39;t help, you may set this too: </p>
   <ul>

      <li>menu: Connection &gt; Connection-type string: linux </li>

<h4>[Mar 14, 2016] <a href="https://otee.dev/2022/01/25/mcedit.shtml">Macros in McEdit</a></h4>

<pre wrap="">To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the keystrokes you want to be executed..
Press Ctrl-R again when finished..
You can then assign the macro to any key you..
        like by pressing that key..
The macro is executed  by: Ctrl-A and then the assigned key.
===========
The simple example is to delete all &#34;=&#34; [from current cursor - forward].
The &lt;F4&gt;=&lt;Replace&gt; function of mcedit is the basis of the macro.
So:
Ctrl-r
 &lt;f4&gt; = &lt;ca. 9 tabs&gt; o l &lt;enter&gt;
 &lt;must key to remove prompt which Falsely announces &#39;5 replacemnets made&#39;&gt;

   <p><em>My other tip:</em> <tt>ALT+S</tt> or <tt>CTRL+S</tt> <em>for file searching.</em> </p>

   <p>Allows searching for names - with wildcards: Example: CTRL+S then sy jumps to first file starting with sy CTRL+S then *sy jumps 
   to first file containing sy </p>

   <p><em>Further presses of CTRL+S jump to next matching file</em> </p>

   <p>If your keyboard or terminal does not have function keys: ESC [num] does equivalent of F[num] Example: to exit mc hit ESC then

      <p><em>Navigate to Options/Panel options and there (on the top right) at Navigation tick &#34;Lynx-like motion&#34;. </em></p>

      <p>What this does it activates the navigation within mc with the four arrow keys (up and down the tree, left is out of and right

I type &#34;vim file&#34; and hit enter. After that F4 will edit it if

Hello,
I&#39;m no expert but i would say this depends on the file which is compressed.
First of all you need xz-utils installed.

I can&#39;t open an xz compressed dd image in mc BUT
I can open an xz compressed text file in mc.

In /etc/mc or in ~/.config/mc is an mc.ext file which define the file
extensions handled by mc.

I hope that would help you.

Best regards,
Basti

      Try the shell command &#39;tty&#39;. In the Linux console it will reply e.g. /dev/tty1. In a graphic terminal the reply will be /dev/pts/0.

   <p>All shortcuts are noted in the menus. In mc&#39;s keyboard shortcut notation, &#39;C-x i&#39; would mean press Ctrl and x simultaneously, 
   release both then press i. M refers to the Alt key. A few common shortcuts:</p>

   <p>• Ctrl R - refresh or rescan directory view</p>

   <p><b>The command line</b></p>

   <p>Although I don&#39;t use the command line much in mc, it should execute whatever you have typed into it. If you wish to su, it will 
   return you to the terminal to type in your password. Then relaunch mc as root; if you ctl-o, it will take you back as user.
</p><p>
   While anything remains typed into the command line, the sideways arrow keys move through the text and won&#39;t work to navigate in the 
   panels. If your arrow keys suddenly don&#39;t work, check and clear the command line.
</p><p>
   To scroll back and forth through command history, use alt - p for previous and alt - n for next command instead of the the up and 
   down arrow keys (as in the terminal window), since mc uses them for navigating. </p>

   <pre wrap="">Hello.
Does anyone know how to hide the second panel in one keyboard hot key?

Currently, we may do this by pressing &lt;M-t&gt; three times and manually set
user_format (from &#34;panels.ini&#34;) from
user_format=full name type size:4
to
user_format=half name type size:4
and vice versa.

Thanks.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre wrap="">I don&#39;t know of a way, but ALT-T seems to cycle through the Listing Modes:

Full File List
Brief File List
Long File List &lt;-- this one is single panel
User Defined

This begs a question:

In my panels.ini I have this:

...
list_mode=user
user_format=name|size
user_status0=half type,name,|,size,|,perm
user_status1=half type,name,|,size,|,perm
user_status2=half type,name,|,size,|,perm
user_status3=name
user_status4=half type,name,|,size,|,perm
user_mini_status=1
...

What are these user_status[0-4] lines for? Apparently user_status3 is the format of the user_mini_status, but what are the others for? I can change them, but they don&#39;t seem to do anything.

I have a guess that they have something to do with this:

static const char *
panel_format (WPanel * panel)
{
    switch (panel-&gt;list_type)
    {
    case list_long:
        return &#34;full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name&#34;;

    case list_brief:
        return &#34;half 2 type name&#34;;

    case list_user:
        return panel-&gt;user_format;

    default:
    case list_full:
        return &#34;half type name | size | mtime&#34;;
    }
}

Perhaps sometime in the misty past, the user was allowed to define these himself, instead of being hard-coded. Come to think of it, that would be a nice feature.</pre>

   <pre>When you run shell script, you run new shell which is child process of MC.
When you do cd in the script, you change working directory of that child
shell. Working directory of parent is unchanged. You unable to change working
directory of parent from child.

You have to use the &#34;source&#34; built-in shell command to run script in current
process context. This allows you change current directory from script.</pre>

   <pre>hardlinks? You can&#39;t count amount of symlinks to a file without
probing every file on your filesystem to be a symlink on requested file.

Hardlinks to a new dir come from 2 nodes:

&#39;stat -c%h /path/to/dir&#39; should show the same value.

   you do not have to use all the fancy file picking mechanizms, if you want to stay simple you can use insert and possibly +

   note that while what I describe is somewhat complicated you can use it in very simple form, in that case it&#39;s basically the same

   panel&#39;s directory as default but you can start typing your own destination right away so it doesn&#39;t slow you down at all, it even 
   provides auto-completion (meta-tab).
</p><p>
   key bindings: list definitely does NOT provide expected key bindings, specially the linux version. the dos version - perhaps and 
   if you like those then that&#39;s a valid point against mc. still - you cannot change</p><p>
   the knife analogy is not a valid one in this case. the extra functionality of mc does not come at significant cost - the only difference 
   is that the program is bigger, it does not have almost any</p><p>
   ...</p><p>
   ...</p><p>
   &gt;<i> catches me almost every time. The second confirm/edit/etc step<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> under mc when doing a tagged file operation is something I&#39;ve never<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> wanted (or used) and would really like to never see.<br/>
   </i></p><p>
   &gt;<i> ObNote: I&#39;d also much prefer it if mc left me in the directory it<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> was viewing when I exited, rather than the directory I started it<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> from.<br/>
   </i></p><p>
   however, there&#39;s a sort of solution for this, here&#39;s a relevant quote</p><p>
   -P At program end, the Midnight Commander will print</p><p>
   0.020u 0.000s 0:00.10 20.0% 0+0k 0+0io 388pf+0w</p><p>
   I compiled the list (crowe&#39;s version for linux) and above are the</p><p>
   btw on your computer it says that real time was 0.469s while the sum</p><p>
   &gt;<i> No promises on not having a slow finger, tho I tried not to.<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> <br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> &gt; you can even run it with command line, it&#39;s not some internal<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> &gt; funky CLI, it&#39;s your login shell, basically unchanged, you just<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> &gt; hit ctrl-o to make panels disappear (but you _don&#39;t_ _have_ to use<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> &gt; this feature, you can just quit mc or use ctrl-z)<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> <br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> I like the bash command line and want it to be my default CLI UI.<br/>
   </i></p><p>
   &gt;<i> Nothing else, just bash as configured by my .bashrc, under an xterm<br/>

   </i>&gt;<i> that and would like to stay with it, augmenting it only in the areas<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> mentioned, not replacing or changing large chunks of it.<br/>
   </i></p><p>
   &gt;<i> &gt; also: menu bar, command line, status line, hint line can all be<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> &gt; turned off so you&#39;re left with panel(s) only.<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> <br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> I&#39;d rather (almost always) have visible the bottom end of scrollback<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> (usually the last 20 or 100 lines depending on window size, with a<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> further 5K lines available under PgUp/PgDn)). That I find useful<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> and use dozens of times a day. The vast majority of the time I<br/>
   </i>&gt;<i> don&#39;t have a use for the panes.<br/>
   </i></p><p>
   ctrl-o has an advantage of keeping the directories of shell and mc in</p><p>

   <p><b>Using the mouse </b></p>

   <p>Although Midnight Commander is a text mode application it can make use of mouse. The openSUSE delivered <b>mc</b> will make use 
   of the mouse when used with a GUI <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:What_is_a_console">console</a>, without any 
   further configuration needed. </p>

   <p>The text mode <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Terminal">terminal</a> that we get when booting in
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=Runlevels&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">runlevels</a> 2 or 3 is a bit different 
   story. You have to install the package <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=GPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">
   gpm</a> (&#34;general purpose mouse&#34;) which is also called <b>mouse server</b>. The gpm is used in Linux to receive movements and clicks 
   from mouse. Start gpm and then start Midnight commander. </p>

   <p>If you come to the text terminal using Ctrl + Alt + F1, then
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=GPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">gpm</a> will not work as another driver 
   that belongs to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GUI">GUI</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=X_Server&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">X 
   Server</a>) claims control over the mouse. </p>

   <p><b>Lynx like motion</b></p>

   <p>This is browsing using the cursor keys. You have never seen graphical applications (like Konqueror) run this fast through directories.
   </p>

   <p><b>openSUSE 11.4 and later</b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>Main difference to older versions of Midnight Commander is different menu, so now we need <b>Panel options</b> instead of
      <b>Configuration</b>. </p>

      <p>To enable it </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Press <b>F9</b> to select drop down menus on the top of the screen. </li>

         <li>Press <b>Alt + o</b> or move highlight with cursor keys for left or right to the Options, then press arrow down, to get 
         drop down menu with options. </li>

         <li>Press arrow down to select <b>Panel options</b> and <b>Enter</b> key to open window with setup </li>

         <li>Press arrow down until you have selected <b>[ ] Lynx-like motion</b>, or , or <b>ALT + y</b> to jump directly. </li>

         <li>Press <b>Space</b> to check option. It will show <b>[x] Lynx-like motion</b> if it is active (enabled) </li>

         <li>Press <b>Alt + s</b> or move highlight to the <b>[ Save ]</b> and press <b>Enter</b> to save setting. </li>

   <p><b>openSUSE 11.3 and earlier</b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>To enable it </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Press <b>F9</b> to select drop down menus on the top of the screen. </li>

         <li>Press <b>Alt + o</b> or move highlight with cursor keys for left or right to the Options, then press arrow down, to get

         <li>Press <b>Alt + c</b> or <b>Enter</b> to get dialog window <b>Configuration</b> with options. </li>

         <li>Now don&#39;t use key shortcut, but use cursor key to move highlight to <b>[ ] Lynx-like motion</b> option, </li>

      </ol>

   <p><b>FTP browsing </b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>This is file browsing on remote FTP server just as it is on your computer. </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Press <b>F9</b> to select drop down menus on the top of the screen. </li>

         <li>Press <b>Alt + L</b> if you want to use left side panel, or <b>Alt + R</b> for right panel. </li>

         <li>Press <b>Alt + P</b> for input box where you have enter server name. Enter for instance </li>
      </ol>

      <pre>ftp.gwdg.de/pub
</pre>

      <p>and press <b>Enter</b>. </p>

      <p>Now <b>mc</b> will try anonymous connection to remote machine. If machine responds, you&#39;ll get directory listing of /pub on 
      remote server. </p>

      <p>It is possible to do the same from <b>mc</b> command line by typing: </p>

      <pre>cd /#ftp:ftp.gwdg.de/pub  </pre>
   </blockquote>

   <p><b>Archive browsing </b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>Archive in classic meaning is compressed file. In Linux you can recognize them by suffix like: </p>

      <pre>tgz, tar.gz, tbz, tar.bz2</pre>

      <p>and many more, but above few are the most used </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Highlight the file </li>

         <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
      </ol>

      <p>That&#39;s it. Midnight Commander will decompress file for you and present it&#39;s internal structure like any other directory. If 
      you want to extract one or all files from archive mark what you want toextract and use <b>F5</b> to copy in another panel. Done.
      </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p><b>RPM browsing </b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>The package installation files for any SUSE are
      <a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=RPM&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">RPM</a> and <b>mc</b> will let you 
      browse them. </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Highlight the file </li>

         <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
      </ol>

      <p>You&#39;ll see few files: </p>

      <pre>/INFO
CONTENTS.cpio
HEADER
*INSTALL
*UPGRADE
</pre>

      <p>Browse to see details of your RPM. </p>

      <p>The <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> is actual archive with files, and if you want to see within: </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Highlight the file </li>

         <li>Press <b>Enter</b> </li>
      </ol>

      <p>(You know the drill) </p>

      <p>The *INSTALL and *UPGRADE will do what the name tells, but if you want only to extract one or more files from <b>CONTENTS.cpio</b> 
      than use <b>F5</b> to copy them in the directory in the other panel. </p>
   </blockquote>

   <p><b>PuTTY and line drawing </b></p>
   <blockquote>

      <p>PuTTY is terminal application used to access remote computers running Linux via ssh (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:SSH_tunnels_from_Microsoft_Windows">SSH 
      tunnels from Microsoft Windows</a> see details). The line drawing in Midnight Commander, YaST and another applications that draw 
      lines using special characters can be displayed wrong as something else. The solution is to change settings: </p>
      <ul>

         <li>menu: Window &gt; Translation:
         <ul>

            <li>Received data assumed to be in which character set: UTF-8 </li>

            <li>Handling of line drawing characters: Use Unicode for line drawing </li>
         </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If that doesn&#39;t help, you may set this too: </p>
      <ul>

         <li>menu: Connection &gt; Connection-type string: linux </li>

         <li>menu: Terminal &gt; Keyboard &gt; The Function keys and keypad: Linux </li>

   <pre>&gt; MC......can I make MC under SuSe 9.0 behave the same way
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Yes.</pre>
<blockquote>

   <pre>&gt; and if so how? 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>&#34;mc&#34; is probably a shell alias:
$ alias mc
alias mc=&#39;. /usr/share/mc/bin/mc- per.sh&#39;
(This is bash in Slackware.)

Simply set the alias in your shell. You probably have the mc- per.sh 
script there somewhere; if not, just copy it from the RH box.</pre>

<pre>This is a locale and termcap issue which I do not fully understand.

   <pre>I don&#39;t have any F16 key.  :-P  F6 tries to move. Shift-F6 doesn&#39;t do
anything at all where most needed, on tty[1-6].</pre>

   <pre>This is unintuitive and doesn&#39;t seem to work right. When I try esc-tab,
it brings up a list of local files. If I pick one, it pastes it in front
of the proposed path to move to that came up with F6.

Hi Andras,

&gt; Almost, but not really. I expect MC to launch the program which is
&gt; registered for that file in the KDE (or GNOME) mime database. Why
&gt; should I have to duplicate that information manually in MC...?

No. You don&#39;t have realy to duplicate it.

In the /etc/mc/mc.ext file are some entries for common file types.

e.g. PDF
-----------------------------------------------
# PDF
type/^PDF
    Open=run-mailcap application/pdf:%f &amp;
-----------------------------------------------

This entry start your default application for this mime type.

&gt; In Windows, the feature works like this: it uses the &#34;start&#34; command
&gt; (of cmd.exe) which &#34;opens&#34; the file (or folder) as if I&#39;d
&gt; double-clicked it in the Explorer.

&#39;start&#39; does the same thing under Windows as run-mailcap will do under
Linux.

&gt; OFF: Also a good thing in Windows is that &#34;start .&#34; (or &#34;start
&gt; any-directory&#34;) opens the folder in Explorer. I also miss that on
&gt; KDE, where I have to type &#34;konqueror .&#34; (or is there a &#34;start&#34;
&gt; equivalent)?

Do you wan&#39;t to have only one command to do all the above magically
for you? Write your own. ;-)

Create an script named &#39;start&#39;, place it in a dir in your binary
search path and make it executeable.

--- start ------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

if test -d &#34;$1&#34;
then
  nautilus &#34;$1&#34;
else if test -e &#34;$1&#34;
  then
    run-mailcap &#34;$1&#34;
  else
    echo &#34;Can&#39;t find directory or file: &#39;$1&#39;&#34;
  fi
fi
-----------------------------------------------

Nautlius is a Gnome filemanager. I don&#39;t know what you should use
under KDE. May be konqueror will do the same.

start .              - opens nautilus in the current dir
start /var/log       - opens nautilus in the /var/log dir
start /docs/test.pdf - opens the test.pdf in the dir /doc
                       with the default mime application
                       for PDF documents

Frank
