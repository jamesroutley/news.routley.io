    <h1>KSP2 is spamming the Windows Registry until the game stops working</h1>

<strong>ARE THEY INSANE??!!</strong>
</p>
<p>
I know professional developers who recommend <span>.ini</span> files over the registry “so you can never get blamed for messing up the registry” <em>and [snip] use it as if it where a Temp file?!</em> And that is <strong>on top</strong> of gargantuan game save files? “<em>Save files were getting too big so we&#39;re using the registry instead.</em>” Wow. You couldn&#39;t come up with this when asked for a list of  “stupid things no developer ever should do” and yet here we are. I&#39;m liquided they&#39;re wrecking the KSP legacy but now I&#39;m  PO&#39;d they&#39;re trying to wreck my PC as well.
</p>
<p>
I have the habit of briefly playing KSP2 after each update until I get disgusted with it (that doesn&#39;t take long, as you can imagine). <strong>Now</strong> I even don&#39;t want to do <em>that</em> and I&#39;m seriously considering uninstalling the game until this is fixed.
</p>
<p>
In my (and assuming everyone&#39;s)  book this is not something that can wait two months until the next patch; fixing this warrants its own hot patch rolled out as fast as humanly possible. I didn&#39;t think anything could surpass the current state of the game as a bad reflection on the dev team, but here it is. They truly outdid themselves.
