<p>Today we are pleased to announce that <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/bending_spoons_to_acquire_renowned_productivity_app_evernote_to_enhance_suite_of_consumer_facing_digital_products/prweb19024575.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evernote has agreed to join Bending Spoons</a>, a leading developer of stand-out mobile apps.</p>



<p>In the deal signed between <a href="https://bendingspoons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bending Spoons</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evernote</a>, Bending Spoons agrees to take ownership of Evernote in a transaction expected to complete early in 2023.</p>



<p>For Evernote, this decision is the next strategic step forward on our journey to be an extension of your brain. The path we’ve taken in recent years—rebuilding our apps in order to expand Evernote’s utility and deepen its appeal—has made possible new features, deep focus on our customers, and ultimately, an #everbetter productivity solution on the cusp of the next stage of innovation and growth. Teaming up with Bending Spoons will speed that journey, accelerating the delivery of improvements across our Teams, Professional, Personal, and Free offerings.</p>



<p>As I write this blog post, our new collaborative editing capability, which allows multiple people to edit the same note simultaneously, and individuals to edit the same note on multiple devices without note conflicts, is in early days of beta testing around the world. At the same time, we are within weeks of beta-ing our new support for Office 365 calendars—another much anticipated step forward for our customers. Of course, our drive to improve Evernote includes smaller changes, too. Whether you’ve wanted mini-sidebars on tablets, new preference menu options, iOS and Android widgets, drag &amp; drop for tags, or even the ability to choose where to start a new note (Hint: it’s either in the title or the body; you now get to set the default), customer-centric innovation continues with every release.</p>



<p>While ownership is changing hands, our commitment to keeping your data safe and secure remains as steadfast as ever, and the Evernote you know and love will continue to thrive. Joining Bending Spoons allows us to take advantage of their proven app expertise and wide range of proprietary technologies. Even a small glimpse into their vibrant suite of apps, including Splice for video editing and Remini for AI-assisted photo editing, demonstrates why about 100 million people rely on Bending Spoons products every month. Bending Spoons has built a remarkable business with strong financials and has the ability and resources to propel Evernote forward.</p>



<p>Together, we share a vision for Evernote as a powerful, intuitive extension of your brain. Everything we do at Evernote is focused on helping our customers remember everything and accomplish anything. We look forward to the continued pursuit of that mission with you, our customers and partners, now as part of Bending Spoons.</p>
