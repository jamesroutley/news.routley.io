    <h1>Swapping out my keycaps</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>In my last post we explored <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-02_keyboard-jupiter-banana-to-durock-shrimp">my journey through different keyswitches</a> to get the typing feel down. Now I&#39;ve gone one step further and swapped out my keycaps to further customize how my board looks.</p>
<h2 id="new-keycaps">New Keycaps</h2>
<p>So my previous keycaps were the set that came with my <a href="https://amzn.to/467jzhM">Keychron Q1 Max</a>. I liked them a lot but when looking for replacement keycaps to change up the colors, I realized that the OSA profile they had was actually pretty rare.</p>
<p>On investigating new keycaps I might want I decided that moving to Cherry would be good cause it would give me a broader pick of customizations in the future. From my research it looks like ~90% of keycaps are created in the Cherry profile.</p>
<p>I ended up getting a black and white keycap set off Amazon that was close to the style I liked - side-printed with light pass through. Then I mixed and matched them to have black in most places but labeled all destructive buttons with white - Enter, Esc, Del, Backspace.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ogg1Up">Black side-printed, passthrough Keycaps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4qzUMtZ">White side-printed, passthrough keycaps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I then changed my LEDs from red to green and voila I now have a keyboard that matches my brand - <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_hamy-labs-rebrand">Terminal Garden</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>I&#39;m hoping this is the last entry in my keyboard adventures for awhile. These things are fun to customize but also can quickly become a time and money sink. At the end of the day it&#39;s a tool and I want nice tools but also the goal is to just use them so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to be focusing on moving forward.</p>
