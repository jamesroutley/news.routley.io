Linus Torvalds has quietly <a href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ebf2bfec412a">changed
the maintainer status of bcachefs</a> to &#34;externally maintained&#34;,
indicating that further changes are unlikely to enter the mainline anytime
soon.  This change also suggests, though, that the immediate removal of
bcachefs from the mainline kernel is not in the cards.</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->

I guess another maintainer, easier to work with, can continue the development of bcachefs. Subsystems with bus factor of one are frowned upon.<br/>

Thank you for posting such a compassionate response. This thread could easily turn into an unkind discussion or an all-out flame war, but you went out of your way to be kind instead.<br/>

Debian has processes for obtaining carvouts/exceptions for critical system packages, naturally with more review. E2fsprogs used them and that&#39;s what should have been done here; there was no need to rush packing bcachefs-tools for Debian.<br/>

Did just removing the package ever come up? Surely not shipping a piece of code is preferable for all parties over shipping a known broken configuration.<br/>

Just to understand what is discussed here, was there ever any technical reason mentioned in public from Debian for why Kent&#39;s recommendation to not unbundle rust dependencies could and should not be followed?<br/>

<p>
If a distribution is full of broken software, who&#39;s going to use it?
</p><p>
It might have made sense 20 and 30 years ago that distributions religiously kept single versions of libraries when (nearly) everything was written in C and the number of &#34;interesting&#34; software was in hundreds or thousands range. Nowadays it no longer makes sense, there are hundrends of thousands of softwares around written in languages which don&#39;t really care what&#39;s in a distribution (especially if the developers of said software work on e.g. MacOS).
</p><p>
There&#39;s no wonder the snap, flatpack, docker, curl |bash way of running/installing software is getting more popular.

Typo? Looks like one bit flip: &#39;v&#39; → 01110110; &#39;b&#39; → 01100010. Linus is not using a filesystem with checksums‽<br/>

Much more likely to have been a typo; b and v are next to each other on a qwerty keyboard.<br/>

Why was this typo made in the first place, though?  Are you telling me Linus types his email all the time instead of using `git commit -s`?  That seems.. really odd to me.<br/>

      Perhaps he takes it more literally that he should actually sign-off on it and doesn&#39;t use the &#34;-s&#34; flag because of it. Or maybe he was using a different computer that doesn&#39;t have his default settings? Who knows...

Could be either. I&#39;d rate the relative probabilities of Linus writing using a keyboard and just outputting raw bits as roughly even.<br/>

I thought Linus would eject it from the kernel, but this change leaves the door open for continued development — exactly what I asked of Linus in my private exchange with him and Kent. Maybe he listened in the end.<br/>

View from a mildly interested end user:  if you alienate the people you depend on it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re right or wrong on any particular technical issue. You lose. The people you claim to care for or represent? Congratulations, you lost it for them too.  There is a 30+ year old kernel project with well established protocols, doctrine, structure, methods - all in the public space, totally discoverable, explicitly described, well understood.  But you know better, so much better that you repeatedly ignore every precedent, explicitly oppose and argue every admonition, refuse all advice, bad mouth the people who have been there before and who you need......guess what?  You needed them but they don&#39;t need you. Your talent is not unique.  You are not Moses, Jesus or Buddha or Mohammed.  Other people can make file systems too. And they did and they do.  And they work.  And they get a lot of development.  That&#39;s why they work, they are in.  And you are out.  Because you are not a voice of truth in the wilderness.<br/>

Couldn&#39;t some big weights interested in bcachefs (at Valve &amp; others maybe?) just nicely ask Linus to let this one go, or find a positive solution to keep bcachefs upstream?<br/>

I love it that you think this hasn&#39;t already been attempted and failed.<br/>

What&#39;s the process nowadays with all these git pulls etc. Do all patches, including those by Linus, still end up on some mailing list? I didn&#39;t find this one in any, but maybe just not indexed yet.<br/>
