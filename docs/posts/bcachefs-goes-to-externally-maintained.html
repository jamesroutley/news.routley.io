Linus Torvalds has quietly <a href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ebf2bfec412a">changed
the maintainer status of bcachefs</a> to &#34;externally maintained&#34;,
indicating that further changes are unlikely to enter the mainline anytime
soon.  This change also suggests, though, that the immediate removal of
bcachefs from the mainline kernel is not in the cards.</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->

I guess another maintainer, easier to work with, can continue the development of bcachefs. Subsystems with bus factor of one are frowned upon.<br/>

Yeah, bcachefs is not in the same boat as ZFS. There are no licensing issues, and as far as I can tell, no technical issues either. It&#39;s just a case of &#34;Linus and some other folks don&#39;t want to work with Kent,&#34; and that is (presumably) solved by somebody else upstreaming the patches.</p></div>

That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;ve resisted the push to put someone else in that role. If it&#39;s one of the other people working on bcachefs I don&#39;t want to risk them burning out and losing another engineer; I&#39;d be ok with it if it was another long standing member of the kernel community with experience working with Linus, but for some strange reason no one I&#39;ve talked to wants to take that on. </p></div>

koverstreet, I agree with NYKevin that it sounds like Linus isn&#39;t interested in working with you in the way you would like to work with him, and therefore I agree with him that one of the three bullet points are most likely to occur.</p></div>

<p><span>&gt;  But I disagree with him that you should focus any attention on that. The healthiest way to approach life is not to try to control what other people do, nor to think about what they might do in response to what you do. Rather, the healthiest approach to life, and the only way to be spiritually free in life, is to do whatever you want to do, so long as what you want to do is both legal and ethical. What other people may or may not do in response to that is their own problem, because, as long as what you are doing is legal, they can&#39;t make it your problem. (Unless you let them, so don&#39;t let them.)</span></p></div>

<p><span>&gt; Broken release process is exactly why bcachefs-tools isn&#39;t in Debian as well; the package maintainer who took it upon himself to package bcachefs-tools in Debian put project rules ahead of shipping working code, then broke the build and sat in it - and I got stuck with the bug reports.</span></p></div>

The specific, technical issue was the package maintainer switching out the Rust dependencies for the packaged versions from Debian. I explained that this was a bad idea at the outset, because it invalidated all the testing we do, and the Debian package wasn&#39;t replicating that testing; it was also wholly unnecessary because Rust dependencies are statically linked.</p></div>

Debian has processes for obtaining carvouts/exceptions for critical system packages, naturally with more review. E2fsprogs used them and that&#39;s what should have been done here; there was no need to rush packing bcachefs-tools for Debian.<br/>

It&#39;s not an issue of the maintainer deciding they &#34;didn&#39;t feel like breaking with Debian process.&#34; Maintainers either follow the process (packaging standards) in Debian, or their packages eventually get kicked from the distribution if they&#39;re not fixed to follow the rules. The distribution&#39;s rules about vendoring dependencies don&#39;t magically disappear because there the upstream thinks there are &#34;no technical counterarguments&#34; against bypassing them.</p></div>

Hm, for me it simply reads like OP is mentioning his frustration about release cycles, and is citing a pretty legitimate example: The fact that developers are overwhelmed with obsolete bug reports, because LTS distros are months or even years behind, is not something new and a real problem for some projects.</p></div>

I&#39;m still waiting to see some reflection from you Debian folks. Debian is the only distro where this became an issue; even Fedora gave us an exception to their unbundling rule (and they gave a better reason for wanting it than anyone from Debian - build server load) and for every other distro it&#39;s been a non issue.</p></div>

Correct, because the Debian packager switched to a bindgen version that was explicitly unsupported, broke the build, and sat on it, and as a result users lost access to their filesystems when they didn&#39;t get the fix for mount option passing.</p></div>

Just to understand what is discussed here, was there ever any technical reason mentioned in public from Debian for why Kent&#39;s recommendation to not unbundle rust dependencies could and should not be followed?<br/>

Of course there is a technical reason. If you are a distributor, you only want one copy of software in a distribution. Updating one copy is manageable. </p></div>

My recommendation is to have an out-of-tree repository that has the latest changes and to send them to Linus at a pace Linus is okay with.  Users who need the very latest code can use the driver from your tree via DKMS or similar.  I also recommend having a way to implement new features that are not on hot paths (such as recovery) in userspace.  Finally, a FUSE version would be a good idea and (as you mentioned earlier IIRC) make kernel changes that are not corruption or crash fixes less urgent, because users could recover in userspace and even access their data (albeit more slowly) while that is happening.</p></div>

What SQLite has done is damned impressive, but I don&#39;t see that being feasible for bcachefs for a long time. The route to formal verification in bcachefs will be - incrementally rewrite in Rust (and it&#39;s still a ways out before I can seriously contemplate starting that, but it needs to happen), than add dependent types to Rust in some fashion (could be done with proc macros).</p></div>

Thanks for that Anubis blog post link: the root cause of the failure (TL;DR: decimal division of the number of CPU cores) is one of those fascinating “works for me” accidental pieces of code (all their test systems had an even number of CPU cores).</p></div>

Why was this typo made in the first place, though?  Are you telling me Linus types his email all the time instead of using `git commit -s`?  That seems.. really odd to me.<br/>

I&#39;m sure this is an interim situation, but at this point this has been talked about so widely, I doubt there are many bcachefs users left unaware of the situation. Users will still be able rebase the patches they need on top of Linus&#39; tree for a little bit, until we know what happens next. Better than nothing in my book.</p></div>

There are quite a few advantages of keeping the code in the tree:</p></div>

I thought Linus would eject it from the kernel, but this change leaves the door open for continued development — exactly what I asked of Linus in my private exchange with him and Kent. Maybe he listened in the end.<br/>

View from a mildly interested end user:  if you alienate the people you depend on it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re right or wrong on any particular technical issue. You lose. The people you claim to care for or represent? Congratulations, you lost it for them too.  There is a 30+ year old kernel project with well established protocols, doctrine, structure, methods - all in the public space, totally discoverable, explicitly described, well understood.  But you know better, so much better that you repeatedly ignore every precedent, explicitly oppose and argue every admonition, refuse all advice, bad mouth the people who have been there before and who you need......guess what?  You needed them but they don&#39;t need you. Your talent is not unique.  You are not Moses, Jesus or Buddha or Mohammed.  Other people can make file systems too. And they did and they do.  And they work.  And they get a lot of development.  That&#39;s why they work, they are in.  And you are out.  Because you are not a voice of truth in the wilderness.<br/>

Couldn&#39;t some big weights interested in bcachefs (at Valve &amp; others maybe?) just nicely ask Linus to let this one go, or find a positive solution to keep bcachefs upstream?<br/>

What&#39;s the process nowadays with all these git pulls etc. Do all patches, including those by Linus, still end up on some mailing list? I didn&#39;t find this one in any, but maybe just not indexed yet.<br/>
