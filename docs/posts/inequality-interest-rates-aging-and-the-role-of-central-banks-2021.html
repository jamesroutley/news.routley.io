But we couldn’t do both. Until relatively recently, simply securing enough food to prevent starvation was a major challenge.</span></p><p>That constraint isn’t nearly as binding now as it was when we lived as subsistence farmers. In fact, our big problem for the past few decades has been a glut of capacity that we’ve refused to put to work. We’ve been living below our means and have been actively discouraging new investment. Nevertheless, we still retain many of the social institutions that we invented to endure the long era of scarcity.</p><p><span>One of those social institutions is “interest”: a reward that society pays to those who voluntarily sacrifice spending power today in exchange for the promise of more spending power later. That sacrifice frees up resources so that others can spend more than they earn now. In exchange, the borrowers agree to either spend less later (if they are borrowing to buy consumer goods and services) or to produce more later (if they are borrowing to invest in expanding society’s productive capacity). </span><strong>Whether this is good or bad—and therefore deserving of reward or punishment—depends on each society’s circumstances.</strong><a id="footnote-anchor-3-40675388" href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and#footnote-3-40675388" rel="">3</a></p><p><span>In theory, interest rates are supposed to encourage or discourage spending according to each society’s needs at different points in time. If there is too much demand for goods and services relative to current production, high interest rates can potentially help by making it more expensive to borrow and by raising the rewards for those who abstain from spending.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-4-40675388" href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and#footnote-4-40675388" rel="">4</a></p><p><strong>But if nobody is consuming or investing, then it’s pointless to get people to spend even less. </strong><span>Thus inflation-adjusted interest rates tend to be higher when the economy is growing rapidly and lower (or negative) during downturns and periods of slow growth. From this perspective, the relentless decline in interest rates is a signal of serious social problems.</span></p><p><span>In most economies, baseline interest rates are “set” by central banks. Private investors and traders then set the borrowing costs for businesses, households, and governments on top of those baselines according to duration, credit risk, and other factors.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-5-40675388" href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and#footnote-5-40675388" rel="">5</a></p><p><span>Central banks can impose any level of (local currency) borrowing costs on the economy that they want, which is why some say that </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbaf.12249" rel="">“interest rates are a policy variable.”</a><span> But central banks generally avoid exercising that power arbitrarily—and for good reason. Interest rates that are too high or too low relative to what makes sense can lead to undesirable consequences ranging from mass unemployment to currency collapse.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-6-40675388" href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and#footnote-6-40675388" rel="">6</a><span> That’s why most central banks instead try to meet the economy and financial system where it is.</span></p><p><span>However, central bankers have an incredibly hard time estimating the “neutral” level of interest rates because there are so many countervailing forces at play. Here are just a few factors that </span><em>aren’t</em><span> being discussed in the recent batch of papers, but that clearly matter:</span></p><ul><li><p>Governments’ willingness to spend, borrow, and tax</p></li><li><p><span>The state of consumer and </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/Macroprudential-Policy#sort=%40imfdate%20descending" rel="">“macroprudential”</a><span> financial regulation</span></p></li><li><p>Perceptions of crisis risk and the need to self-insure against those risks by nonfinancial corporations, pension plans, and foreign reserve managers </p></li><li><p>Globalization and changes in openness to cross-border trade and finance</p></li><li><p>The rate of technological innovation, which in turn is affected by research productivity and by businesses’ success at commercialization and development</p></li><li><p>Attitudes towards debt, consumption, entrepreneurship, etc. by ordinary people and business executives</p></li></ul><p><span>No model can capture all of the relevant mechanisms, which is probably why every model that’s produced estimates of “neutral” (or “natural”) interest rates </span><a href="https://theovershoot.co/p/how-to-improve-german-fiscal-policy" rel="">generates extremely strange results</a><span> at least some of the time. In practice, the best that central bankers can hope for is to get reasonably close with trial and error. As Richard Clarida, the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chairman, </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20181127a.htm" rel="">put it at the end of 2018</a><span>, the “key parameters that describe the long-run destination of the economy are unknown”—and the only solution is to constantly update your estimates as new data come in.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Among other things, Clarida was referring to the relentless decline in estimates of the “neutral” rate over the past few decades. In fact, Fed officials’ estimate of “neutral” dropped </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm" rel="">another 0.5 percentage point</a><span> just between Clarida’s 2018 speech and the end of 2019. </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-changes-in-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm" rel="">The Fed’s new framework</a><span> and the European Central Bank’s updated </span><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/search/review/html/ecb.strategyreview_monpol_strategy_statement.en.html" rel="">monetary policy strategy</a><span> were both responses to this phenomenon.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-7-40675388" href="https://theovershoot.co/p/inequality-interest-rates-aging-and#footnote-7-40675388" rel="">7</a></p><p><span>But even though it’s more or less impossible to know the </span><em>level</em><span> of “neutral” at any point in time, it’s easier to track </span><em>changes </em><span>in “neutral” over time. And that’s where the new research is particularly helpful.</span></p><p>Auclert et al argue that population aging—and slowing population growth—is partly responsible for the global drop in interest rates because slower population growth reduces investment. There is less reason to reward those who put off spending when there are fewer people trying to build factories, houses, or other types of capital.</p><p>This effect should only get bigger if the United Nations’ forecasts pan out:</p><blockquote><p>There will be no great demographic reversal: through the twenty-first century, population aging will continue to push down global rates of return, with our central estimate being -123bp, and push up global wealth-to-GDP, with our central estimate being a 10% increase, or 47pp in levels. </p></blockquote><p>In the 1960s, total population growth in the major global economies (the “high-income countries” plus China) averaged almost 2% a year. That slowed to just 1.2% a year by the 1980s, 0.9% a year by the 1990s, 0.6% a year by the 2000s, and just 0.4% by the eve of the pandemic. The combined population of these economies is projected to shrink starting in the 2030s, eventually falling nearly 20% from the projected 2030 peak by the end of the century.</p><p>Put another way, the number of children aged 0-14 in these economies fell from a peak of more than 600 million in the mid-1970s to about 465 million now. The number of children is projected to plunge almost 30% from current levels to just 335 million by 2100.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png" width="1456" height="826" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:826,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:143874,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8203673c-09f8-4ae1-9826-4fe9d8893008_3011x1709.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>That pushes down interest rates, according to Auclert et al, because fewer people means there is less need to provide for the desires of future generations. This effect outweighs the fact that older people have much lower saving rates than everyone else. </span><strong>An aging society might produce less, but demand falls even further and faster.</strong><span> The process began in the 1980s and could continue for decades to come.</span></p><p><span>That’s consistent with what I noted almost six years ago </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/12436eb2-4331-3931-afe7-c042aff56cc4" rel="">when writing about Japan</a><span>. There, population aging in the 1990s and 2000s pushed the household saving rate to zero during a period of sustained government budget deficits—yet interest rates went </span><em>down</em><span>. The reason was that households are only one piece of the broader economy. In Japan’s case, the decline in business investment and the rise in corporate profitability (which in turn was partly attributable to lower pay for workers) were more than enough to offset what was happening in the rest of the economy. </span></p><p>Mian, Straub, and Sufi, in a paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, focus on how changes in the income distribution affect saving rates, borrowing, and consumer spending.</p><p>The key insight is that the ultra-rich are different from you and me: they have much higher saving rates regardless of their age. No matter how expensive your tastes, there’s a limit to how much you can consume, which means any income above that threshold has to get saved.
