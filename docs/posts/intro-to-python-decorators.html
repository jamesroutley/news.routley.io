    <h1>Intro to python decorators:</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I recently learned about python decorators from Dan Bader&#39;s excellent resource <em>Python Tricks the Book</em>. I immediately wanted to apply my new-found knowledge, but didn&#39;t have a good use-case. So I made a bad one and turned it into a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y11uvVe9wKRX0O0jqUbb1CdPIvYTWgD0?usp=sharing">tutorial</a> (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y11uvVe9wKRX0O0jqUbb1CdPIvYTWgD0?usp=sharing">solutions</a>). I tried to include a good number of exercises; by the end, you should have decorators. Have fun!</p>
