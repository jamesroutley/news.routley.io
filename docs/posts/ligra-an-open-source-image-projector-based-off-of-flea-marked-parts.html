    <h1>Ligra â€“ an open source image projector based off of flea marked parts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">ligra is an open source image projector build from scratch and based off of flea market parts. ligra is not neccessarily a PCB-project nor a single thing, but rather an idea of how to design your own image-projection system. It is an introduction on how to create light-grafittis, how to share messages at large.</p>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s not strictly a Gobo, rather a way of building a system that may resemble one, but may also resemble a video projector or an abstract source of art. I have mostly used it with 2D printed stencils, usually used with so called &#34;overhead projectors&#34;, one can of course also use metal-stencils, coloured effect-foils, 3D printed stencils and even LCDs, or really anything that may project an image. Get creative!</p>

<p dir="auto">This repo is very WIP and shall be expanded soon :3</p>

<p dir="auto">ligra essentially functions as a backwards camera, well, most projectors do. This becomes more visible when we talk about its inner workings, it&#39;s heart and most fixed element is the lens, a Canon FD lens in our case. But instead of using it to project and image <strong>onto</strong> a 35mm film slide, we will project light <strong>through</strong> a ruffly 35mm film slide-sized, image forming medium (i.e. a 2D printed stencil). This light will enter the lens from the back, projecting an image onto a scene with the properties of the lens (focal length, aperture and focus). Given the quality of even early lenses, we can expect some sharp and crisp projections. [WIP ...]</p>
