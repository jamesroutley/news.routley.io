According to a copy of his résumé obtained by WIRED, he spent three months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, last summer.</p><p>Both Bobba and Coristine are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by WIRED as “experts” at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. Scales previously worked on talent for xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, and as part of Uber’s talent acquisition team, per LinkedIn. Employees at GSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify their jobs. WIRED <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-tech-workers-gsa-tts/">previously reported</a> that Coristine was added to a call with GSA staff members using a nongovernment Gmail address. Employees were not given an explanation as to who he was or why he was on the calls.</p><p>Farritor, who per sources has a working GSA email address, is a former intern at SpaceX, Musk’s space company, and <a data-offer-url="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240320742346/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-Next-Thiel-Fellow-Class" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240320742346/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-Next-Thiel-Fellow-Class&#34;}" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240320742346/en/Thiel-Foundation-Announces-Next-Thiel-Fellow-Class" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">currently</a> a <a data-offer-url="https://thielfellowship.org/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://thielfellowship.org/&#34;}" href="https://thielfellowship.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Thiel Fellow</a> after, according to his LinkedIn, dropping out of the University of Nebraska—Lincoln.

According to a copy of his now-deleted résumé obtained by WIRED, he attended McGill University through at least 2021 and graduated high school in 2019. An archived copy of his now-deleted personal website indicates that he worked as an engineer at Jump Trading, which specializes in algorithmic and high-frequency financial trades.</p><p>Shaotran told <a data-offer-url="https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-senior-balances-college-ai-startup-productivity-enterprise-openai-coding-2024-8?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=insider-sf" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-senior-balances-college-ai-startup-productivity-enterprise-openai-coding-2024-8?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=insider-sf&#34;}" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-senior-balances-college-ai-startup-productivity-enterprise-openai-coding-2024-8?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=insider-sf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> in September that he was a senior at Harvard studying computer science and also the founder of an OpenAI-backed startup, Energize AI.

The source, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, says they worry that the new teams could bypass the regular security clearance protocols to access the agency’s sensitive compartmented information facility, as the <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html&#34;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trump administration has already granted temporary security clearances</a> to unvetted people.</p><p>This is in addition to Coristine and Bobba being listed as “experts” working at OPM. Bednar says that while staff can be loaned out between agencies for special projects or to work on issues that might cross agency lines, it’s not exactly common practice.</p><p>“This is consistent with the pattern of a lot of tech executives who have taken certain roles of the administration,” says Bednar. “This raises concerns about regulatory capture and whether these individuals may have preferences that don’t serve the American public or the federal government.”</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Zoë Schiffer and Tim Marchman.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div>
