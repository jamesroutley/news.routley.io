    <h1>Ask HN: Why is building Windows apps so complicated</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>So I decide to build a windows 11 app. I already know some .NET and C/family from school and look through the source of C# and it doesn&#39;t seem too complicated.<p>However, building Windows apps is very complicated even when you know C++ or C#.</p><p>1. I wanted to build  Windows 11 apps and I had to choose between Windows Forms, WinUI3, Win32 and WPF I think. I don&#39;t really know the difference between the 3 and no one really explains that (unless Win32 which is obvious).</p><p>2. Apparently, WUP is no longer recommended. A few years they were pushing it to the max. Bummer.</p><p>3. I installed Visual Studio overnight (it comes with all the tools that building apps need). It downloaded 6GB of data and used 20GB of storage. All i want to build is a hello world app.</p><p>4. I create a project following a guide from Microsoft.</p><p>5. The app is extremely resource heavy and way too over-featured. I build the boilerplate app and Run it and it takes minutes to build (most of the time is downloading dependencies so not such a big deal).</p><p>6. I open the newly created app in Sublime Text (my editor) and I can&#39;t find a way to build the app anymore.</p><p>7. Because Visual Studio is so bloated, I download Visual Studio Code, which is far more simple but I can still not figure out how to build my app even with the various extensions VS code boasts.</p><p>8. After hours of googling, I formulate a script that can build the app from the command-line.</p><p>9. But I stil don&#39;t know how to build the app as the .exe file created does not execute.</p><p>10. I&#39;m very disappointed.</p><p>The worst of all is that there is not even one good guide on the whole clearnet on how to do develop a Hello World windows app from scratch.</p></div></div>
