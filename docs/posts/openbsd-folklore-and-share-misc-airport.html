  <div><p>Back in 2016, I sent a <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=147535923705402&amp;w=2">diff</a> to OpenBSD’s tech@ mailing list which
added missing airports and area codes for Poland. Theo kindly pointed
out privately that there was a rule governing the update of this file,
which was known among OpenBSD developers but never made it into a commit.
So I ended up making <a href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/8qKRlaACyhZSrcEa">one</a> adding my home airport (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rzesz%C3%B3w%E2%80%93Jasionka_Airport">RZE</a>) to the
list and specifying update rules: only add ones you have been to.
Later on, I also added the code for the Warsaw Modlin airport (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Modlin_Airport">WMI</a>),
from which I did a couple of round trips that same year.</p>
<p>At the OpenBSD <strong>d2k17</strong> hackathon, the rules were documented in a newly
introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/airport.7">airport(7)</a> manual page: “New airports can only be added
by OpenBSD developers who have visited an airport and thereby have verified
its existence”. Once again, the more astute reader will not have missed
the fact that the rules do not stipulate any flying requirements. Neither
did henning@, who not long after <em>airport.7</em> was committed, <a href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/ztW1pPgN6oa712AF">added
an entry for XFW</a>, (the Airbus factory) which he had visited but not
flown from.</p>
<p>Today, I finally took some time off and did a day trip to Lublin.
No trip to a city is complete without a visit to its airport, right?</p>

</p>
<p>One can say anything about Lublin airport, but they sure do consider
<strong>IATA</strong> codes are serious business. The tone was set right from the
parking lot entrance.</p>

</p>
<p>And with this, I’m happy to announce that there is a <a href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/xZeFvUEDeAp8INp3">new entry</a> for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin_Airport">LUZ</a> in the <em>airport</em> file! You are welcome.</p>
