  <p>Some of the tools described here are still in use â€“ at least in education
    at school. However, most of the items have disappeared from a professional
    environment. Even the drawing board has disappeared. But we all are still
  dreaming of screens of <em>that</em> size!</p>

  <p>Early drawing pens were made similar to forceps, with a screw to adjust
    the distance of the two legs which held the indian ink. I remember the time
    when the two legs even had to be smoothed with a honing stone to undo the
    waering from the very harsh paper. For my map drawing I also had a double
    pen (for streets) and a free wheeling pen for altitude curves (isohypses).</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_pen3.jpg" width="466" height="225" alt="forceps shaped drawing pens"/></p>
  <p>The pen at this drawing fountain pen could easily be exchanged for writing
    with types for narrow and wide lines.</p>
  
  <p>Â  <img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_pen1.gif" alt="drawing fountain pen" width="585" height="70"/> </p>
  <p>This was my set of pens for a number of years... </p>

    board</h3>
  <p>The most common drawing board for engineers and also for illustrators used
    a parallelograms to keep the rulers parallel to itself. The detail picture
    shows the &#39;head&#39; of the machine:Â The rulers could be exchanged according
    to the desired scale;Â they could also be rotated in 15 degree steps
    or fixed at an arbitrary angle.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_board1.gif" width="342" height="432" alt="drawing board with parallelogram"/> <img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_board2.jpg" width="456" height="282" alt="protractor at drawing board"/></p>
<p>For wide drawing boards (especially used in the ship industy) the parallelogram
    mechanism was replaced by a horizontal rail on top with a &#39;t-square&#39; on roller
    barings holding the drawing head.</p>
  <h3><a name="square" id="square"></a><a name="tsquare" id="tsquare"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Set square
    and T-square</h3>
  <p>Amateurs and students most time are confined to simple forms of a drawing
    board with a t-square to draw horizontal lines (the board was not square
    enough to allow for verticals also). Angles in steps of 15 degrees require
    2 set squares with 90-45-45 degrees and 90-60-30 degrees. Arbitrary angles are supported by adjustable set squares.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_squares.gif" alt="drawing board with squares and t-square" width="589" height="182"/> <img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_square-adjustable.jpg" width="340" height="200" alt="Adjustable square"/></p>
  <p>For the desktop A2 and A3 sized drawing tablets became available with a
    combination of t-square and protractor. I still have an A3 sized in use.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_board4.jpg" width="303" height="182" alt="drawign tablet with protractor"/></p>
  <h3><a name="ruler" id="ruler"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Ruler</h3>
  <p>For working on the desk a ruler is still a handy tool. Most time it is combined
    with a 1:1 scale with tic marks at every mm. For typographic purpose also
    rulers with pica, points etc. are still in use.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_ruler_parallel.gif" width="144" height="170" alt="Sketch of parallel ruler in use"/><a name="parallel_ruler" id="parallel_ruler"></a>Convenient
    tools on the desk are parallel moving rulers. One type has (rubber coated)
    rollers to guide the movement. Another type connects two parallel half-rulers
    with two legs forming a parallelogram with the ruler.The type with the rollers
    often is combined with a mechanism to slip the ruler step be step for hatsching. </p>
  <p>A more elaborate example is pictured hereafter. This is a multipurpose tool
    especially for students. Even math formulas and trigonometric tables are
    available. With the various holes on the long edge a compass can be simulated.</p>

  <p>Since various drawing scales were needed, the tool combined 6 scales, for
    example, 1:200, 1:50 etc. (metric engineer&#39;s scale) or 1:48, 1:128 etc. (imperial). Also very strange scales for rural maps could be
    found: 1:1440 and 1:2880 (architect&#39;s scale).</p>

  <p>Not only children like templates. Making illustrations on paper very often
    is faster than any computer based method... A standard catalogue for templates
    as of 1997 lists hexagons, ellipses, electrical and chemical signs etc. For special purpose  <a name="lettering_stencil" id="lettering_stencil"></a>lettering stencils are still used.</p>

<p>For drawings such as the following I created templates of my own using a
    0.5mm plastic foil: </p>

    curves</h3>
  
  <p>A common set of curves is the Burmester set displayed here. The first item
    is very handy for ellipses, the second very often fitts large parts of hyperbolas
    and the third (largest) item is used most for parabolas.</p>
  
  <p>During my time as a mechanical engineer I also used a very special courving
    tool: some sort of plastic snake with lead spine, about 40Â cm long.
    This could be bent to the desired shape.  </p>
  <h3><a name="flat_spline" id="flat_spline"></a>Flat spline</h3>
  <p>In ship building where drawings frequently were to the scale (or at least
    as large as rooms), another form of curving tools were in use. This is a long straight slat of wood or
    other bendable material. It was pinned down along few points shaping the
  curve.</p>
  <h3><a name="lesbian_rule" id="lesbian_rule"></a>Flexible curve</h3>
  <p>To adjust to arbitrary curved shapes a flexible rule (plastic with lead spine) is used. This has no inner tension, so control points did not work properly. Sometimes it was called <a href="In%20ship%20building%20where%20drawings%20frequently%20were%20to%20the%20scale%20(or%20at%20least%20as%20large%20as%20rooms),%20another%20form%20of%20curving%20tools%20were%20in%20use:%20in%20German%20it%20was%20called%20straklatte.%20This%20is%20a%20long%20straight%20slat%20of%20wood%20or%20other%20bendable%20material.%20It%20was%20pinned%20down%20along%20few%20points%20shaping%20the%20curve." target="_blank">lesbian rule</a>.<br/>

  <h3><a name="compasses" id="compasses"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Compasses</h3>
  <p>Various types of compasses and drawing pens were combined in a box of <a name="drawing_instruments" id="drawing_instruments"></a>drawing
    instruments. The compass in this set could draw circles up to 25Â cm
    in diameter by means of an elongation rod. To draw very small circles a drop
    compass and a bowcompass is included, sometimes also a <a name="divider_compass" id="divider_compass"></a>divider compass with
    two pins.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_reisszeug.jpg" width="403" height="197" alt="My father&#39;s set of drawing instruments in case (about 1935)"/> <img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_reisszeug-neu.jpg" width="457" height="200" alt="Compass set new"/></p>
  <h4><a name="rod_compass" id="rod_compass"></a>Beam compass</h4>
  <p>For larger circles the needle and pencil are arranged on sliders on a rod or beam,
    which might also be eleongated. IÂ remember that once we needed a radius
    of 4m. Kneeling on the floor we just used an ordinary wooden rod of that
    length. There are however also special instruments to <a href="#kreiszeichner">draw large circles</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_compass2.jpg" width="690" height="156" alt="rod compasses for large circles"/></p>
  <h3><a name="prop_compass" id="prop_compass"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Proportional
    compasses</h3>
  <p>Proportional compasses are used to divide distances or to &#39;convert&#39; them
    according to a scale. A specialized device for the relation of the golden
    rectangle may be still in use by sculpturers and other artists. The rightmost
    image depicts an instrument to divide a distance into up to 10 equal parts.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="kreiszeichner" id="kreiszeichner"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Drawing
    large circles</h3>
  <p>But how to draw circles, if the center can not be reached? I have only a
    scetch of such an instrument. There were other types available with greater
    accuracy, but more elaborate.</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_kreisz.png" width="540" height="212" alt="sketch of device to draw circles without reaching the centre"/>    <img src="https://www.daube.ch/docu/graphics/drawing_seyfert.jpg" width="666" height="233" alt="Seyferts tool to draw cirle arcs"/></p>
  <p>b = r - sqrt(r<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>) For a given radius angle alpha
    is constant. Because a is an instrument constant, there were tables to get
    b from the desired radius. A simple form of this instrument consists only of two streight strips of wood fixed together in the position 1 and sliding at pins <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> on the board.</p>
  <p><a href="http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj242/ar242011" target="_blank">H. Seyfert</a> patented 1880 an instrument which uses a steel-blade (<em>c-c</em>). It is supported at both ends (<em>m</em>). The arc is created by pushing the steel blade at the position <em>k</em>, while pulling the supports at <em>m</em>. The bending of the steel-blade is perfomed by moving the pin <em>e</em> down. The various levers swing around the index pins <em>x</em>. This is done by turning a disk which has a spiral notch engagend with the pin <em>e</em>. This disk is marked with the radius of the created arc. The graduation starts with 5000Â mm and goes (for one turn) to 300Â mm. With a second turn a radius of 150Â mm can be reached.</p>
  <h3><a name="ellipse_compass" id="ellipse_compass"></a><img src="https://www.daube.ch/z_designs/nav-dnup.gif" width="30" height="20" alt="[To top/bottom of page]" usemap="#nav-dnup"/> Ellipse
    compasses</h3>
  <p>Before you just could drag your mouse to get an ellipsis of any size both <a href="#template">templates</a> and
    special mechanical devices were used. The two devices depicted use different
    methods of drawing an ellipse.</p>
  
  <p>The method using a thread is at least still used by gardeners. Using a sharp
    pencil, thin pins and a thin thread you can get quite a good precision by
    this method first described at least by Descartes (1596 - 1650): </p>

  <p>To draw correctly with perspective using vanishing points wide drawing boards
    with special rods were used. Let&#39;s see, maybe I find a photograph from such
    a device.</p>
  <p>Skilled users could combine photographs with drawn illustrations - a task
    nearly everybody can perform now with graphic software.</p>

      <td><p>You might know the camera obscura, which works only for very luminous
          situations. Camera lucida (light chamber) was developed by W. H. Wollaston
          in 1807 to draw landscapes etc. with ease. See also <a href="http://painting.about.com/od/oldmastertechniques/ss/camera_lucida.htm" target="_blank">about.com</a>. </p>
        <p>The main component is a 4-sided glass prism. From the oject G the
          light is seen by the eye A in Z, where the pencil can be used to draw
          the object.</p>
        <p>When the instrument is built with mirrors rather than a prism it is
          called <em>mirror lucida</em>.</p>
        <p>The following is a &#39;folded away&#39; instrument from the 18th century
          in the catalogue of <a href="http://www.gemmary.com">gemmary.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Modern
          versions of a camera lucida can be purchased (for example) from:

        <p>Some microscope manufacturers also provide &#34;camera lucida mirrors&#34;

    more easy mathematical handling of arcs). Still available are protractors with 400<sup>g</sup> (gon) to the full circle. The divison of a right angle into 100 gon, ... allowed more easy calculations in trigonometric tables (decimal system). </p>

  <p>This is not a drawing tool per se, but was used by educated people for calculations.
    The analogue calculator is based on the logarithms, discovered (or developed)

    reduces multiplication and division to addition and substraction. Potenzation
    and roots are reduced to multiplication and division. But also special scales
    for trigonometric calculations etc. were in use. The typical slide rule of
    an engineer had 25 scales and was 25cm long. this allowed an accuracy of
    3 - 4 digits.</p>

  <p>The
    sliding window shows the square of 4 (scale D) to be 16 (scale A). The tong
  shows the multiplication of 1.26 by 3.17 (C) = 4 (D).</p>
