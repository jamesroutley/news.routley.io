    <p>
        Whippy Term is a modern terminal program.  It has been designed to have
        a modern UI and to run on modern OS&#39;s like Windows and Linux.  It also
        has a number of unique features such as bookmarks, built in hex dumps,
        extending through plugins, and native support for binary protocols.
    </p>
    <h4>Embedded Developers</h4>
    <p>
        It is primarily aimed at embedded developers that need to talk to their
        devices. It supports serial communication such as serial ports
        (RS232, RS485, RS422, TTL UART), TCP/IP, UDP. It also supports
        protocols such as I2C and SPI though plugins.
    </p>
    <h4>Terminal emulations</h4>
    <p>
        Terminal emulations such as ANSI and VT100 can be added (ANSI is builtin
        and always available) through plugins.
    </p>
    <h4>Binary protocols</h4>
    <p>
        WhippyTerm also support working with binary protocols, in both
        serial streams like RS232, and message block protocols like UDP.
        Support for sending blocks of binary or AscII data is included to
        better work with embedded devices and binary protocols.
