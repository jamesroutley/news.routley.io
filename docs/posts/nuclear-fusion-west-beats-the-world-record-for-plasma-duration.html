The end goal is to control the plasma, which is naturally unstable, while ensuring that all plasma-facing components are able to withstand its radiation without malfunctioning or polluting it.</p><p><img src="https://ntietz.com/english/PublishingImages/Pages/News/nuclear-fusion-west-beats-the-world-record-for-plasma-duration/Vue-west-hall-tore.jpg" alt="WEST, the tokamak run by the CEA " title="WEST, the tokamak run by the CEA  © L. Godart/CEA" id="img_94elihk3"/> </p><p>WEST, the tokamak run by the CEA  © L. Godart/CEA</p><p>This is what CEA researchers intend to achieve and what explains the current record. Over the coming months, the WEST team will double down on its efforts to achieve very long plasma durations – up to several hours combined – but also to heat the plasma to even higher temperatures with a view to approaching the conditions expected in fusion plasmas.</p><p><strong>WEST is a CEA facility that benefits from the commission’s decades of experience in the use of tokamaks to study plasmas</strong>. It welcomes researchers from around the world, who make use of its key characteristics that allow long-duration plasmas, particularly its superconducting coils and actively cooled components. WEST is one facet of an international movement comprising other major experiments in which CEA researchers are heavily involved, such as JET, the Joint European Torus tokamak in the United Kingdom (closed in late 2023), which holds the record for fusion energy, JT-60SA in Japan, EAST in China, and KSTAR in South Korea, not to mention the flagship machine that is ITER.<br/></p><blockquote></blockquote><h2>What is fusion used for?</h2><p>Nuclear fusion is a technology with the ultimate goal of controlling naturally unstable plasma. It uses even fewer resources and less fuel than fission, which was already very concentrated, and does not produce long-lived radioactive waste.    </p><p>Of the various possible techniques for generating energy, the most advanced is magnetic confinement fusion , where plasma is held in a torus by an intense magnetic field and heated until the hydrogen nuclei fuse. Confinement fusion has been shown by JET to produce fusion power of 15 MW for several seconds.</p><p>France, home to both WEST and ITER, is well-placed to house the first prototype nuclear fusion reactor. Nuclear fusion is a source of energy that exploits nuclear reactions, with many possible complementary aspects with nuclear fission energy and associated techniques relating to neutrons and matter, which are well understood.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the infrastructure needed to produce this energy on a large scale, it is unlikely that fusion technology will make a significant contribution to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. For this, several technological sticking points need to be overcome, and the economic feasibility of this form of energy production must still be demonstrated.</p></div>
