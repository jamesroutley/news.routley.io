    <h1>Ask HN: Freelancer&#39;s Dilemma â€“ Client Won&#39;t Pay Despite Clear Agreement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>I&#39;m a freelancer working on various software development projects through different platforms. Recently, I completed a significant project for a client outside of these platforms, and they&#39;re now refusing to pay the final invoice. Despite having a clear written agreement and delivering everything as agreed, they&#39;re ignoring my emails and calls.</p><p>Has anyone here faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on legal actions, or ways to secure payment upfront in future projects? Appreciate any tips or resources that could help!</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p></div></div></div>
