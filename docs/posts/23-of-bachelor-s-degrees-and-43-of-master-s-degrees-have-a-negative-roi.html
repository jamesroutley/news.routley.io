							<p><span>Is college worth it? Well, it depends on what degree you&#39;re getting and where you&#39;re getting it, according to a new <a href="https://freopp.org/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-563b9cb6ddc5">paper</a> from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP), an economic opportunity think tank.</span></p> <p><span>While more than three-quarters of all bachelor&#39;s degrees have a positive return on investment (ROI), according to the paper, master&#39;s and associate degrees are much riskier bets—with many costing students in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>The paper, by Senior Fellow Preston Cooper, examined data from over 50,000 degree and certificate programs at thousands of American colleges and universities. Cooper&#39;s analysis looked at how much students were earning immediately after graduation, as well as how much they were making 10 years later. The paper also took into account a student&#39;s chance of dropping out when calculating a degree program&#39;s ROI.</span></p> <p><span>In all, Cooper found that 31 percent of students are enrolled in a program with a negative ROI—meaning that &#34;the earnings benefits of the degree are unlikely to fully compensate students for the cost and risk of pursuing post-secondary education.&#34;</span></p> <p><span>However, different kinds of degrees were more likely to have a negative ROI than others. For example, 77 percent of bachelor&#39;s degrees and doctoral and professional degrees have a positive ROI. In contrast, just 57 percent of master&#39;s and associate degree programs have a positive ROI. </span></p> <p><span>For bachelor&#39;s degrees, fine arts, education, and biology programs had the lowest median ROI, while engineering, computer science, and nursing degrees gave students the highest long-term rewards. </span></p> <p><span>However, <a href="https://freopp.wpengine.com/roi-undergraduate/">where college students were enrolled</a> also mattered when it came to ROI. </span><span>For example, an English degree from the University of Virginia has a $581,925 positive return on investment—climbing to over $600,000 when only including students who graduated on time. In contrast, students at Virginia Commonwealth University—another public university—who majored in English have a negative $30,000 ROI, with just a $3,624 benefit for those who end up graduating on time.</span></p> <p><span>&#34;When choosing a college and program of study, students should evaluate several key variables that contribute to ROI. The most important is earnings after graduation,&#34; Cooper writes. &#34;Besides starting salary, another critical factor is the institution&#39;s completion rate. While students&#39; individual ability and motivation affects their likelihood of completion, research shows that college quality also has an impact on completion rates.&#34;</span></p> <p><span>Cooper also pointed out just how much federal dollars go toward funding low-value degree programs. He found that 29 percent of the federal funding that went to the programs he studied went to programs with a negative ROI.</span></p> <p><span>&#34;That figure includes $37 billion in Pell Grants, $47 billion in loans to undergraduates, and $39 billion in loans to graduate students,&#34; Cooper writes. &#34;Because ROI is negative for these programs, it&#39;s unlikely that most of those loan dollars will be repaid.&#34; </span></p> <p><span>This latest paper paints a detailed picture of the kinds of concerns prospective students and their families should take into account when deciding whether to enroll in college. While bachelor&#39;s degrees are still a good bet overall, students need to consider what they&#39;ll really get out of <em>both</em> the major they want to study and the school they&#39;ve been accepted into.</span></p>						</div>
