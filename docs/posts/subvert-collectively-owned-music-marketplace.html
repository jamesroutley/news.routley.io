        <p>“Subvert goes beyond
          hopetimism with a meticulously built, actionable framework. Very
          exciting!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Alex Durlak</p>
        <p>“Subvert&#39;s new model of
          collective ownership could shatter the music industry&#39;s outdated
          hierarchy.”</p>
        <p>
            Lindsey Mills</p>
        <p>“Ownership is the
          fundamental tension in platforms and marketplaces. It&#39;s exciting to
          see Subvert address this head-on with a thoughtfully designed
          structure.”</p>
        <p>
            Charles Broskowski</p>
        <p>“Artists and labels
          have succumbed to a hopelessness in the clenches of tech’s strong-arm.
          Subvert is a step forward to fight this default.”</p>

  <p>LEARN:</p>

      <p>Bandcamp&#39;s
        back-to-back acquisitions—first by Epic Games in 2022, then by Songtradr
        in 2023—have its community feeling betrayed and concerned about the
        platform they once relied on. Bandcamp&#39;s trajectory illustrates a
        depressing reality of the contemporary internet: platforms position
        themselves as artist-friendly alternatives, only to seemingly abandon
        their core values and community.</p>
      <p>A cooperative, or
        co-op, is a business owned and democratically controlled by its members.
        Subvert is owned by its membership base of artists, labels, supporters,
        and workers.</p>
      <p>We&#39;re aiming to
        launch Subvert in 2025. Development is underway, and we&#39;re incorporating
        feedback from founding members to shape the platform&#39;s features. We&#39;ll
        provide regular updates through our newsletter and community forums.
      </p>

        <p>Yes. Enter your email to receive a digital version of the zine and
          agree to join our newsletter list.
          </p>
        </div>
      <p>No, there is no
        personal financial liability associated with being a co-op member of
        Subvert. Your liability is limited to your membership contribution.</p>
      <p>We require minimal
        information: your name, a valid email address, and your mailing address.
        This is necessary for maintaining membership records and communications.</p>
      <p>Not at all. Joining
        Subvert doesn&#39;t limit your ability to use other platforms.
      </p>
      <p>No.</p>
