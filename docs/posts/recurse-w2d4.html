<p>After getting into the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/koota">koota</a></p>
<p>Most of my coding time was dedicated towards doing some maintenance and general code pattern making around organizing the parts.</p>
<p>Turns out the simplest way to go about it is to segregate Entity-Component-System by entity, component (&#34;trait&#34;s), and system definitions.</p>
<p>All changes made for the koota migration are captured <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/pull/1">in this pull request</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the &#34;main&#34; method for our game simulation is now organized as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>When the game simulation is started, <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/blob/25097131c24478922eb1637e865c0bb77af8e12d/src/scenes/gameSimulation.ts#L87-L147">do some one-off resource creation</a>. This includes setting up listening for the controller inputs, setting up basic level entities, and setting up the initial state</li>
<li>Set up a method for every tick. Every tick, <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/blob/25097131c24478922eb1637e865c0bb77af8e12d/src/scenes/gameSimulation.ts#L170-L212">run through each of the systems</a> to perform updates on the underlying components per-entity. Concepts that are beginning to merge are &#34;game logic systems&#34; and &#34;draw&#34; systems. The game logic systems depends upon the game state only, and is about making changes to that game state. The &#34;draw&#34; systems then take this processed game state, and determines what to draw on the screen based on this info.</li>
</ol>
<p>While improving basic code organization, some logic was improved as well -- I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_rectangle">axis-aligned bounding boxes</a>, and this was a rather quick way to get collision detection working. I&#39;m happy overall that the bounding box and drawing logic are completely independent of one-another, which feels much better than where I was with working on binary sort a week ago.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-i-m-unhappy-about">Some things I&#39;m unhappy about</h2>
<p>Thinking through what I should do with &#34;systems&#34; <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/blob/25097131c24478922eb1637e865c0bb77af8e12d/src/scenes/gameSimulation/adhocSystems.ts#L17">like this</a>. Here, I am simply calling it an &#39;adhoc&#39; system, and having it operate on a single entity. As designed, functions that receive an entity alone are kind of weird, and probably an anti-pattern. There are &#39;hidden&#39; parts of the contract as-is that say &#34;oh, by the way this better be a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code>-based entity, or this won&#39;t work. These are all code-smells to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the solution is -- turn everything into a system, even if it feels like a one-off. Think if there&#39;s some kind of extractable behavior. For example, perhaps there is something like a &#39;route&#39; that this entity should follow, and there&#39;s a systemic relationship between &#39;routes&#39;, &#39;positions&#39;, and velocities? Perhaps it is really that simple. I&#39;ll give it a shot tomorrow.</p>
<p>On the one hand, in these ambiguous one-off cases, I&#39;m happy to leave it alone. Gives me time to find the right abstraction.</p>
<p>The nice thing here, at least, is that the wrong abstraction does not appear to be as &#39;expensive&#39; as when the same wrong abstraction is selected for in OOP.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-to-work-on-tomorrow">Some things to work on tomorrow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look into turning swarm behavior into a system</li>
<li>Fix controls by using an input queue and handle inputs per-tick</li>
<li>Add some interesting effects, especially lighting
<ul>
<li>since the game logic is completely de-coupled from the view, consider experimenting with other drawing strategies?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>update koota to 0.2.0. I <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/koota/issues/54">posted an issue</a> today, which got fixed by this release.</li>
<li>Perhaps create a github action for building and publishing assets per-merge to main, for long-term tracking of progress</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-things-on-the-horizon">Some things on the horizon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recurse&#39;s &#34;impossible&#34; day. Is that when some kind of client-server interaction should be handled</li>
<li>A game jam -- a game jame is being scheduled for sometime next week, it seems. that would take me off my current project for a bit, but game jams are fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the current code <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/commit/930805e2ba6031396e5df1f2e6c66d4ea3b6ebf5">snapshot</a> of my implementation for the day</p>
