        <p><em>The Future of Innovation Is Open: AOMedia Member Survey Highlights Adoption Trends</em></p>

<p><strong>Wakefield, Mass. — Sept. 15, 2025</strong> —  <a href="https://aomedia.org/" target="_blank">The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia)</a>,
a global collaboration of innovators working together to define and deploy
open standards that power the next generation of media experiences, today
announced the upcoming launch of the next evolution in open video coding: AV2.
Set for a year-end release, AV2 is not only an upgrade to the widely adopted AV1
but also a foundational piece of AOMedia’s future tech stack.</p>

<p>AV2, a generation leap in open video coding and the answer to the world’s growing
streaming demands, delivers significantly better compression performance than
AV1. AV2 provides enhanced support for AR/VR applications, split-screen delivery
of multiple programs, improved handling of screen content, and an ability to
operate over a wider visual quality range. AV2 marks a milestone on the path to
an open, innovative future of media experiences.</p>

<p>“At AOMedia, we believe innovation thrives when it’s open,” said Dr.
Pierre-Anthony Lemieux, Executive Director of AOMedia. “Our standards benefit
from input from innovators worldwide and are developed under a royalty-free
patent policy, bringing next-generation media experiences to more people, faster.
We’re excited to share AV2 with the world, as we continue to lead the way in
shaping the future of media through open collaboration.”</p>

<h2 id="survey-findings-widespread-support-of-av1-and-planned-adoption-of-av2">Survey Findings: Widespread Support of AV1 and Planned Adoption of AV2</h2>

<p>In conjunction with its 10th anniversary, AOMedia released new member survey
findings that underscore strong industry-wide support for its open innovation
model and the widespread adoption of its technologies.</p>

<p>The survey found that 88% of members ranked AV1 as either “extremely critical”
or “important” to their current or future product roadmaps. AOMedia’s
<a href="https://aomedia.org/av1-adoption-showcase/" target="_blank">Adoption Showcase</a>
illustrates the real-world benefits members are achieving through AV1 deployment.
Looking ahead, 53% of AOMedia members surveyed plan to adopt AV2 within 12
months upon its finalization later this year, with 88% expecting to implement it
within the next two years.</p>
