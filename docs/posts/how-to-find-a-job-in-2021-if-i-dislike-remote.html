      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I am pretty extroverted and derive a lot of meaning and enjoyment from working with people IRL, not just across a Slack connection. My previous job went from tolerable to intolerable as a result of the pandemic caused 100% WFH. These days it&#39;s hard to find an in office job, and even when you do, it feels like that would be s red flag anyway, since WFH is seen as a perk by most, or realistically I worry I&#39;m going to go in to the office and be the only one there.<p>I just like being able to grab lunch with coworkers and shoot the shit. I find i care more about my work when I feel more connected to the other people who are affected by it.</p><p>(BTW I don&#39;t mind partial WFH, thats just obviously beneficial for everyone.)</p><p>Are those days just over? Am I doing / thinking about this wrong in some way? Is it not as bad as I think? Are there places out there for weirdos like me?</p></td></tr>
