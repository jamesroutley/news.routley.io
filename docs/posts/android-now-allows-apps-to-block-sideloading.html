A disorganized app you tossed together by sideloading? A face that&#39;s frowning because it&#39;s rolling down a bar held up by app icons? It&#39;s weird, but not quite evocative.</p></figcaption>  </figure>

<p>You might sideload an Android app, or manually install its APK package, if you&#39;re using a custom version of Android that doesn&#39;t include Google&#39;s Play Store. Alternately, the app might be experimental, under development, or perhaps no longer maintained and offered by its developer. Until now, the existence of sideload-ready APKs on the web was something that seemed to be tolerated, if warned against, by Google.</p>
<p>This quiet standstill is being shaken up by a new feature in Google&#39;s Play Integrity API. As <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/play-integrity-sideloading-detection-3480639/">reported by Android Authority</a>, developer tools to push &#34;remediation&#34; dialogs during sideloading <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/f757438a-844f-4c59-8dd4-9a5580a5e23d/">debuted</a> at Google&#39;s I/O conference in May, have begun showing up on users&#39; phones. Sideloaders of apps from the British shop <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/cannot-install-the-new-tesco-clubcard-app-fp4/93824/10">Tesco</a>, fandom app <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Beyblade/comments/16bi9hh/getting_this_message_when_i_open_the_bbx_app/">BeyBlade X</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1833700730349515062?t=BYKpcVNNC-8z7Jems7j37Q&amp;s=19">ChatGPT</a> have reported &#34;Get this app from Play&#34; prompts, which cannot be worked around. An Android gaming handheld user encountered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroid/comments/1dihb9d/how_to_bypass_get_this_app_from_play_on_rp2s/">a similarly worded prompt from <em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> on their device three months ago.</p>
<p>Google&#39;s Play Integrity API is how apps have previously blocked access when loaded onto phones that are in some way modified from a stock OS with all Google Play integrations intact. Recently, a popular two-factor authentication app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/loss-of-popular-2fa-tool-puts-security-minded-grapheneos-in-a-paradox/">blocked access on rooted phones</a>, including the security-minded GrapheneOS. Apps can call the Play Integrity API and get back an &#34;integrity verdict,&#34; relaying if the phone has a &#34;trustworthy&#34; software environment, has Google Play Protect enabled, and passes other software checks.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Graphene has questioned <a href="https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide">the veracity of Google&#39;s Integrity API and SafetyNet Attestation systems</a>, recommending instead <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-key-attestation">standard Android hardware attestation</a>. Rahman notes that apps do not have to take an all-or-nothing approach to integrity checking. Rather than block installation entirely, apps could call on the API only during sensitive actions, issuing a warning there. But not having a Play Store connection can also deprive developers of metrics, allow for installation on incompatible devices (and resulting bad reviews), and, of course, open the door to paid app piracy.</p>

<h2>“Unknown distribution channels” blocked</h2>
<p>Google&#39;s developer video about &#34;Automatic integrity protection&#34; (at the <a href="https://youtu.be/RccJYep2v5I?si=XMuw3sBdM64cC2BH&amp;t=745">12-minute, 24-second mark on YouTube</a>) notes that &#34;select&#34; apps have access to automatic protection. This adds an automatic checking tool to your app and the &#34;strongest version of Google Play&#39;s anti-tamper protection.&#34; &#34;If users get your protected app from an unknown distribution channel,&#34; a slide in the presentation reads, &#34;they&#39;ll be prompted to get it from Google Play,&#34; available to &#34;select Play Partners.&#34;</p>
<p>Last year, Google introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/android-will-now-scan-sideloaded-apps-for-malware-at-install-time/">malware scanning of sideloaded apps</a> at install time. Google and Apple have come out against legislation that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/apple-and-google-seem-spooked-by-bill-requiring-more-app-stores-and-sideloading/">broaden sideloading rights for smartphone owners</a>, citing security and reliability concerns. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/05/apple-must-open-ipados-to-sideloading-within-6-months-eu-says/">European regulators forced Apple</a> earlier this year to allow for sideloading apps and app stores, though with fees and geographical restrictions in place.</p>
