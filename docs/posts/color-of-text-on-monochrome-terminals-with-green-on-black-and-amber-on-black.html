<p>I am wondering what were the color shades and brightness of the text appearing on classic monochrome terminals?</p>
<p>If I were to recreate approximately the green-text-on-black-screen or amber-text-on-black-screen in the user-interface of an app on modern computers, what color should I use for such text?</p>
<p>Any idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RGB</a> values of such text? Brightness?</p>
<p>Photographs of computer stations from that era seem to have very poor color fidelity. So I am left wondering… and asking.</p>

<p>Based on the phosphors used for green and amber screens, <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1206781/414739">this answer</a> on Super User gives the following values:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rctk9.png" alt="green/amber RGB values"/></p>

<p><em>i.e.</em> #FFB000 for dark amber, #FFCC00 for light amber, and variations around #33FF33 or #66FF66 for green.</p>

<p>Additionally, colours vary with brightness adjustments and with the age of the phosphors.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that reproduction of colours isn&#39;t consistent across current generation monitors. Thus, even if the values in this answer are used, what each person will see on their screen will be slightly different than what another person will see with different hardware. For applications where accurate color reproduction is important, there are monitors/software/systems/test hardware which can be used to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=calibrate+color+gamut" rel="noreferrer">calibrate the colour gamut of the monitor</a> in order to more accurately reproduce colours.</p>

<p>If your aim is to recreate more closely the effect of an old CRT (at the expense of readability), whatever color you choose based on the previous answer, you should consider using a very bright (almost white) color for the text itself, and then using the chosen color as a glowing neon-like effect <em>around</em> the outline of the text.</p>

<p>For example, here is what you can obtain based on the #00FF66 color:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vw0AQ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vw0AQ.png" alt="Simulation of phosphor bleed"/></a></p>

<p>As a reference, here is the CSS style that corresponds to the above effect:</p>

<pre><code>font-size: 30px;
color: #f0fff8; /* almost white */
text-shadow: 0 0 3px #80ffc0, 0 0 10px #00ff66, 0 0 20px #00ff66, 0 0 30px #00ff66;
</code></pre>

<p>Using multiple shadows with increasing radius makes for a better effect. Also note the first, small radius (3px) shadow is also chosen in a color closer to white.</p>

<p>And the font I used is <a href="http://sensi.org/~svo/glasstty/" rel="noreferrer">Glass TTY VT220</a> (cool font by the way, and public domain).</p>

<p>Here is a real image of an old computer (I don&#39;t even know what it is, it looks like a french minitel) where you can see the text is actually very bright, and the general appearance looks very close from what I recreated above (maybe more cyan-ish than green-ish, but we clearly see the glow):</p>

<p>I dimly recall these two specific hue frequencies were picked because the human eye focuses them the most accurately.  Other colors would focus in front of or behind the retina.</p>

<p>A modern RGB green is pretty close to the right color of green, I believe so can be used as is.</p>

<p>Recreating the old amber on an RGB screen <strong>does not work</strong> because it generates not a single easy-to-focus amber wavelength, but two <em>different</em> wavelengths, one of green and one of red, that definitely do not focus at the same distance, and further won&#39;t be bent the same by the glasses of an eyeglass wearer, thus separating into separate red and green characters.  You can create a color that seems to be the same, if you want, but it will lack the key property of the original of being easy on the eyes.</p>

<p>Outside the scope of your question, but since RGB&#39;s green channel is so sharply-focused on the retina, you can make equally easy-to-focus text with any foreground you want.  The background should simply use the same R and B channels, and have the G channel be 0 or maximum, whichever is farther from the foreground&#39;s G channel.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s kind of an impossible question, since (as others have mentioned), it is entirely dependent on the monitor that you are trying to recreate it on.  In fact, I have two identical monitors, HP Compaq LA2306x, side-by-side, with identical settings.  If I drag any image/window/text to where I can see part on one monitor and part on the other, there is a clear difference in appearance, even if viewed from the same angle.  One is older than the other, so maybe that is the reason, but that just points out another variable to color perception.  One uses Thunderbolt conversion to VGA, and the other uses HDMI converted to DisplayPort, so that could be the cause, but again, that only points out more variables.</p>

<p>I have never seen an amber display, but I have seen a whole lot of different hues of green - yellow-ish, blue-ish, cyan-ish, white-ish, deep green, probably whatever the tube maker had left for the mix. And I am even not sure that the &#34;deep green&#34; I remember is at all possible to represent by all-positive RGB values.</p>

<p>An important aspect to represent is the phosphor persistence - the pixels fading in slow fashion (1/10..1/2s) after being illuminated. Some of them even faded to warmer color before going completely dark.</p>

<p>Green screens are still used today, in bank environments IBM iSeries systems are still popular. These terminals are not monochrome anymore, are software based (emulated), but basically they are just old green screens. If you do image search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iseries%20green%20screen&amp;newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">&#39;iseries green screen</a>&#39; you can find this colorfull example:</p>
