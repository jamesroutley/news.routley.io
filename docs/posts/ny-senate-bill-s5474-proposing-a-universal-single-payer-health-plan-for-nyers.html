 AN ACT to amend the public health law and  the  state  finance  law,  in
   relation  to  enacting  the &#34;New York health act&#34; and establishing New
   York Health
 
   THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
   Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the &#34;New York health act&#34;.
   ยง 2. Legislative  findings  and  intent.  1.  The  state  constitution
 states:  &#34;The  protection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants
 of the state are matters of public concern and provision therefor  shall
 be made by the state and by such of its subdivisions and in such manner,
 and by such means as the legislature shall from time to time determine.&#34;
 (Article  XVII,  ยง3.)  The legislature finds and declares that all resi-
 dents of the state have the right to health care.    While  the  federal
 Affordable  Care Act brought many improvements in health care and health
 coverage, it still leaves many New  Yorkers  without  coverage  or  with
 inadequate coverage.  Millions of New Yorkers do not get the health care
 they  need  or face financial obstacles and hardships to get it. That is
 not acceptable.  There is no plan other than the  New  York  health  act
 that  will  enable  New  York state to meet that need.  New Yorkers - as
 individuals, employers, and taxpayers - have experienced a rise  in  the
 cost  of  health  care  and  coverage  in recent years, including rising
 premiums, deductibles and co-pays, restricted provider networks and high
 out-of-network charges.  Many New Yorkers go without health care because
 they cannot afford it or suffer financial hardship to  get  it.    Busi-
