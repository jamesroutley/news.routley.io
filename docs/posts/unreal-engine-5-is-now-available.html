    <h1>Unreal Engine 5 is now available</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>The wait is over—we’re very excited to announce that Unreal Engine 5 is now available to download! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>Key new features</h3>

<h4><strong>Next-generation real-time rendering</strong></h4><p>
Unreal Engine 5 introduces a collection of groundbreaking features for rendering real-time worlds in incredible high-fidelity detail.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Specifically designed to work well with Lumen and Nanite, <strong>Virtual Shadow Maps (VSMs) </strong>provide plausible soft shadows with reasonable, controllable performance costs. Nanite and VSMs intelligently stream and process only the detail you can perceive, largely removing poly count and draw call constraints, and eliminating time-consuming work like baking details to normal maps and manually authoring LODs—freeing you up to concentrate on creativity. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>When time is of the essence, why reinvent the wheel? In UE5, an entirely new retargeting toolset enables you to quickly and easily reuse and augment existing animations. With <strong>IK Retargeter</strong>, you can transfer animations between characters with different skeletons and proportions—you could even retarget a human’s animation to a wolf, for example. Meanwhile, IK Rig enables you to do things like adjusting a character’s animation additively, such as making a moving character always look at a target.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>To free up more space for viewport interactions while still keeping tools and content within easy reach, we’ve added the ability to easily <strong>summon and stow the Content Browser</strong> via a hotkey or button and to dock any editor tab to a collapsible sidebar. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h4><strong>And that’s not all!</strong></h4><p>
These are just a few of the highlights of Unreal Engine 5. To see all the new features and enhancements, check out the release notes. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><em>Some features are Beta, and should not be considered production-ready. See the release notes for details.</em></span></p><hr/></div>
</div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><h2><p>UE5 sample projects</p>
</h2><div><div><div><p>To help you explore all the new features in Unreal Engine 5, we’re offering two free sample projects for you to download.
</p><hr/></div>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><h4><strong>Lyra Starter Game</strong></h4><p>
Lyra Starter Game is a sample gameplay project built alongside UE5 development to serve as an excellent starting point for creating new games, as well as a hands-on learning resource. We plan to continue to upgrade this living project with future releases to demonstrate our latest best practices.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><h4><strong>City Sample</strong></h4><p>
The City Sample is a free downloadable sample project that reveals how the city scene from <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/introducing-the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience" target="_blank">The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience</a> was built. The project—which consists of a complete city with buildings, vehicles, and crowds of MetaHuman characters—demonstrates how we used new and improved systems in Unreal Engine 5 to create the experience. In addition to the complete sample, the content is available in separate packs, so you can download just the vehicles, for example. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><h2><p>More UE5-ready content</p>
