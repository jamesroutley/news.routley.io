    <h1>Email is tough: Major European Payment Processor&#39;s Emails rejected by GWorkspace</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Viva.com, one of Europe&#39;s largest payment processors, sends verification emails without a Message-ID header — a recommendation of RFC 5322 since 2008. Google Workspace rejects them outright. Their support team&#39;s response to my detailed bug report: &#34;your account has a verified email, so there&#39;s no problem.&#34;</p><hr/><p>A few days ago, I tried to create an account on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://viva.com">viva.com</a>, one of Europe&#39;s largest payment processors. It should have taken five minutes. Instead, it turned into a small investigation — and left me with some bigger questions about the state of European fintech infrastructure.</p><h2 id="the-verification-email-that-never-arrived"><a href="#the-verification-email-that-never-arrived" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>The verification email that never arrived</h2><p>The signup flow is standard: enter your email, receive a verification link, click it, move on with your life. Except the verification email never showed up. Not in my inbox, not in spam, not anywhere. I waited. I retried. I waited some more.</p><p>My email is hosted on Google Workspace — a corporate email on a custom domain. Not exactly an exotic setup. After a couple of days of retrying, I decided to dig into Google Workspace&#39;s Email Log Search to see what was happening on the receiving end.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I found:</p><p><strong>Status: Bounced.</strong></p><p>The bounce reason:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>550</span> <span>5.7</span><span>.1</span> <span>[</span><span>209.85</span><span>.220</span><span>.69</span><span>]</span> <span>Messages</span> missing a valid <span>Message</span><span>-</span><span>ID</span> header are not

</span></code></pre></div><p>Viva.com&#39;s outgoing verification emails lack a <code>Message-ID</code> header, a requirement that has been part of the Internet Message Format specification (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.4">RFC 5322</a>) since 2008, and was already suggested by its predecessor RFC 2822 back in 2001.</p><p>Google&#39;s mail servers reject the message outright. It doesn&#39;t even get a chance to land in spam.</p><h2 id="the-workaround"><a href="#the-workaround" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>The workaround</h2><p>To unblock myself, I switched to a personal <code>@gmail.com</code> address for the account. Gmail&#39;s own receiving infrastructure is apparently more lenient with messages, or perhaps routes them differently. The verification email came through.</p><p>But the fact that I had to abandon my preferred business email to sign up for a <em>business payments platform</em> is... not great.</p><h2 id="the-support-experience"><a href="#the-support-experience" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>The support experience</h2><p>Of course, I reported the issue to viva.com&#39;s customer support, including the screenshot from Google Workspace&#39;s email logs and a clear explanation of the <code>Message-ID</code> header problem — enough detail for any engineer to immediately reproduce and fix it.</p><p>They responded within a few hours. Their answer:</p><blockquote><p>&#34;We can see your account now has a verified email address, so there doesn&#39;t appear to be an issue.&#34;</p></blockquote><p>That was it. No acknowledgment of the technical problem. No escalation to engineering. Just a confirmation that <em>I</em> had worked around <em>their</em> bug, repackaged as evidence that nothing was wrong.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters"><a href="#why-this-matters" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>Why this matters</h2><p>This isn&#39;t a cosmetic bug. <code>Message-ID</code> is one of the most basic headers in email. Every email library, every framework, every transactional email service generates it by default. You have to go out of your way to <em>not</em> include it — or be running a seriously misconfigured mail pipeline.</p><p><em>(A note, in fairness: RFC 5322 uses &#34;SHOULD&#34; rather than &#34;MUST&#34; for the Message-ID header, meaning it&#39;s strongly recommended but not strictly required. So technically, viva.com&#39;s emails are non-compliant with a recommendation, not a mandate. Meanwhile, Google treats it as a hard requirement. Who&#39;s in the right? I genuinely don&#39;t know. What I do know is that I&#39;m caught in the middle, and my verification email is in neither inbox.)</em></p><p>For a company that processes payments across Europe, this raises a question: if they can&#39;t get email headers right, what does the rest of the stack look like?</p><p>I&#39;m not asking rhetorically. As someone building a business in Greece, I <em>need</em> a reliable payments processor. Viva.com is one of the few that natively supports the the Greek instant-payment system. Stripe, which I&#39;d use in a heartbeat, doesn&#39;t support it yet. So here I am, forced to depend on infrastructure that can&#39;t pass basic RFC compliance checks.</p><h2 id="the-broader-pattern"><a href="#the-broader-pattern" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>The broader pattern</h2><p>This experience fits a pattern I keep running into with European business-facing APIs and services. Something is always a little bit broken. Documentation is incomplete, or packaged as a nasty PDF, edge cases are unhandled, error messages are misleading, and when you report issues, the support team doesn&#39;t have the technical depth to understand what you&#39;re telling them.</p><p>I don&#39;t think this is because European engineers are less capable. I think it&#39;s a prioritization problem. When you&#39;re the only option in a market (or one of very few), there&#39;s less competitive pressure to polish the developer experience. Stripe raised the bar globally, but in markets it doesn&#39;t fully serve, the bar remains remarkably low.</p><p>I miss Stripe. I miss the feeling of integrating with an API that someone clearly <em>cared</em> about. Until Stripe or a Stripe-caliber alternative covers the full European payments landscape, including local payment rails like IRIS, stories like this one will keep happening.</p><h2 id="the-fix"><a href="#the-fix" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>The fix</h2><p>For viva.com&#39;s engineering team, in case this reaches you: add a <code>Message-ID</code> header to your outgoing transactional emails. It should look something like:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>Message</span><span>-</span><span>ID</span><span>:</span> <span>&lt;</span>unique<span>-</span>id@viva<span>.</span><span>com</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Most email libraries generate this automatically. If yours doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s a one-line fix. Your Google Workspace users (and I suspect there is a number of us) will thank you.</p><h2 id="google-workspaces-email-log-search"><a href="#google-workspaces-email-log-search" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span></span></a>Google Workspace&#39;s Email Log Search</h2><p><img alt="A screenshot of Google Workspace&#39;s Email Log Search" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fblog%2F2026%2Fviva-email-log.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fblog%2F2026%2Fviva-email-log.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atha.io/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fblog%2F2026%2Fviva-email-log.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75"/></p></div></div>
