    <h1>Belenios: Verifiable online voting system</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
	Belenios aims at providing an easy to use voting system,
	guaranteeing state-of-the-art security, namely vote privacy
	and verifiability. It can be used in many types of elections (including referendums),
	ranging from scientific councils to sport associations.  </p><p>The main goal of this release is to correct an issue raised
          by Olivier Pereira regarding the implementation of the
          Distributed Key Generation (DKG) scheme in the threshold
          mode, that is when the election key is distributed among n
          trustees, with a threshold of k trustees to decrypt the election. This is now fixed by adding an extra signature
          field. As a side effect, new elections should be monitored
          with this additional signature check and our verification tools
          have been updated accordingly. We are very grateful to
	Olivier Pereira for reporting this issue. </p><div>
     <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.5</p>
          <p>2024-03-08</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>This release includes a restricted mode, that enforces
          all the security options (e.g. external credential
          authority, external decrytion authorities) needed to comply with
          the security requirements of a security target, in view of a
          <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/presentation-de-la-certification-de-securite-de-premier-niveau-cspn">CSPN</a> evaluation. This restricted mode can be activated when
          installing an instance of Belenios on a server.</p>
     <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.4</p>
          <p>2024-01-24</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>Voters no longer have to enter their credential, since
          it is now included in the (private) link to the election
	that is sent to them. Moreover, to comply with best-practice recommendations, the length of
          the credentials has been increased.</p>
	<p>The experience for the election administrator has been
          improved with slight changes.</p>
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.3</p>
          <p>2023-10-01</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>The main visible change is that the
   format of private credentials has changed, to include individual
	salts in credential derivation, for more security. The old format is still supported
   for existing elections, but new ones will use the new
	format.</p>
	<p>Following requests from election administrators, private credentials
          are now sent later one, once the election is ready. This
          allows election administrators to entirely set up an
          election without sending the credentials (yet).</p>
	      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.2</p>
          <p>2023-08-30</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>Belenios now features a new admin interface to set up
          elections, in an experimental mode for the moment. This interface is more intuitive and easy to
          use. Feel free to try this new interface and report your
          feedback on belenios-discuss@inria.fr.</p>

	<p>We have also added support for STV elections in preferential
      voting. Other changes encompass e.g. various optimizations for handling elections with around 30k
   voters.</p>
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.1</p>
          <p>2023-02-28</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>Belenios now supports and uses elliptic curves
          (Ed25519). Several changes have also been made on the web
	platform:
	</p><ul><li>Decryption trustee can know check that they correctly
          save their private key. There is no need to organize a mock
	  election.</li>
	  <li>Voters no longer need to enter their email address when
	  casting their vote.</li>
	  <li>Voter list can be added in JSON format.</li>
	  <li>It is possible to use basic &lt; i &gt;  and &lt; b &gt; markup (GitHub issue #66).</li>
	</ul> 
	
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 2.0</p>
          <p>2022-12-06</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> A major evolution of Belenios has just been
	released. While the main changes are not visible to end
	users, this new version introduces a new election format where
	election events (e.g. ballots submission) are chained to each
	other. This prepares a next version where the server will be
	able to commit to the current content of an election.</p>

	<p>The main visible change is the fact that the last confirmation
	step of the voting phase has been removed. <span> @election admin:</span>
	make sure you inform your voters that this is perfectly
	normal. You may also want to update your documentation
	accordingly. </p>

	<p>From a protocol point of view and for more robustness, the credential authority now
	sends to the server, during the setup, the
	correspondence between public credentials and voters.</p>

	<p>The API support has also been improved in order to support a
	future new version of the administration interface.</p>

      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.20</p>
          <p>2022-10-20</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> The new release includes various improvements and
	fixes. The html tag &lt;br&gt; in election metadata is handled in
	more places. The monitoring has been improved with random
	orders of HTTP requests. A bug has been fixed in the
	computation of the Condorcet 
	winners.</p>

      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.19</p>
          <p>2022-05-10</p>
        </div>
        

	<p>In order to facilitate monitoring elections, pages served
	to credential authority and trustees are now constant. The
	instructions for the authorities have been updated and
	reinforced. </p>

	<p>Belenios 1.19 also solves several issues raised on GitHub, in
	particular regarding the mailto links. New languages have been
	added: Lithuanian, Spanish (Latin America).</p>

	
      <div>
          <p>New Belenios server</p>
          <p>2022-03-18</p>
        </div>
        

	<p>We have deployed a new <a href="https://vote.belenios.org/admin">Belenios public
	server</a>, hosted at 
	OVH, which should (hopefully) offer better availability. New
	elections should now preferably be created on this
	server. Accounts and elections on the old server will not be
	automatically migrated to the new server. You will have to
	create a new account.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://belenios.loria.fr/admin">old server</a> will remain online for a while but
	progressively, account creation and election creation will be
	disabled.</p>

	  
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.18</p>
          <p>2021-11-24</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Belenios 1.18 now proposes the new voting booth by
	default. The new booth is prettier and more responsive, but may lack some
translations; we invite administrators to use the booth preview feature
to see if the new booth fits their needs. The old booth can still be
	selected on the question edition page.</p>

	<p>The new release also includes several bug fixes (e.g. case
	sensitivity issues in logins) and supports new operations on
	the REST API (under development).</p>
      <div>
	
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.17</p>
          <p>2021-09-07</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> One of the main changes in Belenios 1.17 is actually
	invisible to its users: the cryptographic operations have been
	modified to avoid (theoretical) weaknesses. In particular, the
	link between a ballot and the corresponding election has been
	strengthened.</p>

	<p> Moreover, Belenios now fully supports preferential elections
	tallied with the Condorcet-Schulze method. A new,
	user-friendly, voting interface has been developed to rank
	candidates. More information <a href="https://www.belenios.org/Condorcet.html">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, administrators accounts are now associated with a
	profile. As a consequence, administrators will be
asked an e-mail address on first login if the system cannot determine
one. This e-mail address is used to initialize the contact for new
elections. The default public name of the administrator for new
elections can also be modified.
     </p>
      <div>
	
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.16</p>
          <p>2021-07-19</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Belenios now includes several new features.
	</p><ul>
	  <li>A new voting interface has been introduced both for
	standard elections (where voters select candidates among a
	list) and Majority Judgement (where voters rank candidates).</li>
	  <li>The default authentication for voters is now with an email with a short
code during the voting process. The previous default (an email with a
complex password sent in advance) is still available, but needs an
	explicit action to be used.</li>
	<li> Due to several requests, <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt> are now interpreted
        in the classical voting interface as line breaks in election names,
	descriptions, questions and answers.</li>
	</ul>
     

    <div>
          <p>Donations are welcome</p>
          <p>2021-06-25</p>
        </div>
        
	<p>We now welcome donations, in the first place to support
	our infrastructure costs and also to partly cover our
	development costs. You will find <a href="https://www.belenios.org/donations.html">here</a> more information on how to donate
          and how donations are used.
      </p>
      
      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.15</p>
          <p>2021-05-04</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> The new release of Belenios includes several features
	requested by users.
	</p><ul>
	  <li>Belenios now officially support weighted votes. In other
	words, voters may have several votes, according to the rules
	of the election.  You just have to indicate the number of votes of each voter (her &#34;weight&#34;) in the electoral list, in the form mail,login,weight or mail,,weight. </li>
	  <li>Credentials and passwords now have a different format to
	avoid confusion.</li>
	<li>So many elections were deleted by mistake ... we removed
	the misleading &#34;archive&#34; button in most cases.</li>
      </ul><p>
     Moreover, thanks to the <a href="https://www.belenios.org/translation.html">translation effort</a>, new languages have
	been introduced, namely Greek (el), Dutch (nl), Slovak (sk), Finnish (fi), Polish (pl).
      </p>

      <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.13</p>
          <p>2020-12-02</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> The new release of Belenios suports two main new features:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>The aministrator interface is available in several
	languages and new languages have been introduced at least for
	the voter interface: Norwegian Bokmål (nb), Spanish (es), Ukrainian (uk),
	  Czech (cs), Occitan (oc). Your <a href="https://www.belenios.org/translation.html">help for translation</a> is still
	welcome since several languages are incomplete and we
	continuously introduce new parts.</li>
	  <li>If you wish to use alternative voting methods, our
	server now supports Condorcet-Schulze, Majority Judgment and Single
   Transferable Vote. More information can be found <a href="https://www.belenios.org/mixnet.html">here</a>.
	Note that you can still apply any other method
	using your own algorithm applied to the raw ballots produced
	from the tally.</li>
      </ul><p>
      Some more technical changes have also been made in the key
	management. In particular, now the key of the server is always
	needed to decrypt, even in the threshold mode.
	</p>
      
      <div>
          <p>Multi-languages hosted on Weblate</p>
          <p>2020-10-29</p>
        </div>
        

	<p>Belenios is available in a few languages for voters and for
	the administrator of the election. We need you help to pursue
	this effort. We have hosted our translation files on <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/belenios/">weblate</a>.
You can easily create an account and contribute. We have written a few
	<a href="https://www.belenios.org/translation.html">guidelines</a> on how to best translate Belenios. Your help will be
	very valuable to our project!
	</p>
	
        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.12</p>
          <p>2020-08-31</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> The main change is a bug fix: some users reported that
	they were blocked when voting. This was due to a bad
	interaction with some browser extensions. This is now corrected.
	</p>

        <div>
          <p>Security analysis of Belenios (in French)</p>
          <p>2020-06-02</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> We provide a security analysis of Belenios, mainly
	w.r.t. the criteria defined by the CNIL (Commission Nationale
	de l&#39;Informatique et des Libertés). Since these
	criteria are somewhat specific to French regulations, the document is written
	in French. It can be found <a href="https://www.belenios.org/analyse-secu.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>

        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.11</p>
          <p>2020-05-26</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> One important feature of the new release is that the main page of the
	election now includes verification
	material for election authorities and voters. In particular, the
	number and names of decryption trustees are displayed as well as a hash
	of the voter list and all public and verification keys. The instructions
	on what to check and how are spelled out <a href="https://www.belenios.org/instructions.html">here</a> (or <a href="https://www.belenios.org/instructions-fr.html">here</a> for the French version) for each
	party (trustees, electoral commission, credential authority,
	administrator, voters).
	</p>

	
        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.10</p>
          <p>2019-12-09</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> We have added mixnets to Belenios. What does this mean?
	You can now organize any type of elections, e.g. where voters
	rank candidates by order of preference or provide a grade. In
	the mixnet mode (still experimental), the raw ballots are
	provided at the end of the election, in a random order, to
	protect privacy. You can then apply your favorite counting
	methods (e.g. STV, Condorcet, or majority judgement) to
	compute the winner.
	More information on how to use Belenios for alternative
	voting can be found <a href="https://www.belenios.org/mixnet.html">here</a>.
	Note
	that Belenos still supports the previous homomorphic mode,
	which is more convenient (and efficient) in case of elections where voters
	simply select some number of candidates among a list.
	</p>
	
        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.9</p>
          <p>2019-05-28</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Belenios 1.9 now includes the possibility to temporarily hide the result from the
     public (e.g. to delay the announcement of the winner). We have also fixed some bugs.
	</p>
	
       <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.8</p>
          <p>2019-02-04</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> 
	The new version 1.8 of Belenios includes two main changes.
	</p><ul>
	  <li>To use our platform as an election administrator, you may now create
an account online (select public mode).</li>
	  <li>The threshold encryption mode is now fully integrated to our platform.
For example, the decryption key may be split among 3 authorities such
that 2 suffice for decryption, as recommanded by the CNIL. Any other
	  combination can be chosen of course.</li>
	</ul>

        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.7</p>
          <p>2018-11-26</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> The main visible change of Belenios 1.7 is that elections can now be
archived and/or deleted, according to our policy regarding <a href="http://www.belenios.org/data-Belenios-en.pdf">data
management</a> (click <a href="http://www.belenios.org/data-Belenios-fr.pdf">here</a> for the French version). In particular, all elections will be
deleted after one year. An archive of the election may be
previously saved by the administrator of the election.
	</p>

        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.6</p>
          <p>2018-06-13</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> This new version of Belenios includes changes mandated by
	the new GDPR regulation. </p>

        <div>
          <p>Release of Belenios 1.5</p>
          <p>2017-12-14</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Belenios 1.5 has been released and integrated to our voting platform. It is
now possible to set the server as one of the trustees in charge of the
decryption keys. Note that supported languages are now English, French,
German, Italian, and Romanian.
</p>

         <div>
          <p>Fully open voting platform</p>
          <p>2016-09-01</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Our on-line voting platform can now be easily used to set up an
	election by login using your Google account (or the INRIA CAS server).
	</p>

        <div>
          <p>Multi language available</p>
          <p>2016-09-01</p>
        </div>
        

	<p> Voters can now vote in their favorite language (among
	English, French, and German). More languages to come soon! If
	you need another language for an important election, you may
	also contact us.
	</p>

	
        

	<p> The latest version of our Belenios software is
	<a href="https://www.belenios.org/software.html">available</a>. With
	this sofware, you may run an election on your own server.

          <p>2015-09-15</p>
        </div>
        

         <p> The first release of our on-line platform
            is up. No need to install software anymore. You can set up an
            election simply through our interface. Note however that
            this interface is still under development. Therefore the
            access is granted through the INRIA CAS server or on
            request. Stay tuned for the release of our fully open
            voting platform! To learn about the new developments of
