    <h1>Quake 1 potential original font</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-body="true" data-testid="post-body"><p>Some time last year while watching a video I got jumpscared by a logo that used a font that is immediately recognizable as <!-- --><em>the Quake font<!-- --></em>, and they used it at the very least 20+ years before Quake 1 even came out. This made me realize that <!-- --><em>the Quake font<!-- --></em> wasn&#39;t drawn completely from scratch and that it&#39;s probably possible to find it, most likely in a book or a digitization by someone.<!-- --></p><div><hr/>

<!-- --><p>edit: According to <!-- --><a href="http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44242.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Luc Devroye&#39;s &#34;On Snot and Fonts&#34;<!-- --></a>, original Visa font&#39;s designer is Raphael Boguslav.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p>His typeface Avia (VGC) was an expansion of a logofont he did for Abex Corporation, almost like a stencil. It is now at Font Bureau, where Jill Pichotta has added the Light and Bold in 2000. His typeface Visa (1966, VGC) won the Second Prize in the 1966 VGC National Type Face Design Competition. Others (thanks, Alexander Tochilovsky) confirm what I thought---that Visa and Avia are the same thing.<!-- --></p>
