<h4>2019: You can download a copy of your information stored by organizations</h4>
	<div>
		<p><span>You will be able to review your own information stored with different organizations and download it as a (certified) PDF. This file will only be a copy of your information. The data itself will still be stored by that organization. You will be able to then share that pdf file with whomever you choose. For instance, download information about your student loans from the bank and share it with your mortgage advisor. A disadvantage is that this will always be a snapshot of your information and not necessarily always up-to-date.</span></p>

<h4>2023: With Schluss, you decide who an organization shares your information with</h4>
	<div>
		<p><span>Your information is still stored by organizations themselves, such as the bank, the government, the doctor. Only, you decide who they are allowed to share that information with. For instance, you let your doctor share part of your medical information with the pharmacist. This you manage right in your Schluss-vault. What comes in really handy is that whenever the doctor modifies any part of your information, the pharmacist is automatically updated as well.</span></p>

<h4>2025: Organizations store information about you in your Schluss-vault</h4>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>Organizations store information about you directly in your digital vault. They do not store information about you in their databases themselves. Furthermore, you decide who else can view that information. Does some other organization need information about you? You then get a request. In it it is explained what they need to know and for what purpose. You then give permission for your information to be disclosed. Or not, of course.</p>
<p>Read in ‘our dream’ why it is so important that you get back in control of your own information.</p>
