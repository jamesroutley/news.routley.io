    <h1>Design for 3D-Printing</h1>

  <p>Over the past years, I have gotten deeper and deeper into 3d-printing.  One
thing that fascinates me a lot is how different it is from other manufacturing
methods.  And how this, in turn, means a completely different design philosophy
is needed to create good designs for 3d-printing.</p>
<p>As such, I have been collecting the little tricks and rules for designing
well-printable parts.  And of course I am always on the hunt for more.  In this
blog post I want to share all that I have learned.</p>

<p><span>

<span id="continue-reading"></span></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>While a lot can be found online about the basics of design for 3d-printing,
there is not that much material that dives into it in-depth.  And even less
common are good overviews that collect all the little tricks that people have
discovered.</p>
<p>I believe the best format for teaching the rules of well-printable design is a
format that is built on rules of thumb and many practical examples.  While such
heuristic rules will never encompass the whole complexity of the real world, I
think they can provide a tangible guide towards the best solution in each
situation.  They also provide a starting point for building your own intuition
about the topic.</p>
<p>This approach is close in spirit to the german book <em>Konstruktionspraxis im
Maschinenbau</em> by Gerhard Hoenow and Thomas Meißner (<a href="https://www.hanser-kundencenter.de/fachbuch/artikel/9783446464858">Hanser
Fachbuch</a>, ISBN 978-3-446-46485-8). The book follows
the same philosophy, but for traditional manufacturing methods.  If you like
this style, that book might interest you as well.</p>
<h4 id="scope">Scope<a href="#scope"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Before diving in, a few words about the scope of this blog post:  First, I am
explicitly focusing on FDM/FFF printing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">Wikipedia</a>).  A lot of
the rules are specifically tied to the restrictions of this process and do not
apply to other additive manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>Second, I am focusing on designing functional parts with optimal mechanical
properties.  These parts should be easy to print, without requiring much
printer fine-tuning.  They should be easy to produce in higher quantity, which
means they should require as little post-processing and waste as little
material as possible.  Aesthetics do not play a primary role, although I firmly
believe that great mechanical design just looks incredibly beautiful :)</p>
<h4 id="goals-of-design-engineering">Goals of Design Engineering<a href="#goals-of-design-engineering"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Any mechanical design ultimately must be optimized for a large number of
objectives and constraints.  Your job as the designer is to create a part that
fits best between them all.</p>
<p>The most universal objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design according to force</strong> — Parts should be designed such that their
geometry is optimal for the forces it has to transmit and withstand.</li>
<li><strong>Design according to manufacturing method</strong> — Often called <em>DFM</em>
(Design For Manufacturing), parts should be designed such that they are
easy to produce.  Little changes, which usually don&#39;t affect functionality,
can often make a part <em>much</em> simpler to manufacture.</li>
<li><strong>Design according to cost</strong> — Parts should be as cheap as possible.
With 3d-printing, this means minimizing material use and print time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, any real world project will have many more objectives and a lot of
other constraints that the design must comply with.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will focus on topics related to design for manufacturing
with a 3d-printer.  In general, the rules for other objectives are the same,
regardless of manufacturing process.  However, there are some places where
3d-printing does influence these other objectives and I will also highlight
such cases.</p>
<p>An important distinction that I need to make at this point is how the approach
of design engineering attacks the problem from the completely opposite side
compared to, for example, slicer developers and 3d-printer manufacturers.
While they aim for improving the manufacturing process itself, to better print
any possible part geometry, a design engineer instead aims for adapting the
part geometry to best work with the current state of the the manufacturing
processes.</p>
<p>To give an example, a design engineer aims to use the most coarse tolerance on
each dimension that still allows the part to function.  A 3d-printer
manufacturer wants their machine to print with the most tight tolerance they
can achieve.  While the design engineer could try making use of this most tight
tolerance, this will make the part impossible to manufacture using cheaper
printers and thus drive up cost and limit possible suppliers for a part.</p>
<p>This can be summarized as aiming for <em>portable design</em>.  A portably designed
part can be printed by anyone on any printer with ease.  If you intend to share
your designs online, this should definitely be a priority.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also important to keep in mind that due to the rapid innovation
in the 3d-printing scene, we are working with a moving target.  As the
3d-printers and slicer software get improved, some of the design rules will
become less important.</p>
<h4 id="terminology">Terminology<a href="#terminology"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>To make sure everyone is on the same page, let&#39;s quickly review the most
important terminology of FFF 3d-printing that will be used in the following
chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layers</strong> — The horizontal cross-sections of a part that are stacked
on top of one another to create the part (<a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#layer-height">Layer height — Prusa
Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Perimeters</strong> — On each layer, the 3d-printer will first print the
outline of the cross-section.  This outline consists of a number of perimeter
lines (<a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/layers-and-perimeters_1748#perimeters">Perimeters — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Shell</strong> — If you think of only the perimeters on each layer, you get
a completely hollow object:  The <em>shell</em> of the part.</li>
<li><strong>Infill</strong> — Inside the perimeters, the 3d-printer &#34;fills&#34; the space
using a partially hollow pattern.  This is the infill pattern (<a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42">Infill
— Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Infill Percentage</strong> — How much of the infill pattern is solid vs.
empty space (<a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill_42">Infill — Prusa Knowledge Base</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Overhang</strong> — When the cross-section of a layer gets larger than the
previous layer, a part of the perimeter lines will not be supported by
material from below.  This is called an <em>overhang</em> and is actually possible
as long as the overhang is not too large.  Mostly, people talk about the
angle of an overhang when looking at the layers from the side.</li>
<li><strong>Bridges</strong> — While overhangs can become problematic, one thing
3d-printers are surprisingly good at is bridging gaps between two supporting
surfaces.  This is called a <em>bridge</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Seam</strong> — The <em>seam</em> is the point where the printer starts and stops
laying a perimeter.  This point is usually well visible as a perfectly smooth
transition is very hard to achieve (<a href="https://help.prusa3d.com/article/seam-position_151069">Seam position — Prusa Knowledge
Base</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-standard-printer-profile">The Standard Printer Profile<a href="#the-standard-printer-profile"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>One final topic before we can dive in.  To achieve the aforementioned <em>portable
designs</em>, it is useful to define a design target for your work.  Namely a rough
outline of the 3d-printer and profile that the design will be printed with.</p>
<p>While most of the following rules are relevant regardless, I will need to make
some assumptions.  Especially for all the numbers I will mention, a design
target is needed for context.  Otherwise values for expectable tolerances and
empirical dimensional recommendations will have no meaning.</p>
<p>As such, here is my definition of the <em>standard printer profile</em>.  Cutting
across the current market of 3d-printers, the vast majority are compatible with
the following expectations.  A lot of the expectations are intentionally kept
quite vague — we must not assume too much, to keep the designs
<em>portable</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard 3d-printer is using an 0.4 mm nozzle.</li>
<li>The standard profile prints at 0.2 mm layer height.</li>
<li>The standard 3d-printer is calibrated such that no considerable dimensional
deviation is caused by error in the steps/mm setting.  Skew between the axes
is negligible.</li>
<li>Print speeds are tuned to an adequate level but we cannot assume the printer
to be free of artifacts like slight overshoot and ringing.</li>
<li>Bridging across reasonable distances is reliable.</li>
<li>Overhangs print fine.</li>
<li>Bed adhesion is adequate and does not pose an issue for non-extreme geometry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1-designing-for-part-strength">1. Designing for Part Strength<a href="#1-designing-for-part-strength"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The first rules I will present are related to designing parts that are as
strong as possible.  In 3d-printing, the strength of a part is inherently tied
to the manufacturing process.  For one, the parts are partly hollow and thus
behave quite differently than a solid block of plastic.  Second, the layered
manufacturing process leads to anisotropic parts — meaning their
mechanical properties differ depending on direction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy#Materials_science_and_engineering">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, beyond general design rules for part strength, a few additional
considerations should be made when designing parts for 3d-printing.</p>
<h4 id="part-orientation">Part Orientation<a href="#part-orientation"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the most obvious:  3d-printed parts are much weaker in the
direction of pulling apart the layers.  Thus, before starting on a design, you
should first consider the direction of tensile forces in your part and use them
to decide on a print orientation.  All further design should then be done with
this print orientation in mind.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R1.1"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R1.1</strong> 
    —
    Tensile forces should be aligned parallel to the print surface.
  </p>
<p>This is probably the number one rule that everyone talks about in design for
3d-printing.  And that is for good reason because the difference it makes is
substantial.  Tests performed by My Tech Fun indicate roughly 3 times more strength in
ideal orientation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiQek0wei1g">YouTube</a>).  While the exact ratio
will depend heavily on the individual part, I think this is a good indicator of
how important this topic is.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="good and bad print orientation" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Screw-Thread-Orientation.png"/></p><p>A threaded part designed for upright printing (not ideal for tensile loading)
and one designed for printing flat on the bed.  By cutting away a part of the
thread, it can be printed lying flat on the print bed, without supports.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>You should also keep in mind that tensile forces are exerted to some cross
section of a part when bending it.  This means that you should also align any
bending moments parallel to the print surface.  A place where this often fails
is printed clips, which bend slightly to clip into their counterpart.  Such
features will break easily when not oriented correctly.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="good and bad orientation of printed clip" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Clip-Orientation.png"/></p><p>Clips like the one on the left do not survive many uses before breaking.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>I also want to give a small tip here about sharing your designs on platforms
like <a href="https://www.printables.com/">Printables</a>:  Make sure you upload your
models in the correct print orientation.  While the correct orientation may
seem obvious to you, others might not know and they will try printing your part
without reorienting it first.  You&#39;ll do them a small favor by uploading
correctly oriented files 🙂</p>
<h4 id="when-no-orientation-works">When no orientation works<a href="#when-no-orientation-works"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Especially with complex parts, in some cases, no print
orientation is ideal.  While it is often fine to make a trade-off and accept
limited strength in certain locations, one alternative should always be kept in
mind:</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R1.2"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R1.2</strong> 
    —
    Split a part into multiple pieces when no orientation is ideal for all loads.
  </p>
<p>As each piece gets printed individually, you are completely free to choose
the optimal orientation for each one.  Clever joints can be used to easily
assemble the whole part afterwards.  Just to mention one:  Dovetail joints have
proven themselves for 3d-printing, as they are well-printable in most orientations.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="two parts with a dovetail joint" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Dovetail.png"/></p><p>A dovetail joint is used to attach two halves of a part so that each piece
can be printed in an improved orientation.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><h4 id="to-infill-or-not-to-infill">To infill or not to infill<a href="#to-infill-or-not-to-infill"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Contrary to the first rule, a topic that is not talked about enough in my eyes
is the role of infill in part strength.  There is a big misconception that you
can magically give your part ultimate strength by just using 100% infill.  While you
will certainly see an increase in strength, this method is not efficient at all
— most of the additional material does not contribute to part strength
and is just waste and an unnecessary increase of print time.</p>
<p>Why?  It all has to do with the distribution of force inside of a part.
Generally, most parts are not stressed in pure tension or compression.  Instead,
a lot of stress is applied in the form of bending moments and those distribute
the force unevenly.  The force will be greatest in places furthest away from
the center (neutral axis).  Thus, it is generally more effective for additional
material to be added at the surface, not the center of a part.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="bending stress" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/stress-concentration.png"/></p><p>Stress is highest directly beneath the surface of the part.  Notice the blue
neutral axis in the middle, where stress is lowest.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>In 3d-printer speak, this means you should increase the number of
perimeters/shells rather than the infill percentage.  Stefan from CNC Kitchen
has done a thorough analysis of this (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmEaNAwFSfI">YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>In general, his work is a great resource for in-depth information about the
mechanical behavior of 3d-printed parts (CNC Kitchen <a href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/">Blog/Website</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen">YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R1.3"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R1.3</strong> 
    —
    Most strength comes from the part&#39;s surface, not the infill.
  </p>
<h4 id="the-flow-of-forces">The Flow of Forces<a href="#the-flow-of-forces"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>However, there is more to this.  We can actually influence the amount of stress
at the surface by changing the shape of the part.  This is often much more
effective than optimizing print settings.  A way to conceptualize the stress
inside of a part is to think about the forces &#34;flowing&#34; through it. The visual
representation of this is called a <em>force lines drawing</em>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_lines">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="force lines around a crack" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/crack-force-lines.png"/></p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Stress will concentrate in places where the force lines are close together.
You can see how the sharp corners of the crack in the image above lead to
regions of particularly high stress and thus will probably lead to part failure
in these locations.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t specific to 3d-printing but as it is such an important topic, I want
to include it here anyway.  The rules are generally the same for any
manufacturing method: We want to minimize stress and the best way to do it is
this:</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R1.4"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R1.4</strong> 
    —
    Guide forces on the most direct path possible.
  </p>
<p>Or in other words, keep the force lines as short and straight as possible.</p>
<p>One example where this matters a lot are sharp corners.  They impact part
strength very negatively and are usually easy to avoid by simply adding a
fillet.  You can see how a fillet allows a much more direct path for the force
than a sharp corner:</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="force lines around corner and fillet" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/force-lines-fillet.svg"/></p><p>Force lines around a sharp corner vs. a corner with a fillet.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><h4 id="cross-sectional-considerations">Cross-sectional Considerations<a href="#cross-sectional-considerations"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printed parts with their shell and infill has
yet more implications for part strength that are worth talking about.  In
traditional design engineering, you are taught to reduce cross-sectional area
of a part as much as possible.  You should only keep material in places where
it has the highest effect on increasing part strength. The reason for this is
that reduced volume directly leads to reduced material usage and thus cost and
weight savings.</p>
<p>With 3d-printing, things work differently.  You can usually increase the
cross-sectional area quite a bit, without a noticeable increase in material
usage, as the infill is mostly empty space.  You should rather strive to reduce
the surface area of a part, because that is where most material is used.</p>
<p>This means that you can get away with much thicker shapes in 3d-printed parts,
which obviously benefits part strength a lot.  Don&#39;t try to work against this
artificially — if a design allows for it, go for the fattest shape
possible.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R1.5"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R1.5</strong> 
    —
    Use large cross sections.  Prefer thick shapes over thin shapes.
  </p>
<p>To give an example, think about the traditional I-beam
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam">Wikipedia</a>) cross-section. The idea is that material is only kept in
the regions far away from the neutral axis of the bending moment, where it has
the highest impact on part strength.  This allows for significant weight
savings.</p>
<p>While the I-beam profile works wonders for homogeneous materials, it is not a
good idea for 3d-printing. A square cross-section of the same outer dimensions
will have comparable or better strength but usually does not lead to an
increase in material usage and print-time.  It might actually perform better in
those areas, as shown below.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="i-beam vs square profile comparison" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Profile-Comparison.png"/></p><p>Comparison of print times and material usage for I-beam profile and square profile.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><h4 id="simulation-struggles">Simulation Struggles<a href="#simulation-struggles"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>In traditional mechanical engineering, whenever a part needs to be evaluated
for its strength, the tool of choice is simulation.  Simulation allows making
accurate prediction of a part&#39;s behavior under load without needing to
manufacture it.  Especially for parts made from expensive materials or made using
expensive manufacturing methods, performing simulations beforehand is critical
for the project&#39;s budget.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, simulation quickly breaks down when trying to analyze 3d-printed
parts.  The problem is, once again, the inhomogeneous nature of 3d-printing.
While stress analysis may still be useful to find critical areas to give
attention to, extracting realistic values for limiting forces is a lost cause.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is an alternative to simulations that 3d-printing offers.  The
exceptionally low cost of manufacturing 3d-printed parts means that printing
prototypes for testing mechanical properties is often the most cost-effective
solution.  Need to find yield strength of a design?  Just print a few copies
and empirically determine it.</p>
<p>However, there is one things to be careful with: While I see test-prints as a
great way to determine mechanical properties, I advise to not rely on them for
determining dimensional accuracy.  I will go into more detail on my reasons for
this in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Finally, an implication of the above is that <em>topology optimization</em>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization">Wikipedia</a>) is not really well suited for FFF 3d-printing.
While it is amazing for other additive manufacturing processes, current tools
are usually not able to produce designs that would truly be optimal for FFF
3d-printing.  Not to speak of the often less-than-ideal printability of such
parts.</p>
<h2 id="2-manufacturing-tolerance-and-part-finish">2. Manufacturing Tolerance and Part Finish<a href="#2-manufacturing-tolerance-and-part-finish"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Next, I want to talk about optimizing your design to improve manufacturing
tolerances.  Certain shapes will generally print cleaner than others.
If you take this into consideration during design, you can achieve parts that
fit on first print and won&#39;t need endless tweaking of the slicer settings and
printer.  A welcome side-effect of improved tolerance is a cleaner part finish
as well.  Thus, the following chapter covers both: Manufacturing tolerance and
part finish.</p>
<h4 id="chamfers-vs-fillets">Chamfers vs. Fillets<a href="#chamfers-vs-fillets"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>To start, let&#39;s talk about edges.  Generally, mechanical parts should avoid
sharp edges because they are unpleasant to touch.  Any good design breaks edges
by either adding a round fillet or a 45° chamfer of appropriate size.</p>
<p>While the choice between the two is often made for stylistic reasons, there are
actually some rather important printability aspects to it.  There are two
situations that we have to look at, distinguished by the print orientation of
the edge:</p>
<p>Adding a fillet or chamfer to edges <em>parallel</em> to the print surface means the
feature will be built up from multiple layers, potentially with overhang.
Fillets are not well suited for this. They start with an incredibly steep
overhang that will not print well.  Often, such fillets will have large
surface deviations.  Even if no overhang is involved, when the
fillet sits on top, the changing curvature will make the layer steps very
visible, degrading the part finish.  Chamfers are much better suited in this
orientation.  They have a constant overhang angle, leading to a very consistent
layer stepping, which looks a lot more pleasing.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="fillets and chamfers horizontal" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Chamfer-And-Fillet-Vertical.png"/></p><p>Fillets and chamfers on edges parallel to the print surface.  The blue
perimeter on the bottom of the fillet marks an unsupported overhang.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Contrary, edges <em>vertical</em> to the print surface are much better suited for
fillets.  A fillet means that the printer does not have to make sharp corners
while laying the perimeters.  This reduces print-head acceleration and thus
reduces surface artifacts (ringing, overshoot).  A chamfer on such edges will
have two sharp corners, which will never look as pretty and will never achieve
the same tolerances as a round fillet.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="fillets and chamfers vertical" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Chamfer-And-Fillet-Horizontal.png"/></p><p>Fillets and chamfers on edges vertical to the print surface.  The print speed
significantly decreases for the chamfer corners while the fillets can almost
keep the same velocity.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Thus, unless stylistic choices dictate something else, the cleanest prints will
be achieved by following this rule:</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R2.1"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R2.1</strong> 
    —
    Use chamfers on edges parallel to the print surface.  Use fillets on edges
vertical to the print surface.
  </p>
<h4 id="horizontal-holes">Horizontal Holes<a href="#horizontal-holes"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>With horizontal fillets, a major problem is the steep overhang.  There are
other design features where similar problems arise. For example, horizontally
oriented circular holes.  The larger they get, the bigger the problem will be.
The solution is to deviate from the perfect circle for a more optimized shape.
For smaller holes, a teardrop shape with a 90° angle works well.  Larger holes
can be extended to have a flat &#34;roof&#34;.  Keep in mind that a slight amount of
additional clearance will be needed beneath the roof, due to the bridges
drooping slightly.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="alternative horizontal holes" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Horizontal-Holes.png"/></p><p>On the left: A ⌀4 mm hole with a 90° teardrop.  On the right: A ⌀10 mm hole
with a flat roof.  The roof sits 0.4 mm above the theoretical circle so slight
drooping of the bridge won&#39;t affect the fit.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>
    <a href="#rule-R2.2"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R2.2</strong> 
    —
    Improve horizontal holes by using a teardrop shape or giving the hole a flat roof.
  </p>
<h4 id="seemingly-seamless">Seemingly Seamless<a href="#seemingly-seamless"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>A topic that is very important for both part finish and dimensional
tolerances is the placement of the perimeter seams.  Perimeter seams are the
point where a perimeter line starts and ends.  It is very hard to tune a
printer such that there won&#39;t be any seam artifacts.  Thus, let&#39;s put thought
into the placement of this seam so it does not interfere with any functionality
or aesthetics.</p>
<p>Usually, the seam placement is chosen automatically by the slicer.  For each
layer, it searches for the sharpest corner (concave or convex) and then places
the seam right into it.  This has proven to be a very reliable way to
produce good results without requiring any explicit user input.</p>
<p>However, this algorithm breaks down in two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>On perfectly round perimeters, like those of a circular hole or outline.</li>
<li>When all corners have the same angle or when the sharpest corner requires
tight tolerances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Especially the first case is very relevant. This effect has severe consequences
for the tolerances you can achieve with a circular hole.  While the rest of the
perimeter may deviate by less than 0.1 mm, the seam artifacts can easily
bump that up to 0.4 mm.  And worse, it shifts the centerline of the hole
because the seam is only in one place.</p>
<p>The solution is simple: Add a corner where the seam can be placed without
interfering.  Instead of a perfect circle, shape the hole like a teardrop where
the corner has a 120° angle.  Note the difference to the horizontal holes
discussed previously.</p>

    <strong>R2.3</strong> 
    —
    Use a teardrop shape for vertical holes to avoid inaccuracy due to perimeter

  </p>
<p>Similarly, if other corners must not be used for seam placement, add a small
notch somewhere that will serve as the &#34;sharpest corner&#34; and thus take the
seam automatically.  While you can of course also manually place the seam using
the slicer software, this trick means no slicer tweaking is needed.</p>

</h4>
<p>A fundamental building block of any &#34;design for manufacturing&#34; is knowing the
accuracy limits of the manufacturing process.  As stated in the beginning, the
goal is to build <em>portable</em> designs, so we should assume conservative limits
instead of exhausting the capabilities of a particular printer.  Note that this
is backwards to the traditional workflow: Instead of <em>specifying</em> tolerances
that someone else then has to achieve during manufacturing, you <em>accept</em>
certain tolerances of the manufacturing process and design accordingly.</p>
<p>It also needs to be noted that a base assumption here is that the 3d-printers in
question are well-calibrated.  A machine that is out of calibration will have
an additional constant error on top of its tolerances.  For example, badly
configured <em>steps/mm</em> values will lead to a constant factor deviation of
measurements along a certain axis. Part design cannot and should not
accommodate for this — there wouldn&#39;t be much left if we tried.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="visualization of tolerances and calibration error" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Tolerance-Calibration.png"/></p><p>A miscalibrated printer will have a constant error on top of its general
manufacturing tolerances.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Before we can talk about tolerance values, it is important to understand what
causes these deviations in the first place.  A tolerance value means nothing
without the context that it applies to.  In 3d-printing especially, tolerances
will vary widely depending on specific part geometry.  This topic is quite
far-reaching, as a very large number of factors play into it.  As such, this
chapter will only contain the most important things to consider.</p>
<p>Starting from the bottom, the lower bound on accuracy is due to the <em>step
resolution</em> of the printer&#39;s stepper motors and their drivers.  Fundamentally,
there is no way to get more accurate than this, as dimensions will always fall
somewhere between two step locations.  However, on state-of-the-art
3d-printers, the theoretical step resolution is around 0.01 mm.  Whether
this value is actually achievable is debatable, but the takeaway is that step
resolution is well below the deviations caused by other effects.</p>
<p>Continuing on, there are more effects of the printer&#39;s motion system on
dimensional accuracy.  They all have to do with mechanical unrigidness of the
printer. Tuning the slicer settings and advanced motion control (input shaping)
can bring large improvements here.  However, an equally big role is played by
the geometry the print-head is printing.  Sharp corners are the worst offender
as they force the printer to maximum acceleration.  By optimizing a part for
&#34;easy motion&#34;, tolerances of printed parts can often be improved a lot.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="speeds around different corners" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Chamfer-And-Fillet-Horizontal.png"/></p><p>Once again, fillets and chamfers show quite spectacularly how different the
print-head acceleration will be in different scenarios.  Sharper corners
lead to higher acceleration and will thus have worse tolerance.</p>

    Design part geometry for easy motion paths while printing, to improve dimensional accuracy.
  </p>
<p>The next anti-accuracy component of a 3d-printer is the extruder and hotend.
Uneven extrusion makes the line width vary, which has an impact on the outer
dimensions of a part.  Additionally, the nozzle of the printer always slightly
drags the extruded line behind it.  This leads to circles always being slightly
undersized.  On inner circles (vertical holes), assume deviation to make the
hole smaller.  On outer circles, assume deviation to make the outer diameter
smaller, but to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, for current popular FFF 3d-printers with an 0.4 mm
nozzle at 0.2 mm layer height, these effects lead to deviations in the
range of ±0.1 mm for each surface. The deviations are shifted for circular
paths, as mentioned.  While many surfaces will be more accurate, this value is
a safe bet for surface deviation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while 3d-printers usually do not have a noteworthy growth in
tolerance for larger dimensions, other effects take over here: Especially
warping and shrinkage of the 3d-printed parts as they cool down.</p>
<p>Warping and shrinkage depend heavily on the choice of material, but there are
also part geometries that experience it more than others. In general, the more
voluminous a part is and the less sharp its edges are, the less warping can be
expected.  Think about the forces exerted when the material shrinks and how
the geometry can resist those forces.</p>

</h4>
<p>The previous chapter discussed what tolerances can be expected from the FFF
3d-printing process.  However, there are of course situations where more
accuracy is required.  One approach that is often used to deal with this is
experimentally determining a CAD dimension where the final part fits perfectly.
3d-printing makes this very easy because test prints are cheap and fast.
Often, 3d-printers have surprisingly good repeatability so a dimension that was
optimized using test prints can achieve quite incredible tolerances.  Some call
this the <em>goldilocks approach</em> (<a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/finding-perfect-part-fits-with-the-goldilocks-approach-and-openscad/">Hackaday</a>).</p>
<p>However, this empirical approach has a huge drawback:  It makes your design
depend heavily on the slicer settings that were used and the specific printer
that the part was printed on.  As discussed in the beginning, the goal is to
avoid such dependence as it makes the design less <em>portable</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are other approaches that you can use to achieve the same goal,
but without requiring tight tolerances.  Of course, these approaches also have
their limitations.  So what is best in a given situation needs to be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The first approach I want to discuss here is ingeniously simple.  It is best
summarized like this (and I wish I had a proper source for this quote):</p>

    If you can&#39;t make it precise, make it adjustable.
  </p>
<p>The idea is that in places where accuracy is needed, you should design your
part such that the dimension can be adjusted.  There is a huge variety of
adjustment mechanisms to choose from.  The following four examples should serve
to demonstrate the possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Oblong holes for screws</strong> allow sliding a part into alignment.  This allows
for a large range of motion, but makes adjustments of less than 1 mm very
difficult.  This method can also be used quite well to correct for angular
errors.</p>

  </div>
</span></p><p><strong>Opposing screws for height adjustment</strong> allow fixing a dimension in place
quite permanently.  The natural reduction of the screws make tiny adjustments
easy to perform.  A downside is that access from both sides is needed, which is
not always easily achievable.  Adjusting such a mechanism is unfortunately a
bit tedious, because it is a constant back and forth between loosening one
screw a bit and then tightening the opposing screw again.</p>

conceivable for some applications.  However, especially for rather small
heights, small surface defects from the printing process could negatively
affect accuracy.</p>

</span></p><h4 id="engineering-fits">Engineering Fits<a href="#engineering-fits"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>In traditional mechanical engineering, when two parts need to fit each other
geometrically, a so-called <em>engineering fit</em> is used.  An engineering fit is a
systematic classification of the allowed dimensions for the two parts.
Usually, this system of fits is applied to holes and shafts, but it can be applied
to other shapes equally well.</p>
<p>The most important distinction is between</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>clearance fits</strong> where there is always some play between the parts, for any
of the allowed dimensions,</li>
<li><strong>transition fits</strong> where they might be play or interference,</li>
<li>and <strong>interference fits</strong> where the two parts will always interfere and thus
(significant) force is required to join them.  This is also referred to as a
<em>press fit</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="illustrations of the different fit types" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/engineering-fits.png"/></p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>ISO 286 then goes on to define specific classes of fits with distinct tolerance
bands for the dimensions of the shaft and hole (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_fit">Wikipedia</a>).
These are great for traditional manufacturing, but unfortunately, they are
mostly useless for 3d-printing.  We can&#39;t really print parts to a specific
tolerance — instead, the 3d-printer has an inherent tolerance that we have
to design for.</p>
<p>If tight tolerance engineering fits are required regardless, an option that
should not go unmentioned is post-processing of printed parts.  Especially for
printed holes, there is the possibility of reaming (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamer">Wikipedia</a>)
them, to achieve, for example, an H6 fit.  That said, this option only makes
sense where absolutely required.  Otherwise, the additional effort is hard to
justify.</p>
<p>For any other cases, the choice is essentially between a clearance fit and an
interference fit.  Clearance fits are easy — a gap between the parts
that is larger than 2x the printer tolerance does the trick.  Interference fits,
on the other hand, are more difficult.  The problem is that large print
tolerances mean the forces in the interference fit vary wildly between
different parts.  In the worst case, this can even lead to joints breaking due
to excessive forces.</p>
<p>To counteract this, designs need to tolerate the large tolerances of
3d-printing.  There are a few tricks one can use here, which I will share
next.</p>
<h6 id="circles-considered-harmful">Circles Considered Harmful<a href="#circles-considered-harmful"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>The seemingly obvious solution for transition- or interference-fitting a
circular shape is a circular hole in your design.  However, I want to make the
point that this is rarely the best solution for 3d-printing.  Especially when
the aforementioned tolerance issues become relevant, circular holes should be
avoided.</p>
<p>Other shapes, like squares or hexagons can fit the mating part just as well but
are much more forgiving in regards to tolerance.  The reason for this can be
seen when considering how each shape deforms in interference situations.  A
circle can only widen by stretching along its circumference.  This quickly
leads to material failure when large amounts of interference need to be
compensated.  A square or hexagon, on the other hand, can bend to accommodate
the bigger diameter.  Little to no stretching of the material is present in
this case.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="visualization of circle vs hexagon interference fit" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Interference-Visualization.png"/></p><div>
      <p>red: oversized shaft / green: undersized circle or hexagon / grey hatching: interference regions</p>
<p>A circle has to stretch significantly while a hexagon just bends a little bit.</p>
    </div>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Another point in favor or the square or hexagon is the seam problem, as
discussed before.  A perfect circle will be heavily distorted by the seam while
a square can hide the seam neatly in one of its corners.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="a hexagonal hole fits a cylinder pin" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Hex-Holes.png"/></p><p>Hexagonal holes are used for a light press-fit with cylindrical stubs.  This

    <strong>R2.8</strong> 
    —
    Do not use circular holes for interference fits.  Use hexagon or square holes instead.
  </p>
<p>This technique is mostly useful for smaller diameters.  The additional space
occupied by the corners can become problematic for lager holes and as such,
different design approaches should be preferred.</p>
<h6 id="crush-ribs">Crush Ribs<a href="#crush-ribs"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>For bigger diameters, there is another trick that can be borrowed from
injection molding. <em>Crush ribs</em> are features that are meant to be plastically
deformed during assembly. Usually, a ribbing structure is added to a hole where
the ribs can be crushed into the &#34;valleys&#34; between them.</p>
<p>In injection molding, these crush ribs are mainly used to work around the
required draft angle.  For 3d-printing, we can repurpose them to compensate
the printer tolerance, as described by Dan Royer (<a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/10/15/adding-crush-ribs-to-3d-printed-parts-for-a-better-press-fit/">Hackaday</a>).</p>

<p><span>

  </div>
</span></p><p>The ribs are dimensioned such that they still achieve the required interference
at either end of the tolerance band.  Because deforming the small ribs is much
easier than deforming an entire contact surface, the joining force is kept
within limits across the entire tolerance band.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="tolerance considerations with crush ribs" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Crush-Rib-Tolerance.png"/></p><p>To achieve a secure fit, the force of the minimum and maximum press-fit must be considered.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>When designing crush ribs, keep in mind that such small features are prone to
have much worse tolerance than larger features.  This has two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tolerance of the crush rib shown in the drawing above will be larger than usual.</li>
<li>As the crush-rib is a convex shape, it is likely to be more undersized than oversized.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give some numbers, undersizing the crush ribs by 0.2 mm and oversizing
the bore by 0.4 mm lead to good results for me.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind with crush ribs is that they should not be
reassembled more than once.  Their reliance on plastic deformation means that
the joint force will significantly decrease on reassembly.</p>
<p>

<p>Another interesting approach presented by Slant 3D is called <em>grip fins</em>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzg_NXM-NRs">YouTube</a>).  Instead of plastic deformation, like with crush ribs,
grip fins only deform elastically.  The big advantage is of course, that such a
joint can be reassembled repeatedly, which crush ribs do not really allow for.</p>

move closer to the manufacturing process itself.  The following chapter will

faster, and to make parts less likely to result in failed prints.</p>
<h4 id="support-material">Support Material<a href="#support-material"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The elephant in the room is certainly the topic of support material.  Support
material is used as scaffolding for features of a part that would otherwise
hang in thin air.  After printing, it is removed, to reveal the final
shape.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="support material" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/support-material.png"/></p><p>Support material (shown in green) is used to help print an overhang that

</span></p><p>Unfortunately, the use of support material comes with a number of drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It adds an additional post-processing step after printing.  The removal of
supports can be quite time-consuming.</li>
<li>It consumes additional material, which later turns to waste.</li>
<li>It leads to bad tolerances on supported surfaces, much worse than for the rest of the part.</li>
<li>It leaves a worse surface finish on supported surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the designer, the implication is simple:</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R3.1"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R3.1</strong> 
    —
    Avoid the necessity of support material.
  </p>
<p>Yes, there are certainly many situations where using supports is the
appropriate choice.  But more often than not, slight design changes can
eliminate features that would otherwise require supports.</p>

<p><span>

  </div>
</span></p><p>A big role in this is played by the overall orientation of a part on the
print bed.  This was discussed previously, for part strength considerations, but
has equal effect on support requirement.  Balancing between these two is often
quite tricky.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>

      <p>The dilemma of optimizing for part strength or for avoiding supports:  The
orientation of the hook on the left part needs no supports but the force on
the hook can rip the layers apart.  The orientation on the right is ideal for
strength but needs support material.</p>
<p>In this case, the left option was chosen anyway because the forces are small
enough to not break the layers.</p>
    </div>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>One design trick that is surprisingly powerful is the exploitation of diagonal
orientation.  Rather than keeping the rectangular shapes of a part aligned to
the printer axes, tilt the part upwards by 45°.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="example of diagonal part orientation" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Diagonal-Orientation.png"/></p><p>The left orientation leads to a large bridge which will leave inaccuracy and
visible artifacts.  Simply tilting the part so all the straight edges get
printed diagonally leads to all sides getting printed equally well.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>Not only does this method avoid supports or overly long bridges, it also leads to a
more uniform part finish as all faces now get printed with the same
orientation.  The easily discernible top and bottom surfaces are elegantly
avoided.</p>
<p>Of course print stability is affected by this.  You may need to include a brim
to keep such parts from falling over.  Slant 3D explores this concept of
diagonal orientation in more depth (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TIhkxQNINY">YouTube</a>).</p>

<p>Even with the best intentions, it is not always possible to make a part work
without requiring any support material.  While this may mean that it is time to
accept defeat and just print using supports, there is one last option that
should be evaluated.  It certainly isn&#39;t always the way to go, but it is worth
considering:</p>

    <a href="#rule-R3.3"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R3.3</strong>

    Split a part into multiple pieces when no orientation can avoid supports.
  </p>
<p>The trade-off here is between accepting the downsides of support material or
making assembly more complex.  Both solutions will require some amount of
post-print work, but which solution is better will always depend on the exact
circumstances.  Especially for one-off or low-volume designs, a slightly more
complex assembly is easy to justify.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="a design where multiple parts were used to avoid supports" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/multiple-parts.jpg"/></p><p>The hooks were printed separately and then attached using screws.  This

the hook).</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><h4 id="sacrificial-layers">Sacrificial Layers<a href="#sacrificial-layers"><i></i></a>

<p>A large number of situations where avoiding supports gets tricky are caused by
the need for printing counterbored holes upside-down.</p>

</span></p><p>Taking a cross-section, the problem is easily visible: The step of the
counterbore is unsupported.  Bridges won&#39;t work, because the hole in the middle
gets in the way. Using support material to help would be particularly nasty
here, because removing it from inside the hole can be very difficult.</p>
<p>One solution for this problem is the use of a <em>sacrificial layer</em>.  The idea is
simple:  Instead of an unsupported overhang, a bridge across the entire hole is
created.  This bridge is only a single layer high and only serves to
support the smaller diameter hole on top.</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, upside-down counterbores aren&#39;t the only place where this trick can
be useful.  In fact, the next chapter will show an even better solution for
upside-down counterbores.  But to give an example, I have often used
sacrificial layers for the counterbore equivalent of an oblong hole.</p>

</h4>
<p>Sacrificial layers are a useful tool, but they come with an additional
post-processing step.  There can also be problems with strands from the
bridging becoming loose while cutting out the sacrificial layer.  Lucky for us,
there is an even more clever way to deal with overhanging counterbores in
particular.</p>
<p>Instead of bridging over the entire hole and thus closing the through-hole on
top, bridges are only placed where they don&#39;t interfere.  Layer by layer, more
bridges are added to finally achieve the circular inner hole.</p>

<p><span>
  <p><img alt="counterbore trick stackup" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/counterbore.png"/>
    
  </p>
</span></p><p>The layers of this design are as follows, from the bottom up:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, simply cut the circular counterbore to the desired depth.</li>
<li>Then, make a one layer thick cut (typically 0.2 mm) such that only
material remains where the bridges do not run across the inner hole.  Two
strips of bridges will be left, running left and right of the inner hole.</li>
<li>On the next layer, make another one layer thick square cut with the
side length matching the inner hole diameter.  This will only leave bridges
running top and bottom of the inner hole, perpendicular to the bridges on
the layer before.</li>
<li>Finally, from the next layer on, the inner hole will be printed as a circle.
This works because the remaining bridges are small enough to not cause
issues.</li>
</ol>

  </div>
</span></p><p>This trick is particularly elegant because it does not require any
post-processing and it prints exceptionally cleanly.  Of course, there is a
limit to this, mostly with increasing diameters.  But unless there is a good
reason against it, this method should be your go-to for any overhanging

<h4 id="layers-of-bridges">Layers of Bridges<a href="#layers-of-bridges"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The concept from the overhanging counterbores can be generalized to an even
more powerful method.  The basic idea of bridges that support further bridges
can be used for quite advanced geometry that does not need any supports.
You will also see this called <em>sequential bridging</em> in some places.</p>
<p>An impressive example is the OpenFlexure microscope
(<a href="https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/">Website</a>), where this design approach is used
extensively. The best way to understand how it works is to download their
models and view the layers after running the model through a slicer
(<a href="https://build.openflexure.org/openflexure-microscope/v7.0.0-beta1/models/main_body.html">STL Download</a>).</p>


<p>Especially for large bridges, it is a good idea to first build up the bridge
for a few layers before starting the next one. This gives the lower bridge more
strength and more time to cool before it gets loaded with the features on top.</p>

</h4>
<p>We have previously evaluated the I-beam shape in the context of 3d-printing.
The conclusion was that simply shaving off volume is a traditional design
approach that does not map well to 3d-printing.  There are more cases where
this topic pops up.  Cutouts, that are meant to save material, are commonly
added, while really not achieving their purpose in 3d-printed designs.  In fact,
they can lead to the opposite: More material usage and longer print times.</p>

balanced.  Too little will lead to parts toppling over during printing.  Too

<h2 id="4-functional-integration">4. Functional Integration<a href="#4-functional-integration"><i></i></a>
</h2>
<h4 id="general-considerations">General Considerations<a href="#general-considerations"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Functional integration is the art of designing such that each part performs as
many of the required functions as possible.  The goal is to reduce part count.
This speeds up assembly and thus often leads to decreased manufacturing cost.</p>
<p>A ubiquitous example of functional integration are clips in injection molded
plastic parts.  They replace the additional joining element that would be
required otherwise.  For this reason, they play a large role in making
products cheaper and easier to manufacture.  Clips will be discussed in more
detail later.</p>
<p>3d-printing is suited especially well for functional integration, because
additional geometric complexity does not really impact manufacturing cost.
This is in contrast to, for example, subtractive machining, where additional
geometric features generally drive up the cost.  So striving for maximum
functional integration is usually a good idea with 3d-printing.</p>
<p>However, there are some nuances to this.  Printing everything in a single part
limits the print orientation for some features. This can negatively affect
strength, tolerances, and geometric freedom.  Additionally, a highly integrated
part is more difficult to prototype because each iteration requires reprinting
a large model.  And later in the life cycle, repair of a broken part also
requires replacement of a bigger component than what would have been necessary
with a design of many smaller parts that are joined together.  More than once,
I have explicitly kept certain functions in separated parts to facilitate
easier prototyping or repair.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the following chapters will demonstrate some design ideas that
allow integration of certain features.</p>
<h4 id="zip-tie-channels">Zip tie Channels<a href="#zip-tie-channels"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The first idea that I will demonstrate is a rather simple trick.  You can add
small channels to surfaces of your part that allow fastening a zip tie to fix
some cables or wires in place.  There is a great video by Alan Reiner where I
learned about this (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgt9P6jsyaY">YouTube</a>).  The <em>Zip Tie City</em> demo model
is available for download (<a href="https://www.printables.com/model/248291-zip-tie-city">Printables</a>).</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="zip tie channels on a real part" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/ziptie-channels.jpg"/></p><p>Zip tie channels are used to fix cables to a moving assembly.  You can spot
one unused zip tie channel to the left.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>The channel design is quite simply a section of a hollow cylinder.  Dimensions
that work well for smaller zip ties (100 mm) can be taken from the drawing below.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="zip tie channel dimensions" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/ziptie-channels.png"/></p><p>Zip tie channel dimensions for typical 100 mm zip ties.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>An important note is that orientation of the zip tie channels should be
considered.  When the channel is printed such that no perimeters bridge across
it, it gets much weaker.  In this orientation, the bridge can easily get ripped
out which I have already seen happening in practice.</p>

<h4 id="flexures">Flexures<a href="#flexures"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Usually, mechanical parts are designed such that they can be considered
completely stiff in approximation.  Flexures are design features that
explicitly use elasticity of a part to integrate certain freedoms of
movement (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, 3d-printing is perfect for designs that incorporate flexures.  The
thin features required by flexures are easy to print, while complex to create
with other manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R4.2"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R4.2</strong> 
    —
    Use flexures to integrate moving features into a part.
  </p>
<p>Two types of flexures that are very common will be discussed in more detail
below: Clips and so-called &#34;living hinges&#34;.  But first, a few general points
about flexures in 3d-printing are presented.</p>
<p>The amount of movement allowed by a flexure is mostly limited by how much
deflection is possible without plastic deformation.  A thicker flexure will
start plastically deforming much earlier.  Thus, it is very important to keep
flexures as thin as possible when large movements are intended.  Force can be
increased by stacking multiple thin flexures, rather than creating a single
thick one.  Alternatively, the travel distance of a thicker flexure can be
increased by increasing its length — maybe even in a snaking pattern.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="double flexure for more stiffness" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/cable-comb-hooks.jpg"/></p><p>The hooks on this cable comb are made from two parallel flexures.  This is
more stiff than a single flexure, but has the same travel in the elastic
region.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>
    <a href="#rule-R4.3"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R4.3</strong> 
    —
    Design flexures such that they only deform elastically when used.
  </p>
<p>To make flexures long-lived, it is important to ensure they cannot be moved too
far.  Features should be strategically placed as end-stops to a flexures
movement.  This way, the movement is always kept in the elastic region and the
flexure will live much longer.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R4.4"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R4.4</strong> 
    —
    Ensure that flexures have hard limits that prevent breaking them.
  </p>
<p>Another use for flexures is sidestepping tolerance issues.  This only works
when no significant force is exerted on the joint, but can be a nice tool to
cheaply solve accuracy issues.  An example of this are the previously
discussed <a href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#grip-fins">&#34;grip fins&#34;</a>.</p>
<h4 id="clips">Clips<a href="#clips"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Arguably the largest amount of flexures show up in the form of clips.  Clips
have revolutionized the mass-production industry because they provide a
fastener-free way of joining together parts.  Either permanently or in a way
that can be repeatedly opened and closed again.  For the same reason, clips are
popular for 3d-printed designs — avoiding additional fastening hardware
is often desirable.</p>
<p>However, care must exercised with design of clips.  The travel distance of the
clip, retention force, and feature size must be carefully balanced.  Another
significant factor is the orientation of the clip relative to the print
surface.  Especially clips built across layers are very fragile.  In many cases
it is better to keep travel minimal and instead work with a larger clip force
for retention.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R4.5"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R4.5</strong> 
    —
    Ensure clips won&#39;t break from use.  Optimize designs for minimal clip movement.
  </p>
<p>For clips that retain by form-locking the other part geometrically, it is a
great idea to include a way to undo the clip.  Usually, this can be achieved by
providing space to reach the clip with a tool like a screw-driver to push it
backwards.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R4.6"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R4.6</strong> 
    —
    Provide a way to undo form-locking clips.
  </p>
<h4 id="living-hinges">Living Hinges<a href="#living-hinges"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>One more type of flexure that has exploded in popularity as part of optimizing
for mass-production are &#34;living hinges&#34;.  These are hinges which move by
plastic deformation rather than disjoint parts rotating on an axis.  Any cheap
plastic container with a lid probably uses one or two of these hinges, because
they are so much more cost-effective and simple than proper hinged joints.</p>
<p>We can also make use of living hinges in 3d-printed design, but there are a few
limitations:  The hinge absolutely needs to to lie flat on the print bed to
achieve the thin sheet of plastic that reliably deforms.  Experiments have been
done with living hinges made from bridging layers, but these do not perform
nearly as good.</p>

<p>Engineers Grow has discussed living hinges for 3d-printing
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2CqXgaQsyI">YouTube</a>) and so has Slant 3D (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiEyFle6lTM">YouTube</a>).</p>
<h4 id="printed-bearings">Printed Bearings<a href="#printed-bearings"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Another design element that&#39;s sometimes suited for integration are bearings.
Especially where large diameter bearings are required, it can be more effective
to integrate the bearing into the design of the mating parts instead of using
an off-the-shelf component.</p>
<p>To integrate a bearing, the races become features of the part design.  During
assembly, standard steel bearing balls are inserted.  Optionally, a printed
cage may be necessary to ensure correct spacing between the balls.</p>

<p><span>

discussed in a lot more detail (<a href="https://youtu.be/0KhV6JW2sHg">YouTube</a>).</p>
<h4 id="print-in-place-mechanisms">Print-in-place Mechanisms<a href="#print-in-place-mechanisms"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As the final type of functional integration that will be discussed,
<em>print-in-place mechanisms</em> are another unique possibility of 3d-printing.
Multiple parts of an interlocking mechanism can be printed at the same time.
No post-print assembly is required.</p>
<p>Print-in-place mechanisms can include joints that would be impossible to
assemble after printing.  The trick is that interlocking parts are printed in
their already joined position.  This can be an incredibly useful design tool to
make strong mechanisms without complicated assembly.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="herringbone planetary gear set" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Herringbone-Gears.jpg"/></p><div>

gear set.  This model could not be assembled from its parts after printing.</p>

    </div>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>The big downside of print-in-place mechanisms is the additional design
complexity.  Part orientation is fixed, making avoiding supports and design for
strength difficult to achieve.  Especially where interlocking parts meet, it
can be difficult to adequately support floating geometry.  Sometimes, special
<em>break-away surfaces</em> are placed between parts.  These then have to be broken
with force after printing.</p>

<p>Another critical topic for print-in-place design is the necessary clearance
between interfacing parts.  Printing multiple surfaces very close to each other
can be difficult for some printers.  It seems that a clearance of 0.3 mm
should allow most current printers to print a design.</p>

</h2>
<p>After discussing the peculiarities of 3d-printed parts for so long, it is time
to widen the horizon.  Most functional designs will not be entirely 3d-printed,
but also include other components.  The largest number of them are most likely
going to be <em>machine elements</em>.  Screws, nuts, bearings, and all the other
standard parts optimized for certain functions.  In the following chapter,
design considerations related to the use of such machine elements will be
evaluated.</p>
<h4 id="nuts-and-bolts">Nuts and bolts<a href="#nuts-and-bolts"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Arguably the most ubiquitous machine elements are screws.  For the most part,
they are used to fasten different components to each other.  While it is easy
to just pick the next best screw and design your parts around it, there is more
to it if the joint is meant to last.  In traditional mechanical design,
selection of screws can be a science of itself. Especially, when the screw is
heavily loaded or safety critical.  With design for 3d-printing, it is
technically no different — but fortunately, you can usually get away with
ignoring a lot of the complexity involved.  Nonetheless, I think it is
important to at least know the limits and some general guidance on what is good
or bad for a screwed connection of 3d-printed parts.</p>
<h6 id="screw-preload">Screw Preload<a href="#screw-preload"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>In screw theory, one of the most important values is the preload force
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolted_joint#Theory">Wikipedia</a>).  That&#39;s the clamping force exerted by
the screw at rest after tightening.  For a screwed joint to work, the preload
force must be greater than any forces experienced by the joint during
operation.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="spring analogy for a bolted joint" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg"/></p><div>
      <p>A bolted or screwed joint can be modelled using springs.  Preload compresses
the parts and elongates the screw.  As long as the external load never
becomes greater than the preload, the joint is fixed in place.</p>
<p>Image by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spring_Analogy_for_a_Bolted_Joint.jpg">Stephen Mckelvey</a>.</p>
    </div>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>In metal to metal joints, this preload is achieved by elongation of the screw.
In 3d-printing and other thermoplastics applications, the joint members are much
less stiff than the screw, leading to the preload mostly coming from compression
of the plastic parts instead.  The implication is that any of the traditional
preload calculation methods are mostly useless here.</p>
<p>Attempting to reach the required preload force, one quickly reaches the yield
strength limit of the printed parts, leading to deformation or worse.  While
the achievable preload is usually enough to deal with static loads of an
application, it is often not possible to counteract the dynamic loads.
Vibrations or shocks are usually the worst offenders.</p>
<p>The solution is one that&#39;s also often used for additional security of metal
joints as well:  Use additional screw locking measures, like lock-nuts or a
threadlocking adhesive.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R5.1"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R5.1</strong> 
    —
    Protect dynamically loaded screws with additional locking measures like threadlocking adhesive.
  </p>
<h6 id="screw-length">Screw Length<a href="#screw-length"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>Another noteworthy parameter of screwed joints is the length of the screw, or
more precisely the length of the compressed section of the 3d-printed parts. As
a rule of thumb, you should design the joint such that the screw is as long as
possible.</p>
<p>There are two effects at play that make this a reasonable choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>A long screw ensures the part is preloaded entirely in compression rather
than tension.  When an external load is then applied, it counteracts the
compression.  With a short screw, the external load would just add more
tension which printed parts often cannot take well anyway.</li>
<li>A longer screw has to be tightened with more turns to compress the part past
its yield strength.  This means it becomes less likely to accidentally
overtighten the joint.</li>

<h6 id="threads-in-printed-parts">Threads in Printed Parts<a href="#threads-in-printed-parts"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>With screws and thermoplastics, an important consideration is the thread for the
screw to fasten to.  In metal applications, the thread is often simply cut into
the mating part.  With 3d-printed parts, the same is possible, but threads made
from thermoplastics are a lot weaker.  This means the threads can be easily
stripped by overtightening the screw.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, plastic threads are an option.  They can be tapped into a part if
an adequately sized hole is printed and wall thickness is high enough.  For
bigger diameter threads (M8 and up), modelling the threads in CAD and printing
them is an option, although quality of such threads is not always good.  The
strength of thermoplastic threads is surprisingly good — however
they do not like repeated assembly and the aforementioned overtightening problem
should not be underestimated.</p>

<p>An alternative to thread tapping is to combine the previously discussed concept
of <a href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs">Crush Ribs</a> with a standard threaded screw.  The screw can
deform the crush ribs to create its own thread.  This rib thread forming works
surprisingly well, as demonstrated by Thomas Sanladerer

</h6>
<p>As the downsides of plastic threads are well known from injection molding,
alternative solutions have emerged.  Most popular are small metal threaded
inserts which are added to the part as a strong and long-lasting thread.
Usually, these inserts are heat-set into an appropriately dimensioned hole.</p>

    Use heat-set threaded inserts to add highly reusable and robust threads to a part.
  </p>
<p>A design limitation of threaded inserts is that they are not reliably usable
for screws inserted from the back side.  During insertion, heat-set inserts
often push some molten plastic into the hole beneath them, preventing easy
insertion of a screw from the back side.  While the hole diameter can be tuned
to prevent this, my experience is that this is not really portable to other
3d-printers.</p>
<h6 id="embedded-nuts">Embedded Nuts<a href="#embedded-nuts"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>A more cost effective alternative to threaded insert is embedding standard nuts
into 3d-printed parts.  Usually, this is done by preparing an appropriate
cutout into which the nut can be inserted after or during printing.</p>

  </div>
</span></p><p>Embedded nuts are not only cheap, they are also a great alternative for the
mentioned design limitation of threaded inserts.  A nut is predestined to be
placed on the far side of a part, making through-joints with long screws easy
to realize.  This also plays into the benefits of using long screws again.</p>
<p>Two kinds of cutouts have emerged in my designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sideface cutouts are rectangular cutouts reaching in from a side of the part to insert the nut horizontally.</li>
<li>Backface cutouts are hexagonal pockets on the exit of the screw through-hole.</li>
</ul>

  </p>
<p>The big downside of the embedded nuts approach is that they often fall out of
their cutouts during assembly.  Tuning the cutout dimensions usually does not
work well — the only real solution is to &#34;plug&#34; the cutouts by inserting
the nuts halfway through the print.  This does, however, complicate the
printing and assembly complexity considerably, so it often is not a desirable
choice either.</p>
<h6 id="thread-strength">Thread Strength<a href="#thread-strength"><i></i></a>
</h6>
<p>With all these options for adding threads and the many design considerations
surrounding them, one last factor that does play a role is the strength of the
threads.  Lucky for us, all of the discussed options almost always have
strength beyond the design requirements, with the other factors being more
prevalent.</p>
<p>Again, Stefan from CNC Kitchen has a nice writeup on his experiments
on the topic (<a href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/helicoils-threaded-insets-and-embedded-nuts-in-3d-prints-strength-amp-strength-assessment">CNC Kitchen</a>).</p>
<h4 id="dowel-pins">Dowel Pins<a href="#dowel-pins"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s look at machine elements beyond screws next.  While the use of dowel pins
is quite rare in 3d-printed design, they should still get mentioned.  In
traditional mechanical design, they are the go-to solution for accurately and
repeatedly locating one part to another.</p>
<p>As the tolerances of 3d-printing often make such accuracy superfluous, the uses
of dowel pins here are limited.  Additionally, such pins need an engineering
fit which is difficult to achieve in 3d-printing.  The best solution are the
<a href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#circles-considered-harmful">hexagonal holes</a> or <a href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs">crush ribs</a>
mentioned before, or post processing of the printed parts.</p>

</h4>
<p>With the <a href="https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#embedded-nuts">embedded nuts</a>, we already discussed one element that
can be inserted into a part mid-print.  This concept can be used for many
other things as well — many designs have been published that use this
method in some way.</p>
<p>To quickly discuss the concept again, it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the design, a cavity is left for the component to occupy.</li>
<li>During slicing, a pause is configured right before the layer above the cavity.</li>
<li>When the printer reaches the pause, the hardware is inserted.</li>
<li>Then the print is resumed, enclosing the hardware and often permanently fusing the part with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get some inspiration, take a look at the window in this <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/894202-modern-gridfinity-case">Modern Gridfinity
Case</a> by Matthew.  It is made from a transparent
PETG sheet that gets inserted into the print.  The design even includes small
tabs to hold the sheet in place, right as it is inserted.  This makes for a very
robust design and the result is hard to achieve with any other methods.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Of course, many other components can be inserted into 3d-prints.  To name a few more:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Trapped fasteners&#34; are inserted such that they cannot fall out of the part, making it hard to loose them.</li>
<li>Magnets</li>
<li>Metal mesh</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the big advantage of embedded hardware is that additional joining or
fastening means can be avoided.  Do, however, consider the downside that
embedded hardware can only be extracted destructively and replacement is
usually impossible.</p>

<h4 id="printing-on-fabric">Printing on Fabric<a href="#printing-on-fabric"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>A technique that is very similar to inserted hardware, but deserves attention on
its own, is incorporating fabric into a 3d-print.  This produces parts with
unique flexibility, especially interesting for wearable applications.  For this
reason, 3d-printing onto fabric is quite popular in the cosplay scene.</p>
<p>The gist is that a print consisting of many individual pieces is paused roughly
2 to 3 layers in.  Then a piece of tulle fabric is draped across the initial
layers.  When resuming the print, the new layers on top will fuse into the lower
ones, securing each part to the fabric.</p>

<p><span>

    </div>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>The flexibility of the resulting design can be finely controlled by the geometry
of the solid 3d-printed shapes.  Other people have already experimented with this
technique a lot, for example you can check out the video tutorial from UncleJessy
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjH5KGw3Psw">YouTube</a>).</p>
<h2 id="6-appearance">6. Appearance<a href="#6-appearance"><i></i></a>

<h4 id="complex-shapes">Complex Shapes<a href="#complex-shapes"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>While appearance isn&#39;t the main concern of functional design, no parts should
be designed without consideration of their appearance.  3d-printing uniquely
allows complex surface shapes to be added &#34;for free&#34;.  Suddenly, the
consideration is no longer about increased manufacturing cost, the only
remaining factor is the time it takes to design such shapes.</p>
<p>Of course, complex shapes should still follow the basic constraints of the
process — avoiding overhangs and not mandating support material.  But
beyond that, there is no reason to limit designs to the straight and
rectangular shapes of traditional functional parts.</p>
<p>There are even places where complex, maybe organic, shapes have a use beyond
appearance: For ergonomic design, such shapes are usually much better suited.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R6.1"><i></i></a>

  </p>
<h4 id="shadow-lines">Shadow Lines<a href="#shadow-lines"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>One trick we can borrow from traditional product design practices are <em>shadow
lines</em>.  They improve the appearance of seams between mating surfaces of
multiple joined parts.  When two surfaces are pressed directly against each
other, the result will never look great due to the imperfections on both sides
leading to an uneven seam.</p>
<p><em>Shadow lines</em> improve on this by leaving a controlled larger gap between the
surfaces and hiding the actual mechanical connection behind a small lip.  The
larger gap is wide enough such that the small surface imperfections are no
longer distinguishable.  This leaves the result with a very even look without
requiring extreme precision.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="Example of a part with a shadow line" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/shadow-line-valve.jpg"/></p><p>The upper and lower half of the valve actuator body have an evenly sized gap
between them.  The real seam is actually hidden behind the shadow line.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>It may be enough to place a single lip on the shadow line to hide the real seam.
If dust protection is of concern, a second lip on the inner side can transform
the shadow line into a sort of labyrinth seal, providing for more than just
aesthetics.</p>
<p>Shadow lines can also be used on parts joined at an angle, like a lid placed
flat onto a box.  In this case, a constant offset is left between the size of
the lid and the surrounding box, with alignment tabs on the inside ensuring the
lid stays centered.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="Shadow line on the lid of an electronics enclosure" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/shadow-line-electronics.jpg"/></p><p>The lid is surrounded by yet another evenly sized gap.  To ensure it stays
centered, alignment ribs on the inside locate it quite precisely.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>To learn even more about this concept, Teaching Tech has made a video about the
topic (<a href="https://youtu.be/8dhFhU7Nl_0">YouTube</a>).</p>

    Create shadow lines along the joining edge between two parts.
  </p>
<h4 id="surface-texture">Surface Texture<a href="#surface-texture"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Another significant factor for appearance is surface texture.  With
3d-printing, we generally do not have much control about them.  Especially
vertical surfaces will always prominently display the layer lines inherent to
the process.</p>
<p>With special print beds, like textured steel sheets, the bottom surface of parts
can be refined.  This allows for a very clean texture, but is of course quite
limited because only one surface of each part can get this treatment.
Sometimes, it is actually desirable to avoid having a bed surface on a part, to
keep all sides looking more even.  One way to do this is rotating parts to a
diagonal angle relative to the print bed.</p>
<p>For vertical surfaces, where the layer lines are sometimes destroying the
aesthetics of a part, a trick has been developed to help hiding them.  <em>Fuzzy
skin</em> adds irregularities to each layer perimeter, building up to a surface that
appears more rough, but without prominent layer lines.</p>
<p>Fuzzy skin also has a pleasant feel to it, if tuned correctly, which has made it
a popular choice for 3d-printed grips and handles.</p>

<p><span>

  </p>
<h4 id="printed-text">Printed Text<a href="#printed-text"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Another nice side-effect of the nature of 3d-printing is the fact that it is
laughably simple to add text or symbols to a part.  No need for stickers,
decals, or labor-intensive engravings.  There is no excuse to not add text to a
printed part.</p>
<p>A starting point is to make it a habit to add part numbers into each part of a
larger design.  This way it is easy to keep everything organized.  Especially
when iterating on a part a lot, having the revision index printed onto it can
reduce confusion quite a lot.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="part with text printed on it" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/engraved-text.jpg"/></p><p>An enclosure with a label text engraved into it.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>There are two ways to add text or symbols:  Either the text gets cut into the
surface, which is called engraving.  Or the text can be raised over the
surface, called embossing.  For the most part, engraving leads to much cleaner
results with 3d-printing.  This is especially true as the font size gets
smaller.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R6.4"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R6.4</strong> 
    —
    Prefer engraving text over embossing.
  </p>
<p>Regarding orientation, the best results will be achieved by placing the text such
that it is vertical to the print surface.  This way it gets printed as part of
the perimeter lines where the printer can achieve the most detail.</p>
<p>
    <a href="#rule-R6.5"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R6.5</strong> 
    —
    Place engraved/embossed text vertical to the print surface.
  </p>
<p>Experience has shown that most printers can print a text with 0.6 mm
minimum stroke width and engraved to 0.5 mm depth without issues.</p>

<p>For the final chapter, I want to investigate a completely different design
approach for 3d-printing — vase mode design.  Inherently, the FFF
3d-printing process is not volumetric.  Volumetric parts are only achieved by
using lines of plastic, fused together such that a volume emerges.  But
whether this is the most efficient way to make use of the 3d-printing process
is a question worth asking.</p>
<p>Vase mode is an alternative approach where only a hollow shell of a part is
printed, using a single perimeter line.  Instead of individual layers, the Z
height slowly increases such that filament is laid down in a spiral. This has
a number of advantageous consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very efficient because 100% of the print time is spent extruding filament.</li>
<li>Due to the lack of individual layers, there is no seam in the surface.</li>
<li>As the printer never stops printing, no stringing issues can occur.</li>
<li>It is very fast because the least amount of plastic is used to represent a part&#39;s shape.</li>
<li>It can also leads to very light parts due to the decreased filament usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big downside is of course that parts become very unstable due to the
missing internal support.  For certain kinds of parts, especially artistic
ones, this may not be a problem.  Even for functional parts, like vases —
where this technique got its name — the strength might already be
sufficient.</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="Vase mode vase" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/vase.png"/></p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>With vase mode, the most important factor to part strength is surface geometry.
Surfaces that are flat or only bend in only one direction perform the worst.
Intricate shapes often show much more strength.  This can be seen especially
with the impressive strength some vase designs manage to achieve.</p>
<h4 id="beading-patterns">Beading Patterns<a href="#beading-patterns"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>What those vases achieve through style can be used for technical designs in
the form of <em>beading patterns</em>.  They describe features that are added to thin
sheet-material parts to give them additional strength.  CNC-Kitchen has made a
video about using beading patterns for 3d-printing where this concept is
explored in more detail (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs">YouTube</a>).  There is also a german
web-book going into detail about beading patterns in general
(<a href="https://4ming.de/de/forming-handbuch/leichtbau-durch-sicken-fachbuch">4ming.de</a>).</p>

<p>
    <a href="#rule-R7.1"><i></i></a>
    <strong>R7.1</strong> 
    —
    Use beading patterns to make vase mode parts more stiff.
  </p>
<h4 id="unconventional-vase-mode">Unconventional Vase Mode<a href="#unconventional-vase-mode"><i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Interestingly, it is possible to adapt vase mode for even more uses.  The trick
is in viewing vase mode as a way to have very tight control over the way that a
printer extrudes filament.  A part is designed such that its surface perimeters
describe a path for the printer which ultimately results in the intended
geometry.  An impressive example of this is the stackable tray designed by
FPacheco (<a href="https://www.printables.com/model/514142-vase-mode-stackable-hextray-60-mm-hexagons">Printables</a>).</p>

<p><span>
  <div>
    <p><img alt="vase mode stackable tray" src="https://nmn.gl/design-for-3d-printing/vase-mode-tray.jpg"/></p><p>This tray looks nothing like a vase-mode part but is the result of very careful and clever design.</p>
    
  </div>
</span></p><p>While the resulting part for such designs looks nothing like a normal vase mode
part, it still gets the 100% print time benefit of vase mode.  Especially when
a part shall be produced in high quantity, this may have significant impact.</p>

<p>Alright, you have made it to the end.  Below, you will find a final summary of
all the design rules discussed in this blog post.  Use them as a reference for
your designs, as &#34;sane defaults&#34; when there is no good reason to deviate.  But
at the same time, these are no laws — there are many situations where
doing things differently is the better choice.  It is your job as the design
engineer to make these decisions.</p>
<p>I have thought long about where I should publish this information.  For now,
placing it here on my blog felt like the easiest choice.  But such &#34;rules&#34; live
from discussion and I would love to hear your opinions and to get talking about
them.  If enough interest emerges, I would be interested in turning this into an
&#34;open-source book&#34; where others can contribute their own rules or suggest
changes to the existing ones.  My ultimate goal is finding the best approaches
for design for 3d-printing.  And such a feat is only achievable by the community
at large.</p>
