    <h1>Words that seem related but aren&#39;t (2015)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A crayfish is not a fish, an outrage is not a rage, and there&#39;s no bomb in bombast. Words suggest one thing, but their histories tell us another.</p><p><strong>1. PEN AND PENCIL</strong></p><p><em>Pencil</em> originally referred to a paintbrush with a fine, tapered end, and can be traced back to the Latin <em>penicillus</em>, for paintbrush. <em>Pen</em>, on the other hand, goes back to Latin <em>penna</em>, for feather, which is what the original pens were.</p><p><strong>2. MALE AND FEMALE</strong></p><p>Where <em>male</em> goes back to Latin <em>masculus</em>, <em>female</em> comes through French <em>femelle</em> from Latin <em>femella</em>. The eventual overlap in pronunciation was accidental.</p><p><strong>3. FISH AND CRAYFISH</strong></p><p>In Middle English, crayfish was <em>crevice/-visse</em>, related to French <em>écrevisse</em>, related to the German <em>Krebs</em>, for crab. The <em>visse</em> was close enough in pronunciation to <em>fish</em> that some confusion led to a spelling change.</p><p><strong>4. HANG AND HANGNAIL</strong></p><p>Though a hangnail seems to be a piece of skin that &#34;hangs&#34; off your nail area, it&#39;s actually an &#34;angry&#34; nail. <em>Ang-</em>, meaning troubling or distressing in Latin, also meant painful in Old English.</p><p><strong>5. EAR AND EAR (OF CORN)</strong></p><p>Isn&#39;t it odd how an ear of corn looks nothing like an ear? That&#39;s because the root of the corn ear is in Old English <em>éar</em> or <em>eher</em>, which always referred to the spiky, seed bearing part of a grain plant, and not to <em>éare</em>, which always meant the ear.</p><p><strong>6. HOUSE AND PENTHOUSE</strong></p><p>There is no house in <em>penthouse</em>. It came from Anglo-Norman <em>pentiz</em>, which was an outbuilding, or &#34;appendage&#34; to a main building.</p><p><strong>7. STAR AND STARLING</strong></p></div><div><p>A starling is a bird of the genus <em>Sturnus</em>, which was the Latin name for the bird. It was called <em><em>stær</em></em> or<em> </em><em><em>stærlinc</em></em> in Old English, and the pronunciation drifted its way to starling.</p><p><strong>8. FACE AND SHAMEFACED</strong></p><p><em>Shamefaced</em> began as shame<em>fast</em>, with the same suffix found in <em>steadfast</em> and <em>holdfast</em>, and it had the sense of being shy or restrained by shame.</p><p><strong>9. GINGER AND GINGERLY</strong></p><p>The <em>ginger</em> in <em>gingerly</em> is not related to the spice identified by the genus <em>Zingiber</em> but to Old French <em>gensor</em>, which is related to <em>gent</em>, as in &#34;well-born.&#34; It referred to small, elegant steps, like those a gentleman would make.</p><p><strong>10. STEP AND STEPMOTHER/FATHER</strong></p><p>The <em>step-</em> in words for step family members comes not from the word for taking a step with the foot, nor the related metaphor for being removed by one unit, but to an old root <em>stéop-</em>, related to the concept of bereavement. The earliest use of this prefix was in an Old English word for orphan, <em>stéopcild</em>, or stepchild.</p><p><strong>11. SCOTLAND AND SCOT-FREE</strong></p><p><em>Scot-free</em> is an alteration of <em>shot-free</em>, where <em>shot</em> was a charge or share of a payment. It was a lucky thing to get out of a meal or a night at the tavern shot-free. It later came to mean escaping without injury, and came to be pronounced as <em>scot</em> instead of <em>shot</em>.</p><p><strong>12. LOCK AND WEDLOCK</strong></p><p><em>Wedlock</em> comes from Old English <em>wedlác</em>, where <em>lác</em> was a suffix that formed an action noun out of another noun. Other suffixed words were <em>brýdlác</em> (nuptials), <em>réaflác</em> (robbery), and<em>feohtlác</em> (warfare). <em>Wedlock</em> is the only one we still use today.</p><p><strong>13. BOMB AND BOMBAST</strong></p><p>Bombastic talk can be explosive and in-your-face, but the word traces back to the soft, downy, French <em>bombace</em>, the name for raw cotton. It was used as stuffing or padding in clothing and in that way took on the meaning of talk that enlarges, pads out, or inflates.</p><p><strong>14. RAGE AND OUTRAGE</strong></p><p>Etymologically speaking, outrage is not a type of rage. While <em>rage</em> traces back to the Latin for rabies, <em>outrage</em> comes from Old French <em>ultrage</em>, where the <em>ult-</em> is that of <em>ultra</em>, meaning beyond and the <em>-age</em> is the suffix found in <em>plumage</em>, <em>steerage</em>, <em>usage</em>, etc. Outrage is &#34;ultra-age&#34; or beyond-ness. It originally referred to a serious transgression or insult.</p><p><strong>15. MAN AND HUMAN</strong></p><p><em><em><em>Man</em> </em></em>comes from a Germanic root, and in all the Germanic languages has had both senses of &#34;person&#34; and &#34;adult male person.&#34; Human comes from a Latin root, <em></em><em>humanus</em>, meaning that having to do with people (rather than animals or gods).</p></div></div>
