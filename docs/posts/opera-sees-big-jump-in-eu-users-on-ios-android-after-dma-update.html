    <h1>Opera sees big jump in EU users on iOS, Android after DMA update</h1>

<p>Opera has reported a substantial 164% increase in new European Union users on iOS devices after Apple introduced a new feature to comply with the EU&#39;s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Digital Markets Act </a>(DMA).</p>
<p>With iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new choice screen that asks EU users to select a default web browser from a list of randomly listed browsers, including Opera.</p>
<p>When users open Safari for the first time after updating their phone, they will see a list of popular browsers in their region to choose from as their default browser.</p>
<p>To be on this list, a browser needs at least 5,000 downloads in the EU&#39;s App Store from the last year. If a company has more than one browser app, only the most popular one is included.</p>
<p>&#34;Up to 11 of the most downloaded browsers on iOS in that country in the prior year that meet the above criteria will be selected for the browser choice screen in addition to Safari,&#34; Apple explained <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a web page</a> about the new browser choice screen.</p>
<p>&#34;Apple will update the list of browsers eligible to be shown on the choice screen once per calendar year.&#34;</p>

<p>The new browser choice screen showcases up to 11 of the top downloaded browsers in users&#39; countries over the last year, along with Safari, all presented in a randomized order.</p>
<p>Google also rolled out a <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/dma/browser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">similar browser choice screen</a> to Android users on March 6th, which will be shown during the initial setup of an Android smartphone or tablet.</p>
<h2>Opera sees a surge in installs</h2>
<p>After this new feature was rolled out, Opera now says they have seen significant growth across key EU markets for iOS and Android versions.</p>
<p>Apple users in France witnessed an impressive 402% increase in new Opera users. Spain, Poland, and Germany also saw a substantial rise in new users, 143%, 68%, and 56% respectively.</p>
<p>This data suggests a growing interest among iOS users in exploring browser alternatives like Opera.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Android version of Opera also experienced a boost, especially in France, where new user inflow rose by 54% on the day the browser choice screen was introduced.</p>
<p>&#34;The day the ballot screen started to appear, we saw a spike in the growth of our daily active users, especially for Opera for iOS,&#34; <a href="http://press.opera.com/2024/03/18/opera-jump-in-new-eu-users-after-ballot-screen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said Jørgen Arnesen</a>, EVP Mobile at Opera.</p>
<p>&#34;We see this as indicative of two things: for one, the importance of regulation to provide a more level playing field, and for another, that users are hungry for new and innovative products that can deliver a superior online experience.&#34;</p>
<p>These findings are supported by an Opera survey conducted before March 6th, which showed that 80% of European smartphone users were open to trying a new browser. </p>
<p>The survey highlighted the importance of offering users more choice and transparency in selecting their browsers.</p>
<p>Opera is not the only browser company experiencing growth since the new DMA changes went into effect.</p>
<p>Brave had earlier tweeted about a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/brave-sharp-increase-in-installs-after-ios-dma-update-in-eu/" target="_blank">spike in its iOS browser installations</a>, further underscoring the impact of Apple&#39;s new browser choice screen in the EU.</p>
