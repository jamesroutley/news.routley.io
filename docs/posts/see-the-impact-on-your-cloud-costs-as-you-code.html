    <h1>Show HN: See the impact on your cloud costs as you code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey folks, my name is Owen and I recently started working at a startup (<a href="https://infracost.io/">https://infracost.io/</a>) that shows engineers how much their code changes are going to cost on the cloud before being deployed (in CI/CD like GitHub or GitLab). Previously,</p><p>I was one of the founders of tfsec (it scanned code for security issues). One of the things I learnt was if we catch issues early, i.e. when the engineer was typing their code, we save a bunch of time.</p><p>I was thinking â€¦ okay, why not build cloud costs into the code editor. Show the cloud cost impact of the code as the engineers are writing it.</p><p>So I spent some weekends and built one right into JetBrains - fully free - keep in mind it is new, might be buggy, so please let me know if you find issues. It is check it out: <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24761-infracost" rel="nofollow">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24761-infracost</a></p><p>I recorded a video too, if you just want to see what it does:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgfkdmUNzEo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgfkdmUNzEo</a></p><p>I&#39;d love to get your feedback on this. I want to know if it is helpful, what other cool features we can add to it, and how can we make it better?</p><p>Final note - the extension calls our Cloud Pricing API, which holds 4 million prices from AWS, Azure and GCP, so no secrets, credentials etc are touched at all.</p><p>If you want to get the same Infracost goodness in your CI/CD, check out <a href="https://www.infracost.io/cicd">https://www.infracost.io/cicd</a></p></div></div></div>
