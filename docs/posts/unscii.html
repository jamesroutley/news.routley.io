<p>Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts.
Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable
for terminal and programming use.</p>

<p>The two main variants are unscii-8 (8×8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16
(8×16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as
an 8x16 &#34;full&#34; variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from
Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. &#34;unscii-16-full&#34; falls under GPL because
of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.</p>

<p>Unscii was created by Viznut.</p>
