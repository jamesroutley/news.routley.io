<p dir="auto">DO NOT CLOSE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT DOEN&#39;T MEET THE CRITERIA OF A VALID ISSUE! THERE ARE SOME VERY SALIENT ISSUES BEING RAISED IN THIS ISSUE.....</p>
<p dir="auto">I have reported issues as far back as Feb, 2022, and of as now, many of these reported issues remain unfixed. This is really a poor situation where I have to open an issue to complain about issues not being fixed. The lack of response to issues <strong>IS</strong> the issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">I reported an issue (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1137585916" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/4672/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672">#4672</a>) and here we are at .NET 8 and this VERY BASIC thing remains unfixed. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/davidortinau/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/davidortinau">@davidortinau</a> I know I have been critical of the lack of desktop support and I do applaud your efforts in shoring up this deficiency in the latest releases, but how long do we have to wait for the most basic MAUI stuff to work properly?</p>
<p dir="auto">When I open a window that has frames, it almost NEVER draws correctly. You have to resize the window to force a layout recalculation for things to correct themselves. Here is a picture of an app that has a flyout strip and it never draws correctly until a window resizes:</p>

<p dir="auto">I reported this almost 2 years ago and you (David) even added comments to the original issue: Controls/Layout does not draw controls correctly in first-time view. <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1137585916" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/4672/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672">#4672</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It has been in the backlog ever since and I would think that something that makes a MAUI app look like total s&amp;#t would be a concern of the MAUI team.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, I reported the fact that easy controls like Switch cannot have its basic colors changed (at least at the time I reported the issue: There is no way to set the text color of a Switch control <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1315936359" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/8965" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/8965/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/8965">#8965</a>). Gerold V just took it upon himself to close my issue by telling me, in essence, we are not going to do stuff like this. I should go write platform-specific code. That&#39;s ridiculous because what is platform-specific about the Switch control??? In WPF EVERYTHING was stylable... Why is it the responsibility of the development community to do your work by writing handlers and such to get something simple to work?</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, take a look at the screenshots above. Notice the minimize, maximize, and close buttons are double-drawn. How does this stuff pass QA??????</p>
<p dir="auto">I am getting ready to roll this out to 2000 perspective users and I will not be proud of 99.99999% of the app because of the visual aspects of MAUI. I looked at UNO and Avalon back when I was deciding to go cross-platform and I decided to stick with Microsoft all the way for everything: .NET, MAUI, gRPC, ASPNETCORE, etc... I wanted the whole stack to be Microsoft, but I am ruing my decision... MAUI is great in concept, but not in implementation. Simply upgrading Xamarin to MAUI did not buy the community much in the whole product delivery. You guys have focused far too much effort on sapping milliseconds out of performance while glaring visual bugs persist. I think 90% of the attention should be placed on fixing bugs and performing better QA. I know stuff breaks from release to release and I would think that decent regression testing would catch stuff like this. I also think you guys need to look at WPF and figure out how to achieve the functionality that existed there before developing new stuff. I would love a WYSIWIG XAML editor so we can see what we are designing without having to run the app. This brings me to Hot Reload which RARELY works! It does work on straight XAML, but not XAML in templates. I see it work there, but as I said, rarely.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have been a developer since 1984 and have focused much of my career on UI design. WinForms was great and WPF was even greater. MAUI isn&#39;t even making the charts... I sometimes spend hours trying to get something that was easy in WPF to work in MAUI and that is time I don&#39;t have...</p>
<p dir="auto">Yes, this rant is probably misplaced here in the issues log, but how else can somebody truly vent their frustrations about developing with MAUI? I spoke via a TEAMS meeting early last year with both David and Maddy and I let my opinions be known then. Here it is almost two years later, and nothing is even slightly easier to develop in MAUI... I would love for David to be made aware of this &#34;issue&#34; and have him contact me directly. This doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface of my frustrations...</p>
<p dir="auto">I really want to talk to <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/davidortinau/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/davidortinau">@davidortinau</a> directly. Please pass this on to him.</p>
