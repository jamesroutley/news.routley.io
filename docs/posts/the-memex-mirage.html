<p data-block-key="5j1v6">In case you use Pinboard, heads-up that you might want to hedge your bets. An <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/368202/Is-Pinboardin-bookmarking-site-still-supported-software">Ask MetaFilter conversation from the last few months: &#34;Is Pinboard.in (bookmarking site) still supported software?&#34;</a></p><p data-block-key="744hr">Also:</p><p data-block-key="f6le">In December, <a href="https://aus.social/@attacus/109597004356497781">Lilly Ryan wrote a Fediverse thread about the difficulty of systematically managing information we find via the web</a>. We&#39;ve had the design goal of the memex since Vannevar Bush wrote a spec in 1945, yet:</p><blockquote data-block-key="8a26c">it sure is A Thing that we donâ€™t have a clear, accessible solution to the problem of personal information management, given that it was a major point of personal computing and the Web to begin with.</blockquote><p data-block-key="bv2ru">Ryan also requests:</p><blockquote data-block-key="f4rj3">Knowledgeable people: tell me about your workflows and why they work for you! Link me to articles and resources that dig deeper into these issues so I can lose myself in reading more about it!</blockquote><p data-block-key="7qdsm">so please do so by <a href="https://aus.social/@attacus/109597004395278576">replying to that thread</a>.</p><p data-block-key="aop24">But even if you don&#39;t -- please know that <b>you are not alone</b>. Managing your bookmarks is tedious and hard and you likely do not have tools that would make this part of your life properly manageable.</p><p data-block-key="7u0ib">Because this post is also a followup to <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2019/its-not-just-you/">&#34;It&#39;s Not Just You.&#34;</a>, where I said:</p><blockquote data-block-key="69cqd">...a ton of fiddly expensive-if-you-make-a-mistake labor has emerged or shifted onto the middle class&#39;s shoulders, without commensurate logistical, psychological, or financial support for that shift.....</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="5dubi">Expectations around planning, decision speed and responsibility, and focus that used to only apply to executives with secretaries now apply to all knowledge workers. And I am struck by how many skills we are expected to have, as adults in 2019 middle-class America, that NO ONE HAS EVER HAD BEFORE, basically.</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="b6aji">Here, manage e-mail, a.k.a. this endless TODO list that grows without your input.</blockquote><blockquote data-block-key="crcda">Here, resist the best gambling temptation ever invented, which is on the same device you are expected to carry at all times.....</blockquote><p data-block-key="dmfqs">And I&#39;d add: here, be your own librarian and archivist for a dizzying variety of formats, media, interpersonal communications platforms, etc. so you can immediately re-find that resource you ran across yesterday or ten years ago.
