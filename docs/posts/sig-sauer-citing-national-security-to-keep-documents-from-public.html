        <p><em>The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed <strong>Glasscock v. Sig Sauer</strong> to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s new</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Trace intervenes in the appeal.</strong> The newsroom moved to intervene <strong>for the limited purpose of opposing</strong> sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA <strong>nine times</strong> when it certified the class.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army.</strong> In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A second FMECA document emerges.</strong> Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are <strong>two</strong> FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a <strong>FMECA Spreadsheet</strong> and a <strong>FMECA Memorandum</strong>—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PSI’s reporting is part of the record.</strong> The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FMECA document was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/the-document-sig-sauer-doesnt-want-you-to-see-about-the-p320/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-traces-pitch-this-isnt-secret-anymore">The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore</h2>

<p>The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed <strong>100,000 views</strong>. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs <strong>Phil Strader</strong> being asked on the <em>Behind the Lens</em> podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, <strong>“No, there’s not”</strong> (nothing to hide), while <strong>directing viewers to this website to see the document</strong> and describing its contents.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-08.png" alt="Screenshot 8"/></p>

<p>The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/sig-sauer-vp-consumer-affairs-discusses-the-document-they-didnt-want-you-to-see/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”?</strong> The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they <em>do</em> document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.</p>

<p>The Trace also points to <strong>DoD Instruction 5230.24</strong>, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it <strong>does not authorize withholding unclassified information</strong> about <strong>evaluations of performance and reliability</strong> of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA <strong>bears no DoD distribution markings</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sig-sauers-response-let-the-army-decideand-keep-the-lid-on">Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on</h2>

<p>Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace <strong>lacks standing</strong> and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on <strong>military‑secrets</strong> concerns, requests time for the <strong>Army to opine</strong> on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-10.png" alt="Screenshot 10"/></p>

<p>Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:</p>

<p>1) <strong>The “FMECA Memorandum.”</strong> Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Ongoing Army communications.</strong> Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were <strong>unavailable</strong> the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.</p>

<h2 id="the-transparency-question-distilled">The transparency question, distilled</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is the FMECA “national‑security” material?</strong> The Trace says <strong>no</strong>—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it <strong>does not provide authority to withhold</strong> unclassified evaluations of <strong>performance and reliability</strong>—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is secrecy even possible at this point?</strong> The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is <strong>online on this website</strong>, has been <strong>reposted broadly</strong>, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who <strong>told listeners where to find it</strong>. One video discussing it has <strong>100,000+ views</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-to-the-class-actionand-to-owners">Why this matters to the class action—and to owners</h2>

<p>The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on <strong>notice</strong> and <strong>risk‑mitigation</strong> questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="my-role-plainly">My role, plainly</h2>

<p>Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‑sports and firearms industry. The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-to-watch-next">What to watch next</h2>

<p>1) <strong>Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention</strong> and applies the strong presumption of public access to <strong>class‑certification</strong> records.</p>
