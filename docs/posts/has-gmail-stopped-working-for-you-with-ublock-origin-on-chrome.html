    <h1>Ask HN: Has Gmail stopped working for you with uBlock Origin on Chrome?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Noticed since a couple of days ago that my Gmail and Google Workspace emails weren&#39;t loading on Chrome while they continue to work on Firefox.<p>And then I realised today that when I turn off uBlock origin on Chrome, then my emails start loading again on Gmail.</p><p>Is this happening to others? Is Google actively trying to kill all adblockers in Chrome this way?</p></div></div>
