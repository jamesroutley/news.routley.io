    <h1>Lessons from Growing a Piracy Streaming Site</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>There are some contemporary piracy services that run ads—for marketing and, well, advertising purposes. This ranges
from PPC to social media campaigns. I opted not to, mostly because I didn&#39;t think I could do it tastefully,
and because I&#39;d probably attract users who wouldn&#39;t be great customers.</p>

<p>Instead, my marketing relied entirely on word-of-mouth—which meant building tremendous trust with my users,
plus a single growth hack that I&#39;ll describe later on this page.</p>

<p>This is all fairly standard startup knowledge—I&#39;ve worked with more than a handful of Y Combinator companies and I could apply this to all of them—but it&#39;s interesting to see how many parallels existed between what I built and what a &#34;real&#34; startup looks like.  </p>

<p>I learned a lot about running a business while operating HeheStreams: customer experience, retention, product design, and the weird parallels between illegal streaming and your typical B2C.  </p>

<p>Think of this as a founder postmortem with felony-level customer support.</p>

<h2>Lessons from Growing a B2C</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>noreply@</code> is absolutely stupid.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>I did everything I could to be visible to customers and encouraged them to talk to me any time. That helped build trust in a product sitting in a sea of shady, fly-by-night operations. I ended every email with some variation of &#34;If you need anything, just reply :)&#34;.</p>

<p><strong>Get customers started.</strong>  </p>

<p>After a user subscribed, I sent a sequence of onboarding emails to make sure they were actually using the site: After three days, I&#39;d check whether they&#39;d watched anything and ask if they needed help; after they watched <em>n</em> minutes, I&#39;d send an NPS-style survey (&#34;1–10, how likely are you to recommend...&#34;) and if they gave a 9 or 10, I&#39;d invite them to leave a review; if they didn&#39;t watch anything within two weeks, I offered a refund and suggestions on where else to watch.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Send fun emails.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>My copywriting was tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating. It was all me, no bullshit. I treated <em>every</em> message—even transactional emails—as an opportunity to build trust. Users regularly told me they actually enjoyed reading my emails, which is not a thing that should happen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest about service availability.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If things went sideways, I owned it. No hiding behind &#34;maintenance windows.&#34;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A customer with a bad taste in their mouth is bad.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If someone used their entire subscription and then asked for a refund, I&#39;d still honor it—no questions asked. My users were shockingly honest, and I rarely dealt with chargebacks. My abuse detector barely had to do anything over 66 months.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It&#39;s okay to be direct about churn.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d send messages like, &#34;Hey, I saw you didn&#39;t renew. Did you find a good place to watch? Anything I could&#39;ve done better?&#34; People usually responded—nicely, even.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommend your competitors if you have to.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If a user wasn&#39;t a good fit, I happily pointed them toward alternatives. It built credibility, even if it lost me a sale.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You don&#39;t need to target everyone.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>I intentionally priced higher than competitors. That filtered in customers who were more tech-savvy and saw HeheStreams as an &#34;investment in their leisure time,&#34; not a &#34;cost.&#34;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be great at one thing, and half-assed at nothing.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>I never added generic IPTV or random channels. I focused purely on sports. That probably left money on the table, but it kept quality high.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Say no.</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Say no a lot. Customers can be stupid.</p>

<h2>The growth hack</h2>

<p>My proudest growth hack involved Reddit&#39;s API. I filtered posts mentioning phrases like &#34;NBA League Pass,&#34; &#34;blackouts,&#34; or &#34;where to&#34; on team-specific subreddits. Then I gave my users lists of those posts and encouraged them to comment—transparently—about why they liked HeheStreams, including their referral link.</p>

<p>Each referrer got a $10 credit per subscriber, and new subscribers got $10 off their next month. It worked well.</p>

<h2>Lessons still work</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve applied these same principles to a Mexican ecotourism business with great success. Some of them will never scale to hundreds of thousands of customers (you can&#39;t automate personality or hire for charm), but they work beautifully for small, honest teams. That&#39;s enough for me.</p>

<h2>Why word-of-mouth beats ads (especially when you can&#39;t run ads)</h2>

<p>I believe that trust mechanics are reflections of self. If they&#39;re artificial, people will see right through them.</p>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t trade the lessons; would strongly advise against the exit strategy. &#34;Acquired&#34; by Alliance for Creativity/Motion Picture Association.</p>
