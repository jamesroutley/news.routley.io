    <h1>Week 7: Crafting interpreters, and also relationships</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Image credit: </span><a href="https://vectorportal.com/vector/scanning-a-barcode./21323" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">VectorPortal</a></p><p><span>Since last time, </span><strong><span>I‚Äôve made </span><a href="https://github.com/solamen2/crafting-interpreters/commits/main" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">some solid forward progress</a><span> on going through </span><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Crafting Interpreters</a></strong><span>. I‚Äôve done up through the first coding chapter (chapter 4, on scanning) and it‚Äôs been fun! It‚Äôs a relief to take a bit of break and work with a language ‚Äî Java ‚Äî that I know pretty well. I‚Äôm stretching my brain in a different way by learning a subject I don‚Äôt know well (compilers / interpreters), so it‚Äôs still engaging and having me work on the edge of my abilities, since I‚Äôm resting a bit from the brain-burning of the first five weeks. And as I‚Äôve learned from running the last few years, pacing yourself is important!</span></p><p><strong>And what have I learned so far? Well, I learned what the difference is between a compiler and an interpreter</strong><span>, roughly: a compiler doesn‚Äôt run the code after processing, and an interpreter does. (It‚Äôs more complex than that </span><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html#compilers-and-interpreters" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">if you want the details</a><span>, but this is a good high-level description, I think.) </span><strong>I also learned some cool new terms like ‚Äúlexeme‚Äù</strong><span>, which is one of the raw substrings of the string input to the interpreter/compiler. And I learned many, many other things that are too much to go into in a single post!</span></p><p><span>Oh, and for those of you who are familiar with Crafting Interpreters, you might ask: </span><strong>if I‚Äôm just typing the Java code in from the book (and the book contains every line of Java you need for the interpreter), how am I making sure I understand what I‚Äôm typing?</strong><span> In two ways, actually:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Every time the code compiles, I‚Äôm running it and </span><strong>testing it with some test input</strong><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If that input works,</span><strong> I make a descriptive commit comment</strong><span> and push it to Git.</span></p></li></ol><p>That second step forces me to think about what I‚Äôve just added, and why, so that I can make a good code commit comment. So far I think it‚Äôs been working out well for comprehension!</p><p><strong>Now, will this mean my testing is amazing? No</strong><span>, since it‚Äôs just ad hoc. But I think at the end of each chapter, </span><strong>I‚Äôll integrate the official test cases</strong><span> (which you can see </span><a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test/scanning" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here for scanning</a><span>) to augment my ad hoc testing and make sure I implemented it correctly. This will be especially important later, when I plan on adding some things from my rapidly-growing TODO list (the textbook contains many natural ideas for additions). I‚Äôm not going to add the TODO stuff in till I‚Äôm done with the interpreter, though, because the book expects the compiler to be in a particular state at the end of each chapter, which implementing TODOs would interfere with.</span></p><p><span>Talking about working on Crafting Interpreters allows me to transition into my second topic for this blog post: </span><strong>new batchmates</strong><span>! </span><strong>The Winter 1s started this week</strong><span>, </span><strong>and I got to talk to lots of them about Crafting Interpreters</strong><span> today, which is exciting! It was just me and one other Recurser working on the book before, and now </span><strong>it looks like there will be maybe 6 or 7 of us now</strong><span>, which is very exciting! I always find it a lot more fun to work on projects with others, especially for learning.</span></p><p><strong>I‚Äôve also been having lots of introductory conversations with all these fun new folks</strong><span>, which as always is interesting and fun for me! I‚Äôm looking forward to pairing with some of them soon and chatting with them about their lives and hobbies and coding! I even got to show them my goofy costume for Halloween: </span><a href="https://twilightsaga.fandom.com/wiki/Edward_Cullen" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Edward Cullen from Twilight</a><span>. (I‚Äôm an Edward and I live pretty close to Forks, so he‚Äôs always been an amusing character for me to dress up as. üôÇ ) And lots of folks, familiar and new, had fun costumes too! The Recurse Center really does have a nice atmosphere with lots of fun people!</span></p><p><strong>Next time: Deeper into Crafting Interpreters!</strong><span> See you then!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
