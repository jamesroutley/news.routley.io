he wanted to show his new present to was his Uncle Mike.</p><p>Rosolowsky, an associate professor of physics at the University of Alberta, was among the first Canadian researchers to put the world’s latest and greatest space telescope to use, in his case, by observing star formation in the Triangulum Galaxy, also known as Messier 33.</p><p>“When my project was executing, I was pulling (data) out of the archive as soon as it was landing,” says Rosolowsky. “I sent a picture of it to my uncle … ‘Hey Uncle Mike! You and I are the first people on Earth to see these pictures!’ ”</p><p>His Uncle Mike, a backyard astronomer, is the person who first set Rosolowsky on the path that ultimately led him to receive images of a galaxy two million light years away from a $10-billion telescope orbiting the sun, some 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth.</p><p>But the picture Rosolowsky sent to Uncle Mike — significant as it was for them both — was a far cry from the stunning full-colour images released by NASA as the JWST continues to gather acclaim for its high-resolution infrared observations of the universe.</p><p>Instead, the picture for Uncle Mike — a few light blobs on a dark background crisscrossed with banding — looked something like this:</p><div><div><picture><source

alt="A portion of an image of the Triangulum Galaxy (M3), two million light years from Earth — as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope — is shown as raw data, as it appears in Canadian astronomer Erik Rosolowsky&#39;s code." width="968" height="314"/></picture></div></div><p>What he sent to his uncle, he says, was a “quick and dirty look” at the Triangulum Galaxy.</p><p>But before those images — or that data — can become remotely useful to him as a researcher, they have to be corrected, not the least for quirks inherent in the equipment.</p><p>For all the meticulous precision that went into the JWST’s design and construction, the data coming from it, in its rawest form, is uneven.</p><p>Images have to be corrected for imperfections inherent in the cameras themselves.</p><p>Cosmic rays hitting the telescope can create static in the detectors of its cameras, which is corrected for, in part, by capturing multiple versions of the same image.</p><p>And even the pixels — the smallest photosensitive units of the telescope’s detectors — themselves have different sensitivities; one of the more than one million pixels in the JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), for example, might be more sensitive than its neighbour, and less sensitive than another neighbour.</p><p>Thankfully, the JWST engineers have a solution for that — a complete calibration map of how to compensate for the variations in each pixel in every instrument on the Webb telescope.</p><p>“This is the work of hundreds of people,” says Rosolowsky. “When we say ‘commissioning a telescope’ — it launched and then they went through this period where you heard nothing about the results. </p><p>“That’s what they were doing up there. It’s finally turned on. They’re starting to make images and say, ‘How do we take out all these corrections?’ ”</p><p>All he has to do, he says, is apply the JWST’s map of pixel calibrations to his data to account for those variations in pixel sensitivity.</p><p>For most researchers, much of this technical work takes place in what they universally call “the pipeline.”</p><p>Think of it as a data-processing highway, where the raw data received from the JWST is refined as it travels from source to destination.</p><p>Along the length of that highway, some software processing modules might apply corrections to the data based on inconsistencies or aberrations in the detectors, others might apply corrections based on calibrations for the cameras themselves, and yet others might combine the data from multiple exposures into single images.</p><p>But the highway also has a series of off-ramps, from which researchers can extract their information at earlier stages of the processing for their more specific uses.</p><p>In Rosolowsky’s case, he wants some of that raw data, closer to the beginning of the pipeline.</p><p>It’s all well and fine to have something nice to send to a loved one, says Rosolowsky, but researchers don’t do science off of pretty images.</p><p>Much of his work is done with the raw, numerical data.</p><p>“The pretty pictures are wonderful for interpreting and building up and telling a story,” he says. “But then backing up that story is what requires doing the computer processing to figure out how to measure every star in this image, figure out what it is, and then use that to back up your claim.”</p><p>“Most of my job is programming, so I’m writing the computer code that is going to take this big chunk of numbers and turn this into properties of stars,” he says. “That is my day job when you get down to it.”</p><p><strong>‘It was gorgeous, honestly’</strong></p><p>It’s a different situation for Alyssa Pagan, though. She works with NASA as a science visuals developer. She’s one of the people responsible for processing the stunning images from the Webb telescope released to the public.</p><p>In fact, the image of the “Cosmic Cliffs” of the Carina Nebula, one of <a oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/07/12/james-webb-space-telescopes-next-images-being-released.html">the first five images</a> released from the JWST, was the first she’d worked on from the Webb.</p><p>“It was insane,” she says of working on the first images from the Webb. “It was gorgeous, honestly, to me from the get-go.”</p><p>“The fact that you are one of the first people to see the image and … process it and put it out for the public — it was a huge honour.

adjusting like tonality and contrast, colour and all these things to really make the features in each filter more prominent or just to showcase and highlight those different regions.”</p><p>Working in
