The FEM has fundamentally revolutionized the way we do scientific modeling and engineering design, ranging from automobiles, aircraft, marine structures, bridges, highways, and high-rise buildings. Associated with the development of FEMs has been the concurrent development of an engineering science discipline called computational mechanics, or computational science and engineering.</p></div><p>In this paper, we present a historical perspective on the developments of finite element methods mainly focusing on its applications and related developments in solid and structural mechanics, with limited discussions to other fields in which it has made significant impact, such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid–structure interaction. To have a complete storyline, we divide the development of the finite element method into four time periods: I. (1941–1965) Early years of FEM; II. (1966–1991) Golden age of FEM; III. (1992–2017) Large scale, industrial applications of FEM and development of material modeling, and IV (2018–) the state-of-the-art FEM technology for the current and future eras of FEM research. Note that this paper may not strictly follow the chronological order of FEM developments, because often time these developments were interwoven across different time periods.</p><section data-title="(1941–1965) The Birth of the Finite Element Method"><div id="Sec2-section"><h2 id="Sec2">(1941–1965) The Birth of the Finite Element Method</h2><div id="Sec2-content"><p>The origin of the FEM as a numerical modeling paradigm may be traced back to the early 1940s. In 1941, A. Hrennikof, a Russian-Canadian structural engineer at the University of British Columbia, published a paper in the ASME <i>Journal of Applied Mechanics</i> on his membrane and plate model as a lattice framework [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Hrennikoff A (1941) Solution of problems of elasticity by the framework method.

This paper is now generally regarded as a turning point that led to the birth of the FEM. In the paper, he discretized the solution domain into a mesh of lattice structure, which was the earliest form of a mesh discretization.</p><p>On May 3rd, 1941, the same year that Hrennikoff published his paper, R. Courant of New York University delivered an invited lecture at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society held in Washington D.C. on his numerical treatment using a variational method to solve a second order PDE, which arises from Saint–Venant’s torsion problem of a cylinder. In this work, Courant systematically used the Rayleigh–Ritz method with a trial function defined on finite triangle subdomains, which is a primitive form of of the finite element method [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Williamson F (1980) A historical note on the finite element method.

As Ray Clough commented in his 1980 paper, “<i>One aspect of the FEM, mathematical modeling of continua by discrete elements, can be related to work done independently in the 1940s by McHenry and Hrennikoff-formulating bar element assemblages to simulate plane stress systems. Indeed, I spent the summer of 1952 at the Boeing Airplane Company trying to adapt this procedure to the analysis of a delta airplane wing, the problem which eventually led to the FEM”.</i></p><p>By the early 1950s, several engineers and academics had further developed and extended these early approaches to solve real engineering problems in aeronautical and civil engineering. In parallel but with different emphases, Argyris at the Imperial College London, and M. J. Turner (1950–1956) at Boeing Company, who was later joined by R.W. Clough of UC Berkeley and H.C. Martin of Washington University, developed what we know today as the earliest form of the finite element method (1954), which was called the Matrix Stiffness Method at the time. In a paper published in 1960 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Clough RW (1960) The finite element method in plane stress analysis.

Clough coined the phrase <i>Finite Element Method</i>, and this unassuming and right-to-the-point phrase was an instant hit, bringing out the essence of the method.</p>

In some senses, the invention of the triangle element was a “quantum leap”, and hence for a large spectrum of the engineering community, the inception of the FEM is the publication of the landmark paper by Turner et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 10" title="Turner MJ, Clough RW, Martin HC, Topp LJ (1956) Stiffness and deflection analysis of complex structures.

M. Jon Turner, head of Boeing’s Structural Dynamics Unit, addressed that problem in the early 1950s by bringing civil engineering professor Ray Clough of the University of California, Berkeley, and Harold Martin of the University of Washington to Boeing for summer ``faculty internships,’’ Collectively, they created a method of structural analysis that Turner applied at Boeing using computers to perform the myriad calculations need to predict real-world performance. That fruitful collaboration led to Clough’s development a few years later of what he named the finite element method (FEM). Clough formed a research group at UC Berkeley that used FEM in a host of analytical and experimental activities, from designing buildings and structures to withstand nuclear blasts or earthquakes to analyzing structural requirements for spacecraft and deep-water offshore drilling. By revolutionizing the application of computer technologies in engineering, FEM continues to help engineers design to this day all sorts of durable, cost-effective structures. Meanwhile, Turner’s efforts at Boeing contributed to the success of its renowned line of commercial jets, beginning in 1958 with the 707 and continuing in 1964 with the 727, which could land on shorter runways and serve more airports. Equipped with three fuel-efficient turbofan engines, the 727 became the workhorse of commercial aviation and helped achieve a threefold increase in U.S. passenger air traffic in the’60s.</i></p><p>Independently and separately, in the early 1960s, Kang Feng of the <i>Chinese Academy of Science</i> also proposed a discretization-based numerical method for variational principles for solving elliptic partial differential equations [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Feng K (1965) Variational principle-based finite difference formulation.

                <i>When Clough presented the first paper using the finite element terminology in 1960 it attracted the attention of his friend, Professor O. C. Zienkiewicz, who was then on the faculty at Northwestern University. A few weeks after the presentation of the paper Zienkiewicz invited Clough to present a seminar on the finite element method to his students. Zienkiewicz was considered one of the world’s experts on the application of the finite difference method to the solution of continuum mechanics problems in Civil Engineering; therefore, Clough was prepared to debate the relative merits of the two methods. However, after a few penetrating questions about the finite element method, Zienkiewicz was almost an instant convert to the method.</i>

I was mesmerized by seeing that 1962 report. It presented a 2D stress analysis of large crack observed in Norfork dam. The dam was subdivided into about 200 triangular elements and provided stress contours for a number of loading cases. …… Clough was at that time way ahead of anybody else.</i></p><p>To collaborate Z. Bazant’s recollection, we cite E.L. Wilson’s recounting of that part of FEM history:</p><p>
                <i>In 1956, Ray, Shirley, and three small children spent a year in Norway at the Ship Research Institute in Trondheim. The engineers at the institute were calculating stresses due to ship vibrations to predict fatigue failures at the stress concentrations. This is when Ray realized his element research should be called the Finite Element Method which could solve many different types of problems in continuum mechanics. Ray realized the FEM was a direct competitor to the Finite Difference Method. At that time FDM was being used to solve many problems in continuum mechanics. His previous work at Boeing, the Direct Stiffness Method, was only used to calculate displacements not stresses.</i>
              </p><p>
                <i>In the fall semester of 1957, Ray returned from his sabbatical leave in Norway and immediately posted a page on the student bulletin board asking students to contact him if they were interested in conducting finite element research for the analysis of membrane, plate, shell, and solid structures. Although Ray did not have funding for finite element research, a few graduate students who had other sources of funds responded. At that time, the only digital computer in the College of Engineering was an IBM 701 that was produced in 1951 and was based on vacuum tube technology. The maximum number of linear equations that it could solve was 40. Consequently, when Ray presented his first FEM paper in September 1960, “The Finite Element Method in Plane Stress Analysis,” at the ASCE 2</i>
                <sup><i>nd</i></sup>
                <i> Conference on Electronic Computation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the coarse-mesh stress-distribution obtained was not very accurate. Therefore, most of the attendees at the conference were not impressed. After the improvement of the speed and capacity of the computers on the Berkeley campus, Professor Clough’s paper was a very fine mesh analysis of an existing concrete dam. The paper was first presented in September 1962 at a NATO conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Within a few months, the paper was republished in an international Bulletin, which had a very large circulation, as “Stress Analysis of a Gravity Dam by the Finite Element Method”, (with E. Wilson), International Bulletin RILEM, No. 10, June 1963.</i>
              </p><p>
                <i>The Lisbon paper reported on the finite element analysis of the 250-foot-high Norfork Dam in Arkansas, which had developed a vertical crack during construction in 1942. The FEM analysis correctly predicted the location and size of the crack due to the temperature changes and produced realistic displacements and stresses within the dam and foundation for both gravity and several hydrostatic load conditions. Because of this publication, many international students and visiting scholars came to Berkeley to work with Professor Clough. Also, he freely gave the FORTRAN listing of their finite element analysis computer program to be used to evaluated displacement and stresses in other two-dimensional plane structures with different geometry, materials, and loading. Therefore, professional engineers could easily use the powerful new FEM to solve for the stress distributions in their structural engineering problems in continuum mechanics. However, he did not capitalize on his success in the development of the FEM. He returned to the task of building the earthquake engineering program at Berkeley – the task he given when he was first hired in 1949.</i>
              </p><p>For their decisive contributions to the creation and developments of FEM, R. W. Clough was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1994 by the then vice-president of the United States Al Gore, while O. C. Zienkiewicz was honored as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Today, the consensus is that J.H. Argyris, R.W. Clough and O. C. Zienkiewicz made the most pivotal, critical, and significant contributions to the birth and early developments of finite element method following an early contribution to its mathematical foundation from R.

An MS research report was produced, which has long since been misplaced, with the approximate title of Computer Analysis of Plane Stress Structures. …… In 1959 the IBM 704 computer was installed on the Berkeley Campus. It had 32K of 32-bit memory and a floating-point arithmetic unit which was approximately 100 times faster than the IBM 701.

During this period, there were two seemingly unrelated events for FEM development, which significantly affected future FEM developments. These events were the discovery of mixed variational principles in elasticity. In 1950, E. Reissner [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Reissner E (1950) On a variational theorem in elasticity.

Hellinger’s mixed variational principle from 1914 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Hellinger E, Klein F, Müller C (1914) Die allgemeinen Ansätzeder Mechanik der Kontinua.

This variational principle is called the Hellinger–Reissner variational principle. Shortly after, Hu [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Hu HC (1955) On some variational principles in the theory of elasticity and plasticity.

As early as 1964, Pian [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Pian TH (1964) Derivation of element stiffness matrices by assumed stress distributions.

This began the use of mixed variational principles to formulate Galerkin FEMs, which was followed by the assumed strain FEM developed by J.

This movement was first highlighted by the proof of optimal and superconvergence of FEMs. This attracted the interest of some distinguished mathematicians all over the world, including G.

Some notable results developed for the proof of FEM convergence are the Cea lemma and the Bramble-Hubert lemma. The fundamental work of Nitsche [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Nitsche J (1970) Lineare spline-funktionen und die methoden von Ritz für elliptische randwertprobleme.

It may be noted that unlike other mathematics movements, the convergence study of FEMs was an engineering-oriented movement. The mathematicians soon found that, in practice, engineers were using either non-conforming FEM interpolants or numerical quadrature that violates variational principles or the standard bilinear form in Hilbert space. G. Strang referred to these numerical techniques as “variational crimes”. To circumvent complicated convergence proofs, the early FEM patch tests were invented by B. Iron and R. Melosh, which were proven to be instrumental for ensuring convergence to the correct solution.</p><p>Following T.H.H. Pian’s invention of the assumed stress element, attention shifted to the mixed variational principle based FEM [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Pian THH (1965) Element stiffness matrices for boundary compatibility and for prescribed boundary stresses.

However, most mixed variational principles are not extreme variational principles, and thus suffer from numerical instability. In early 1970s, I. Babuska and F. Brezzi discovered their groundbreaking results, known today as the Babuska-Brezzi condition, or the LBB condition, giving tribute to O. Ladyzhenskya—a Russian mathematician, who provided the early insight of this problem. The so-called LBB condition, or the inf–sup condition, provides a sufficient condition for a saddle point problem to have a unique solution that depends continuously on the input data; thus, it provides a guideline to construct shape functions for the mixed variational principle-based FEM (see: [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 54" title="Boffi D, Brezzi F, Fortin M (2013) Mixed finite element methods and applications (vol 44).

However, an important development came in the late 1970s when T. Belytschko, K. C. Park, and later TJR Hughes proposed using explicit or implicit-explicit, or implicit time integration with damping control to solve nonlinear structural dynamics problems. Other notable contributors to this key development are A. Combescure, A. Gravouil among others (see e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Gravouil A, Combescure A (2001) Multi-time-step explicit–implicit method for non-linear structural dynamics.

It turned out that the explicit time integration was a game changer for the automotive industry, establishing FEM technology as the main tool of passenger vehicle design and crashworthiness analysis. By the end of 1980s, there were thousands of workstations running explicit time integration-based FEM codes in the three major automakers in the United States.</p><p>One of the main FEM research topics in the 1980s was using FEM techniques to solve the Navier–Stokes equation as an alternative to finite difference and finite volume methods. Starting the early 1970s, J.T. Oden and his co-workers had begun working on FEM solutions for fluid dynamics [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Oden JT, Wellford LC Jr (1972) Analysis of flow of viscous fluids by the finite-element method.

The main challenge in using FEM solving fluid dynamics problems is that the Navier–Stokes equation is not an elliptical partial different equation, and the minimization or variational principle-based Petrov–Galerkin procedure may suffer both stability as well as convergence issues. To resolve these issues, T.J.R. Hughes, and his co-workers such as A.N. Brooks and T.E. Tezduyar developed the streamline upwind/Petrov Galerkin method and later Stabilized Galerkin FEM to solve Navier–Stokes equations under various initial and boundary conditions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Hughes TJR, Tezduyar T (1981) Finite elements based upon Mindlin plate theory with particular reference to the four-node bilinear isoparametric element.

He and his group systematically applied FEM-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers for aircraft structure design and analysis. They developed the finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI) method for the scalable solution of large-scale systems of equations on massively parallel processors. Today, some fundamental ALE concepts have also been applied to numerical modeling engineering fields other than FEM, such as meshfree modeling. For example, to alleviate tensile instability and distorted particle distributions in smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations, a so-called shifting technique has been adopted in many of today’s SPH simulations (e.g., Oger et al.

By considering uncertainty in loading conditions, material behavior, geometric configuration, and support or boundary conditions, the probabilistic FEM provided a stochastic approach in computational mechanics to account for all these uncertain aspects, which could then be applied in structure reliability analysis.

To simulate concrete failure, the vertical stress drops in FEMs, and progressive softening technique were introduced already in 1968.

It was eventually accepted that the partial differential equations that are associated with the classical plasticity become ill-posed after the material passes the yield point and enters the softening stage. This especially became a dire situation when civil engineers applied FEM to solve complex structural and geotechnical engineering problems, which involved complex plastic deformations of concrete, rock, soil, clay, and granular material in general. Bazant and others realized that this is because the classical continuum plasticity theory lacks an internal length scale. To remedy this problem, starting from the middle 1980s, many efforts were devoted to establishing FEM formulations of nonlocal (Bazant et al.

PUFEM is a powerful method because it can be used to construct FE spaces of any given regularity, which is a generalization of the h, p, and hp versions of the FEM, as well as providing the ability to embed an analytic solution into the FEM discretization instead of relying upon a generic polynomial interpolant.</p><p>A significant breakthrough in computational fracture mechanics and FEM refinement technology came in the late 1990s, when Belytschko and his co-workers, including Black, Moes, and Dolbow, developed the eXtended finite element (X-FEM) (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 160" title="Belytschko T, Black T (1999) Elastic crack growth in finite elements with minimal remeshing.

Because the adaptive enrichment process is governed by the crack tip energy release rate, X-FEM provides an accurate solution for linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). In developing X-FEM, T. Belytschko brilliantly utilized the PUFEM concept to solve fracture mechanics problems without remeshing. Entering the new millennium, Bourdin, Francfort, Marigo developed a phase-field approach for modeling material fracture [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 162" title="Bourdin B, Francfort GA, Marigo J.J (2000) Numerical experiments in revisited brittle fracture.

The main advantage of the phase field approach is that by using the Galerkin FEM to solve the continuum equations of motion as well as a phase equation, one can find the crack solution in continuum modeling without encountering stress singularity as well as remeshing, and the crack may be viewed as the sharp interface limit of the phase field solution.

Based on crystal slip, CPFEM can calculate dislocation, crystal orientation and other texture information to consider crystal anisotropy during computations, and it has been applied to simulate crystal plasticity deformation, surface roughness, fractures and so on.

The accuracy and efficiency for predicting overall mechanical response of polycrystalline materials are demonstrated with a comparison to traditional full-field FEMs.</p><p>In 2013, a group of Italian scientists and engineers led by L. Beirão da Veiga and F. Brezzi proposed a so-called virtual element method (VEM) (see Beirao et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 205" title="Beirão da Veiga L, Brezzi F, Cangiani A, Manzini G, Marini LD, Russo A (2013) Basic principles of virtual element methods. Math Models Methods Appl Sci 23(01):199–214" href="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/article/10.1007/s11831-022-09740-9#ref-CR205" id="ref-link-section-d177614572e1366">205</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 206" title="Beirão da Veiga L, Brezzi F, Marini LD, Russo A (2014) The hitchhiker’s guide to the virtual element method.

The virtual element method is an extension of the conventional FEM for arbitrary element geometries. It allows the polytopal discretizations (polygons in 2-D or polyhedra in 3-D), which may be even highly irregular and non-convex element domains. The name <i>virtual</i> derives from the fact that knowledge of the local shape function basis is not required, and it is in fact never explicitly calculated. VEM possesses features that make it superior to the conventional FEM for some special problems such as the problems with complex geometries for which a good quality mesh is difficult to obtain, solutions that require very local refinements, and among others. In these special cases, VEM demonstrates robustness and accuracy in numerical calculations, when the mesh is distorted.</p><p>As early as 1957, R. Clough introduced the first graduate FEM course at UC-Berkeley, and since then FEM courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels have been added into engineering higher education curriculums in all the major engineering schools and Universities all over the world. As J.T. Oden recalled in his 1963 paper, “<i>I went on to return to academia in 1964 and among my first chores was to develop a graduate course on finite element methods. At the same time, I taught mathematics and continuum mechanics, and it became clear to me that finite elements and digital computing offered hope of transforming nonlinear continuum mechanics from a qualitative and academic subject into something useful in modern scientific computing and engineering</i>.”.</p><p>By the end of 2015, there have been more than several hundred monographs and textbooks on the FEM published in dozens of languages worldwide. An exposition of FEM mathematical theory by Strang and Fix [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 207" title="Strang G, Fix GJ (1973) An analysis of the finite element method.

The development of FEM software technology started in the early1960s. In 1963, E.L. Wilson and R. Clough developed a structural mechanics computing code called Symbolic Matrix Interpretive System, SMIS, which was initially intended to fill the gap between the matrix method and hand calculating in structure mechanics. It turns out the development of SMIS led to the birth of FEM software. Then, based on SMIS, Wilson initiated and developed a general-purpose static and dynamic Structural Analysis Program, SAP. In late 1960s and the early 1970s, K, J. Bathe developed the nonlinear FEM code ADINA based on SAP IV and NONSAP. Today, the brand name SAP2000 has become synonymous with the state-of-the-art FEM structural analysis and design methods since its introduction over 55 years ago.</p><p>At the same period, to compete with the Soviet Union’s space program, NASA developed its own FEM code called NASTRAN (NASA STRuctural ANalysis Program). The first version of NASTRAN was called COSMIC Nastran, which debuted in 1969, with a key figure in its development being R. H. MacNeal. As early as 1963, R. H. MacNeal founded the MacNeal-Schwendler Software Corporation (MSC) along with R. Schwendler. Under his leadership, MSC developed its first structural analysis software called SADSAM (Structural Analysis by Digital Simulation of Analog Methods), which showed the early form of FEM analysis software technology. In response to NASA’s <u>request for proposals</u> in 1965 for a general purpose structural analysis program, Dr. MacNeal contributed significantly to the early efforts of the aerospace industry by successfully simulating on-the-ground physical testing through computing to deliver the right answers and physics needed to take humans to the moon. In 1971, MSC Software released a commercial version of Nastran, named MSC Nastran.</p><p>About the same time in 1960s, J. A. Swanson worked at Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory in Pittsburgh, and he was responsible for stress analysis of the components in NERVA nuclear reactor rockets. While there he then developed 3D FEM model and computer codes to analyze and predict transient stresses and displacements of the reactor system. To integrate different computer codes and streamline the processing, Swanson asked his employer Westinghouse to develop a general-purpose FEM computer code, but his suggestion was rejected, and then he left the company and developed the initial ANSYS FEM code. Today, ANSYS has become one of the major FEM commercial software worldwide.</p><p>Several years later, J.O. Hallquist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory also developed a 3D nonlinear FEM code called DYNA3D, which was extensively used impact, dynamic contact, and failure analysis of structures, which later evolved to LS-DYNA. LS-DYNA is the major FEM software used in automobile design and crashworthiness analyses. In 2018, Livermore Software Technology was purchased by ANSYS, and LS-DYNA became a part of ANSYS as ANSYS LS-DYNA.</p><p>In the early development of nonlinear FEM software, there were two early pioneers: P. V. Marcal and D. Hibbitt, who was Marcal’s student at Brown University. In the early 1970s, Marcal founded the MARC corporation to develop the first general purpose nonlinear FEM program, which is still widely used today in industry and academia for analysis of complex structures, such as nuclear reactors, car crashworthiness and manufacturing processes. While Hibbitt together with B. Karlsson and P. Sorenson formed a FEM company called HKS in 1978, and they released a large-scale commercial FEM software called ABAQUS. One of the major features of ABAQUS is that it allows the user defined subroutines, which greatly facilitates the researchers to conduct their researches by using the standard FEM solvers with reliability and efficiency. Together with ANSYS, ABAQUS is one of the two commercial FEM software that dominate the market.</p><p>By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the FEM software industry had become a multi-billion-dollar business. There were several household FEM software company names such as ANSYS, ABAQUS, ADINA, LS-DYNA, NASTRAN, COMSOL Multiphysics, CSI, among others. Today, there are also a plethora of open-source FEM software available online, such as FreeFEM, OpenSees, Elmer, FEBio, FEniCS Project, DUNE, among some others.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Present and Future"><div id="Sec5-section"><h2 id="Sec5">Present and Future</h2><div id="Sec5-content"><p>The modern form of the FEM can routinely solve many large and complex industrial problems. It enables developing a fundamental understanding and allows for the predictive analysis for product design. For new scientific discoveries and engineering innovations, the development of new scientific principles often trails the pace of new inventions with the sheer volume of data that are generated across multiple spatial, temporal, and design parameter (spatial–temporal-parameter) spaces. For this reason, FE researchers are studying various forms of machine and deep learning methods, of which this class of methods covers the largest class of interpolations.

In this context, Mechanistic Data Science (MDS) FEMs, which combine known scientific principles with newly collected data, will provide the critically needed research that can be a boon for new inventions.</p><p>Scientific and engineering problems typically fall under three categories: (1) problems with abundant data but undeveloped or unavailable scientific principles, (2) problems that have limited data and limited scientific knowledge, and (3) problems that have known scientific principles with uncertain parameters, with possible high computational load [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 228" title="Saha S, Gan Z, Cheng L, Gao J, Kafka OL, Xie X, Li H, Tajdari M, Kim HA, Liu WK (2021) Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN): an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for computational science and engineering.

In essence, mechanistic data science (MDS) mimics the way human civilization has discovered solutions to difficult and unsolvable problems from the beginning of time. Instead of heuristics, MDS uses machine learning methods like active deep learning and hierarchical neural network(s) to process input data, extract mechanistic features, reduce dimensions, learn hidden relationships through regression and classification, and provide a knowledge database. The resulting reduced order form can be utilized for design and optimization of new scientific and engineering systems (see Liu et. al.

Thus, the new focus of the FEM research has shifted towards the development of machine learning based FEMs and reduced order models.</p><p>With the recent development of machine learning and deep learning methods, solving FEM by constructing a deep neural network has become a state-of-the-art technology. Earlier research focused on building up a shallow neural network following the FEM structure to solve boundary value problems.

Due to the limitation of computationliual power and slow convergency rate in shallow neural networks, earlier applications could only solve simple PDE problems. After the 2010s, neural networks for solving computational mechanics problems have become increasingly popular with the rapid growth of deep learning techniques and the development of more sophisticated neural network structures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and residual neural networks (ResNet).

It is noted that PGD methods are based on the idea of separation of variables and in particular a canonical tensor decompostion (TD).</p><p>Recent works have been conducted to combine deep machine learning methods with reduced order modeling methods. Zhang et al.

The comparison of FEM, TD/PGD, HiDeNN-TD/PGD, HiDeNN, and DNN has been conducted in terms of accuracy and speed. It is shown that the HiDeNN-TD/PGD outperforms other methods with a good balance between accuracy and speed. The proposed HiDeNN-TD/PGD method is expected to provide novel powful tools for solving large scale high dimensional problems while maintaining a high accuracy. Various applications, including multiphysics coupled additive manufacturing, multiscale composite modeling, and structural topology optimization, have been discussed in a generalized reduced order machine learning finite element framework [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 272" title="Lu Y, Li H, Saha S, Mojumder S, Amin A, Suarez D, Liu Y, Qian D, Liu WK (2021) Reduced order machine learning finite element methods: concept, implementation, and future applications.

In particular, this reduced order machine learning framework is expected to enable ultra large-scale high resolution topology design that is currently challenging for the FEM based topology optimization. In this regard, Lu et al.

This convolution formulation incorporates the concept of meshfree approximation into the finite element function approximation and allows smoother solutions and automatic length-scale control in topology design. It is shown that the convolution HiDeNN-TD leads to better design with smoother and fine structures. This general convolution formulation opens new perspectives to resolve the length scale effect and can be applied to many orther problems, such as additive manufacturing and microstructure modeling.</p><p>The extra-ordinary interpolating capability of neural network has resulted in numerous research in approximating and solving the ordinary and partial differential equations e.g. Chen et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 274" title="Chen RT, Rubanova Y, Bettencourt J, Duvenaud DK (2018) Neural ordinary differential equations. In; Advances in neural information processing systems, p 31" href="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/article/10.1007/s11831-022-09740-9#ref-CR274" id="ref-link-section-d177614572e1679">274</a>]. Currently, the researchers are looking into approximating the mathematical operators directly from universal approximation of operator theory (see Chen and Chen [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 275" title="Chen T, Chen H (1995) Universal approximation to nonlinear operators by neural networks with arbitrary activation functions and its application to dynamical systems.

The goal of this endeavor is to solve the integral equations such as the Lippmann–Schwinger micromechanics equations (Z. Liu et. al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 190" title="Liu Z, Bessa MA, Liu WK (2016) Self-consistent clustering analysis: an efficient multi-scale scheme for inelastic heterogeneous materials.

A major step forward towards this target is made by Li et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 276" title="Li Z, Kovachki N, Azizzadenesheli K, Liu B, Bhattacharya K, Stuart A, Anandkumar A (2020) Neural operator: graph kernel network for partial differential equations.

                " href="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/article/10.1007/s11831-022-09740-9#ref-CR276" id="ref-link-section-d177614572e1688">276</a>] in their proposed Graph Kernel Network, in which they developed neural operators for solving partial differential equations. In this work, a kernel-based graph neural network is shown to be able to mimic the Green’s function method for solving partial differential equation. One drawback of this method is the associated computational cost and storage requirement increases with the size of the problem. A more general version of approximating the Green’s function operator is proposed by Lu et al. in their DeepONet [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 277" title="Lu L, Jin P, Pang G, Zhang Z, Karniadakis GE (2021) Learning nonlinear operators via DeepONet based on the universal approximation theorem of operators.

These approximation works are vital in computational mechanics as these can directly solve the micromechanics equation for multiscale analysis like FE-SCA. Moreover, these networks have suggested that the analytical calculus method such as differentiation and integration, and solution of differential and integration equations can be directly expressed as an approximation of neural network. In this regard, recurrent neural networks have shown promised to be identical in structure of wave equations [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 279" title="Hughes TW, Williamson IA, Minkov M, Fan S (2019) Wave physics as an analog recurrent neural network.

These researches are directed towards a future when the research and education in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sector with discrete calculus will be transformed with the aid of deep learning. We are envisioning this field as deep learning discrete calculus, a new perspective in teaching calculus by the integration of calculus definition, numerical analysis, and deep learning (see Liu et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 280" title="Liu WK, Gan Z, Fleming M (2021) Mechanistic data science for STEM education and applications, 1st edn.

Practical optimal control may require a reliable prediction within the range of milli- or sub-milli-second. Reducing the computation cost of simulations has been one of the major motivations for developing model reduction methods. Other reduced order modeling related topics are the feature engineering and data analytics, which constitute an extensive literature in field of machine learning. Thus, the reduced order modeling and the machine learning have intrinsic connections. Developing reduced order machine learning methods may enable physics-data combined models that can overcome the current bottleneck in model reduction methods and purely data-driven machine learning approaches.</p></div></div></section>
