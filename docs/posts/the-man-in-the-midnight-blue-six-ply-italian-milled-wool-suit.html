From the best fabrics. By the best tailor. Paired with the best bespoke shoes.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A suit that would make me feel at ease, while declaring to others, “Here is a man who feels at ease.” A suit that would be appreciated by the world’s most heartless maître d’. A suit that would see me through the immigration checkpoints of difficult countries. A suit that would convince readers that the man in the author photo has a sense of taste beyond the Brooklyn consensus of plaid shirt and pouf of graying hair.</p><hr/><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. <a data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="984608" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small></p><hr/><div data-flatplan-ignore="true"><section data-event-module="magazine promo"><div><h2>Explore the March 2025 Issue</h2><p>Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.</p></div><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2025/03/" target="_blank" data-event-element="view more">View More</a></section></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The suit would serve as the perfect carapace for a personality overly dependent on anxious humor and jaundiced wit, a personality that I have been trying to develop since I saw my lightly mustached <i>punim</i> in the mirror as a pubescent boy and thought, <i>How will I ever find love?</i> The suit would transcend my physicality and bond with my personality directly. It would accompany me through the world’s great salons, the occasional MSNBC appearance, and, most important, the well-compensated talks at far-flung universities. The suit would be nothing less than an extension of myself; it would be a valet preceding me into the room, announcing with a light continental accent, “Mr. Gary and his suit are here now.” Finding this perfect suit, made by the most advanced tailor out of superlative fabric, would do nothing less than transform me.</p><h3>The Body</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>Before there is</span> a suit, there is a body, and the body is terrible.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">First there is my shortness (5 foot 5 and a half, with that “half” doing a lot of work). Being short is fine, but those missing inches are wedded to a narrow-shouldered body of zero distinction. Although I am of Russian and Jewish extraction, the continent whose clothing stores make me feel most at ease is Asia. (I once bought an off-the-rack jacket in Bangkok after the clerk examined me for all of three seconds.) However, this is not exactly an Asian body either, especially when I contrast myself with the natural slimness of most of my Asian friends. Just before my bar mitzvah, I got a set of perfect B-cup knockers and had to squeeze into a “husky” suit to perform the ritual yodeling at the synagogue. But that’s not all. Some hideously mismanaged childhood vaccination in Leningrad created a thick keloid scar running the length of my right shoulder. The shame of having this strange pink welt define one side of me led to a slumped posture favoring my left shoulder. When I finally found people to have sex with me—I had to attend Oberlin to complete the task—my expression upon disrobing resembled that of a dog looking up at his mistress after a bowel movement of hazmat proportions.</p><h3><span>Before the Suit</span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>The clothes before</span> the suit were as bad as the body.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I was born in the Soviet Union in 1972 and was quickly dressed in a sailor’s outfit with white tights and sexy little shorts, then given a balalaika to play with for the camera. The fact that Russia now fields one of the world’s most homicidal armies can partially be explained by photos such as this. On other occasions I was forced to wear very tight jogging pants with a cartoon bunny on them, or a thick-striped shirt dripping with medals from battles I had never seen. These outfits did make me feel like I belonged to something—in this case, a failing dictatorship. I left the U.S.S.R. before I could join the Young Pioneers, which would have entailed wearing a red tie at a tender age, while prancing about and shouting exuberant slogans such as “I am always ready!”</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="black-and-white photo of smiling child in sailor suit sitting with legs crossed and playing an instrument" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZQ3wo0FkH6dYfpo0ClP3vBhuNPk=/0x0:630x868/300x413/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage2/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3ILwZEXgIzWs8O_tNbNSBdLVeMo=/0x0:630x868/600x826/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage2/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZQ3wo0FkH6dYfpo0ClP3vBhuNPk=/0x0:630x868/300x413/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage2/original.jpg" width="300" height="413"/></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of smiling child sitting between parents on sofa" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DRxPa0RNoTn-Dkr7GL3vzibVjEI=/199x74:888x760/300x299/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage3/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HzKI0yeNKpsjlP_E-7s_q85T_xc=/199x74:888x760/600x598/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage3/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DRxPa0RNoTn-Dkr7GL3vzibVjEI=/199x74:888x760/300x299/media/img/posts/2025/02/webImage3/original.jpg" width="300" height="299"/></picture><figcaption><em>Top</em>: The author, about 6 years old, in Leningrad, dressed as a sailor and forced to play balalaika under a hanging carpet. <em>Bottom</em>: About a year later, in Rome, his parents buy him a normal Western sweater.

I arrived in New York in 1979 with the immigrant’s proverbial single shirt, although my parents had managed to snag a cute Italian V-neck sweater during the few months we spent in Rome on our way to America, a sweater that would serve me for the next half decade (as mentioned, I did not grow much). The Hebrew day school to which I was sentenced for eight years began a clothing drive for me, and I was rewarded with pounds of old Batman and Robin T-shirts, which made me look like a Soviet-refugee poster child. It’s worth noting that, growing up, I never thought, <i>They hate me for my clothes or my poverty or my lack of English skills</i>. This realization would come later, in hindsight. For the longest time, I thought that I was hated for the essential state of being myself; the clothes were more a symptom than a cause. My school may have been Jewish, but I somehow found myself in the throes of Calvinist predestination. For as long as I was myself, I deserved these clothes. Around this time, the idea of becoming an entirely different person took root—<i>How will I ever find love? This is how</i>—an idea that would be expanded for four decades, until it finally led me to The Suit.</p><h3>Growing Up <span>Tasteless</span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>High school found</span> <span>me</span> trying to blend in with a suburban outlay of clothes that my now middle-class family could finally afford. These were surfer T-shirts from Ocean Pacific and other brands that suburbanites who survived the 1980s might remember: Generra, Aéropostale, Unionbay. Unfortunately, I did not go to high school in Benetton Bay, Long Island, but in Manhattan, where these shirts were immediately a joke. (This would become a pattern. By the time I figure something out fashion-wise, I’m already two steps behind.) At a high-school job, my boss bought me a set of colorful <i>Miami Vice–</i>style shirts and jackets. These proved ridiculous at Oberlin, where dressing in janitor uniforms from thrift shops was considered the height of style. (Ironically, I had worked as a janitor during the summer, at the same nuclear laboratory that employed my father.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">After college, I fell in with a crowd of artsy, ketamine-addicted hipsters, and together we managed to gentrify several Brooklyn neighborhoods during the late ’90s. One of my friends, who was especially fashion-conscious, began to dress me at the high-priced secondhand emporium Screaming Mimis. The clothes she told me to buy were very itchy, mostly Orlon and Dacron items from ’70s brands such as Triumph of California, but these tight uniforms, like their Soviet predecessors, made me feel like I was playing a part in a grander opera, while also serving as a form of punishment. On nervous dates, I would sometimes have to run to the bathroom to try to angle my acrylic armpits under the dryer.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Because I was a writer who worked in bed, I mostly did not need a suit, although when I got married, in 2012, I went down to Paul Smith to get a herringbone number that I thought was just fine, if not terribly exciting. I bought a J.Crew tuxedo for black-tie benefits. Once, I did a reading sponsored by Prada and was given a nice gray jacket, pants, and a pair of blue suede shoes as compensation. Come to think of it, there was also a scarf. As a final note, I will say that I am incredibly cheap and that shopping for clothes has always raised my blood pressure. Leaving Screaming Mimis after spending more than $500 would always end in me getting terribly drunk to punish myself for the money I had blown on such a frivolous pursuit.</p><h3>The Dream Begins</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>When I reached</span> the age of 50, mildly prosperous and with a small family, I met a man named Mark Cho. We discovered each other because of a mutual love of wristwatches (a costly middle-aged hobby I had recently acquired), and because I knew about his classic-menswear store, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thearmoury.com/">the Armoury</a>, with locations in New York and Hong Kong. The Armoury has been called “a clubhouse for menswear nerds”; if you’re looking for, say, a cashmere waistcoat in “brown sugar,” you have found your home. I had even given one of the characters in my latest novel, a dandy from a prominent Korean chaebol family, an article of clothing from that store to wear.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/special-orders-dont-upset-us/591367/">Read: The future of marketing is bespoke everything</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We met for dinner at Union Square Cafe, and I liked him (and his clothes) immediately. Mark was almost always dressed in a jacket and tie, and would often sport a vest along with spectacles made of some improbable metal. What I loved about him was how comfortable he appeared in his medley of classical attire, and how, despite the fact that all of his garments had been chosen with precision, he gave the impression that he had spent very little time and thought on which breathable fabrics to settle over his trim body. He looked like he was, to use my initial formulation, at ease.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Later, I would learn that this whole look could be summarized by the Italian word <i>sprezzatura</i>, or “studied carelessness,” and later still I learned of something that the Japanese had discovered and refined: “Ivy style,” which is basically studied carelessness goes to Dartmouth. For the time being, I knew that I liked what I saw, that my inner lonely immigrant—the one who is always trying to find a uniform that will help me fit in—was intrigued. Mark once gave me an Armoury safari jacket, the very same one worn by the character in my novel, and its light, unflappable linen proved perfect for my summer readings around Germany and Switzerland that year. Everywhere from starchy Zurich to drunken Cologne to cool-as-fuck Berlin, the jacket would pop out of a suitcase and unwrinkle itself in seconds, yet it was also stylish and seemingly impervious to the odors of my non-Teutonic body. It was, to use Hemingway-esque prose, damn well perfect, and I immediately knew I wanted more.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I had lived in Italy in my 30s and met many aristocrats there. Those bastards had <i>sprezzatura</i> to burn, but when I asked them the make of their suits and jackets, they would smile and tell me it was the work of a single tailor down in Naples or up in Milan. <i>Ah</i>, I would say to myself, <i>so that’s how it is</i>. Given my outlook on life, owning a bespoke suit was not an outcome I was predestined for. The Prada jacket I had been given, which fit me well enough, was the most that my Calvinist God would ever grant me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But over more martinis and <i>onglets au poivre</i> with Mark, I began to understand the parameters of a fine bespoke suit and its accessories: bespoke shirts and bespoke shoes. I also began to timidly ask questions of a financial nature and learned that the price of owning such a wardrobe approached and then exceeded $10,000. I did not want to pay this kind of entry fee. Given my own family’s experience in fleeing a declining superpower, I try to have money saved with which to escape across the border. Unlike watches, a suit could not be resold in Montreal or Melbourne.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A brief but generative conversation with my editors at this magazine soon paved the way for my dream to become possible. At a particularly unsober dinner with a visiting Japanese watchmaker, I whispered to Mark the extent of my desires. Yes, it would take a lot of work, a lot of research, and possibly travel to two other continents. But it could be done. At the right expense, with the most elegant and sturdy of Italian-milled fabrics, and with the greatest of Japanese tailors, a superior suit could be made for anyone, even for me.</p><h3>Some Thoughts on Male Fashion</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>In religious school</span>, I studied the Torah and the Talmud, which were okay but failed to leave a deep impression. At Oberlin, I read Gramsci’s notebooks from prison; those were fine, but a little too carceral for my airy disposition. Mark sat me down with the foundational texts more relevant to my lived experience, as they say. Or at least the experience I hoped to live. The canonical texts of male fashion, and I urge them upon any aspiring dandy, are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780060191443"><i>Dressing the Man</i></a>, by Alan Flusser, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780465053995"><i>True Style</i></a>, by G. Bruce Boyer (that name alone deserves a cummerbund). I would also slip in an interesting national study, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781541604339"><i>Ametora: How Japan Saved American Style</i></a>, by the well-dressed intellectual W. David Marx, whom I would meet in Tokyo soon enough. Like the diligent student I had rarely been before, I took copious notes: <i>American look</i>, <i>dart</i>, <i>London shrunk</i>, <i>natural shoulder</i>, <i>weft</i>,<i> warp</i>. I have worn clothes all my life but never known a single thing about them. It was like not knowing the difference between freshly caught tilefish and farm-bred tilapia; each fills your stomach, but only one tastes good.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Formal male fashion traces back to two personalities: Beau Brummell, the sharp-witted proto-dandy of the early 19th century without whom the modern suit would be unthinkable (and who reportedly spent five hours a day getting dressed), and Edward VIII, the Nazi admirer and short-term king better known as the Duke of Windsor. These two insufferable assholes are mostly responsible for how men dress today. “With Brummell,” Flusser notes, “male style became a matter of impeccable fit and cut, exquisite detail, and immaculate cleanliness.” Before Brummell, the aristocracy dressed in rich, smelly materials; after, styles were adapted from military uniforms—think of the broad shoulders of a British pinstripe suit, for example. The duke took Brummell’s simplicity and “ran to Baroque elaboration,” Boyer wrote. “District checks, windowpane plaids, bold stripes, and tartans were his true métier.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the battle between the 19th-century dandy’s stark simplicity and the duke’s playful elaborations, I find myself choosing the former. My personality is colorful enough without tartans; let the suit merely contain it. Whatever the duke’s “district check” is, I will leave it uncashed.</p><h3>Yamamoto-San Arrives</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>On May 24</span> of the fateful year 2024, a plane from Tokyo landed in New York City, carrying one of the most meticulously attired men in existence. His name is Yuhei Yamamoto, and he is the preeminent representative of Ivy style, that mode of dress that Americans appreciate yet only the Japanese fully understand.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The British suit, in all its City of London severity, morphed into different shapes around the world. The Italians made particularly interesting work of it. The Milanese suit was the most British-like, but as you traveled farther down the boot to Florence, Rome, and Naples, the tailors became more freehanded; the colors and fit became jauntier and more Mediterranean, more appreciative of bodies defined by crooked lines and curves and exploded by carbohydrates. Meanwhile, in America, as always, we went to work. The suit became a uniform that stressed the commonality and goodness of Protestant labor and church attendance without any further embellishments. It came to be known as the “sack suit.” In the 1950s, Brooks Brothers furthered this concept with an almost subversively casual look: a jacket with natural-width shoulders that hung straight from the body, and plain-front trousers. This, along with other American touches, such as denim, became the basis for Ivy-style clothes that the Japanese of the ’60s made into a national obsession, and that culminated in a wholly different approach to workwear, office wear, and leisure wear. Today, you can’t go into a Uniqlo without seeing the aftereffects of Japanese experimentation with and perfection of our “Work hard, pray hard” wardrobe ethos.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I met Yamamoto-san at the Upper East Side branch of Mark Cho’s Armoury empire. The moment I first saw him, I was scared. No one could be this well-dressed. No one could be so secure in a tan three-piece seersucker suit that didn’t so much hang from his broad shoulders as hover around them in expectation.

(Peter Fisher for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The diagnosis stung at first. I was already aware of the provenance of the sack suit, which had clothed men up and down the very avenue (Madison) right outside Mark’s store for almost a century. Was I not more than an Excel jockey or a finance bro whose oppressive job had him ready to be put into a sack? Were my curves, at least the double trouble posed by my tatas (true, they had shrunk and mellowed with age), not worthy of something with a little bit more Florentine flair, if not full-on Neapolitan decadence?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Sack suit,” Yamamoto-san repeated. He then explained through a translator that I was, in his eyes, “full of character.” I had heard this sentiment before, and not always in the form of a compliment, but wanted elaboration. “You’re a character,” he said. “You’re an authentic New Yorker. You transcend fashionable suits. As an authentic New Yorker, you need a sack suit.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He and Mark began to talk about the master plan for my body. Yamamoto-san would make a drape-cut suit that would emphasize my slimness, and “flatter” my chest. The pants would accentuate my legs while making me look taller than 5 foot 5 (and a half).</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“You can hide a multitude of sins with a good suit,” Mark said. The Calvinist inside me blanched.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For the first time in my life, I felt nonphysician, nonlover hands all over me—measuring, prodding, taking stock. The thousands of dollars being spent on this project were not just creating a garment; they were affording me a new level of care and involvement. It was the sartorial version of having a concierge doctor. “At the fitting stage,” Mark said, “you’ll feel like a woman getting haute couture. Why should women have all the fun?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Yes</i>, I thought. <i>Why should they?</i> We retired to the Armoury’s garden to smoke half a dozen short Davidoff cigars and discuss matters some more. “Clothing is a visual language,” Mark said. “What we have to divine is: What is a Gary Shteyngart suit?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I puffed on my cigar, feeling seen. “Your head has to sit in a certain way on your frame,” Mark said. I pictured my head above the suit, like the dot at the top of an inverted exclamation point. The suit, according to Mark, would focus attention on my head, which was definitely where I wanted the attention to fall. After mastering English in Hebrew day school and social democracy at Oberlin, I had always made the right sounds with my head. (“I want to make a suit that accentuates my client’s character,” Yamamoto-san had told me. “I don’t want a suit that speaks more than the character.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The best body type for a suit,” Mark went on, “is one that is slightly unathletic and also stoops slightly so that it hangs better.” <i>That’s me!</i> I thought, shocked that what I’d considered a debility had turned out to be a strength. “Yamamoto-san will make a softer, rounder, more natural shoulder,” Mark continued. “He will cut closer to the hips. You don’t want a pumpkin shape.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Most certainly not,” I said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Back inside, Yamamoto-san had set the music system to his beloved Chuck Berry and had spread out ancient <i>Esquire</i> and <i>GQ</i> magazines. “I will make you a suit from the golden age of American style,” the tailor was saying. “I will make your legs even more beautiful.” We were looking at intimidating books of fabric swatches. I had signaled that I wanted the suit to be ready for nights of leisure as well as labor; drunken dinners at Frenchette as well as university readings and television appearances. This led us to the darker side of the color spectrum, until we settled on midnight blue. “Six-ply is more durable, and it travels well,” Mark was saying. “There’s more return. See how it bounces back more quickly? Fewer wrinkles.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That all sounded great, but I was both intrigued and confused. What the hell is “six-ply”? How is yarn even made? Mark invited me to attend a fabric fair in Milan in July, then to journey to the nearby fabric mill, where the materials for my suit would be prepared. Next, we would fly to Hong Kong to have the appropriate shirts made by the fine shirtmaker Ascot Chang, and on to Tokyo for a second fitting with Yamamoto-san, as well as a fitting for a pair of shoes at the atelier of the master shoemaker Yohei Fukuda.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Sure,” I said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Somewhere in the heavens, my Calvinist God was preparing his lightning bolts.</p><h3><span>The Anticipation Grows </span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>There are many</span> <span>days</span> between May and July. How many exactly I cannot tell you, as I am not a mathematician, but definitely too many when you’re waiting for a series of garments to change your life.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the meantime, Mark threw a black-tie party to celebrate 10 years of the Armoury in New York, and I put on my J.Crew tuxedo, hoping no one would sneer at its humble pedigree. The party was sponsored by Campari, and I was soon coasting on boulevardiers and chatting with a gaggle of short menswear nerds and the attractive women who loved them. As with most Midtown parties, the mix had its share of financiers, but also included war-crimes prosecutors and museum executives. “Are you in fashion?” I overheard one attendee asking another. “No, I’m a Marxist.” (And, I later found out, an architect.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/fashion-in-dark-times/307440/">From the June 2009 issue: Fashion in dark times</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Alex Seo, a Korean American man dressed stunningly in a white double-breasted, peak-lapel tuxedo jacket, told me that when his grandfather, an academic, had landed in the Midwest from Korea many years ago without a proper outfit, the man who’d sponsored him had said, “Every professor should have a tweed jacket,” and then handed him his own. The story reminded me of the clothing drive that was started for me at my yeshiva, although this tale had a kinder, more midwestern ending (Alex’s father and his Armoury suit were also at the party). Looking around the room and talking to people, I realized just how many of us were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. The need for a fine suit became obvious. It was the final certificate of naturalization.</p><h3><span>Milan and Beyond </span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>I tried to</span> <span>take</span> my mind off my desperate need for bespoke clothing. A conference brought me to Tbilisi, Georgia, and then I tooled around Istanbul, Rome, and Lucca for a bit. Finally, the fabric fair arrived, and, accompanied by my old friend, the stylish Tuscan resident, art historian, and translator Shilpa Prasad, I traveled to Milan, where Mark was waiting for us.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“We’re starting way upstream,” Mark told me, meaning that we were going deep into the nitty-gritty of how a suit is made. Amid the city’s heartless July humidity, he took us to a neoclassical palazzo, where <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dormeuil.com/">Dormeuil</a>, a family-run French maker of high-end fabrics, presented us with endless espresso and samples. I wasn’t here to shop, just to learn what was possible.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of two hands scrunching a pinstripe navy fabric sample into fists" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Pa_L_itgigjdYDAHp4o1htQMVlQ=/media/img/posts/2025/02/webTA_08_07/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Pa_L_itgigjdYDAHp4o1htQMVlQ=/media/img/posts/2025/02/webTA_08_07/original.jpg" width="638" height="471"/></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of the same two hands releasing the pinstripe navy fabric sample as it relaxes and lays flat without any wrinkles" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WLhvnAQJmo6b6LpLiCuPRJnFAaA=/media/img/posts/2025/02/webTA_08_08/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WLhvnAQJmo6b6LpLiCuPRJnFAaA=/media/img/posts/2025/02/webTA_08_08/original.jpg" width="638" height="471"/></picture><figcaption>Testing crease-resistant fabric at Vitale Barberis Canonico, the oldest fabric mill in Italy (Bea De Giacomo for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What followed was an impressive display of discernment. Mark and his colleague Jan would feel the square of a fabric swatch, then scrunch it up and watch as it regained its composure. “Fabric drives our collection,” Mark said. “For Hong Kong, this is good winter fabric,” he said of one sample. Because Hong Kong represents a large portion of his business, he is very attuned to that part of his clientele. “This one’s too hairy,” he said of another. “Hong Kong people don’t like things that are hairy.” <i>Most people don’t</i>, I thought, sadly.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Shilpa was amazed by how Mark and Jan knew which samples they would buy from just a cursory feel. “It’s like muscle memory,” Jan told her.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“We’ll take four meters,” Mark told the fabric salesman, and the barcode adjoining one swatch was zapped. The price for this particular fabric, which would become a three-piece suit for another client, was about 68 euros a meter. Shilpa lovingly stroked cloth flecked with gold that clocked in at 380 euros a meter, and visualized the shawl that could be made from it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Mark explained that some fabrics are better for business suits, others for leisure suits. As an example of the former, he showed me the kind of slightly shiny wool-and-mohair blend that could have been worn by members of the Rat Pack. The fabric for my suit should bridge the gap, Mark said. It should be both beautiful and travel-resistant. “More texture, less sheen.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Milano Unica fair took place in a typical soulless convention center on the city’s edge. The booths where the vendors had set up shop were grouped by the type of goods they were hawking: Shirt Avenue, for example. The sellers we visited each gave us a fine cup of espresso and sometimes even a little chocolate, so that by the time I left the fair, I was orbiting Neptune.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We stopped by the esteemed Somerset cloth maker <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://foxflannel.com/">Fox Brothers</a>, which produced the fabric that once draped Winston Churchill and Cary Grant. They favor undyed sheep’s wool and are known for their wool flannel, the kind that was used to make Fred Astaire’s trousers. The clothes made from their fabrics, one trench coat in particular, were gorgeous, but I would have needed to buy a Land Rover to complete the look.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Next we headed down the “street” to the booth for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://vitalebarberiscanonico.com/">Vitale Barberis Canonico</a>, the mill tasked with producing the fabric for my suit. After we had another coffee, the attractive representatives of the brand presented us with bolts of cloth to feel. “This reminds me of going to sari shops in Bombay,” Shilpa said as we felt our way through the sensuous wares, gasping in delight. I was reminded of Mark’s quip: “Why should women have all the fun?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A sample of the fabric that would be used for my suit was finally presented to me—the 21 Micron. I was told that the mill’s 21 Micron is made from the wool of Argentinian and Uruguayan sheep that live high in the mountains. Regular, less important sheep are subjected to the cruelty of mulesing, where strips of wool-bearing skin are removed from around their ass, to prevent the parasitic infection of fly larvae. My sheep were not subjected to such horrors. “They are happy sheep,” one dapper representative told me with a wolfish smile.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Despite its South American origins, the fabric had a heavy British solidity. I crumpled it up in my fist as I had seen Mark and Jan do, and when I let go, the fabric opened like a flower. “21 Micron is the more exclusive fabric,” the mill’s representative told me. “It is breathable, high-twisted yarn; it will not wrinkle.” Unlike most suits, mine would be made of six-ply yarn. The fabric’s weight, exclusivity, sturdiness, and expense came from the fact that there was simply more of it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Six-ply is for the brave,” the dapper man assured me, a sentence I did not understand, but cherished nonetheless.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Your suit will be business luxury,” Mark told me. “You can wear it into the ground.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I stared into the fabric, which looked as inky blue as the eternity I hope to fall into after I expire, many fathoms deeper than the Baltic Sea by which I was born. <i>Soon</i>, I thought, <i>this magical fabric will cover me from my ankles to my neck. And then, maybe, I will be another person.</i></p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of author standing in warehouse next to piles of baled wool 3 times as tall as he is" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZRYjQkAYo2TnRosh2_tzISPF-X0=/0x0:1307x1772/655x888/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_TA_03_15/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/tJ_hB4kBxN080YHKbP00pZJs21M=/0x0:1307x1772/750x1017/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_TA_03_15/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bETx-Bp0-OcbtF6ETtvmhwKmdsQ=/0x0:1307x1772/850x1152/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_TA_03_15/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WX8ubDGrvueeK9x3jq4dRiK264U=/0x0:1307x1772/928x1258/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_TA_03_15/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZRYjQkAYo2TnRosh2_tzISPF-X0=/0x0:1307x1772/655x888/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_TA_03_15/original.jpg" width="655" height="888"/></picture><figcaption>The author is confronted with endless amounts of wool at Vitale Barberis Canonico. (Bea De Giacomo for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The next day, Mark and I traveled west of Milan, past rice fields and solar-power farms and shirtless men yawning on balconies, to a village in the Biella region of Piedmont, where Vitale Barberis Canonico is based. The mill’s waiting room was filled with volumes that had titles such as <i>I Am Dandy</i>, and the magazines <i>Monsieur</i> and <i>The One: Yacht &amp; Design</i>. Yachtless and without a French appellation, I wondered what the hell I was doing there. The executive offices surrounded a lovely Japanese garden, and as we began our tour, the members of a visiting group of fabric buyers from Taiwan, China, and Japan shyly snuck photos of Mark.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">First mentioned in documents in 1663, Vitale Barberis Canonico is truly canonical, the oldest fabric mill in Italy. Our tour guides explained that the water in the Biella region has a very low concentration of minerals, making it soft, unlike the harsh water in other parts of Europe. This adds an extra softness to the fabric, much as pizza crust in Naples would be unimaginable without the city’s <i>acqua</i>. I touched a clump of Australian wool, and noted how superior my South American sheep was to its antipodean cousin. The seven steps for making wool fabric were explained: washing, gilling (aligning the wool fibers and removing short strands), spinning, dyeing, warping, weaving, and finishing. Giant machines are dedicated to these tasks, and they run all day, mostly without human intervention. The weaving, in which the weft, the horizontal structure, is inserted into the fabric’s vertical structure, the warp, is conducted in the world’s quietest weaving room. Touching the yarn as it was being spun by a machine was like strumming a gently weeping guitar. I was told that my six-ply yarn was the strongest that Vitale Barberis Canonico produced, and that it had been worsted to eliminate some of its hairiness (Hong Kong readers, rejoice). Finally, this exemplary fabric had been put into a massive machine called the Dolphin 1200, which finishes the fabric and prevents it from shrinking.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of Gary rubbing cloth against his face" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6C0fWE7tPAyEZKt2nH32CaEXwms=/0x0:1307x1772/655x888/media/img/posts/2025/02/TA_05_05/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/wu2D3P4MzJNPycQgPEynLtmUhLI=/0x0:1307x1772/750x1017/media/img/posts/2025/02/TA_05_05/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_OrF4WCAN9-XXseUIxTWaIQe0fc=/0x0:1307x1772/850x1152/media/img/posts/2025/02/TA_05_05/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/YR9TmPQuIrQGQa_OtB92TB64s84=/0x0:1307x1772/928x1258/media/img/posts/2025/02/TA_05_05/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6C0fWE7tPAyEZKt2nH32CaEXwms=/0x0:1307x1772/655x888/media/img/posts/2025/02/TA_05_05/original.jpg" width="655" height="888"/></picture><figcaption>The author snuggling with some alarmingly soft wool at the Vitale Barberis Canonico mill (Bea De Giacomo for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the mill’s archives, we examined order books dating back to 1846, as well as a photo of King Charles III and his fun-loving wife, the Queen Consort, who both appear to be fans of the brand. I saw an advertisement for my fabric, which featured a drawing of sheep standing on a road, next to a man leaning against a sports car. A sign behind him pointed to the <em><span>ruta del fin del mundo</span></em>, “the route to the end of the world.” The tagline read: “21 Micron is the final destination of a long journey in search of a family of cloths of the highest quality that guarantee unparalleled strength and crease resistance.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Is this it?</i> I thought. <i>Has my long sartorial journey finally come to an end?</i></p><h3>Mom Posture</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>But my journey</span> had only begun.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">On the way to Asia, I watched one of Wim Wenders’s latest films, <i>Perfect Days</i>, and was struck with the teariness that often hits at 30,000 feet. The film follows an older toilet cleaner in Tokyo, exulting in the care with which he performs his task, the way he makes his work anything but menial. The toilet cleaner’s devotion reminded me of something Mark had said about how a true craftsman focuses on just one item, asking himself constantly, <i>Is this as good as it can be? </i></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Hong Kong, Mark brought his obsession with individual crafts to a 100-year-old building off Queen’s Road Central, known as the Pedder Building. On the fifth floor, a 6,000-square-foot space called the Pedder Arcade has a distinctly Wong Kar-wai feel, punctuated by broad arches and spinning overhead fans. The Armoury may be the Pedder Arcade’s flagship store, but it is just one part of a lifestyle hub for the intelligent moneyed class, where you can buy a signed first-edition set of John le Carré’s <i>Karla Trilogy</i> for about $7,000. Mark himself works out of a space called “The Study,” where people feel free to drop in and smoke a cigar—some of the world’s best cigars are sold out of an anteroom, with the more intense aged Cuban variants smelling, according to Mark, “as good as God’s armpit.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Mark is Malaysian Chinese by heritage, but grew up in London, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles and speaks perfect American English, though he will occasionally break a word like <i>forgotten</i> into two, adding to his charm. He got his bachelor’s degree in economics from Brown and started out in finance. We are similar in that neither of our fathers was perfectly happy with the career we ultimately chose: wordsmithing and clothes selling. In Milan, I had asked Mark how he’d resolved things with his father. “He died,” Mark said.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of hands cutting a piece of fabric with a scissors on a work table" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JjSn1Wuj0NOtwVdE8LzSGUyHK9k=/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00050/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JjSn1Wuj0NOtwVdE8LzSGUyHK9k=/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00050/original.jpg" width="640" height="960"/></picture><figcaption>At the Ascot Chang factory, in Hong Kong, sewers and cutters produce about 45 meticulously made shirts a day.

Justin Chang, the grandson of the founder—the family has been making shirts in Hong Kong since 1953—greeted us and pulled out rolls of fabric (the store has more than 7,000 variations).</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I was to have four shirts made to complement my suit. Justin and Mark talked over each other as I pawed at the crisp fabrics.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We chose four fabrics for the different shirts: a spread-collar dress shirt made in a fine cotton piqué, a traditional white oxford button-down, a vintage-1970s cotton shirt with blue stripes, and my favorite, a chambray shirt with a button-down collar whose uneven yarn gave it a cool and casual look. I reveled in the by-now familiar, almost therapeutic feel of several men pressing measuring tape against my shoulders, chest, and arms. Because I am a watch aficionado, Mark requested that the diameter of the left cuff be slightly larger to expose my timepieces. The formal shirt must not have a pocket, he said, but the easygoing chambray could have a pocket with a button on it. “What does this button convey?” I asked Mark, trying to master all the rules.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“It conveys, <i>I have a button on my shirt</i>.”</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of Gary getting his shirt fitted as someone knees to adjust the cuff and another man adjusts the back" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4Dn1J3ITTL385aB2vKnzNx5BQi4=/0x0:1320x880/655x437/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/aeWuVJqruUCz_my_wGSse7REP-A=/0x0:1320x880/750x500/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JZtLSCRx2juSSKljapj4oVOUBqc=/0x0:1320x880/850x567/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/slPcoDH-5XYfZnoZRkzJls9Fzqk=/0x0:1320x880/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/5o3a9JZWz8xj40LnmVG0iDzRxsw=/0x0:1320x880/1310x874/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4Dn1J3ITTL385aB2vKnzNx5BQi4=/0x0:1320x880/655x437/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00769_4/original.jpg" width="655" height="437"/></picture></figure></div><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of Gary sitting and looking through fabric swatch books as two men look on" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Nbl7jM-g4KwxhNQEGrIqnHBLzG4=/0x0:1380x920/655x437/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/yydLAc7I-coxvEpwgHi2kuyEH68=/0x0:1380x920/750x500/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6Ks8y_ZhxR2PRTGnZ2iEfPqSh-g=/0x0:1380x920/850x567/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3MSlkYs9QsDcI1x71HDFuyBLU8o=/0x0:1380x920/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/-dyhSroe93My5_w8BjwNj7pnQvM=/0x0:1380x920/1310x874/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Nbl7jM-g4KwxhNQEGrIqnHBLzG4=/0x0:1380x920/655x437/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00207_5/original.jpg" width="655" height="437"/></picture><figcaption>The author visiting Ascot Chang in Hong Kong to select fabric and be fitted for four bespoke shirts (Leung Man Hei for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">One of the shirts had to be rushed for my second fitting with Yamamoto-san in Tokyo in a mere two days. Back at the Pedder Arcade, as I tried on a pair of artisanal-denim jeans, Mark told me that this was a particularly difficult task for Ascot Chang, because of my body’s many quirks. “There’s a large drop to your right shoulder,” Mark said. “It makes it difficult to dial in.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I also apparently have something called “rounded shoulders,” which results from a forward head position and a forward pelvic tilt. When I looked up my diagnosis online, I discovered that it is also called “mom posture,” a malady that usually afflicts mothers, who have to bend down to take care of their children. I wanted to congratulate myself on my devotion as a parent, but realized that my mom posture must result from a lifetime of slouching my shoulders to hide my breasts and, possibly, from constantly nursing my other child, my phone, while walking.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As I modeled the artisanal denim, Mark and I discovered something else: I have no ass. This is why all my pants fall off me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“No,” I said, immediately predicting what Mark would prescribe. “I can’t. It’s too <i>Wall Street</i>, the movie.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Suspenders,” he said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The next day, we left the fancy Central district and crossed the bay for the industrial hum of Kowloon East, to see the shirt that was being rushed for our Tokyo departure. In the warm, bright light of the factory, a host of workers was making my chambray shirt. I smiled sheepishly at the men and women toiling overtime to create the special differing armholes that would compensate for my dropped shoulder. Thirty-eight workers at the Ascot Chang factory produce about 45 shirts a day. The cloth cutters are mostly men; the sewers, who do the more complex engineering, such as the cuffs and collars, are mostly women.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of author and another man standing behind a woman sitting at a sewing machine in a factory, watching her work" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xQ8dEgyZ0oEFm-XOyAM5_7UY5c0=/0x0:1380x920/640x427/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00197_2/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/UuzXLq-tO-6RCVQgck7yRPARpco=/0x0:1380x920/750x500/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00197_2/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AMQMREVeKr1Hz4efPiqdCavu3jU=/0x0:1380x920/850x567/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00197_2/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vVP5C7_HpUEXm00gRSFhQuGe-xU=/0x0:1380x920/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00197_2/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vVP5C7_HpUEXm00gRSFhQuGe-xU=/0x0:1380x920/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC00197_2/original.jpg" width="928" height="619"/></picture><figcaption>The author touring the Ascot Chang factory.

I tried on my first-ever bespoke garment with trepidation. In the wooden glow of the Ascot Chang shop, I witnessed my first transformation. This was not the suit, but it was the pre-suit, an exquisite blue thing with gleaming charcoal mother-of-pearl buttons and, as I was told by Mark, “quite a strong collar for someone your size.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But for the first time in my life, the fit was right. The fit was good. The fit was perfect. Through the industry of a thoughtful team of cutters and sewers on the edge of Asia, I had finally reached a détente with my body. I looked at myself in the mirror and there I was: a well-dressed middle-aged man.</p><h3><span>Yamamoto-San Returns</span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>Armed with </span>one Ascot Chang shirt, with three more on the way, we left Hong Kong for Tokyo for the final steps of the bespoke journey—the second fitting with Yamamoto-san and a shoe fitting with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yoheifukuda.com/">Yohei Fukuda</a>, “arguably the best shoe money can buy,” according to Mark.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Tokyo is the city for craftspeople, and I was happy to watch Mark buzz around like a hummingbird, searching for perfect accoutrements for his clients. We visited the Ginza branch of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jean-rousseau.com/">Atelier Jean Rousseau</a>, where men in white lab coats perfected a watch strap for a customer’s Patek Philippe Ellipse. “Do you have a real rose-gold stitch?” Mark asked. “I know they cost a lot of money.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We cabbed across Ginza to Ortus, a maker of elite bags from materials including hippo, elephant, and seal, where Mark had commissioned a briefcase for an underemployed man of means that contained nothing but a Monopoly set (the Hong Kong–tram edition, naturally, the pieces made in silver). “Does he go around Hong Kong playing Monopoly with his friends?” I asked.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Well, he’s hoping this will make him some friends,” Mark said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That evening I had dinner with W. David Marx, the author of the aforementioned <i>Ametora</i>. David is a 6-foot-4 southern WASP-Catholic-Jew hybrid, who also counts Yamamoto-san as a tailor. “It makes you look like an adult,” he told me of the suit I would soon wear. “Which is not what people want to look like anymore.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The next morning, I climbed the steps to the second floor of Yamamoto-san’s atelier, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.tailorcaid.com/index.html">Tailor Caid</a>, in the hip Shibuya section of Tokyo. <span>Welcome to Caid modern tailoring</span> proclaimed a sign next to a silhouette of a man in a fedora toting a briefcase down an imaginary Madison Avenue. <span>We are not fashion snobs</span>, the sign continued, <span>but we know a few simple rules</span>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Inside, Yamamoto-san was resplendent in another seersucker suit, this one light blue, a dark-blue pocket square providing contrast. A record player was spinning not just Ella Fitzgerald, but a rare Japanese edition of her work titled <i>Ella and Nice Guys</i>. A Harvard pennant hung in the bathroom. There were old, yellowing copies of the Japanese magazines that had made Ivy style synonymous with Japan, with titles such as <i>Popeye</i> and <i>Hot-Dog Press</i> and headlines including “We Are Real IVY Leaguers.” And, finally, I was confronted with the work in progress, draped over a wooden hanger: my midnight-blue suit held together with white basting thread.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I relieved myself beneath the Harvard pennant and, with shaking hands, put on the suit. At this stage in the bespoke process, the basting thread disfigured the jacket, dividing it into quadrants, and the buttons were nothing but stickers. But I could begin to imagine the wonder that the suit would become. The heavy six-ply fabric felt primordially satisfying, like a light suit of armor, but one that managed to cling to my body with near perfection. This second fitting would remove the <i>near</i>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“There is an extended shoulder, but no pad,” Yamamoto-san explained through a translator, negating the horrors of the shoulder-pad-stricken ’80s, but also managing to support my dropped right shoulder. “There is an empty space in the chest,” Yamamoto-san pointed out. Because I stoop so profoundly, he had used the draping technique to, in Mark’s words, “give your chest a little more volume.” The jacket cleverly made my chimichangas all but invisible, while ironically providing them with new space to roam.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Damn, this is dramatic,” the usually unflappable Mark said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The way you wear this,” Yamamoto-san said, “it looks like ’50s France, or Alain Delon in the ’60s.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We talked about areas that needed improvement. I lifted my arms and turned around. “What do we do with Gary’s behind?” Mark asked as the two men searched for my ass. “Apparently you lost some butt since the first fitting.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“He should wear his pants as snug as possible,” Yamamoto-san said. The dreaded word <i>suspenders</i> came up again. “When the pants are above the belly button, everything is in line.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“He could do some squats,” Mark said, an opinion I would not dignify with a response.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We chose a beautiful turquoise lining to contrast with the outer sobriety of the suit, and also navy buttons made out of nuts. “Into each life, some rain must fall,” Ella crooned on the record player, but I was hardly listening to her.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of 3 men in a row each raising a martini glass to his mouth for a sip" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hRZfFUcvKLlbh5iFJW4jFzWyEec=/0x0:1340x1680/655x821/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nNC_eWRfWWvHBGH-XdI73uuJ8cY=/0x0:1340x1680/750x940/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OUkGRAJPek8a0WAI5W16cF0v6dI=/0x0:1340x1680/850x1065/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/MaEQDoiUVxmxDqf1JbE-nfyLqk4=/0x0:1340x1680/928x1163/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/EcpZQSNw_o9Ps6US6QlzRxOA4OI=/0x0:1340x1680/1310x1642/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hRZfFUcvKLlbh5iFJW4jFzWyEec=/0x0:1340x1680/655x821/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9021/original.jpg" width="655" height="821"/></picture><figcaption>The author with Mark Cho, the owner of the Armoury ( <em>left</em>), and Yamamoto-san (<em>middle</em>), enjoying a drink at Martiny’s bar, in New York City (Dina Litovsky for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">To celebrate the suit, we retired to the tailor’s favorite bar, Le Zinc, a few minutes’ walk from his atelier. Yamamoto-san is the type of Japanese man who surrounds himself with so much perfection that it would be interesting to take him someplace awful, like Hudson Yards or Westfield Garden State Plaza. Le Zinc felt like it had floated in from a former America, too spare and beautiful to provoke nostalgia, only awe. My martini was so excellent, I struggled not to cry. “There’s a sentiment in Japan,” my tailor said. “We don’t want to come to a bar without being well-dressed. There is a sentimentalization of Western culture.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“A Western culture that barely exists,” I said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A few martinis and highballs into our celebration, Yamamoto-san began to talk at length. He’d idolized America since he was a child. He listened to jazz in elementary school and saw the men wearing suits, and he couldn’t wait to wear a suit as well. He fell in love with the show <i>Bewitched</i>, in which an ad executive named Darrin (originally played by Dick York) was married to a witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)—but more important for Yamamoto-san, Darrin worked on Madison Avenue and wore fabulous suits.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I have to pause this story for a minute. Back in Queens, when I was wearing my Robin the Boy Wonder T-shirts and watching television on my grandmother’s failing 1960s Zenith set, <i>Bewitched </i>had managed to bewitch me as well. My nearly pubescent eyes lightly male-gazed Samantha, but I was equally in love with Darrin and his stark but perfect suits and ties. Though separated by a continent and an ocean, the young Yamamoto-san and I had entertained the same ideas of male fashion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“A lot of young people today are anti-aging,” he continued. “They want their clothes to show their youth. I like the idea of aging, the kind of aging you see in vintage furniture or a vintage watch. Aging is beautiful. When I see a 70-year-old man in Manhattan picking up after a dog while wearing a suit, I applaud.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We continued our discussion over bottles of Barolo at his favorite restaurant, which featured Lucchese cuisine. I had been to the actual Lucca just a month earlier, but the Japanese version of the food, like my Ivy-style suit in progress, seemed to both canonize and elevate its inspiration. If this part reads like a love letter to Japan and its pasta makers and toilet cleaners, I assure you it is.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">According to ancient Japanese custom, a night of karaoke followed, about which I recall only singing Suzanne Vega’s child-abuse classic “Luka,” to which my audience nodded politely. In the middle of the night, I tripped over the complicated stairs of my hotel suite and almost broke my nose. But I felt fine.</p><h3>The Final Touch</h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>The next day</span> would see the last piece of my wardrobe fall into place. The back-order list for Yohei Fukuda’s shoes is so long, the atelier has stopped accepting bespoke-shoe orders from new clients. For the time being, it is near-impossible to get his shoes, so please allow me to enjoy mine by myself. Fukuda-san and his assistants make only eight pairs a month, and each takes 130 to 140 hours of work. The soles are stitched by hand, which makes them a lot more flexible. Much like Yamamoto-san, who interned with a Boston tailor, Fukuda-san attended two years of “shoe college” in Northamptonshire, England, and then worked his way up from repairing soles to creating leather masterpieces in his atelier, by Tokyo’s Olympic stadium.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Fukuda-san is perfectly bald, with a luxuriant mustache. His work has been described as “kind of British,” which means he references and perfects traditional British shoes with the same brio as my tailor’s approach to Ivy style. The British did fine; Yohei Fukuda does better.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of two shelves of sample men&#39;s shoes in different leathers with an array of swatches beneath" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/idsd01V37nkoq_Gp2LKvU90uMxE=/0x0:1320x880/640x427/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_Atlantic_08262024_PerfectSuit_Tokyo_2035/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/P9zuJHzosu05AS1i-pTGZG3k3pc=/0x0:1320x880/750x500/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_Atlantic_08262024_PerfectSuit_Tokyo_2035/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/aY5rr9Mp_p_Ue1tzDZqiZfdv37w=/0x0:1320x880/850x567/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_Atlantic_08262024_PerfectSuit_Tokyo_2035/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AE630zgfPXly8tyWiG76wx9yZg8=/0x0:1320x880/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_Atlantic_08262024_PerfectSuit_Tokyo_2035/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AE630zgfPXly8tyWiG76wx9yZg8=/0x0:1320x880/928x619/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_Atlantic_08262024_PerfectSuit_Tokyo_2035/original.jpg" width="928" height="619"/></picture><figcaption>The atelier of the shoemaker Yohei Fukuda, in Tokyo (An Rong Xu for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Mark has this theory that bespoke oxfords are not really worth the money, because many fine examples can be found off the rack. But he believes in bespoke loafers. So now is the time to confess another of my body’s deficiencies: One of my legs happens to be longer than the other. Since I was a child, I’ve had to wear inserts in my shoes to account for this discrepancy, and so an easygoing loafer, the pride of America’s aristocratic New England class, is sadly not for me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We surveyed the gleaming shoes arrayed along the length of Fukuda-san’s atelier, like icons in a church. “Derby shoes,” Mark suggested. I looked over a couple. They were not quite as formal as oxfords, nor as floppy as loafers. Unlike oxfords, they had an open-laced construction that would comfort my calloused piggies during my daily six-mile walks around the countryside.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">My final row of samples to examine was rolled out, a collection of hides that would allow us to choose a color. “For derbies, the best place to start is the darkest brown,” Mark suggested. I remembered Boyer writing in <i>True Style</i> about how the Italians had taught the world not to be afraid of mixing brown shoes with blue suits.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Coffee,” Fukuda-san suggested, as we flipped through the hides.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Maroon,” Mark offered.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Brown pepper!” I said, as I ran my hands across a suede that seemed spicier, more intense, more brown than the others. Fukuda-san measured and traced every part of my foot, as we discussed adding a big rubber heel for better traction, and a steel toe. As with Yamamoto-san’s suit, my comfort and pleasure would be the biggest factors here; there would be no room for ostentation. <i>No one must know that these shoes cost $3,000</i>, I thought. <i>No one</i>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">My derbies would be lined with forest green to remind me of the forests behind my dacha. “Would you like your shoes monogrammed?” Fukuda-san asked. I was tempted to allow this to happen, but my Oberlin education still had some sway. My shoes remain anonymous.</p><h3><span>Yamamoto-San 3: The Transformation </span></h3><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>Just over two months</span> later, Yamamoto-san arrived back in New York with my suit. My shoes had emigrated through different channels.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It was November 7, two days after an important American election. I was trying to practice self-care. I couldn’t make my adopted country fall out of love with fascism, but at least I could enjoy my new shoes. Also, I suspected that our new leader would cut my taxes as he had in the past, shuffling money from his supporters into my piggy bank. As an immigrant who had moved from one failed superpower to another, I had learned to take my pleasures wherever I could.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of man tying dark blue tie for the author" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/IrWfzKrZhLpsdK_DdoYTsAOYmcA=/0x0:1320x1650/655x819/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/r9VZUwWbuxNg4vI5zneTN6IiyP4=/0x0:1320x1650/750x938/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/x_TtYNfWFJLNfCOCUVVf169oe8Q=/0x0:1320x1650/850x1063/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/SJJkVYUsOQxMjoMoAwOGISW_P9I=/0x0:1320x1650/928x1160/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bGbgDTLLsdxv6XgHXIDFlC6b1Wc=/0x0:1320x1650/1310x1638/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/IrWfzKrZhLpsdK_DdoYTsAOYmcA=/0x0:1320x1650/655x819/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_031/original.jpg" width="655" height="819"/></picture><figcaption>Mark educates the author on how to tie an Old Bertie knot during his final fitting at the Armoury.

The evening was warm, almost summery. Before I was ready to put on my suit, Yamamoto-san showed me how to steam-iron it with his beloved Panasonic travel iron. The Yohei Fukuda shoes were presented to me in a beautiful blond-wood box. “There’s no nail in that box,” one of the Armoury’s salesmen said. “Like a Jewish coffin.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But as I put on the suit, I felt less Jewish than distinctly Christian, Episcopalian if not Calvinist; in any case, born again. I walked out of the changing room and looked into a mirror. I was contained by midnight blue, my shoulders weighed down with six-ply pleasure, each of my feet covered by what felt like the product of a heavily personalized cow.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“<i>Yokatta! </i>” Yamamoto-san cried—roughly, “Thank goodness!”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“<i>Yokatta</i>,” Mark said, smiling.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of Gary beaming and holding the lining of the suit jacket" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/r_Qk2xXt89Sgc0QhRzScueOorGg=/0x0:1320x943/655x468/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/-Krv3vq5XBz0HklsQ77a39uUxGg=/0x0:1320x943/750x536/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/tvcTojVYpC4j74i5EXoMoEZjDFo=/0x0:1320x943/850x607/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_9j1m8mrHjRQwm6WT0ecxJ5qMA4=/0x0:1320x943/928x663/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xLS3sTDE31Nl8p2sN3oQEHqzTIc=/0x0:1320x943/1310x936/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/r_Qk2xXt89Sgc0QhRzScueOorGg=/0x0:1320x943/655x468/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_GarySuitDay_001/original.jpg" width="655" height="468"/></picture><figcaption>The author stroking the iridescent lining of his suit during his final fitting (Dina Litovsky for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">While I stood there yammering my gratitude, I noticed that despite the tailor’s best efforts, my pants were still sliding off the ghost of my ass. “I also have no tuchus,” the Armoury salesman who’d likened my shoebox to a Jewish coffin explained. “There’s no shelf on our bodies.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">To compensate, I was strapped into a pair of suspenders, and Mark lovingly tied a polka-dot tie around my neck in an Old Bertie knot. Even though I was at least a decade older than he was, I had started to think of Mark as my parent. He demonstrated how using a Bertie knot instead of the usual four-in-hand would benefit a shorter man like me by ending my tie at the waist, not the groin, where our returning president likes his. He thrust his index finger below the knot of my tie and explained that he was making a dimple.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Braces and polka dots, matching, wow!” Yamamoto-san said in English. He motioned to my nearly transparent Selima Optique frames. “And with glasses color, very nice!”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We’d had many discussions about whether my pants would come with buttons instead of a zipper, to avoid the dreaded “pants tent.” But after I had demonstrated to him my love of martinis and the many bathroom visits they inspire, Yamamoto-san had relented with a zipper.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I left the fitting room and walked out into the crucible of menswear society. Although my suit felt Episcopalian, men gathered around me as if I were a bar mitzvah at the bimah. They touched the fabric; they touched my shoulders; they touched my arms and my collar. They followed me out into the Armoury’s well-lit backyard.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“It looks like it was painted on you,” one man said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The back is so clean.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Your shoulders slope, and this just hugs them.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The neck hugs the collar with no wrinkle.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The stitching adds texture and visual interest.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The weight helps it hang, the drape.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“That’s a good lapel length.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“You’re shaming us all tonight.”</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of Gary striding down the sidewalk at night wearing the suit" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pZ78VM_okZZB9mfda-5hI_NFMl4=/0x0:1364x1904/655x914/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bseD9xHYkYLTGfhjj39xnkhz0hM=/0x0:1364x1904/750x1047/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ql2mRFXdCI6mZqSLxGUVO_qqjzc=/0x0:1364x1904/850x1186/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/7SbZEKFuFJfRvnNxPhZ9KQ55SIQ=/0x0:1364x1904/928x1295/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/142RZ4AvuiuFlZ-l2lxmPsyYtqE=/0x0:1364x1904/1310x1828/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pZ78VM_okZZB9mfda-5hI_NFMl4=/0x0:1364x1904/655x914/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9721/original.jpg" width="655" height="914"/></picture><figcaption>The author strolling through New York with his newfound self-esteem (Dina Litovsky for <em>The Atlantic</em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I opened up my suit, shyly and then proudly, to let folks touch the iridescent lining within. Is this what it was like to be loved in this country? Yamamoto-san took me aside and told me that I must wear my suit all the time, and wear it casually, not just for special occasions. The suit was a part of me now. “What we have to divine is: What is a Gary Shteyngart suit?” Mark had once asked. Well, now we had divined it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“If this becomes just for special occasions, I haven’t done my job,” Yamamoto-san said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I promised him that I would never abandon the suit. Every week, I would find a use for it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And I have kept my promise. I wear my suit regularly and with joy. I can do the Bertie knot in my sleep now. The different Ascot Chang shirts combine with either the polka-dot tie or its less formal counterpart, a silk foulard tie, to create different personalities. “You look like a crooner from the ’50s,” my wife, Esther, said of one combination. “You look like an English deacon,” she said of another.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Bitch! You’re ready for anything now!” Shilpa wrote from Tuscany.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I feel like you’re walking differently than you usually do,” my friend Sarah remarked. “You’re strutting a little.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Only my 11-year-old son, Johnny, was unimpressed. “I wear a less comfortable version of that every single day,” he told me, pulling at the collar of his school uniform.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I began to wear my suit to all my meals and to take it into consideration when I ordered. <i>What would my suit like to eat?</i> I would ask. The suit wanted shrimp cocktail. Even after the noon hour, the suit wanted steak and eggs with Tabasco sauce and a Bloody Mary. I traveled with my suit to give a reading at the University of Pennsylvania. The suit was a perfect companion. It sprang out of my suitcase like a golden retriever, with not even the afterthought of a crease on it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">My head floating above the perfect triangle effectuated by my lapels, I gave one of the best readings of my life. Why shouldn’t I? I had always been content with my mind, but now I loved my body. It was no longer an object of discomfort and derision. I loved the small flickering muscles beneath my chest. I loved the roundness of my posture, my settled state. Like a character out of a James Salter novel, I loved my physique, my physicality. And I loved myself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">We did a photo shoot at Martiny’s, a Japanese-style cocktail bar on 17th Street. Yamamoto-san insisted that he would help supervise. He parted the tie for me as I lay on a couch to make me look more at ease, more Ivy style. He made sure that only half of the watch I had chosen for the shoot, a gilt-dial 1963 Rolex Explorer, would flash from beneath my cuff.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="photo of author reclining on dark brown leather couch raising a martini glass in his right hand" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 982px) 928px, (min-width: 786px) calc(100vw - 54px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/n3bV29G91asNsPP-iwafGHl9ro4=/0x0:3024x2043/640x432/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 640w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/CU1SIQC0MZ3e5OATIzmKwZRiITY=/0x0:3024x2043/750x507/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3ikjnjXG_-y9T2jINEyK5GQWocc=/0x0:3024x2043/850x574/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/g6H6E_maTPiaQ0KbgZMn95IEWPU=/0x0:3024x2043/928x627/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Z54Hlvx87QP_F12LxEsXJshq440=/0x0:3024x2043/1536x1038/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HxZREDf1fBrYNi15ax-_YTXVpRs=/0x0:3024x2043/1856x1254/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg 1856w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/g6H6E_maTPiaQ0KbgZMn95IEWPU=/0x0:3024x2043/928x627/media/img/posts/2025/02/web_DSC_9126/original.jpg" width="928" height="627"/></picture><figcaption>Dina Litovsky for <em>The Atlantic</em></figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Afterward, Mark and I were walking through Tribeca past an immensely popular French bistro.
