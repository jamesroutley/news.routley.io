    <h1>Google Makes over $92B per Year by Owning Android</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>With over 3 billion Android users worldwide, the little green robot powers more devices than any other mobile operating system.</p><p><span>But here’s something you may not know: </span><strong>Android isn’t free</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Sure, you can download and use Android without explicitly paying anything. But behind the scenes, Google employs all sorts of creative ways to profit from their open source operating system. After all, tech companies don’t provide products out of the goodness of their hearts.</p><p><em>So how does Google make money from Android? And how much money are we talking here? </em><span>Let’s break it down.</span></p><p>The first and most direct way Google profits from Android is by charging phone makers licensing fees to install Google’s apps. </p><p>Technically, Android the operating system is open source and free. But if device manufacturers like Samsung want access to popular Google apps like Gmail or Google Maps or YouTube, they need to pay up. </p><p><span> Without Google’s apps, an Android phone would be useless to most people. So phone makers don’t really have a choice but to license this bundle, which Google calls </span><strong>Google Mobile Services (GMS)</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>According to court filings, Google charges phone makers between </span><strong>$2.50 to $40</strong><span> per device to license GMS, with the average being about </span><strong>$20 per phone</strong><span>. </span></p><p>With over a billion Android devices shipped every year, those licensing fees add up, on average generating Google about $20 billion annually.</p><p>But that’s not all…</p><p><span>The Google Play Store is a massive money maker on its own through paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, and advertising. </span><strong>In 2021, the Play Store generated $38.8 billion in revenue, and by 2025, experts predict Google Play Store will make $64 billion annually</strong></p><p>Like with most app stores, Google charges app developers 15 - 30% of all revenue generated from the Play Store.</p><p>Data on how much Google actually makes from this is unavailable, however, even by conservative estimates, over $22 billion of the Play Store’s revenue becomes profit for Google. </p><p>Here’s where things get crazy. Beyond direct revenue sources like hardware and app stores fees, controlling Android also steers billions of users towards Google’s family of apps. These include:</p><ul><li><p>Google Search</p></li><li><p>Google Maps</p></li><li><p>YouTube  </p></li><li><p>Gmail  </p></li><li><p>Google Drive </p></li><li><p>Google Photos</p></li><li><p>Google Chrome</p></li><li><p>Google Assistant</p></li></ul><p>These pre-installed apps don’t directly earn Google money. But by getting them in front of users by default, Google drives eyeballs that they then monetize through advertising and data collection across their ecosystem. </p><p>Having Android lead users into their funnel makes Google’s ads more valuable and gives them an unrivaled profile of user behaviors to optimize their services.</p><p>To quantify this indirect value provided by Google owning Android, let’s consider Google’s deal with Apple:</p><p><span>Google pays Apple a whopping </span><strong>$18 billion per year</strong><span> simply to be the default search engine on iPhones. And that’s just for search, without all the other pre-installed apps Android provides Google! </span></p><p><span>Combining the value of Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, and more - </span><strong>experts estimate Google gains over $50 billion per year indirectly from Android.</strong></p><p>So next time you see an Android phone, consider the irony. Google lets users download and use their ubiquitous operating system without paying a dime, then makes billions directly and indirectly from those same users.  </p><p>Rather than some free, open-source utopia, Android exists as a massive pipeline driving value to Google at each stage of the user journey. Phone makers pay, app developers pay, advertisers pay, and users pay with their data and eyeballs all so Google can turn around and maximize their profits.</p><p>It’s quite a strategy - Android provides massive access and control of the mobile world for Google while users happily carry around the data-gathering portal in their pockets as if it was free.</p><p><span>So while you may not pay for Android in dollars and cents, it certainly isn’t free. But for Google shareholders, they’ll surely say it’s </span><strong>priceless</strong><span>!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
