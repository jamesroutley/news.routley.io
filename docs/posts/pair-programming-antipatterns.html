    <h1>Pair Programming Antipatterns</h1>

<p>It’s possible to pair well simply by avoiding pairing poorly.</p>

<p>Stay away from these common mistakes and you’ll up your chances of success.</p>

<h2 id="for-navigators">For navigators:</h2>

<h3 id="leaping-on-errors-too-quickly">Leaping on errors too quickly</h3>

<p>Give your driver a chance to notice their own syntax errors and typos.</p>

<p>Constantly pointing out small errors hurts flow. Yours <em>and</em> theirs. It may also make your pair self-conscious.</p>

<p>Remember: your job is to consider the bigger picture, not to point out misspelled words as soon as you spot them.</p>

<h3 id="giving-low-level-instructions">Giving low-level instructions</h3>

<p>If you have a suggestion for the driver, communicate it at the highest level of abstraction they’ll understand.</p>

<p>If you find yourself dictating code (or worse, individual keystrokes), stop and see if you can communicate your idea at a higher level.</p>

<p>If that fails, ask to drive for a bit to get your idea sketched out.</p>

<h3 id="not-bringing-a-keyboard">Not bringing a keyboard</h3>

<p>Bring your own keyboard to every pairing session. Plug it in before you start.</p>

<p>This makes swapping roles easier and allows you to show rather than tell when words fail.</p>

<p>Having your own mouse is nice too, but not as essential. (It’s easy to ask someone to click on something, harder to get them to type many characters.)</p>

<h2 id="for-drivers">For drivers:</h2>

<h3 id="driving-too-fast">Driving too fast</h3>

<p>If you’re highly proficient with your editor, it’s easy to move fast enough to lose even experienced navigators.</p>

<p>Unless you’re sure your pair is keeping up, don’t manipulate code quite as fast as you’re able.</p>

<p>It helps if you dictate what you’re doing.</p>

<h3 id="allowing-a-checked-out-navigator">Allowing a checked-out navigator</h3>

<p>It’s easy to lose your navigator’s attention by moving too fast, or doing things they don’t quite understand.</p>

<p>If you get the sense that your pair’s attention is drifting, stop and sync up.</p>

<p>A bad question: “You understand this, right?”</p>

<p>A good question: “Which part of this is hardest to follow?”</p>

<p><strong>Pairing should involve constant two-way communication.</strong> If you or your navigator has gone quiet, stop and check in.</p>

<h3 id="unequal-screen-access">Unequal screen access</h3>

<p>Sit so that the monitor is <strong>between</strong> the two of you. Make sure both of you can see it equally well (consider bumping up font sizes).</p>

<p>If one person is tucked off to the side, it will create a subconscious unequal hierarchy.</p>

<p>A pair is a unit. Neither of you is more important.</p>

<h3 id="not-taking-breaks">Not taking breaks</h3>

<p>Pairing is draining. Even more so than normal programming.</p>

<p>A nice way to ensure you take adequate breaks is to employ the Pomodoro Technique. Consider agreeing on preferred work and break lengths with your pair before you start.</p>

<h3 id="listening-without-hearing">Listening without hearing</h3>

<p>It’s hard to listen and type at the same time.</p>

<p>If your navigator is making a suggestion, consider taking your hands off the keyboard. Even better: turn and make eye contact.</p>

<h2 id="for-both">For both:</h2>

<h3 id="allowing-unproductive-distractions">Allowing unproductive distractions</h3>

<p>Before you start pairing, disable all notifications (on your computer <em>and</em> phone).</p>

<p>A pairing session should be interrupted by exactly zero Slack notifications or text messages. If one slips through, apologize and disable future ones.</p>

<p>Don’t leave your email open on another monitor.</p>

<p>(You should do the above even when you’re not pairing. The quickest way to improve programming productivity is to reduce interruptions.)</p>

<h3 id="not-swapping-roles">Not swapping roles</h3>

<p>Driving and navigating are draining for different reasons.</p>

<p>Swapping roles lets you rest the tired parts of your brain and activate the idle ones.</p>

<p>Swapping drivers is a great way to energize a pairing session that’s losing steam. Consider setting a timer to indicate every time it’s time to switch.</p>

<h3 id="forgetting-its-a-skill">Forgetting it’s a skill</h3>

<p>Pair programming is a skill which must be learned.</p>

<p>You will not be good at it at first, but consistent practice will yield improvements.</p>

<p>Don’t give up after a difficult first experience. Don’t assume experienced developers are automatically good pairing partners. Don’t expect to be good without practice.</p>

<p>Consider reflecting with your pair or asking for feedback after each session. What could have been better?</p>
