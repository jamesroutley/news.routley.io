    <h1>A third of North America’s birds have vanished</h1>

              <p><span>F</span>or weeks, Adam Smith had been crunching the raw data from more bird statistics than anyone had ever tried before—thirteen different bird counts and millions of radar sweeps. Suddenly he heard the musical chime that tells him his results are ready. He leaned across his desk, surrounded by enough high-powered computers to heat up his entire office, and stared at what could only be an impossible conclusion: Over the past fifty years, his calculations found, a third of North America’s birds had vanished. “Well, that can’t be right,” he thought. “I must have made a mistake somewhere.”</p><p>Smith, one of the hemisphere’s top specialists in bird populations, just sat for a while in his cluttered cubicle at the Canadian Wildlife Service, which was decorated with caribou antlers, a musk-ox skull, and early drawings from his twin boys. Then it dawned on him. “This would be a massive change, an absolutely profound change in the natural system,” he said. “And we weren’t even aware of it.”</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="410" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"/><figcaption><strong>GLOBE TROTTER:</strong> Teams of researchers in both South and North America are trying to protect the Cerulean Warbler, one of scores of tiny world-travelers whose ranges span the hemisphere. <em>Photo by Anders Gyllenhaal.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Up until that point, counting the abundance of individual birds throughout the entire continent was impossible. At any given time, many species number in the tens of millions in North America—adding up to billions of birds—and they’re constantly on the move. But the science of bird study was advancing, and a close-knit group of scientists was experimenting with using radar imagery, satellite photos, and citizen science to add precision to the dozens of conventional bird counts done for groups of species.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="568" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"/><figcaption><strong>CITIZEN SCIENCE:</strong> The Great Blue Heron, shown here with its decorous mating plumage, is one of the species most often reported by birders as part of the massive citizen science project powered by the eBird smartphone app. Photo by <em>Anders Gyllenhaal.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The computation Smith had just finished that day in May 2019 combined individual population estimates for 529 bird species, from the most common sparrows and robins to rarities hardly ever seen. When Smith pulled these estimates together and adjusted each for its degree of certainty, the findings came down to a single ski slope of a chart. It showed a precipitous drop in nearly all these species in every part of the continent. At the bottom sat four lone digits—2.913. That’s the number of breeding birds in billions that had disappeared since the early 1970s. He had documented an accelerating churn of seasonal losses that slowly took their toll on the abundance of birds. And it translated to an astounding third of the adult birds that not long ago filled North America but now are gone.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="800" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"/><figcaption><strong>BYE, BIRDS: </strong>The graphic that Adam Smith sent out to his fellow scientists, showing the seismic drop in bird populations over the past fifty years.  <em>Credit: Adam Smith.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The hardest hit were grassland birds, down by more than 50 percent, mostly due to the expansion of farms that turn a varied landscape into acres of neat, plowed rows. That equates to 750 million birds, from bright yellow Eastern and Western Meadowlarks with their incessant morning songs to the stately Horned Lark with black masks across the male’s eyes and tiny hornlike feathers that sometimes stick up from their heads. Forest birds lost a third of their numbers, or 500 million, including the compact, colorful warblers and speckle-breasted Wood Thrushes that sing like flutes. Common backyard birds experienced a seismic decline. That’s where 90 percent of the total loss of abundance occurred, among just twelve families of the best-known birds—including sparrows, blackbirds, starlings, and finches. There’s been relatively little research on these species, and there’s no sense of urgency when resources are already stretched thin for so many other birds in more dire need.</p>
