    <h1>W6D1 - Be excited</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2086855">
    
      <div><p>In a <a href="https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/">post</a> on job searching, Haseeb Qureshi advises candidates to be excited.</p><blockquote><p>Be excited about the company. It’s trite, but it makes a huge difference. Be excited to interview. Be excited to learn about what your interviewer does and the prospect of getting to work with them.</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;m often fascinated how much you learn about companies through the interview process; plus it&#39;s often less motivating to do so outside of a job search. This helps me stay excited.</p></div>
