    <h1>Semantic note-taking</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Early in my career,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I learned a particular approach to taking meeting notes. I’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback about this over the years; here’s my attempt to explain the approach and why it’s effective.</p>
<p>I call this “<strong>semantic note-taking</strong>”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> based on the two main actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to record <strong>a shared understanding</strong>, focusing on meaning rather than text; and</li>
<li>Leverage the <strong>process of taking notes</strong> to create that shared understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This document</em> is my own work: all opinions, interpretations, hypotheses are my own. But I can’t take credit for the approach: I learned this implicitly by mirroring what my coworkers were doing. Please blame me for any bad advice; any positive outcomes, credit to the giants on whose shoulders I have stood.</p>

<p>There’s different reasons to have a meeting, some of which are (as the meme goes) really reasons to send e-mails. There’s also meeting types where semantic note-taking isn’t an appropriate approach.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The meetings where semantic note-taking shines involve <strong>many-to-many, back-and-forth communication</strong>. A weekly team roundtable, where we update each other on recent incidents and project progress.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> A working session between two teams, to establish background and decide on an approach. A horizontal summit, discussing how different groups have handled similar problems.</p>
<p>The goal of this kind of meeting is to <strong>build a shared understanding</strong>. But the process matters too: What did we conclude? What information did we use? What values did we apply? Notes-as-an-artifact <a href="https://adr.github.io">record</a> the answer to these questions; and if done right, the <em>process</em> of taking notes can help answer them.</p>

<p>I start semantic note-taking for a meeting by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I volunteer to take meeting notes. But I’m not a transcriptionist, so I’m going to <strong>write down what I hear, not what you say</strong>. I’m <a href="#procedural">sharing the meeting notes right now</a>- if I’m misrepresenting you, <em>please</em> say something to make sure we’re all on the same page!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This distinction – “what I hear, not what you say” – is the <em>semantic</em> part. I’ve found this makes me more engaged in meetings where I’m taking notes: I’m focused on active listening, going from ears to brain to fingers, rather than “just” transcribing.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>But human language is an imperfect conveyor of thoughts<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This is where the note-taking <em>process</em> matters: we want to <a href="#mechanics">set up an environment</a> where, <em>in the moment</em>, we detect and discuss misunderstandings. Without judgment – recognizing up-front that misunderstandings are possible, that the record reflects only one understanding, and that our shared goal is to reflect that inside and outside everyone’s heads.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m probably going to have comments, and I have a hard time typing and speaking. Can someone be ready to trade off note-taking with me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and wait for (or solicit) a volunteer.</p>
<p>“Note-taker” and “participant” are not discrete roles; I assume everyone is at the meeting to contribute to the discussion. Explicitly preparing to trade-off makes sure the note-taker’s contributions don’t get missed, and helps onboard more people into the semantic note-taking pool.</p>

<p>The above are – I think – the important bits. If you want more (less important) details, here’s some other things I think contribute to effective meeting notes.</p>
<h2 id="procedural">Procedural</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a shared document, e.g. Google docs.
<ul>
<li>Attach it to the meeting invite, e.g. with a link.</li>
<li>Share with edit access for all attendees.</li>
<li>Use the same document for a repeated meeting or series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the start of the meeting, identify two notetakers: solicit / volunteer to get them.
Establish expectations.
<ul>
<li>We need at least two people ready to jump in and take notes so that everyone can contribute: when Murali has something to say, Charles is ready to write it down, and vice versa.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li>
<li>Everyone is here to participate. Primary/backup. One person writing, unless they start talking for fall behind.</li>
<li>Form a habit –&gt; mutual trust.</li>
<li>Keep a line “empty” at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One notetaker presents the notes (e.g. via screen-share).
<ul>
<li>If someone is presenting slides, it’s probably not a many-to-many meeting; is semantic note-taking the right choice?</li>
<li>Participants don’t <em>need</em> to have a device open unless they’re taking notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share the meeting notes afterwards.
<ul>
<li>…including with non-attendees of interest, e.g. a team list or a <code>myteam+notes@</code> sublist.</li>
<li>Explicitly ask for corrections, again. My typical caveat:
<blockquote>
<p>These notes reflect what I understood, not what you said, and I probably got some things wrong. Please correct the record, and reach out if you think anything important was missed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structural">Structural</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a header to mark &amp; date each meeting session.</li>
<li>Below that, add a top-level bullet for each top-level agenda item</li>
<li>Below that, bullets for replies, sub-points, and discussions on that topic.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Include a speaker identifier<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> for each point<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting notes look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="future-agenda-items">Future agenda items:</h3>
<ul>
<li>bombadil@: Results of prime mover research (work in progress)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2178-04-08-temporal-cabal-weekly">2178-04-08: Temporal cabal weekly</h3>
<ul>
<li>rvw@: Issue with prognosticator
<ul>
<li>Prognosticator prone to high latency; sometimes only produces results
after the event</li>
<li>Possible solutions? -&gt; brownphd@ has some patents on this, I think?</li>
<li>brownphd@: Combine with temporal distortion field?
<ul>
<li>rvw@: Tried that in Delta tests; didn’t work well</li>
<li>fifteen@: We have more resouces in Alpha; more details? Maybe can work
around?</li>
<li>jnwy@: localized anomalies, see logs <a href="http://logs.voy.fleet/33.44.5;">http://logs.voy.fleet/33.44.5;</a> warp
disruption (link? AI: jnwy@), cutoff from mycelial network, …(and a
few other issues fifteen@ didn’t get written down; jnwy@ to link)</li>
<li>brownphd@: also high power draw issue; exceeds 1.21GW, may need protostar-scale source
<ul>
<li>cassilium@: Scale isn’t atmospherically stable, it’ll blow up</li>
<li>brownphd@: Don’t think so, will link numbers (AI: brownphd@)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2178-04-01-temporal-cabal-weekly">2178-04-01: Temporal cabal weekly</h3>
<ul>
<li>cassilium@: Morlock attack rates increased
<ul>
<li>“I’m trying very hard to not say I told you so” (cassilium@: please put that in quotes in the meeting notes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
