    <h1>Static Allocation with Zig</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Over the past few months I&#39;ve been chipping away at a small Redis-compatible key/value server called
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nickmonad/kv"><code>kv</code></a>. The goal is to have something (mostly) production-ready, while implementing
only a small subset of commands. The world doesn&#39;t necessarily need another key/value store, I&#39;m just interested in
implementing it in Zig and learning about some new (to me) techniques for systems programming.</p>
<p>One of those techniques is static memory allocation during initialization. The idea here is that all memory is requested
and allocated from the OS <em>at startup</em>, and held until termination. I first heard about this while learning about
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, and they reference it explicitly in their development style guide dubbed &#34;TigerStyle&#34;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All memory must be statically allocated at startup. <strong>No memory may be dynamically allocated (or freed and reallocated)
after initialization.</strong> This avoids unpredictable behavior that can significantly affect performance, and avoids use-after-free.
As a second-order effect, it is our experience that this also makes for more efficient, simpler designs that are more
performant and easier to maintain and reason about, compared to designs that do not consider all possible memory usage
patterns upfront as part of the design.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">TigerStyle</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although, this isn&#39;t as straightforward as it might sound at first. The first question that comes to mind might be:
&#34;How much memory do I allocate?&#34; Of course, the answer depends on the system. If we&#39;re writing a server, how many
concurrent connections do we allow? How much space is each connection allowed to work with? How much data do we expect
to process at any given time? Are there limits in response size? Do we need all the data at once, or can it streamed in
some fashion?</p>
<p>These are all questions that depend on the nature of the system and the context in which it will operate. I believe
that going through the exercise of answering these questions is ultimately a good thing, as it seems to have a strong
possibility of resulting in more stable systems, and forces us to understand the nature of our program at a deeper level.</p>
<p>On the language front, I feel like Zig is currently the best option out there for doing this with <em>relative</em> ease,
considering its design choices around explicit memory allocation and the <code>std.mem.Allocator</code> interface, which allows
the standard library to ship with a variety of different allocators.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at how we can manage static allocation in <code>kv</code>, considering three areas of request handling in
sequence: connection handling, command parsing, and key/value storage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of this is pretty new to me, and I&#39;m still wrestling with all these concepts. (And learning Zig!) I&#39;m sure
there are better ways of handling this stuff. I&#39;m presenting this as one possible implementation completed as a
learning exercise. I&#39;ll speak more about the trade-offs and where I think it can go further at the end of this post.</p>

<h2 id="connection-handling">Connection Handling</h2>
<p>The first thing we have to consider is how data comes into the system, which we&#39;ll maintain through the concept
of a <code>Connection</code>.</p>
<p>A connection represents the communication to a particular client that wants to access the key/value store.
Since we&#39;re using <code>io_uring</code> for asynchronous I/O, we have to keep some information around through the life-cycle of
a request, so the kernel can use it. The space for that information is what we&#39;ll statically allocate and re-use across
different connections as they come and go.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>const </span><span>Connection = </span><span>struct </span><span>{

</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>

<p>Connections also must maintain something called a &#34;completion&#34;. This detail is related to integration with <code>io_uring</code>,
the full details of which are outside the scope of this post. There are some good resources

I also took some inspiration from TigerBeetle&#39;s <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/522c0b9d15b112b20c57903987f140f1c16f627b/src/io/linux.zig">IO module</a>.</p>

<p>During initialization, we create three pools: one for the Connection structs themselves, one for receive buffers
(requests), and one for send buffers (responses). When a request comes in to the server, a Connection is pulled
from a <code>std.heap.MemoryPool</code>, and then two buffers are associated with that <code>Connection</code>. The buffers are
implemented as <code>ByteArray</code> structs, which are in turn allocated as part of a <code>ByteArrayPool</code>. The <code>ByteArrayPool</code>
is custom and uses a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_list">free list</a> to keep track of which buffers are available
to reserve for a new connection.</p>

<p><img src="https://hamy.xyz/images/kv-connection-pool.png" alt="A diagram showing how the kv connection pool works. A connection has two buffers, one for receive and one for send. Each come from a separate pool."/></p>
<p>At runtime, connections are created and destroyed (marked as available) using these pools and no actual allocation
needs to happen. If no <code>Connection</code> is available in the pool, the request is rejected and the client will have to try again.</p>
<p>This does mean that the server must be configured with an upper limit on the number of connections. Each connection
must also have a limit on how much data it can receive and send.</p>
<p>At first this might seem limiting, but in practice, it creates a more robust system. Databases in particular will
enforce a limit on the number of active connections for that exact reason! For a backend, networked system like <code>kv</code>,
I would say something like 1000 active connections is a pretty reasonable limit. For a public facing system you&#39;d
likely want more. Of course, this should all be configurable by the user.</p>
<p>The <code>Config</code> struct given to the <code>ConnectionPool</code> represents these user-configured options. Note that the <code>Config</code>
struct has a method <code>.allocation()</code> which is computed after the options have been set. In this case,
the <code>connection_recv_size</code> and <code>connection_send_size</code> depend on other options, such as <code>config.key_count</code> and
<code>config.key_size_max</code>. We&#39;ll revisit those later.</p>
<p>Now that data can get into the system, the next step is to parse out Redis commands.</p>
<h2 id="command-parsing">Command Parsing</h2>
<p>In an attempt to be compatible with Redis (at least a very small subset of it), <code>kv</code> has to parse incoming commands
following the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/">Redis serialization protocol</a> (&#34;RESP&#34;) format.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of an incoming <code>GET key</code> command.</p>
<pre><code><span>*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n
</span></code></pre>
<p>I won&#39;t go into detail on how these commands are structured, the RESP document will do a much better job there.
Basically, what we&#39;re looking at is &#34;Here&#39;s an array with 2 elements. The first element has 3 characters,
with the content <code>GET</code> and the second element has 3 characters, with the contenhttps://github.com/nickmonad/kvt <code>key</code>.&#34;</p>
<p>In order to parse this command, we need to look at the buffer that contains the request data, create some kind of
iterator over that buffer, and split each entry on the CRLF <code>\r\n</code> byte sequence. Here&#39;s the signature for <code>parse</code>,
the function that does just that.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>: </span><span>Config</span><span>, </span><span>alloc</span><span>: </span><span>std.mem.Allocator</span><span>, </span><span>buf</span><span>: []</span><span>const u8</span><span>) !</span><span>Command
</span></code></pre>
<p>The allocator is used to create some book-keeping structure as we parse through the command. We need to create a list
of <code>[]const u8</code> slices that points into the whole buffer and then is given to a command&#39;s <code>parse()</code> function, once
we know the command. This has the benefit of being a &#34;zero copy&#34; approach to parsing. No request data needs to be copied,
only pointed to.</p>
<p>Zig&#39;s <code>std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator</code> is perfect for this kind of operation. During initialization, we ask for buffer
space from a general purpose allocator, and pass it to the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code>. This allocator works as &#34;bump&#34; allocator,
where each internal allocation happens in a linear fashion, up to the amount of available space. The trade-off here is
that memory allocated within the fixed buffer can&#39;t be free&#39;d directly. Instead, the entire buffer is reset after use,
which simply resets an index back to <code>0</code>. (Just about as cheap as an operation can get!)</p>
<p>Since our server is single-threaded and processes one request at a time, we can re-use this <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code>
across every request. After the request is processed, the response is copied to a <code>Writer</code> object backed by the
connection&#39;s <code>send</code> buffer and the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> is reset for the next request.</p>
<p><img src="https://hamy.xyz/images/kv-parsing-state.png" alt="A diagram showing how parsing state works in kv."/></p>
<p>Knowing how much space to give the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> depends again on our system configuration. We need space for
the <code>ArrayList</code> of parsed command items, and space for any copied list items that are written back as a response during
command execution. Parsing must be able to support the largest possible command (a list <code>PUSH</code> of maximum size/length) and
copying has to support the largest possible response (again, a maximally sized list).</p>
<p>Copying has the extra consideration that we have to actually store the copied list items, which are duplicated when
read from the key/value store. During parsing, we just need to keep <em>slices</em> into the request buffer. For the copied
items, we need to keep a list of slices that point to the items, and the items themselves. As long as we give the
<code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> space, we can use it for all these (sub-)allocations.</p>

<p><img src="https://hamy.xyz/images/kv-fixed-buffer-space.png" alt="A diagram showing how the Fixed Buffer Allocator is utilized in kv. The first section is the parse array, the second is the copy array, and the third is copy data."/></p>
<p>The underlying <code>Store</code> will use the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> to allocate an <code>ArrayList</code> of fixed capacity
(determined by <code>config.list_length_max</code>) and then use the remaining space in the allocator for the copied data.</p>
<p>Hopefully all is clear so far! Now we can move on to the core of the system: key/value storage.</p>
<h2 id="key-value-storage">Key/Value Storage</h2>
<p>Perhaps obviously, the fundamental data structure in <code>kv</code> is a hash map, used to associate user provided keys with
user provided values.</p>
<p>Without looking too closely at the standard library, if you grab one of the provided hash map implementations,
it will accept a <code>std.mem.Allocator</code> and hold onto the allocator for the lifetime of the map. When a key/value pair
is added to the map, it will use that same allocator and request the appropriate amount of memory to store that data.
This won&#39;t work for our case though, since we need to control allocation prior to adding any data to the map.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Zig also provides an &#34;unmanaged&#34; version of a hash map. Generally, these unmanaged versions of data
structures in the standard library mean that an allocator is not held by the structure itself. It&#39;s up to us to provide
that allocator when needed. A cool trick we can play with an unmanaged map is ask it to ensure it has enough capacity
up front, and then &#34;assume&#34; that capacity during runtime when adding data to it. The hashing and internal details are
still handled by the map.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>var </span><span>map</span><span>: std.</span><span>StringHashMapUnmanaged</span><span>(Value) =</span><span> .empty</span><span>;
</span><span>try</span><span> map.</span><span>ensureTotalCapacity</span><span>(gpa, capacity);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>ensure</code> operation can fail with <code>error.OutOfMemory</code>, which is OK during initialization. But, assuming this succeeds,
we no longer need to pass an allocator when we store data in the map.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>store.map.</span><span>putAssumeCapacity</span><span>(key, value);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This <em>could</em> in theory fail, in which case there would an assertion failure. It&#39;s ultimately up to us to check against
the map&#39;s available capacity before calling this function. But, again, no allocation is required.</p>
<p>Since the map itself doesn&#39;t do any allocation at runtime, we have to provide space for incoming keys and values. We&#39;ll
reuse the same <code>ByteArrayPool</code> implementation that we used for connection buffers. Basically, we have a big space
allocated for keys and values and the hash map just maintains an association of pointers from keys to values.
The key/value data isn&#39;t literally <em>stored</em> &#34;in the map.&#34; The allocation that happens in <code>ensureTotalCapacity</code> is for
the internal book-keeping structure of the map, not for the user data.</p>
<h3 id="navigating-the-map">Navigating the map</h3>
<p>At the highest level, the primary challenge with storing keys and values in a statically allocated map is that we
could get poor utilization of the allocated space, especially when we need to support keys pointed at lists as values.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let&#39;s say our map is configured to allocate space for 5 keys and 5 values. If each key maps to one
value, we get perfect utilization. At the other extreme, if one key maps to a value containing a list of 5 elements,
we have to use all the allocated value space for this one key, preventing other keys from using any value space,
causing the map to be &#34;biased&#34;. The store wouldn&#39;t be able to hold any more key/value pairs, even though there is
allocated memory &#34;on the table.&#34;</p>
<p><img src="https://hamy.xyz/images/kv-map-utilization.png" alt="A diagram showing three different possibilities of how allocated memory can be used in a static hash map."/></p>
<p>Basically, the only way to mitigate this is to make sure there&#39;s enough allocated space for <em>every</em> key to hold a
list of maximum size. This definitely inflates the amount of space we have to allocate, but the alternative is a
system that doesn&#39;t support its configured properties. Every key must be <em>able</em> to store a list of maximum size,
even if they don&#39;t during actual use.</p>
<p>Another issue with static allocation in the context of a map is dealing with map deletions. Our
<code>std.StringHashMapUnmanaged</code> structure uses open-addressing and linear probing to place keys in the map when hash
collisions occur. Deletions are tricky because they can break the map&#39;s ability to know if a key is actually present
in the map. To handle this, a &#34;tombstone&#34; technique is used to mark a space as logically (but not physically) deleted
in order to preserve accurate lookups.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more to figure out here, but it&#39;s my understanding that a map will have to periodically rehash the
keys in order to reclaim space if too many tombstones pile up. When this occurs is still a bit of mystery to me.
If it occurs when the map needs to grow to accommodate more key/value pairs, we&#39;ll never actually trigger that
condition in a static context. If it occurs at some other point, based on number of keys compared to capacity,
perhaps that could work. Or maybe, it&#39;s up to us to call <code>rehash()</code> whenever it appears there is no space left,
and try the operation again.</p>
<p>All of this considered, I think a custom map implementation is more appropriate for the context of static allocation.
This current implementation proves the concept, but definitely leaves room for improvement!</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-allocation-size">Revisiting allocation size</h2>
<p>Now that we have a method for statically allocating space for these three components (connections, parsing, and storage),
we can finally answer the first question: How much space do we allocate?</p>
<p>In this current iteration of <code>kv</code>, the answer can really only be determined after the fact, once configuration has
been set and all the allocations have been made. There are five options that can be configured by the user,
and two derived properties based on those options.</p>

<p>The <code>connection_recv_size</code> and <code>connection_send_size</code> properties of <code>Allocation</code> depend on some details of the
RESP protocol, but is mostly informed by our user configuration. In the interest of wrapping this post up,
I&#39;ll gloss over those details, and encourage you to check out <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nickmonad/kv/blob/master/src/config.zig"><code>src/config.zig</code></a>.</p>
<p>This <code>Config</code> struct doesn&#39;t directly specify <em>every</em> aspect of allocation, but it does provide the basis for it.
Something not listed in the <code>Config</code> struct directly is the &#34;list item pool&#34;, part of the key/value <code>Store</code> struct.
When keys point to lists as values, there is a linked list backing that value in the hash map, and we need a pool of
structs to assist in the construction and iteration of that linked list.</p>
<p>With some reasonable configuration options set, let&#39;s see just how much memory we allocate!</p>

<p>Everything here is measured in bytes, so we&#39;re looking at approximately <code>750 MB</code> of memory for the given configuration.
<code>total_requested_bytes</code> is a feature of Zig&#39;s <code>std.heap.DebugAllocator</code>. The exact number of bytes will be different
on each run, although it will hover around that value. I think the reason for this is how Zig requests <em>pages</em> of
memory from the OS. It won&#39;t always be the same and the OS is very likely doing some fancy book-keeping of its own.</p>
<p>If you play around with the configuration options and see how <code>total_requested_bytes</code> changes, it might be
surprising just how much memory is allocated up-front, before any of it is actually used! For example, if we
double <code>val_size_max</code> to <code>8192</code> and <code>list_length_max</code> to <code>100</code>, we&#39;re looking at about <code>2.8 GB</code> of allocated memory.</p>
<p>In the context of modern servers, this isn&#39;t a lot, but it can quickly grow as we adjust these parameters.
Should we be asking ourselves: Is this inefficient? What if we don&#39;t use all that memory?</p>
<p>Like all good engineering decisions, we have to consider them in the context of the problem we&#39;re trying to
solve, and the guarantees we expect from our systems. With this design, ensuring that each request and each
key/value pair <em>can</em> utilize the maximum configured space, seems like a worthy trade-off to make.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Like most projects, this one took a lot longer than I expected! Trying to incorporate both <code>io_uring</code> and
static allocation was something I had never done before, but I&#39;m pretty happy with the result.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to improving the internal hash map to better fit a static context, consider alternative
allocator implementations to improve memory utilization, and incorporate fuzz testing to find the limits of the system.</p>
