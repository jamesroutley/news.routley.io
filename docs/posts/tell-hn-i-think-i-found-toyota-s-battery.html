    <h1>Tell HN: I think I found Toyota&#39;s battery</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Recently there was a thread about a &#34;breakthrough&#34; in battery technology at Toyota.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36585327">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36585327</a></p><p>Toyota has been putting out PR puff pieces about their &#34;solid-state&#34; (solid-electrolyte) batteries for years, but this story was unique in that it had a quote from Keiji Kaita, who holds some high-level role at Toyota. Anyway, I didn&#39;t think much of it, because there was no paper referenced in the <i>Guardian</i> article, which seemed to be the original source.</p><p>But while reading about something else, I came across the paper &#34;A near dimensionally invariable high-capacity positive electrode material&#34;, published in <i>Nature Materials</i> last December:</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01421-z" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01421-z</a></p><p>This paper, reporting a cathode that has very little (much less than normal) change in size or shape when charged and discharged, claims reversible storage with a solid electrolyte. It stands to reason that dimensional stability of the cathode is necessary for interfacing with a solid electrolyte, since if it swells and shrinks, it will probably detach from the electrolyte, and possibly damage it further.</p><p>Looking at the affiliations of some of the authors we see a number of contributors from the &#34;Lithium Ion Battery Technology and Evaluation Center (LIBTEC)&#34;. A web search about LIBTEC leads to several articles from 2018:</p><p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-nissan-honda-libtec-solid-state-battery-development/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-nissan-honda-libte...</a></p><p>which state that Toyota, along with Nissan, Honda and Panasonic (Tesla&#39;s major collaborator), have established this consortium to work on solid-electrolyte batteries as of five years ago.</p><p>So what does this thing look like? It&#39;s a vanadiumâ€“titanium cathode, Li8Ti2V4O14. Titanium is common; vanadium technically has a higher crustal abundance than nickel, but it tends to be spread across low-quality deposits, so production is low right now. A review considering the resource outlook for V-based batteries [1] was guardedly optimistic. 750 Wh/kg is <i>great</i>. Vanadium cathodes historically had a problem with high dimensional <i>instability</i>, but it appears that cocrystallization with titanium may have fixed that, and the weird properties of vanadium became an advantage in compensating for Li+ influx/efflux.</p><p>The use of a sulfide electrolyte pours doubt on claims of safety, though. It&#39;s reasonably likely that if water were to come into contact with the electrolyte, it could release highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.</p><p>Also, since the battery was developed in collaboration with other major automakers (and funded by the Japanese government), it&#39;s somewhat questionable to think it would give Toyota a major advantage in the EV race. But for the Japanese economy, which has been rather slow lately, it could be a boost.</p><p>1: <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.202200479" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10....</a></p></div></td></div></div>
