    <h1>Taking a Look at Compression Algorithms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently undertook the delusional project of writing my own implementation of a Kafka Broker: <a href="https://cefboud.github.io/posts/monkafka">MonKafka</a>. Deep into that rabbit hole, I fell into a different one when trying to implement compression for Kafka’s record batches. Kafka supports, as of now, four schemes: GZIP, Snappy, LZ4, and ZSTD. While proceeding with my implementation, I realized I really didn’t know that much about the fascinating topic of compression. I vaguely remembered Huffman trees and some information theory from school, but that was the extent of it. Importing packages and calling friendly APIs felt lacking. So, in the spirit of rabbit holes and indulging, I decided to take a bit of a deep dive to get a better understanding of some of these compression algorithms.</p><h2 id="primer-on-compression"><span>Primer on Compression</span><a href="#primer-on-compression"><i></i></a></h2><p>What is compression? We represent data using bytes (1 byte = 8 bits). The more bits we have, the more storage space we need and the longer the transmission time. If we can represent some data with fewer bits, we can save on both storage and time it takes to process or transmit. So compression translates to cost savings and better performance. And at scale, we are talking about millions of $.</p><p>There are two major types of compression:</p><ul><li>lossless, where no data is lost and the original data can be perfectly reconstructed. In this post, we’ll focus on that.</li><li>lossy, where data is compressed in such a way that the original data cannot be fully recovered, but a close approximation is sufficient. A well-known example is JPEG, which produces an image close enough to the original, and for many cases, this level of quality is acceptable if it gives a better compression ratio.</li></ul><p>So, how do we compress data? There are several techniques, some of which you might be familiar with or have heard of:</p><ul><li><strong>Run-Length Encoding (RLE):</strong> Consecutive identical elements are replaced with a single element and a count (e.g., “AAAAAA” becomes “6A”).</li><li><strong>Lempel-Ziv (LZ):</strong> This method uses back-references to previous sequences. For example, <code>This is a nice sweet example of LZ, a nice sweet example of LZ.</code> becomes <code>This is a nice sweet example of LZ, &lt;28, 26&gt;.</code>, where &lt;28, 26&gt; means “go back 28 positions and copy 26 characters.” Lempel and Ziv are a big deal in the compression world and their compression scheme LZ77 (created in 1977) is the ancestor of a host of modern schemes such as DEFLATE (gzip) and Snappy.</li><li><strong>Huffman Coding:</strong> A variable-length encoding algorithm, where symbols have different code lengths (e.g., 10, 110, 1110, etc.), assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols. In English, for instance, <code>e</code> is the most frequent letter, and <code>z</code> is one of the least frequent. To save space, we can represent <code>e</code> with a short code, while using a longer code for <code>z</code> - which won’t be a significant penalty since <code>z</code> occurs less often.</li></ul><p>These techniques and others are used in the different schemes with great variations in the implementations.</p><p>The various compressions schemes try to optimize three metrics: compression ratio, compression speed and decompression speed.</p><h2 id="gzip"><span>GZIP</span><a href="#gzip"><i></i></a></h2><p>When I started looking into GZIP, it was confusing and frustrating, to say the least. But a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPvNi4HrWQ">lecture by Professor Bill Bird on YouTube</a> not only allowed me to learn so much about the subject and answered all my questions, but it was also very entertaining and fun. I can’t recommend this video and his whole series on compression strongly enough. At some point in the lecture, he was explaining one of the most gnarly pieces of DEFLATE and <a href="https://youtu.be/SJPvNi4HrWQ?si=EVN9DSGdNxWCxolV&amp;t=7682">said</a>:</p><p>“…maybe after months and months of working on this scheme with all these bit level hacks they were getting maybe cabin fever or something and um delirium was setting in”</p><p>The ‘cabin fever’ comment had me laughing out loud. It came two hours into the intricacies of DEFLATE, and the joke hit the nail on the head!</p><p>Anyway, let’s keep going.</p><p>Gzip is a file format with a header (10 bytes), footer (8 bytes), and a payload of blocks compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm. It is one of the most famous compression formats in the world. The meat and potatoes of GZIP is DEFLATE.</p><p>The DEFLATE algorithm is also used in ZIP,DOCX (Microsoft Word), and PNG (images) files. DEFLATE is everywhere!</p><h3 id="deflate-algorithm"><span>DEFLATE Algorithm</span><a href="#deflate-algorithm"><i></i></a></h3><p>The DEFLATE compression algorithm combines LZ77 (technically LZSS, but the RFC refers to it as LZ77) and Huffman encoding:</p><ul><li><p>LZ77: A sliding window algorithm that back-references previous sequences. For example, as mentioned above, “This is a nice sweet example of LZ, a nice sweet example of LZ!” becomes “This is a nice sweet example of LZ, &lt;28, 26&gt;!”, where &lt;28, 26&gt; means “go back 28 positions and copy 26 characters.” We saved quite a bit of characters by replacing them with just two numbers. Imagine doing this multiple times with greater lengths. That is the LZ magic!</p></li><li><p>Huffman encoding: As explained above, encodes frequent symbol with shorter sequences than less frequent ones, to save space. A simplification of its algorithm is:</p><ol><li>Count the frequencies of symbols.</li><li>Build a binary tree where frequent symbols are closer to the root.</li><li>Traverse the tree to retrieve the symbols.</li></ol></li></ul><p>We create the tree from the bottom-up, combining the least frequent nodes first, ensuring that no path to a leaf overlaps with another. Let’s take a look at an example:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

This knowledge allows us to encode the distance symbols using a different Huffman code, since we know where they start. A different code means a shorter one, i.e., more space savings.</p><p>Data bytes and lengths are represented together, using the same Huffman code. Data bytes occupy their natural range of 0-255, while lengths, which range from 3 to 258, are represented using codes from 257 to 285. The interesting part is that all 256 possible length values are represented using only 29 symbols. How is this possible? The answer lies in the use of extra bits for less common values.</p><p>For example, a length of 30 (second column, fifth row in the first table above) is represented using the code 271 and two extra bits 11.</p><p>Why use extra bits? Because some length values are less frequent, they are represented using the same code with additional offset bits. This allows for a more compact representation, even though the extra bits add a small penalty. This approach is similar to how Huffman coding works, where less frequent values are encoded with longer codes to achieve compression efficiency.</p><p>The same idea is used for the distance codes. All 32768 possible values are only coding using 30 codes and extra bits. THe bigger distance which are less common are represented with more extra bits as per the table.</p><p>For example, a distance of 100 (second column, fourth row tbe second table above) is represented using code 13 and an additional 5 bits, 00011 (3 + 97 = 100).</p><p>Suppose we are at the i-th position in our data to be compressed. How do we look for a backreference, i.e., a previous sequence equal to the current one? Do we reexamine all the previous characters? This could be quite CPU-intensive.</p><p>The RFC suggests using a chained hash table. This means that all sequences whose first three bytes share the same hash are added to a linked list. When we are at position i, we hash the current 3 bytes and look up the table to find a linked list of all previous sequences that share the same hash and ideally (if no collisions occur) match the current bytes. The presence in the list only means a 3-byte match; we need to extend each one to the largest match possible. How far back into the list we search and when we stop determines the compression level. The further we search for a better match, the more we trade CPU time for a better compression ratio.</p><p>Here is how the RFC puts it:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre>   The compressor uses a chained hash table to find duplicated strings,
   using a hash function that operates on 3-byte sequences.  At any
   given point during compression, let XYZ be the next 3 input bytes to
   be examined (not necessarily all different, of course).  First, the
   compressor examines the hash chain for XYZ.  If the chain is empty,
   the compressor simply writes out X as a literal byte and advances one
   byte in the input.  If the hash chain is not empty, indicating that
   the sequence XYZ (or, if we are unlucky, some other 3 bytes with the
   same hash function value) has occurred recently, the compressor
   compares all strings on the XYZ hash chain with the actual input data
   sequence starting at the current point, and selects the longest
   match.

   The compressor searches the hash chains starting with the most recent
   strings, to favor small distances and thus take advantage of the
   Huffman encoding.  The hash chains are singly linked. There are no
   deletions from the hash chains; the algorithm simply discards matches
   that are too old.  To avoid a worst-case situation, very long hash
   chains are arbitrarily truncated at a certain length, determined by a
   run-time parameter.

   To improve overall compression, the compressor optionally defers the
   selection of matches (&#34;lazy matching&#34;): after a match of length N has
   been found, the compressor searches for a longer match starting at
   the next input byte.  If it finds a longer match, it truncates the
   previous match to a length of one (thus producing a single literal
   byte) and then emits the longer match.  Otherwise, it emits the
   original match, and, as described above, advances N bytes before
   continuing.

   Run-time parameters also control this &#34;lazy match&#34; procedure.  If
   compression ratio is most important, the compressor attempts a
   complete second search regardless of the length of the first match.
   In the normal case, if the current match is &#34;long enough&#34;, the
   compressor reduces the search for a longer match, thus speeding up
   the process.  If speed is most important, the compressor inserts new
   strings in the hash table only when no match was found, or when the
   match is not &#34;too long&#34;.  This degrades the compression ratio but
   saves time since there are both fewer insertions and fewer searches.

</pre></td><td><pre>Each encoded block begins with the varint-encoded length of the decoded data,
followed by a sequence of chunks. Chunks begin and end on byte boundaries. 

The first byte of each chunk is broken into its 2 least and 6 most significant bits
called l and m: l ranges in [0, 4) and m ranges in [0, 64). l is the chunk tag.
Zero means a literal tag. All other values mean a copy tag.

For literal tags:
  - If m &lt; 60, the next 1 + m bytes are literal bytes.
  - Otherwise, let n be the little-endian unsigned integer denoted by the next
    m - 59 bytes. The next 1 + n bytes after that are literal bytes.

For copy tags, length bytes are copied from `offset` bytes ago, in the style of
Lempel-Ziv compression algorithms. In particular:
  - For l == 1, the offset ranges in [0, 1&lt;&lt;11) and the length in [4, 12).
    The length is 4 + the low 3 bits of m. The high 3 bits of m form bits 8-10
    of the offset. The next byte is bits 0-7 of the offset.
  - For l == 2, the offset ranges in [0, 1&lt;&lt;16) and the length in [1, 65).
    The length is 1 + m. The offset is the little-endian unsigned integer
    denoted by the next 2 bytes.

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>I omitted some optimization code, but this is the gist of Snappy, and it is refreshingly simple. We hash 4 bytes at a time and only keep 1 previous reference, unlike DEFLATE, which keeps a whole chain. Once we find a match—a hash of 4 previous bytes that match our 4 current bytes — we exit the first nested <code>for</code> loop. We then <code>emitLiteral</code>, meaning we write the literal bytes before the match where no match was found, then keep extending our current match to get the biggest backreference possible. We emit the backreference using <code>emitCopy</code> and keep going until we reach the end of our <code>src</code>.</p><p>This is somewhat of an oversimplification, but this is the gist of it!</p><p>The difference between Snappy and DEFLATE in searching for previous back references is:</p><ul><li><strong>Match length</strong>: 64 for Snappy and 258 for DEFLATE.</li><li>Snappy contents itself with the most recent match, i.e., the most recent sequence that starts with the same 4 bytes, whereas DEFLATE maintains a list of entries that share the same prefix.</li></ul><h2 id="lz4"><span>LZ4</span><a href="#lz4"><i></i></a></h2><p>LZ4 is quite similar to Snappy.

</pre></td><td><pre>    An LZ4 compressed block is composed of sequences. A sequence is a suite of not-compressed bytes, followed by a match copy operation.

    Each sequence starts with a token. The token is a one byte value, separated into two 4-bits fields. Therefore each field ranges from 0 to 15.
    The first field uses the 4 high-bits of the token. It provides the length of literals to follow.
    The value 15 is a special case: more bytes are required to indicate the full length. Each additional byte then represents a value from 0 to 255, which is added to the previous value to produce a total length. When the byte value is 255, another byte must be read and added, and so on. There can be any number of bytes of value 255 following token. 

    ... 

    A literal length of 280 will be represented as :
    15 : value for the 4-bits High field
    255 : following byte is maxed, since 280-15 &gt;= 255
    10 : (=280 - 15 - 255) remaining length to reach 280

   Following token and optional length bytes, are the literals themselves. They are exactly as numerous as just decoded (length of literals). Reminder: it&#39;s possible that there are zero literals.

    Following the literals is the match copy operation.

    It starts by the offset value. This is a 2 bytes value, in little endian format (the 1st byte is the &#34;low&#34; byte, the 2nd one is the &#34;high&#34; byte).

    The offset represents the position of the match to be copied from the past. For example, 1 means &#34;current position - 1 byte&#34;. The maximum offset value is 65535. 

    Then the `matchlength` can be extracted. For this, we use the second token field, the low 4-bits. Such a value, obviously, ranges from 0 to 15. However here, 0 means that the copy operation is minimal. The minimum length of a match is 4. As a consequence, a 0 value means 4 bytes. Similarly to literal length, any value smaller than 15 represents a length, to which 4 must be added, thus ranging from 4 to 18. A value of 15 is special, meaning 19+ bytes, to which one must read additional bytes, one at a time, with each byte value ranging from 0 to 255. ... There is no limit to the number of optional 255 bytes that can be present.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>LZ4’s approach is quite interesting. The literal and match (copy) blocks are combined, and the <code>token</code> is used to indicate the length of both. The 4 high bits represent the length of the literal, while the 4 low bits represent the length of the match. If the length exceeds what can be stored in 4 bits, additional bytes are used. Each extra byte can encode a length of up to 255. Thus, two extra bytes can represent lengths up to 510 instead of 16k if read as a uint16. I assume in practice lengths rarely exceed the extra two bytes limit. This is a rather intriguing way of handling things.</p><p>Offsets are handled with 2 simple little-endian bytes, which naturally limits the sliding window to 65535.</p><p>The main loop to compress a block share quite a bit of common ground with Snappy. We rely on a hash table to look to backreference.</p><p>Here is an abridged version from a neat <a href="https://github.com/pierrec/lz4/blob/1a4bbaef2f12f93c70060b52121e992756077a1f/internal/lz4block/block.go#L105-L106">Golang implementation</a> with some additional comments:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Behind the scenes, it extends the hash table by adding a chain (much like Deflate) and introduces a new compression level parameter that indicates how deep the chain we can look to find a better match, i.e., how much CPU we can trade for a better match and thus a higher compression ratio! It is remarkable how it all boils down to this.</p><p>Once again, this is just a glimpse into LZ4, but I hope it gives you a good sense of its functionality.</p><h2 id="zstd"><span>ZSTD</span><a href="#zstd"><i></i></a></h2><p>ZSTD (Zstandard) is the successor to LZ4.

This is what I call having the best of both worlds!</p><p>ZSTD is more complex compared to the previous algorithms, and explaining it in detail would be too ambitious for the scope of this blog post. However, it felt wrong to stop here, so I’ll briefly touch on some of the ideas it builds on.</p><p>ZSTD is still an LZ-based scheme, but it incorporates Huffman encoding, FSE (more on that below), and several clever tricks. FSE is based on a method derived from arithmetic coding.</p><p>In the remaining sections, I’ll try to provide a gentle introduction to some of these blocks.</p><h3 id="arithmetic-coding"><span>Arithmetic Coding</span><a href="#arithmetic-coding"><i></i></a></h3><p>Huffman coding allows us to represent frequent symbols with fewer bits. If <code>e</code> is the most frequent symbol in the English alphabet, it makes sense that it would get the shortest bit representation, i.e., just one bit (0 or 1).</p><p>The problem with Huffman is that we need an integer number of bits to represent a symbol. Consider the sequence <code>eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb</code>. Here, <code>e</code> has a probability of 98%, and <code>b</code> has a probability of 2%. Given Huffman’s nature, the shortest code would be just 1 bit. However, because of this, both <code>e</code> and <code>b</code> end up being encoded with the same 1-bit representation.</p><p>Ideally, there should be a proportional relationship between probability and the number of bits used to represent a symbol.</p><p>Arithmetic coding attempts to solve this issue. The idea is quite elegant. Imagine we have the a sequence with letter <code>a</code>, <code>b,</code> and <code>c</code> , with probabilities of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> being 0.45, 0.35, and 0.2, respectively. To represent <code>a</code>, we can send any value in the interval <code>[0, 0.45)</code> (with 0.45 not included). For <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, we use the intervals <code>[0.45, 0.8)</code> and <code>[0.8, 1)</code>, respectively.</p><p>For the second character, we subdivide the first interval according to the same probabilities. If the first character is <code>a</code>, we can send a value from the subintervals <code>[0, 0.203)</code>, <code>[0.203, 0.36)</code>, and <code>[0.36, 0.45)</code> to represent <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, respectively. Here, <code>0.203</code> is <code>0.45</code> times <code>0.45</code>, and <code>0.36</code> is <code>0.35</code> (the probability of <code>b</code>) times <code>0.45</code>, added to <code>0.203</code>.</p><p>In simple terms, we divide the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> according to the probabilities of the symbols. After encoding each symbol, we subdivide its interval according to the remaining probabilities, and we continue subdividing for each subsequent symbol. The final compressed result is simply a value within the correct interval representing our sequence.</p><p>The example and the following neat representation are borrowed from <a href="https://youtu.be/xt3uNibQWlQ?si=fE5AjLDuE16zZMSz">this tremendous lecture</a> by the same professor mentioned above:</p><p><a href="https://cefboud.github.io/assets/arithmetic-coding.png"><img src="https://cefboud.github.io/assets/arithmetic-coding.png" alt="alt text" loading="lazy"/></a></p><p>At the third step, once we have encoded <code>ac</code>, the interval is expanded and subdivided according to the probabilities. The entire interval now represents the sequence <code>ac</code>, but each subinterval corresponds to one of the next possible values. So, if the next value is <code>a</code>, resulting in the sequence <code>aca</code>, we need to pick from the first subinterval for <code>a</code>, the second for <code>b</code>, and the third for <code>c</code>.</p><p>You might think that this technique is impractical for encoding long sequences, as the interval keeps getting smaller, potentially leading to a fractional part with hundreds, thousands, or even millions of bits. This is, of course, impossible to handle because computers can only work with a limited precision. While it might be possible to represent a number with a million digits in its fractional part using clever techniques (such as a linked list), it would be highly impractical.</p><p>So, what’s the point of arithmetic coding? Have we been wasting our time with it? Luckily, no. There are renormalization techniques that <em>truncate</em> our numbers while ensuring correctness. This allows us to always operate within 16, 32, or 64 bits.</p><h3 id="fse-finite-state-entropy"><span>FSE: Finite State Entropy</span><a href="#fse-finite-state-entropy"><i></i></a></h3><p>Arithmetic encoding requires a lot of multiplication, rounding, and division at the symbol level, making it CPU-intensive-unlike Huffman encoding. This makes arithmetic encoding impractical for large amounts of data.</p><p>ZSTD uses a technique called Finite State Encoding, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems">Asymmetric Numeral Systems</a>, which builds on the ideas of arithmetic encoding but offers better computational efficiency.</p><p>FSE and ANS are quite involved and complex. For the brave of heart, the author of ANS has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5PeBBQw190">YouTube video explaining it</a>. Here is also a <a href="https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2013/12/finite-state-entropy-new-breed-of.html">blog post</a> by none other than Yann, the creator of ZSTD, introducing FSE.</p><h3 id="trainable-dictionaries"><span>Trainable Dictionaries</span><a href="#trainable-dictionaries"><i></i></a></h3><p>One very cool feature of ZSTD is the ability to train dictionaries from a set of files. Dictionaries are simply common patterns, keywords, or other repetitive sequences found in the files. The compressor then looks up matches from these dictionaries instead of using backreferences.</p><p>Quote from the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/programs/zstd.1.md">Github repository</a>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

It&#39;s possible to train zstd with a set of samples, the result of which is saved into a file called a dictionary. 
Then, during compression and decompression, reference the same dictionary, using command -D dictionaryFileName. 
Compression of small files similar to the sample set will be greatly improved.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>So if we are compressing a specific kind of data say some form of log files, we can train a dictionary and hit the ground running using it.</p><p>Compression is truly a fascinating field. It’s about stripping data of redundancies, reducing entropy, and extracting information. One interesting idea is that, at their core, AI models are nothing more than compression models that take the corpus of data humanity has and boil it down to a set of weights.</p></div></div>
