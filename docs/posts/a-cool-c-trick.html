    <h1>A Cool C Trick</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I sinned. In my last two blog posts on Carp, in which I talked about <a href="http://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_C_%28as_of_2017%29.html">Carp and C interop</a> and <a href="http://blog.veitheller.de/Adding_format_strings_to_Carp.html">Carp’s format strings</a>, I committed the same error twice. Finally someone on Reddit’s wonderful <a href="https://reddit.com/r/programminglanguages">r/programminglanguages</a> pointed me to a fix, and I want to share it with you. I’m sure most of the C programmers that read this blog already know of it, but I still want to document this bit of behaviour, because it’s useful, and it was new to me.</p>
<h2 id="generating-cruft">Generating cruft</h2>
<p>In both of the blog posts linked to above, we implemented the <code>str</code> interface for our types. This more often than not involves writing C, especially when we want to implement the interface for types defined in C.</p>
<p>In both of the implementations presented in the blog posts, I allocate too many bytes. This is justified in two distinct ways: in one of the blog posts I explain how to interface C and Carp, and the function is thus described as “good enough”; in the other I explicitly ask for “atonement” and ask people to fix it for me.</p>
<pre><code>string Int_format(string* str, int x) {
    int n = strlen(*str) + 32;
    char *buffer = CARP_MALLOC(n+1);
    snprintf(buffer, n+1, *str, x);
    return buffer;
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="thank-you-reddit">Thank you, Reddit</h2>
<p>A redditor known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/basic-gongfu">u/basic-gongfu</a>—the creator of the <a href="https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cixl">cixl</a> programming language, as it happens—gave me something much more useful: pointers on how to fix it.</p>
<p>He told me that <code>snprintf</code> has a bit of useful behaviour: if you pass it a <code>NULL</code> pointer and <code>0</code> as the first two arguments, it will return the number of bytes that <em>would be</em> needed if we wanted to hold the full string. Without the <code>0</code> byte at the end, because C was made to infuriate you<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This means we can fix the code from Figure 1! Here is an illustration of the principle and how to apply it:</p>
<pre><code>string Int_format(string* str, int x) {
    int n = snprint(NULL, 0, *str, x);
    char *buffer = CARP_MALLOC(n+1);
    snprintf(buffer, n+1, *str, x);
    return buffer;
}</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: Figure 1, fixed.
</p>
<p>The only thing that has changed is the second line, where we replaced the brittle <code>strlen</code> and constant-based version with a call to <code>snprintf</code>. This helps us in two ways: it is less brittle, relying solely on a library function to work, and it will not allocate garbage but instead enables us to allocate exactly as much memory as we need.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>I want to thank basic-gongfu profusely for making me aware of this bit of behaviour. We’ve <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/pull/172">incorporated</a> it into Carp already, removing a bug that has been on our radar for a while and Carp’s memory footprint in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>I’d like to think that, once again, being upfront about the shortcomings of my code has helped in getting feedback and help. Of course this fix is not largely attributable to me, but I do think that an honest way of communicating the state of your projects helps people find a way to voice their concerns and help make your creations better with their experience.</p>
<p>And you get to learn cool stuff in the process, so that’s nice.</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> This tip isn’t explicitly documented in the piece of <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/snprintf/">official documentation</a> that I looked at, and I would’ve likely lacked the imagination to use <code>snprintf</code> like that myself.</p>
