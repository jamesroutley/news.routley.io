    <h1>I&#39;ll pass on your zoom call</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="campaign">
    <div><p>In 2026, there are some amazing programs
being made by genius coders,
who are happy to hand out their code for free
so that people can be sure of their security.</p>
<p>One such program is <a href="https://jitsi.org">Jitsi</a> -
their biggest offense in my book is their name,
which is hard to say is or is not really offensive.</p>
<p>This group of coders made all good decisions.
One, they open-sourced their code
so that people can be sure of their security.</p>
<p>Using the in-browser model
familiar to anyone who has used Google Meet,
you can be sure that you are able to manage the permissions
that the app is asking for from your machine;
microphone, sure! camera, maybe another day. files, hell no!
Because you already are using a browser now,
you know you can be on any call in a couple quick clicks.</p>
<p>People say Zoom is secure, but nobody knows this!
Any app that claims to be end-to-end encrypted
needs to share their code if they aim for their claim to be credible.
In 2025, the rulebook changed in many crucial places;
if we are unable to rely on our health insurance companies
to keep our records secure,
who seriously imagines that unimaginably young,
unimaginably rich coders are going to handle the vault keys properly?</p>
<p>...and, they don&#39;t even claim to!
Reading through their policies,
you only have to go a few paragraphs before you see
that they group their users into two camps;
their super-special paying organizations,
which have the threat of legal action on their side,
and the large mass of casual users,
who share reunions, medical discussions,
holiday celebrations, and phone sex.</p>
<p>Coders are creeps!</p>
<p>Yes, I am also a creep. Of course I am! I code online!
And I know precisely how much I could access if I cared to look.
The difference is that I&#39;m a smidge more scientific,
much more self-obsessed,
and uphold a really unique philosophy
around commercial success.</p>
<p>To me, success in 2026 is being able to keep a goddamn secret!
Is being able to choose which business you share,
and which you share with specific people!</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going to pass on your creepy-ass Zoom calls!
If there&#39;s one that I really need to be on,
I&#39;m going to spin up a VM on my computer
so that it has no idea of the other files laying around,
such as my <code>~/passcodes.csv</code>.
If you are such a negligent bullhead as to get me onto your call,
you&#39;ll be unable to see me because my VM cannot access my camera!
By design! Same for my microphone,
so I&#39;ll plug in a USB mic if I really need to speak up.
More likely than not though, I&#39;m exhausted by now.
I&#39;ll spend the full duration of the call eeking a small echo of pleasure
from the continuation of this rambling alarm,
for your sheepish audience to rub their enablist shame in.</p>
<p>And if we&#39;re really lucky,
we&#39;ll still have something to talk about by the end,
so I&#39;ll follow along to your marginally-less harmful
Slack or Discord channels, where I&#39;ll keep.
name. dropping. <a href="https://jitsi.org">Jitsi</a>.</p>
<p>Please remember that our holier-than-health Zoom
took the world by storm in the middle of a panicked response
to an airborne toxic event!</p>
<p>No one read the conditions back then,
and those conditions have changed
on numerous occasions - each - year - since then.</p>
<p><a href="https://tosdr.org/en/service/2198">Here&#39;s where those conditions are now, according to ToS;DR.</a>
There are so many angry red data horrors
that the following green &#34;You maintain ownership of your data&#34;
is seriously the most disrespectful sentence I have ever come across.
That&#39;s so goddamnfuckingbumasshurt meaningless!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some big ones:</p>
