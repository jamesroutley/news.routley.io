When people do acknowledge the warts of startup culture, they are often only included as part of a dramatic narrative that sweetens a triumphant conclusion. This is an honest (as honest as I can be) rendition of my failed company, and the motivations to why I killed it.</p><p>I started working on a startup with one of my best friends right at the start of the pandemic. The pandemic helped the stars align. Before this, I had been working on a cryptocurrency project called &#34;Saito&#34; while living in Beijing. Saito had all the qualities of an early stage startup environment. I lived in an apartment which also functioned as our company office. My roommate was also my boss and cofounder of the project. I had a fantastic few years travelling and working across Asia, but when the pandemic hit I started to get worried about Canada closing the borders on me for an indefinite period of time. Once the virus started to take off in Italy, Iran, and South Korea I knew I had to return while I still could.</p><p>By beginning of March 2020, I was back in my home country. No one at this point in the West was really taking the virus all that serious, even myself despite all that I had already seen. I had other things on my mind, such as a close friend of mine, Ryan, hitting me up about his startup idea. Particularly, he was looking for a technical cofounder to help him get his idea off the ground. Even before I was back in the country, I&#39;d been trying to help him find a technical founder to no avail. All the while, however, I was entertaining the notion that I would step into the role myself. I think this started to dawn on him as well, as ours calls started to become less about networking and more about the startup idea itself. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to jump head first with him into the startup world.</p><p>The startup was named &#34;Storied&#34;, and the big idea was to build a new engagement tool for HR professionals which we very marketably branded a &#34;People analytics&#34; platform. Before starting the company, Ryan had been talking with HR professionals about how their tooling could be improved, and felt that there was an opportunity to combine better metrics with engagement data. Kind of like if JIRA met Lattice, where correlations between HR initiatives could be directly tied to employee feedback all in one platform. </p><p>At the beginning, I felt prepared to take on building a company. I felt that working on an early stage startup like Saito had prepared me adequately for what to expect building a startup from scratch. Working on Saito taught me to be scrappy. It taught me the importance of getting a product out quickly then iterating on it through user feedback. However while both Ryan and I knew these abstractly, we didn&#39;t necessarily follow these principles. In the course of a year we had rewritten most of the application from scratch 3 times. We were constantly building new time-intensive features that would never see the light of day. We had talked to hundreds of people, but we were only able to convince one organization to use our product (which we offered to them for free just to have users). An entire year went by and we hadn&#39;t made a single dollar.</p><p>I kept asking myself &#34;What are we doing wrong?&#34;. Our website looked good, our app looked stellar thanks to Ryan&#39;s design skills, and everyone we talked to said that what we were building is awesome (not &#34;awesome&#34; enough to give us any money though). I spent many nights thinking about what it would take to move the needle.</p><p>After the first year passed, things were looking bleak. Our main problem was being unique enough to stand out from the competition. Most HR engagement tools aren&#39;t rocket science. A lot of them are are merely glorified survey builders with slightly better analytics and report building. The market was already saturated with these types of products thus the service we were offering was heavily commoditized. Everybody&#39;s pricing in this space was a race to the bottom, and unfortunately what we had built had only marginal improvements to what was being offered by other platforms.</p><p>The two products that dominated our space were CultureAmp and Lattice. These platforms were already massive when we first started building Storied. Both of them were venture capital supported and had been around for years. They had already extended their services beyond solely employee engagement. They also provided performance and growth tools, which we knew was exactly what our potential customers were looking for. To put it bluntly, we weren&#39;t doing anything novel enough to be able to compete with the big guys.</p><p>After a year in the initial excitement of building a startup had worn off completely. Despite being a two person team, we used Slack for all of our company communication. At this point I hated being on Slack. The only news I got through Slack was either more work that had to be done, or a catastrophic message that something had went wrong, and I had to drop everything to go over there and fix it. Even though we only had one user, it brought with it the pressure of keeping everything running smoothly in production. Any big changes or pivoting becomes significantly more difficult when you have to manage user data. Pretty normal startup software stuff, but with my level of experience I made a lot of mistakes in trying to keep things up and running, and probably shaved a few years off of Ryan&#39;s life due to my sloppiness.</p><p>If you&#39;re thinking to yourself &#34;this sounds awful, why would anyone do this to themselves?&#34;, there is a reason. You fall in love with the extremes. The highs of startup life are extremely tough to beat. In a startup you are always moving from one problem to the next, and these problems are constantly punching you in the mouth. But you&#39;re also throwing a few punches yourself, and when you finally get a punch to connect and you get a win, there&#39;s really no beating that feeling. It&#39;s pure triumph, through your own strength and will you were able to make a tangible impact on the world. You can see a straight correlation between your effort and your achievement. It&#39;s all right there in front of you, and it is uniquely satisfying.</p><p>But there comes a point where the anxiety is constant and the wins are few and far between. Come March of last year, we had maybe 4 months of runway left to work on this full-time before we both would need to find other employment. It was make or break, and spoiler alert, I broke. </p><p>I was a first time CTO without a lot of expertise. I had only one job out of college, which was working on Saito. I had done some internships before in some more traditional companies, the one with the most name recognition easily being Shopify. But beyond that, I don&#39;t have too much to my name. </p><p>I wanted to use Storied to level up my skills even further, but what I had not anticipated was the constant anxiety shipping the product and keeping bugs out of production as a solo developer on top of a break-neck pace of development. The system I had built was, fragile, to say the least. I was constantly in fear of something nuclear happening, then having to go in and fix it before our few customers became irate.</p><p>My perspective changed when I had a change of environment. I went with my girlfriend back to her hometown to visit her parents. I was stressed about my startup (who isn&#39;t), I wasn&#39;t able to relax and enjoy myself over the weekend. But being in a different space allowed me to reflect on my stress instead of just experiencing it. Given that we had a hard deadline in play now, I came to realize that I was more stressed about us possibly succeeding than us failing. I had reached a point where I was actively hoping that we would fail, so that I would have an excuse to move on from our startup and go work on something else. At that point, the worse thing that could happen is that we found more customers, found a way to keep doing what we were doing and keep moving forward. This is obviously a perverse motivation to the success of the company, and for the sake of my co-founder and not subconsciously sabotaging the company, I had to stop working on it and come clean to Ryan.</p><p>Say what you want about quitters, but deciding to quit that startup was one of the best feelings in the world. I was vividly reminded of how good I felt when I made that decision, having just revisited the hiking trail where said decision was made. After the decision, walking around with my girlfriend and her parents was blissful. All of the stress and anxiety that I was carrying trying to make this failing thing work just disappeared. I could be happy, I could be present, I didn&#39;t have to keep fighting anymore. It was a huge weight off of my shoulders. </p><p>Ultimately, the reason that the startup died was because I did not do the due diligence in discerning whether this was a problem that I genuinely wanted to solve with my entire being. That&#39;s the bar for creating a successful startup, you need to find a problem that you&#39;re willing to dedicate yourself entirely to solving.</p><p>I started working on this startup with one of my best friends because I saw his passion in solving this problem, and I wanted the opportunity to build a tech platform that was completely architected and written by me. I wanted to test my skills and see what I was capable of creating. That to me was a fantastic opportunity, and I despite the rest of our failures this venture did accurately assess my skills. I knew where I stood and where I was lacking.</p><p>However, when push comes to shove and you&#39;re debugging something late into the night, your commitment is tested. Your will is formed by how badly you care about the problem, not about how much you love the technology. Unfortunately, my feelings of stress and anxiety about maintaining the venture outweighed how much I cared about the problem I was solving. It left me with no other choice but to kill my startup.</p><p>It&#39;s trite to mention this but it’s true; you do learn a lot about business and yourself running a startup. I learned that for me to invest that level of commitment, I need to be obsessed. Anything else won&#39;t get me through the hard times, to keep going when everything is stacked against you.</p><p>Startups today are sexy. They&#39;re glamorized and intensely fetishized predominantly by people who have never done them (or from people who are looking to massively profit from an endless pool of founders). Take some advice from someone who has done them, you won&#39;t be successful running one if your only desire is to create a startup for the sake of it. When you create a startup, your sole focus should be on the problem you&#39;re solving, and if it isn&#39;t you&#39;re eventually gonna kill your startup just like I did.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
