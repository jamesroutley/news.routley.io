		<h2>Ross Anderson</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/">Ross Anderson</a> unexpectedly passed away <a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2024/03/29/rip-ross-anderson/">Thursday night</a> in, I believe, his home in Cambridge.</p>
<p>I can’t remember when I first met Ross. Of course it was before 2008, when we created the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/security-and-human-behavior-shb-2023.html">Security and Human Behavior</a> workshop. It was well before 2001, when we created the <a href="https://econinfosec.org/">Workshop on Economics and Information Security</a>. (Okay, he created both—I helped.) It was before 1998, when we <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1997/04/the_risks_of_key_rec.html">wrote about</a> the problems with key escrow systems. I was one of the people he brought to the Newton Institute, at Cambridge University, for the six-month cryptography residency program he ran (I mistakenly didn’t stay the whole time)—that was in 1996.</p>
<p>I know I was at the first <a href="https://iacr.org/meetings/fse/">Fast Software Encryption</a> workshop in December 1993, another conference he created. There I presented the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1994/09/description_of_a_new.html">Blowfish</a> encryption algorithm. Pulling an old first-edition of <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Cryptography-Protocols-Algorithms-Source/dp/0471597562">Applied Cryptography</a></i> (the one with the blue cover) down from the shelf, I see his name in the acknowledgments. Which means that sometime in early 1993—probably at Eurocrypt in Lofthus, Norway—I, as an unpublished book author who had only written a couple of crypto articles for <i>Dr. Dobb’s Journal</i>, asked him to read and comment on my book manuscript. And he said yes. Which means I mailed him a paper copy. And he read it. And mailed his handwritten comments back to me. In an envelope with stamps. Because that’s how we did it back then.</p>
<p>I have known Ross for over thirty years, as both a colleague and a friend. He was enthusiastic, brilliant, opinionated, articulate, curmudgeonly, and kind. Pick up any of his academic papers—there are <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/#Research">many</a>—and odds are that you will find a least one unexpected insight. He was a cryptographer and security engineer, but also very much a generalist. He published on block cipher cryptanalysis in the 1990s, and the security of large-language models last year. He started conferences like nobody’s business. His masterwork book, <i><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">Security Engineering</a></i>—now in its third edition—is as comprehensive a tome on cybersecurity and related topics as you could imagine. (Also note his fifteen-lecture video series on that same page. If you have never heard Ross lecture, you’re in for a treat.) He was the <a href="https://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf">first person</a> to understand that security problems are often actually <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/econsec.html">economic problems</a>. He was the first person to make a lot of those sorts of connections. He fought against surveillance and backdoors, and for academic freedom. He didn’t suffer fools in either government or the corporate world.</p>
<p>He’s listed in the acknowledgments as a reader of every one of my books from <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/beyond-fear/"><i>Beyond Fear</i></a> on. Recently, we’d see each other a couple of times a year: at this or that workshop or event. The last time I saw him was last June, at <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2023/index.htm">SHB 2023</a>, in Pittsburgh. We were having dinner on <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/">Alessandro Acquisti</a>‘s rooftop patio, celebrating another successful workshop. He was going to attend my <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/01/second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy.html">Workshop on Reimagining Democracy</a> in December, but he had to cancel at the last minute. (He sent me the talk he was going to give. I will see about posting it.) The day before he died, we were discussing how to accommodate everyone who registered for this year’s <a href="https://www.schneier.com/shb/2024/">SHB workshop</a>. I learned something from him every single time we talked. And I am not the only one.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to his wife Shireen and his family. We lost him much too soon.</p>
