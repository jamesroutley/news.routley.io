    <h1>Telegram is not safe</h1>
    
    <p>I&#8217;m going to keep this one short. There&#8217;s a war in Ukraine and Russia&#8217;s Iron Curtain is coming back down. In Ukraine people are dying from Russian bullets and missiles. In Russia independent media is being shut down and people are being arrested for having the wrong opinion.</p><p>Secure messaging is more important than ever. Some people who really need safe communications are being misled and using the wrong platform and it could get them arrested or killed.</p><p>Unfortunately a lot of people seem to think <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is a safe encrypted messaging platform. It is not safe. If you are in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine it&#8217;s possible this mistake could get you arrested or killed. People should use <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> or <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> instead. </p><p>Signal and WhatsApp use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol">Signal Protocol</a> to offer true, safe <em>end-to-end</em> encryption. This means, broadly, that your messages are safe as long as your phone is safe<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>. Even employees of Signal and WhatsApp can&#8217;t read your messages. </p><p>Telegram, by contrast, does not use end-to-end encryption by default. Messages are sent to a server where they are stored in plaintext. Anyone with access to Telegram&#8217;s message servers can read your messages. That probably includes lots of Telegram employees. </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1497001286444617746?s=20&amp;t=KSweEBSHOnBOqb_bQlC4Jg&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Telegram is the most popular messenger in urban Ukraine.

The reality is the opposite-TG is by default a cloud database w/ a plaintext copy of every msg everyone has ever sent/recvd. <div class="quoted-tweet"><p><span class="quote-tweet-name">Moxie Marlinspike </span><span class="quote-tweet-username">@moxie</span></p>It's amazing to me that after all this time, almost all media coverage of Telegram still refers to it as an "encrypted messenger." 

Telegram has a lot of compelling features, but in terms of privacy and data collection, there is no worse choice. Here's how it actually works:

1/</div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1497001286444617746?s=20&amp;t=KSweEBSHOnBOqb_bQlC4Jg" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">February 25th 2022</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">4,173</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">12,819</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>But Telegram does everything it can to hide this fact from you. They claim in their marketing materials that &#8220;Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct&#8221; and that &#8220;Telegram keeps your messages safe from hacker attacks.&#8221; </p><p>These claims are not true.</p><p>And here&#8217;s the thing: Telegram is a Russian app. And messages are stored on its servers in plaintext. And even if the Telegram team <em>hate</em> Putin and are true Libertarians they&#8217;re still susceptible to pressure. Some of them will have families in Russia. And so it&#8217;s not only Telegram employees who may have access to your messages. It&#8217;s very possible that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service">FSB</a> also has access.</p><p>The founder of Telegram is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov">Pavel Durov</a>, the founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(service)">VKontakte</a>, Russia&#8217;s Facebook clone. He left Russia years ago, says he&#8217;s a Libertarian, and says that the Russian authorities &#8220;can&#8217;t stand me.&#8221;</p><p>Here&#8217;s what he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706180259/https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/durov-out-for-good-from-vk-com-plans-a-mobile-social-network-outside-russia/">said to TechCrunch</a> when he left VKontakte: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out of Russia and have no plans to go back. Unfortunately, the country is incompatible with internet business at the moment&#8230; I&#8217;m afraid there is no going back, not after I publicly refused to cooperate with the authorities. They can&#8217;t stand me.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I have no idea whether he&#8217;s telling the truth or not. </p><p>But I can&#8217;t, for the life of me, understand why he wouldn&#8217;t make proper end-to-end encryption Telegram&#8217;s default mode. If he&#8217;s really a Libertarian cyberpunk who hates Putin&#8230; why <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> he do this? </p><p>There&#8217;s a very long history of governments coopting private companies for communications intelligence purposes. In 1919 the American Black Chamber had a <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2015/12/16/the-black-chamber">deal with Western Union</a> to read any interesting telegrams it wanted. The NSA and Microsoft <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/">collaborated to put a backdoor</a> in key encryption technology in Windows. </p><p>More recently, the National Security Agency and AT&amp;T <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/06/25/att-internet-nsa-spy-hubs/">collaborated to monitor internet traffic</a> at eight locations around the United States. </p><p>Governments have been doing this for centuries. It would be crazy to think Russia wouldn&#8217;t at least try to do this with Telegram. </p><p>So, look, maybe Pavel hates Putin and deplores the invasion of Ukraine. Who knows. He may be a legitimately great guy. </p><p>All I know is that if anyone at Telegram with access to their message databases is compromised &#8212; in any way &#8212; then your messages aren&#8217;t safe. And that isn&#8217;t a risk worth taking when perfectly good alternatives exist. </p><p>Tell your friends and family.</p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>If you backup your messages to iCloud or Google Drive you need to <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-turn-on-and-turn-off-end-to-end-encrypted-backup/?lang=en">turn on End-to-End Encrypted Backup</a> in order to keep your messages safe on those platforms.</p></div></div>
