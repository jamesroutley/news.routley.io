<p>On Jan 14th <a href="https://proton.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Proton</a> sent out an email newsletter with the subject line:</p><blockquote><p>Introducing Projects - Try Lumo’s powerful new feature now</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/lumo-spam.avif" alt="screenshot of the official email from @lumo.proton.me" width="515" height="367" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-f8a652e2"/><p popover="" id="--alt-f8a652e2" data-anchor="--img-f8a652e2">screenshot of the official email from @lumo.proton.me</p></figure><p>Lumo is Proton’s <glossary-term id="--term-ai"><a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“AI”</a></glossary-term> offering.</p><p>There is a problem with this email. And I’m not talking about the question of how exactly AI aligns with Proton’s core values of <em>privacy</em> and <em>security</em>.</p><p>The problem is I had already <strong>explicitly</strong> opted out of Lumo emails.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/lumo-opt-out.avif" alt="screenshot of an unchecked toggle" width="235" height="55" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-d9cc8beb"/><p popover="" id="--alt-d9cc8beb" data-anchor="--img-d9cc8beb">screenshot of an unchecked toggle</p></figure><p>That toggle for “Lumo product updates” is unchecked. Lumo is the only topic I’m not subscribed to. Proton has over a dozen newsletters, including some crypto nonsense. I opt-in to everything but Lumo, I gave an undeniable <strong>no</strong> to Lumo emails.</p><p>So the email I received from Proton is <strong>spam</strong>, right?</p><p>My understanding is that spam is a violation of GDPR and UK data protection laws. Regardless, Proton’s email is a clear abuse of their own service towards a paying business customer.</p><p>Before I grab my pitchfork I emailed Proton support.</p><h2 id="proton-support">Proton Support</h2><p>Despite the subject line and contents, and despite the “From Lumo” name and <code>@lumo.proton.me</code> address, maybe this was an honest mistake?</p><p>Proton’s first reply explained how to opt-out.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/proton-support-1.avif" alt="screenshot of support email quoted below" width="460" height="614" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-c8d2e805"/><p popover="" id="--alt-c8d2e805" data-anchor="--img-c8d2e805">screenshot of support email quoted below</p><figcaption>I’ve blurred the name because whatever</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Hello David,</p><p>Thank you for contacting us.</p><p>You can unsubscribe from the newsletters if you do the following:</p><p>- Log in to your account at https://account.protonvpn.com/login</p><p>- Navigate to the Account category</p><p>- Disable the check-marks under “Email subscriptions”</p><p>- If you need additional assistance, let me know.</p><p>[screenshot of the same opt-out toggle]</p><p>-Have a nice day.</p></blockquote><p><em>John Support</em> directs me to the exact same <em>“Lumo product updates”</em> toggle I had already unchecked. I replied explaining that I had <strong>already</strong> opted out. Support replies saying they’re <em>“checking this with the team”</em> then later replies again asking for screenshots.</p><blockquote><p>Can you make sure to send me a screenshot of this newsletter option disabled, as well as the date when the last message was sent to you regarding the Lumo offer?</p><p>You can send me a screenshot of the whole message, including the date.</p><p>Is it perhaps 14 January 2026 that you received the message?</p></blockquote><p>I found that last line curious, are they dealing with other unhappy customers? Maybe I’m reading too much into it.</p><p>I sent the screenshots and signed off with <em>“Don’t try to pretend this fits into another newsletter category.”</em></p><p>After more <em>“checking this with the team”</em> I got a response today.</p><blockquote><p>In this case, the mentioned newsletter is for promoting Lumo Business Suit to Business-related plans.</p><p>Hence, why you received it, as Product Updates and Email Subscription are two different things.</p><p>In the subscription section, you will see the “Email Subscription” category, where you can disable the newsletter in order to avoid getting it in the future.</p></blockquote><p>If I understand correctly, Proton are claiming this email is the <em>“Proton for Business newsletter”</em>. Not the <em>“Lumo product updates”</em> newsletter.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I think that’s baloney. Proton Support had five full business days to come up with a better excuse. Please tell me, how can I have been any more explicit about opting out of Lumo emails, only to receive “Try Lumo” “From Lumo”, and be told that is not actually a Lumo email?</p><h2 id="non-consent">Non-Consent</h2><p>Has anyone else noticed that the AI industry can’t take “no” for an answer? AI is being force-fed into every corner of tech. It’s unfathomable to them that some of us aren’t interested.</p><p>The entire AI industry is built upon a common principle of non-consent. They laugh in the face of IP and copyright law. AI bots <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DDoS websites</a> and <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lie about user-agents</a>. Can it get worse than the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sickening actions of Grok?</a> I dread to think.</p><p>As Proton has demonstrated above, and <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2026-01-12T07:49Z/">Mozilla/Firefox</a> recently too, the AI industry simply will not accept “no” as an answer. Some examples like spam are more trivial than others, but the growing trend is vile and disturbing.</p><p>I do not want your AI.</p><h3 id="update-for-23rd-january">Update for 23rd January</h3><p>I guess someone at Microsoft read my post and said “hold my beer”. This morning I woke up to a lovely gift in my inbox; <em>“Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK”</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/github-spam.avif" alt="GitHub email subject line: &#39;Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK&#39;" width="474" height="68" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-b61aec8e"/><p popover="" id="--alt-b61aec8e" data-anchor="--img-b61aec8e">GitHub email subject line: &#39;Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK&#39;</p></figure><p><a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/08/11/github-ensloppification/">GitHub Ensloppification</a> is moving faster than I can delete my account for good. (It’s an unfortunate requirement for client projects.) For the record, I have <em>never</em> said “yes” to any GitHub newsletter. Even before Copilot I disabled every possible GitHub email notification.</p><p>The “Unsubscribe” link provides the hidden newsletter list. There is nothing within GitHub account settings I can find to disable spam.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/github-newsletters.avif" alt="GitHub &#39;Opt-Out Preferences&#39; with 3 newsletters unchecked but GitHub Copilot emails checked" width="524" height="814" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-c9841fd3"/><p popover="" id="--alt-c9841fd3" data-anchor="--img-c9841fd3">GitHub &#39;Opt-Out Preferences&#39; with 3 newsletters unchecked but GitHub Copilot emails checked</p></figure><p>As expected, Microsoft has opted me in without my consent. The wheels are falling off at GitHub. The brutally slow front-end UI. The embarrassingly lacklustre <em>Actions</em> CI. Now this sloppy tripe everywhere. Reminder to developers: <strong>GitHub is not Git.</strong></p>
