But events such as the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01056-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01056-5" data-track-category="body text link">detention and deportation of international scholars</a> are pushing some academic societies and institutes to rethink where they hold their meetings.</p><p>One of those is the International Society for Research on Aggression (ISRA), which announced last month that it would relocate its 2026 meeting from New Jersey to St. Catharines, Canada, after a survey of its members suggested that many international researchers would not attend a US meeting.</p><p>“It was clear to us that, if we held a meeting in the US, based on the feedback we received, that we might not get enough people to register,” says Dominic Parrott, a clinical psychologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, and ISRA’s president-elect. “We wanted to make sure that we were going to get our members and non-members from many different parts of the world, because that makes the best meeting and helps produce the best science.”</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/jcjhabjhgi" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01636-5/d41586-025-01636-5_50683482.jpg"/><p>How Trump 2.0 is reshaping science</p></a></article><p>Organizers of the International Conference on Comparative Cognition have made a similar call. Its 33rd annual conference next year will take place outside the United States for the first time in the society’s history, in Montreal, Canada. “It was really a difficult decision for us,” says Caroline Strang, one of the conference organizers and a psychologist at Western University in London, Canada. “With things as unpredictable as they felt at the time and still feel, it’s a decision we made that allows as many of our attendees to come as possible.”</p><p>The Northwest Cognition &amp; Memory (NOWCAM) meeting relocated its meeting earlier this month from Western Washington University in Bellingham to Victoria, Canada.</p><p>Stephen Lindsay, a psychologist at the University of Victoria, one of the meeting’s organizers, says that most attendees are students in Canada. “I was concerned that many of them would decide not to attend NOWCAM if doing so entailed crossing the border,” he tells <i>Nature</i>. This is a choice he has had to make himself. “I plan to avoid travel to the US until relations improve, even though that means forgoing important annual conferences such as the annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society [in Denver, Colorado, in November], which I have rarely missed over the last 39 years.”</p><h2>Cancelled plans</h2><p>Other US meetings have been postponed, or cancelled altogether, because of similar or related concerns.
