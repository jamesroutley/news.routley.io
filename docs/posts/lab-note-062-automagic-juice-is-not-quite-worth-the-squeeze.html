            <p>I made good progress on the reactive engine. </p><ul><li>Simplified the requirements for define a handler. </li><li>Started work on the scheduler</li><li>No longer need to handler to ability type checking method, by converting from protocols into abstract base classes. This was one example of where AI lead me astray.</li></ul><p>I also experimented with dynamically generating the effect description dataclasses, while appeasing the static type checker. A friend suggested trying <a href="https://www.codebuff.com/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">codebuff</a> to generate a possible solution for me. Ultimately I didn&#39;t take its suggestions. For now, the juice isn&#39;t worth the squeeze. Getting rid of that boilerplate is a little auto-magical. However, it was valuable to get a prototype from the code gen as it mentioned that it didn&#39;t take in to account generics and other type edge cases. </p><p>I finished out the latter part of the ELT for the Zig doc RAG pipeline as a sample application. After reorganizing, I found other quality of life issues.</p><ul><li>handlers that use other handlers is clunky. You have to call <code>yield from (yield Some Effect)</code></li><li>setting up the schema for a relational db is important, but not even the thing you want to be doing when you&#39;re getting started.</li><li>need to have some system to easily set up environment configurations.</li></ul><p>I also attended <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">HYTRABOI 2025</a>, which was interesting. My favorite talk this year was Thomas Ballinger&#39;s <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/f99f35fa-6b26-45a3-a4b2-37801fdefeff-database-ideas-in-convex?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Database Ideas in Convex</a>. In the middle of the conference, suddenly interjectedfuture.com was down! I had run out of space on my persistent volume. Alas, I lost a couple drafts and lab note #61. I&#39;ll need to take some time to figure out this set up. Or really, it might be cheaper (in time) to just pay for the hosted version (!)</p>
