<p>After two years of living in Germany I’m moving back to New York. There isn’t much of an interesting backstory behind the decision. It’s simply one of realizing that the benefits of living in Germany didn’t outweigh the drawbacks- the most significant of them being far away from the family, friends, community, and culture I had access to back in New York.</p>

<p>Germany was a generous host during the time I was there and I’m incredibly grateful for the new perspective it gave me on the world. Spending time outside of New York was good for me. It helped me learn to appreciate what I had back home and what a place like New York could learn from a place like Munich.</p>

<p>This year’s holidays have been a transition phase, a brief interregnum between life in Munich and life back in New York. I haven’t yet had a ton of mental space to reflect on my experience of living abroad, but I at least wanted to jot down some of the things I already know I’m going to miss of Munich.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Alps</strong>. I’ve never lived near mountains before and, wow, those were good mountains. In 45 minutes I could be on a trailhead and hiking into absurdly gorgeous scenery. Hiking was a sport I didn’t know I enjoyed before living in Munich and hope I can continue to explore when I’m back in New York. The Catskills or Adirondacks aren’t the Alps, but they’re still beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>The rail infrastructure</strong>. A common joke in Germany these days is how bad Deutsche Bahn is, and it’s true that it has its fair share of problems.  Even so, it’s a very expansive rail network and, with the Deutschlandticket, it’s incredibly easy to navigate the country without a car. I’ve loved biking into the mountains knowing I have a train to get me back home the same day. Or being able to take a night train up to Amsterdam rather than suffer through flying. Or a high-speed train up to Berlin for the weekend, an 8 hour drive or 3.5 hour train.</p>

<p><strong>Bavarian bike infrastructure</strong>. Munich has good bike infrastructure, but what I was most impressed by was how decent the bike infrastructure was <em>regionally</em>. I could bike from Munich to Salzburg (~160km) and be on a protected bike line, dedicated trail, or low traffic road pretty much the entire way. This was pretty mind-blowing coming from the States, where bike infrastructure is limited to cities and trails that require a car to get to.</p>

<p><strong>The baths</strong>. Munich has some really impressive <a href="https://www.swm.de/english/m-baeder">public pools</a>. My favorite has been <a href="https://www.swm.de/baeder/freibaeder-muenchen/dantebad">Dantebad</a>, an outdoor pool heated to 34°C (~93F) during the winter. It also has a tide pool, a mushroom, and a bunch of bubble tubs. It’s a very fun way to spend an evening with friends and a day-pass is only 10€.</p>

<p><strong>The bread</strong>. German bakeries really are something else. They are everywhere and almost always offer a great loaf of bread for a reasonable price<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Or ready-to-go sandwiches that make for a quick, easy, healthy, and cheap lunch.</p>

<p>After becoming accustomed to having such easy access to bakeries I’m mystified as to why these don’t exist in the United States. We have flour, we have yeast, yet for some reason we choose not to use them and settle instead for heavily processed packaged bread!</p>

<p>And of course, <strong>the friends made along the way</strong>. I’ve been fortunate to have found and built a really great community back in Munich- easily the thing I miss the most. When I first moved I was pretty nervous about how so many people said it was difficult to make friends. Thankfully I’ve found that to be largely unfounded<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. While Munich certainly feels more like a German village than a city, there are plenty of fun and interesting people around if you get out and look for them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I could go on, but these were just a few things that came to mind as I’ve been typing this out. I had a great run back in Germany and it’ll take me a long time to digest how I’ve changed from the experience. I’m excited to start my new old life back in the motherland, this time with a fresh perspective to hopefully help me appreciate what I have here better than I did before I left.</p>
