If I got any benefits from my work, I&#39;m asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That&#39;s the legacy I want: be useful. And please know, I loved you all to the very end.&#34;</p><p><em>This story was updated to add new information.</em></p><p><em>Contributing: Anna Kaufman, USA TODAY</em></p></div></div>
