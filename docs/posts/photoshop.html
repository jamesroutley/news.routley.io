    <p>The touch-up method <em>photoshop</em>, first used as a generic verb in 1992, is named after Adobe’s 1987 image editing software Photoshop. The software, in turn, is likely named for the offset lithography department <em>photoshop</em>, where people would touch up photographs before they went to print.</p>

<p>The word <em>photograph</em> was coined in 1839 by English chemist Sir John Herschel, combining Greek φῶς (phos), meaning “light,” and γραφή (graphê), meaning “drawing”. However, most early photographs were instead called <em>daguerreotypes</em>, after Louis Daguerre’s development of the first practical photography process. Daguerreotypes were ascendant from their invention in 1839 until the development of the less restrictive wet colloidon process in 1851, rarely appearing after 1860.</p>

<p>φῶς is actually a regional form of Ancient Greek φάος (phắos), which can be reconstructed back to PIE bʰéh₂os, also meaning “light”, by comparing it to its relatives like Sanskrit भास् (bhās), meaning “light”.</p>

<p><em>Photoshop</em> was a popular enough topic that the clipping <em>shopped</em> can be found since the early 2000s. You can compare the trend to its genericized contemporary <em>autotune</em>, created in 1997 and popularized in Cher’s 1998 hit “Believe”.</p>
