		<p>In 1995, I had the privilege of serving as the chief 
			
			technical editor of the  Fast Ethernet specification. In that 
			
			capacity, I got to know many of the design  teams working on 
			
			chips to support the standard. The group from Broadcom was  
			
			working particularly hard on an all-digital implementation of 
			
			a subset of Fast  Ethernet called 100BASE-T4 (different from 
			
			the 100BASE-TX version that  ultimately prevailed in the 
			
		market).</p>
<p> Broadcom&#39;s T4 chip contained one of the first all-digital 
			
			adaptive equalizers built for use on a fast serial link. 
			
			Adaptive equalization was necessary in this case because the 
			
			severely limited bandwidth of 100m of fairly low-grade 
			
			Category 3 data wiring filters out all the fast edges in a 
			
			signal, turning a crisp transmitted signal into slush at the 
			
			far end of the cable. A good adaptive equalizer reverses the 
			
			filtering effect of the cable, restoring the received data to 
			
			its normal appearance.</p>
		<p> By 1995, the use of digital adaptive equalization at lower 
			
			speeds was well-established, as in telephone and satellite 
			
			modems. These products used programmable-DSP cores to operate 
			
			at speeds of approximately 100 kbps. In contrast to the 
			
			programmable approach, Broadcom used dedicated digital state 
			
			machines to speed  those same algorithms by a factor of 1000.</p>
		<p> The value of the Broadcom T4 design was its ability to 
			
			work at high speeds on horrible cables. In many cases, you 
			
			could use it on the cables you already had without upgrading. 
			
			To demonstrate the power of what it felt was the world&#39;s best 
			
			chip, Broadcom demonstrated its operation using the world&#39;s 
			
			worst cable. </p>
		<p><img src="https://www.sigcon.com/images/edn/SoGoodPaige.jpg" alt="Paige demonstrates Fast Ethernet on barbed-wire cabling." width="208" height="345"/>
In 1998, Wide-Band Systems demonstrates <em>Gigabit </em>Ethernet 
				running on four pairs of old, rusty barbed wire.</p>

		<p>At Interop that year, Broadcom set up a 2×4-ft glass 
			
			case containing eight parallel strands of barbed wire 
			
			configured as four differential pairs, each running straight 
			
			from side to side, suspended in air. The wires were ugly and 
			
			rusty and had nasty little barbs all over them. A transmitter 
			
			and a reel of Category 3 data cabling were on one side of the 
			
			case. The data cabling led to the glass case where it coupled 
			
			onto the four barbed-wire pairs. The other side of the case 
			
			coupled through more Category 3 cabling to a receiver. </p>
		<p>During the show, lo and behold, Broadcom&#39;s demonstration 
			
			flawlessly conveyed 100 Mbps of data through the barbed wire. 
			
			&#34;Buy our parts&#34; was the message the Broadcom marketing folks 
			
			wanted to impress on their audience. </p>
		<p> I&#39;d like you to receive a different message: Only four 
			
			properties really affect the performance of most digital 
			
			transmission structures. The &#34;big four&#34; transmission-line 
			
			properties are impedance, delay, high-frequency loss, and 
			
			crosstalk. </p>
		<p> Crosstalk in a barbed-wire configuration is controlled by 
			
			enforcing a large spacing between the pairs, as compared with 
			
			the much smaller spacing between the individual wires of each 
			
			pair. The glass case in Broadcom&#39;s demonstration was easily 
			
			large enough to accommodate such spacing, so crosstalk wasn&#39;t 
			
			a problem.</p>
		<p> What about the high-frequency loss? It wasn&#39;t a problem 
			
			either. The T4 system divides its data among the four pairs, 
			
			so that each pair operates at only 25 Mbps. At that low 
			
			frequency the skin-effect resistance of 4 ft of barbed wire 
			
			is insignificant, and the overall high-frequency loss in the 
			
			glass case at 25 Mbps was practically nil.</p>
		<p> The signal delay is <em>less </em> on barbed wire than 
			
			on an equivalent length of PVC-insulated Category 3 wiring, 
			
			due to the use of an air dielectric between the barbed 
			
			strands. This difference in delay was insignificant, however, 
			
			because of the serial nature of the communications 
			
			architecture.</p>
		<p> Finally, if you consider the characteristic impedance, 
			you find that this quantity is just a fixed number, such as 
			
			75 or 150 Ω. For most cables, it varies 
			
			little with 
			frequency of 1 to 100 MHz, but it varies significantly with 
			
			the spacing between 
			the wires. You can intentionally set the spacing to create 
			
			almost any impedance 
			you want. Inside the glass case, the spacing between barbed 
			
			strands was set to 
			create an impedance of 100 Ω, the <em>same 
			
			impedance</em> as in the Category 3 UTP cabling on either side 
			
			of the glass case. Thus, the case introduced no impedance 
			
			discontinuity.</p>
		<p> In summary, the barbed wire had zero impact on signal 
			
			quality. The signals went through perfectly undistorted. The 
			
			only thing the barbed wire did was impress the heck out of 
			
			Broadcom&#39;s customers.</p>
		<p> Next time you look at a transmission line, I hope you&#39;ll 
			
			focus on the big four properties: characteristic impedance, 
			
			high-frequency loss, delay, and crosstalk. These properties 
			
			determine how well a transmission structure functions, 
			
			regardless of the physical appearance or configuration of its 
			
			conductors.  </p>
