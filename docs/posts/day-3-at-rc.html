    <h1>Day 3 at RC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Day 3 was really packed. Here&#39;s a quick summary before I jump in:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started my day by writing down my reflections on day 2 (yesterday&#39;s post).</li>
<li>Pairing session on a 2048 implementation in python.</li>
<li>Heard from a bunch of folks about their plans/advice at RC.</li>
<li>Paired on a LeetCode problem in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Responded to a creative coding prompt in p5js as part of a group.</li>
<li>Paired some more on a neat Pok√©mon image downloader in async rust.</li>
<li>Had a coffee chat with an RC alum to talk about some of our experience in
the programming language sphere.</li>
<li>Had a really interesting discussion about reusing some open source C++ code
to create an LSP implementation in Rust by bridging the gap with <a href="https://cxx.rs">cxx</a>.</li>
<li>Dove into some of the cxx documentation.</li>
<li>Watched the first half of Jon Gjengset&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/9_3krAQtD2k">The What and How of Futures and async/await in Rust</a> video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this post will be some of my thoughts during day 3.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-in-the-morning">Reflecting in the morning</h2>
<p>I think I like this routine of beginning each day by
reflecting on the previous day. So I&#39;m doing it again today!</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t done a great job of writing down these kinds of reflections
professionally. I don&#39;t really know why that is. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not
all that comfortable being vulnerable at my place of work? Regardless, I&#39;d like
to care a lot less about others&#39; perception of me and my work and focus more on
creating things that I&#39;m proud of or excited about. So far writing down some of
my thoughts has really helped clarify how I&#39;m feeling.</p>
<h2 id="2048">2048</h2>
<p>This morning pairing session was great. The dialogue felt pretty good and there was
a nice exchange of thoughts back and forth while producing a good amount of code.
We made a solid amount of progress in a little over an hour and had
a mostly functional version of 2048 playable in the terminal. We planned another
pairing session around wiring up a simple AI to see how well it might perform.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to work on a more in-depth writeup about this at some point in the future.</p>
<h2 id="leetcode">LeetCode</h2>
<p>I really gravitate toward LeetCode-style problems. In some sense, I find it
really satisfying to come up with an efficient solution to a problem. But on
the other hand, I don&#39;t know that spending time on LeetCode is &#34;working at the
edge of my abilities&#34; (one of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">self directives</a> at RC).
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working on competitive coding prompts like Advent of Code,
Codeforces and LeetCode. I&#39;m not the best that I could be -- I certainly don&#39;t crank out
LC hards -- but it&#39;s <em>comfortable</em> for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably try to fight the temptation to spend a lot of time on this style of
programming throughout the rest of my batch.</p>
<h2 id="creative-coding">Creative Coding</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun navigating on a creative coding prompt. We built an interactive
scene where an emoji person was trying to decide on which outfit to wear. It was
a great reminder that programming doesn&#39;t have to be serious. I think these
sessions will be especially good as a foil for solving really complex technical
challenges. I&#39;ve historically leaned on playing trumpet for this kind of release.
But when I really want to focus on growing as a programmer for a few months,
creative coding sessions with a group of folks seems pretty great.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier post that I struggle with some of the improvisational
skills that are sometimes called upon for activities like this. The group setting
felt pretty nice and it was a lot of fun to think about ways to structure the
scene we built.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Rust seems to be everywhere. There are a bunch of folks in my batch that seem
really interested in learning Rust which is really exciting.</p>
<p>For a low-level language, Rust has a really compelling feedback loop. Top-notch
developer tooling (at least compared with clangd), built-in testing functionality
and a package management ecosystem that makes it easy to focus on the problem you
want to solve instead of how to repackage an open source library as a Bazel library
instead of using CMake (I&#39;m not salty at all...).</p>
<p>And the community is fantastic. There are so many resources for learning and most of them are fairly up-to-date. I think C++ is simply
too large of a language for most resources to be broadly applicable. Recently, I have enjoyed
Klaus Iglberger&#39;s CppCon talks on YouTube; and I&#39;m curious about his recently
published book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-software-design/9781098113155/">C++ Software Design</a>.
But it gets really frustrating to see recommendations for pasting over
decades-old language design mistakes by adding yet another keyword or annotation
to your method declaration. Rust corrects a lot of these mistakes and incorporates
better mechanisms for encoding invariants in programs.
In many ways, Rust is now one of the most accessible
languages with explicit memory management: you get best-practices by default
instead of opting into them with a keyword.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll write a lot more about Rust in the coming weeks so I&#39;ll leave it
at that, for now.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time in group activities this week. I think I&#39;m
developing a stronger sense for how I want to spend my time during the rest of
my batch. I definitely want to continue with
these daily reflections. Thanks again for reading!</p>
