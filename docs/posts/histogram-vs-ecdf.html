    <h1>Histogram vs. ECDF</h1>

<p>Accumulation is a fun word.</p>


<p>Histograms are a rightfully popular way to present data like latency, throughput, object size, and so on. Histograms avoid some of the difficulties of picking a summary statistic, or group of statistics, which is <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">hard to do right</a>. I think, though, that there&#39;s nearly always a better choice than histograms: the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF). To understand why, let&#39;s look at an example, starting with the histogram<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_hist_10bucket.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>This latency distribution is very strongly bimodal. It&#39;s the kind of thing you might expect from a two-tiered cache: a local tier with very low latency, and a remote tier with latency in the 2 to 3ms range. Super common in systems and databases. The histogram illustrates that bimodality very well. It&#39;s easy to see that the second mode is somewhere around 2.5ms. The next two questions on my mind would be: <em>how much do these two spikes contribute?</em> and <em>where is the first spike?</em> In histogram form, its hard to answer these questions. The first we&#39;d need to answer by doing some mental area-under-the-curve estimation, and the second is obscured by bucketing.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_ecdf.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the same data in eCDF form. You can think of it as the histogram <em>summed up</em>, or <em>integrated</em>, or <em>accumulated</em><sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>. The first thing you may notice is how easy it has become to see the relative contribution of our first and second mode. The first mode contributes around 70% of measurements. If this is a cache system, we immediately know that our cache hit rate is around 70%. We also know that the 65th percentile is very low, and the 75th is very high. In fact, we can read these percentile<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup> values right off the graph by finding the 0.65 and 0.75 points on the Y axis, moving right until we hit the curve, and reading their value off the X axis. Magic!</p>

<p>The second question, about the location of the first spike, can be answered by zooming in. That works because the eCDF, unlike the histogram, doesn&#39;t require bucketing, so we can zoom around in X and Y as much as we like without changing the shape of the curve. Say, for example, we wanted to look at the tail in more detail. Let&#39;s zoom in on the top right.</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_ecdf_zoomed.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Again, we can easily read off high percentiles from the graph, and don&#39;t have to worry about how changing bucket widths.</p>

<p>I believe that for nearly all purposes in systems design and operations, eCDFs are a better choice than histograms for presenting data to humans.</p>

<p><em>What other cool stuff can eCDFs do?</em>
Another cool thing eCDFs make easy is generating random numbers from a measured distribution. Remember how we could go up the Y axis to find the value of different percentiles? Computers can do that too: generate a random number between 0 and 1, and then &#34;read off&#34; the X axis value. I&#39;ll leave the exercise of doing that efficiently and accurately to the reader.</p>

<p>Just as easy as finding the value of a percentile is finding the percentile of a value. This is less frequently useful in systems, but occasionally it is nice to be able to ask &#34;how much of an outlier is this value?&#34;. For example, say you&#39;re building a filesystem that can only store files less than 1MiB. Take the eCDF of file distributions in the world, find 1MB on the X axis, and the Y value will be the percentage of files your system will be able to store.</p>

<p>It&#39;s trivial to transform an eCDF into a histogram, by bucketing up first differences (f<sub>n+1</sub> - f<sub>n</sub>). You can&#39;t go from the histogram to the eCDF so easily <em>in general</em>, because bucketing loses data.</p>

<p><em>Why do you say eCDF and not just CDF?</em>
At least in my head, the CDF is the <em>true</em> cumulative distribution function of the underlying distribution, and the eCDF is an empirical estimate of it (related by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glivenko%E2%80%93Cantelli_theorem">fundamental theorem of statistics</a>. Whether you feel that&#39;s a useful distinction depends on whether you think there is an underlying distribution that&#39;s exists separately from our measurements of it (and whether you still think that in the face of the non-stationarity of nearly all systems).</p>

<p><em>Isn&#39;t a histogram a data structure and not a graph?</em>
Some folks use <em>histogram</em> to mean the graph (as I do above), and some folks use it to mean a data structure designed for summarizing a stream of values. There are many flavors of these, but most have a set of buckets (exponentially spaced is common) and sum into the buckets. The &#34;real&#34; eCDF is calculated directly from the samples themselves without bucketing, but can also be estimated from these histograms-as-data-structures. If you&#39;re summarizing your data using one of these data structures, it&#39;s nice to store as many buckets as feasible (and indeed many more than you&#39;d show a human).</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> I use <em>histogram</em> to also cover <em>frequency polygon</em> here, because most people don&#39;t recognize the distinction. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a particularly useful distinction anyway. You also might say ePDF.</li>
<li><a name="foot2"></a> It is, after all, the <em>cumulative</em> distribution function. It&#39;s nice when things say what they are.</li>
<li><a name="foot3"></a> I say <em>percentile</em> here, but this is true for all quantiles. You can read off the quartiles, deciles, quintiles, heptiles, etc right off the graph in the same way.</li>
