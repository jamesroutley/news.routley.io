    <h1>Framework Laptop 13 gets ARM processor with 12 cores via upgrade kit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Additionally, there’s an ARM Immortalis-G720 GPU with ten cores and an AI accelerator with a performance of 30 TOPS. This chipset is likely slower than the Snapdragon X Elite or a current flagship smartphone chip, but it should still provide enough performance for many everyday tasks. Either way, this mainboard upgrade might only be interesting for developers for the most part, because <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/11/11/500-minisforum-ms-r1-arm-linux-ai-mini-pc-features-cix-cp8180-12-core-soc-up-to-64gb-lpddr5x/" target="_blank">early tests</a> show that the SoC already draws about 16 watts at idle, which means battery life will likely be fairly short when combined with the 55Wh battery of the Framework Laptop 13.
