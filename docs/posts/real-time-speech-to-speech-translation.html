    <h1>Ask HN: Real-time speech-to-speech translation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Has anyone had any luck with a free, offline, open-source, real-time speech-to-speech translation app on under-powered devices (i.e., older smart phones)?</p><p>* https://github.com/ictnlp/StreamSpeech</p><p>* https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx</p><p>* https://github.com/openai/whisper</p><p>I&#39;m looking for a simple app that can listen for English, translate into Korean (and other languages), then perform speech synthesis on the translation. Basically, a Babelfish that doesn&#39;t stick in the ear. Although real-time would be great, a max 5-second delay is manageable.</p><p>RTranslator is awkward (couldn&#39;t get it to perform speech-to-speech using a single phone). 3PO sprouts errors like dandelions and requires an online connection.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p></div></div></div>
