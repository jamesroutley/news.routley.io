<p>We&#39;re seeking feedback about this tour--we&#39;d love to hear from you about what you thought about it at <a href="https://mused.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a020f0606052a071f190f0e4405180d"><span data-cfemail="5f373a3333301f322a2c3a3b71302d38">[emailÂ protected]</span></a></p>
<p>There are many people to thank for the creation of this virtual tour. I&#39;m going to be building the list and improving the credits here and reworking the way that the credits are featured.</p>
<p>Most importantly thank you so much to the Egyptian teams that I worked with on site at the Valley of the Kings, and best of luck with the new excavation season! </p>
<p>Thanks so much also to the Egyptologists that helped me verify the accuracy of the information provided and the bibliographies for my research. I&#39;m particularly indebted to OsirisNet and the Theban Mapping Project in this area.</p>
<p>The scribe statue for Paramessu is just a stand-in borrowed from Doctor Peter Der Manuelian&#39;s Sketchfab. It will be replaced soon!</p>
<p>More details and improvements, bug fixes, credit lines, etc are coming.</p>
