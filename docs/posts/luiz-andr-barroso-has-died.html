    <h1>Luiz André Barroso has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Pioneer of Google’s Data Centers Dies at 58" data-elid="2666322744" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-memoriam-nov-2023" data-authors="Amanda Davis" data-page-title="Pioneer of Google’s Data Centers Dies at 58 - IEEE Spectrum"><div><p><strong>Luiz André Barroso</strong></p><p>Data center pioneer</p><p>Senior member, 59; died 16 September</p><p>An engineer at <a href="https://about.google/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a> for more than 20 years, Barroso is credited with designing the company’s warehouse-size data centers. They house hundreds of thousands of computer servers and disk drives and have brought cloud computing, more powerful search engines, and faster Internet service. He died unexpectedly of natural causes. </p><p>Barroso was born in Brazil and earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 1989 in electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/english/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro</a>. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in computer engineering in 1996 from the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>.</p><p>In 1995 he joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102750386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Research Laboratory</a>, in Palo Alto, Calif., as a researcher specializing in microprocessor design. While there, he investigated how to build hardware to run more modern business applications and Web services. Three years later, the company was acquired by <a href="https://www.compaq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Compaq</a> and his project was terminated.</p><p>He left Compaq in 2001 to join <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a> in Mountain View, Calif., as a software engineer.</p><p>The company housed its servers at leased space in third-party data centers, which were basically cages in which a few racks of computing equipment were placed. As Google’s business expanded, its need for infrastructure increased. In 2004 Barroso was tasked with investigating ways to build more efficient data centers.</p><p>He devised a way to use low-cost components and energy-saving techniques to distribute Google’s programs across thousands of servers, instead of the traditional method of relying on a few powerful, expensive machines.</p><p>The company’s first data center designed by Barroso opened in 2006 in The Dalles, Ore. It implemented fault-tolerance software and hardware infrastructure to make the servers less prone to disruption. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> now has 35 data centers in 10 countries, all drawing from Barroso’s groundbreaking techniques.</p><p>In 2009 Barroso co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacenter-Computer-Introduction-Warehouse-Scale-Architecture/dp/159829556X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Data Center as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines</em></a>, a seminal textbook.</p><p>He also led the team that designed Google’s AI chips, known as tensor processing units or TPUs, which accelerated machine-learning workloads. He helped integrate augmented reality and machine learning into Google Maps.</p><p>At the time of his death, Barroso was a Google Fellow, the company’s highest rank for technical staff.</p><p>He also was an executive sponsor of the company’s Hispanic and Latinx employee group and oversaw a program that awarded fellowships to doctoral students in Latin America.</p><p>For his contributions to computing architecture, he received the 2020 <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/barroso_UJ31885" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eckert-Mauchly Award</a>, an honor given jointly by IEEE and the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association for Computer Machinery</a>.</p><p>He was a Fellow of the ACM and the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.</p><p>He served on the board of <a href="https://www.rainforesttrust.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rainforest Trust</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting tropical lands and conserving threatened wildlife. Just weeks before he died, Barroso organized and led a weeklong trip to Brazil’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pantanal</a> wetlands.</p><p>Read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-visionary-designer-behind-googles-warehousescale-data-centers" target="_self"><em>The Institute’s</em> 2020 profile</a> of him to learn more about his career journey.</p><p><strong>Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao</strong></p><p>Former director of the Indian Statistical Institute </p><p>Honorary member, 102; died 23 August</p><p>Rao was onetime director of the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indian Statistical Institute</a>, in Kolkata. The pioneering mathematician and statistician spent more than four decades at the organization, where he discovered two seminal estimators: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cramér–Rao bound</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rao–Blackwell theorem</a>. The two estimators—rules for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data—provided the basis for much of modern statistics.</p><p>For his discoveries, Rao received the 2023 <a href="https://statprize.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Prize in Statistics</a>. The award is presented every two years to an individual or team for “major achievements using statistics to advance science, technology, and human welfare.” </p><p>Rao began his career in 1943 as a technical apprentice at the Indian Statistical Institute. He was promoted the following year to superintending statistician. Two years later, he published a paper in the <a href="https://www.calmathsociety.co.in/cmsPublications.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society</em></a>, demonstrating two fundamental statistical concepts still heavily used in the field today. The Cramér-Rao bound helps statisticians determine the quality of any estimation method. The Rao-Blackwell theorem provides a means for optimizing estimates. </p><p>Rao’s work formed the basis of information geometry, an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics.</p><p>Rao was a professor at the ISI’s research and training school before being promoted to director in 1964—a position he held for 12 years.</p><p>He moved to the United States in the 1980s to join the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a> as a professor of mathematics and statistics. He left Pittsburgh eight years later to teach at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a> in State College, where in 2001 he became director of its multivariate analysis center. Multivariate statistics are data analysis procedures that simultaneously consider more than two variables.</p><p>After nine years at Penn State he moved to New York, where he was a research professor at the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Buffalo</a> until shortly before he died.</p><p>Rao authored more than 14 books and 400 journal articles during his career. He received several awards for his lifetime contributions, including 38 honorary doctoral degrees from universities in 19 countries.</p><p>In 2010 he was honored with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Science_Award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Science Award</a>, the highest honor given by the government of India in the scientific sector. He received the 2002 U.S. <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/od/honorary-awards/national-medal-of-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Medal of Science</a>, the country’s highest award for lifetime achievement in scientific research.</p><p>He was nominated in 2013 for a <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-peace-prizes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his contributions to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-642-04898-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science</a>. Last year he was named an <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-honorary-membership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">honorary member</a> of IEEE. </p><p>Rao received a master’s degree in mathematics in 1940 from <a href="https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andhra University</a>, in Visakhapatnam. Three years later he earned a master’s degree in statistics from the <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Calcutta</a>. He went on to receive a Ph.D. in statistics from <a href="https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">King’s College Cambridge</a> in 1945 and a doctor of science degree from the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> in 1965.</p><p><strong>Herbert William Zwack</strong></p><p>Former U.S. Naval Research Laboratory associate superintendent </p><p>Life member, 88; died 14 March</p><p>Zwack led electronic warfare research programs at the U.S. <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naval Research Laboratory</a>, in Washington, D.C., where he worked for more than two decades. </p><p>After receiving a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1955 from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York University Tandon School of Engineering</a>), in New York City, he joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazeltine_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazeltine</a> (now <a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BAE Systems</a>).
