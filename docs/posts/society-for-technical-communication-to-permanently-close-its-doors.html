    <h1>Society for Technical Communication to permanently close its doors</h1>

			<p>Dear Members, Stakeholders, and Friends,</p>
<p>Despite significant efforts over the past several years by the various Boards of Directors and STC leadership, financial liabilities coupled with falling membership numbers have created a situation where we are not able to offer the education, resources, and outreach that this membership expects and deserves. Various cost-cutting measures and attempts to generate revenue have not been sufficient, and our debt and operational expenses now outweigh our ongoing revenue.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive look at finances and extensive research and discussion with the organization’s legal counsel, we have decided to dissolve the organization. The Board approved a motion to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy and secured a bankruptcy attorney to draft the required paperwork and submit it to the court on STC’s behalf.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, STC will permanently close its doors and cease all activities. This includes, but is not limited to, membership renewals and new member applications, elections, education programs (including conferences), certification courses and exams, committee and subcommittee activities, recognitions, awards, competitions, publications, and financial activities. This also applies to all Chapter, Special Interest Group (SIG) and Community of Interest (COI) activities including, but not limited to, events (virtual and in-person), activities, elections, council meetings, and all financial transactions.</p>
<p>Community and chapter leaders will receive further communication on closure activities directly from the bankruptcy trustee once assigned. The trustee will also provide direction to those owed money from the organization. We will update the <a href="https://www.stc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-link-type="web">STC.org</a> website to reflect these communications.</p>
<p>Questions will be collected at <a href="mailto:info@stc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@stc.org</a> and shared with the trustee.</p>
<p>Shuttering an organization as old as ours is painful. So many of us are deeply invested in STC. Thank you for advancing the profession with us.</p>
<p>With sincere appreciation,</p>

<p>STC Board of Directors</p>
<p>STC Executive Director Tim Shaw</p>
