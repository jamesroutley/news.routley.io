            <span>Abstract:</span>  The report of synthesis of modified Lead apatite (LK-99) with evidence of
superconductivity at more than boiling water temperature has steered the whole
scientific community. There have been several failures to reproduce
superconductivity in LK-99 including partial successes. Here, we have continued
our efforts to synthesize phase pure LK-99 with improved precursors. The
process has been followed as suggested by Sukbae Lee et. al., [1,2]. The phase
purity of each precursor is evidenced by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
well fitted by Rietveld refinement. The PXRD confirms the synthesis of phase
pure polycrystalline LK-99 with apatite structure. The freshly synthesized
sample does not show any signature of superconductivity levitation on a magnet
(diamagnetism). The magnetization measurements on SQUID also show that LK-99 is
diamagnetic at 280 K, there is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room
temperature. Moreover, we have also performed first principle calculations to
investigate the electronic band structure of the LK-99 near Fermi level. Our
study verifies that the Cu doped lead apatite (LK-99) has bands crossing at
Fermi level, indicating generation of strong correlation in the system.
