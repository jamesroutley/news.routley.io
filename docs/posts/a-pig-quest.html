<p>My name is Frank Further. Further... It’s kind of ironic, come to think of it, as I’ve never left my village. Neither had my dad and his dad before him. It’s the same for everyone in our land since our four statues of wellness were stolen one night moons ago. Everyone seems to be cursed with numbness, immobility and indifference. Adventure, curiosity, audacity and courage are words that have disappeared from our vocabulary. </p>
<p> I was born in Porkville and, as sure as the gods made little green apples, I know I’m going to die in Porkville. Without ever leaving the valley. Oh, don’t get me wrong. It’s a nice and pleasant lowland with green pastures, fruit trees, wild mushrooms, flowers and a beautiful little pond. </p>
