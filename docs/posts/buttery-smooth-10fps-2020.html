<p>When I am making animations, with the intent of ultimately becoming a GIF file on the internet, I pretty much always target <strong>50 fps</strong>. <code>50fps</code> is currently the highest and <em>most compatible</em> frame rate supported by most modern browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. Currently(<code>Sun 09 Feb 2020 09:01:05 AM PST</code>) these are some of the maximum frame rate GIFs that some key software and browser engines support to my knowledge. I’ll try my best at keeping this updated, but based on some of the bug tracker replies I’ve been seeing, these values probably aren’t going to be changing any time soon.</p>

<p>Desktop image viewers such as <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfranView</a>
 are not
limited by the constraints of serving web pages and tend to display gifs at
their <em>actual</em> fps(Probablt the only way to properly see a <code>100fps</code> gif!). Meanwhile web browsers(As in, their browser engines: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebKit</a>
, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gecko</a>
, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28browser_engine%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink</a>
, etc) have to consider all the other content that a web page can be displaying and would rather not choke a UI thread trying to handle dozens of <code>100fps</code> asynchronous animating gifs. The highest that most browsers worth their weight is <code>50fps</code> as of the year 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Any gif that claims to be showing <code>60fps</code> is simply untrue due to the fact that no web browser out there right now supports displaying gifs higher than <code>50fps</code>.</strong> If you try to set your frame rate any higher than what the browser supports (or if you set the frame delay to zero) then most browsers will default to a playback of <code>10fps</code>(<em>over <strong>5</strong> times slower than you probably intended</em>).</p>
<p>Not only that, but you can’t even <em>depict</em> the 60fps frame-delay(<code>0.016666...</code>) by the gif89a specification since you can
only depict frame-delays in increments of <code>0.01</code>(1/100 of a second, <code>0.01</code>, <code>0.02</code>, <code>0.03</code>, <code>0.04</code>, …) so it simply does not have the resolution to depict the frame delay of <code>0.016666...</code> necessary to get true <code>60fps</code>. You can either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alias</a>
 <code>0.01666...</code> to <strong>0.01</strong>(and ultimately get <code>10fps</code> in web browsers since it is lower than <code>0.02</code>) or set the frame-delay to <strong>0.02</strong> and get a proper <code>50fps</code> depiction(which is the best you’re gonna get).</p>
<p>If there’s something to take away from this it’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GIFs are incapable of depicting <code>60fps</code>. The two highest FPS that can be depicted with a GIF is either <code>100fps</code> or <code>50fps</code></strong></p>
<p><strong>GIFs with a frame-delay lower than <code>0.02</code>(faster than <code>50fps</code>) is going to be forced to play at <code>10fps</code> by all web browser engines!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>I made this set of gifs of the same animation at different frame rates in ascending order(fps gets progressively higher).
If any of them take a different amount of time to reach the start and end points(they are all exactly 1 second long) then you know what framerate your browser is “restricting” the frame delay at.</p>

<p><strong>Nice and even <code>50fps</code>, even technically! (<code>0.02s</code>)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>This is the framerate I work with</strong></em> as it is nice and evenly representable within the GIF specification and is a very high frame rate that most modern browsers support. This is the best you’re gonna get with <code>.gif</code> files.</p>

<p><span><span><img src="https://wunkolo.github.io/post/2020/02/buttery-smooth-10fps/images/60fps.gif" alt="image"/></span></span></p>
<p>This is pretty much just <strong>50fps(0.02) again</strong> as it is only possible to represent frame delays by <strong>increments of <code>0.01</code></strong> and software such as Photoshop will round-off the frame delay from  <code>0.01666...</code> to <code>0.02</code></p>
<p>I put this here to prove a point since some software will lead you to believe that you are exporting a <code>60fps</code> GIF when it is actually not possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><img src="https://wunkolo.github.io/post/2020/02/buttery-smooth-10fps/images/100fps.gif" alt="image"/></span></span></p>
<p>The highest fps possible representable in the GIF file format specification is <code>100 fps</code> (<code>0.01s</code>), which <strong>no</strong> browser supports and <code>60hz</code> consumer screens cannot faithfully display this anyways. Browser-engine image decoders <em>will</em>
automatically reset this framerate to <strong>10fps</strong> and play it x10 times slower.
If this gif is moving very slow to you, it is because your browser reset the speed to <code>10fps</code>.</p>
