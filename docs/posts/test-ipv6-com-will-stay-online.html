        <p>After announcing its retirement, many generous people and organizations offered help - thank you! The project is now transitioning to an RIR (Regional Internet Registry), which will continue running the site in the public interest. I&#39;ll share updates as things progress.</p>

        <h2>Previous message</h2>

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I&#39;ve sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of &#34;during winter break&#34;  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you&#39;ll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p>These are already public.</p>

        <p>The remaining parts, such as geolocation and service provider lookups,  I am contractually unable to release.  Please do not ask.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about monitoring and validation?</strong></p>

        <p>Delan Azabani has shared with me <a href="https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky">https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky</a>, which includes a standalone validator.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I&#39;d consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>
