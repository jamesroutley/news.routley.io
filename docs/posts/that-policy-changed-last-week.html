While you&#39;re here: I&#39;m building a new company and hiring engineers. Email me to learn more: omar@center.app, or <a href="https://twitter.com/omarish" target="_blank">reach out on twitter</a>.
</p>

<p><em>This is part 2 of my Silicon Valley story. <a href="https://omarish.com/we-bill-hourly">Part 1 is here.</a></em></p>

<p>Part 1 finished with <em>&#34;and it felt like things were starting to work;&#34;</em> if you zoom out far enough, that was indeed one of the moments things started to work. But I&#39;d be remiss if I made it sound like it&#39;s been all positive all the time. For me, few good things have ever been a linear process. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone back and forth on publishing this post because it was a really difficult time for me. Some reasons to, lots of reasons not to. I guess after a certain point, your inner scorecard matters more. And sure, there are people out there who seem like they have a perfect track record. I think that means that either 1) they&#39;re lying, 2) they&#39;re not sharing something, or 3) they could be taking on more risk.</p>

<p>Of all things, it was a Dr. Seuss book that convinced me to press publish.</p>

<blockquote>
I&#39;m sorry to say so</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I&#39;m afraid that some times</blockquote>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s get into it.</p>

<p>In 2015 I couldn&#39;t fight this feeling that I didn&#39;t know what I was doing. My past few endeavors had gone OK, but I didn&#39;t yet have my spectacular &#34;win&#34; that I could look back at and say that this was the right choice. I hadn&#39;t yet found the &#34;great&#34; that I was looking for, and like that scene from Pulp Fiction: &#34;if you were gonna make it, you would have made it by now.&#34;</p>

<p>In our industry, it&#39;s a common meme that nobody knows what they&#39;re doing, and while that&#39;s true of any fast-evolving field, there are gradations to it. I had done a lot of cool things: I had scaled a music streaming company (FratMusic.com) from 0 to 2 million monthly streaming audio users (in 2010). I helped start and ran Priceonomics for a few years. I did some massive web crawling projects. I had a lot to point to that I was proud of, but it felt like my title was &#34;startup engineer&#34; and not &#34;software engineer.&#34; I felt like I could build things by pulling packages together and integrating them, but I felt like I didn&#39;t know the &#34;core&#34; things.</p>

<p>I&#39;d never run a &gt;5 person eng team before. I&#39;d never worked closely with product managers. I didn&#39;t know how to sell to big companies. And while &#34;any fool can learn from experience,&#34; what if I could go somewhere, learn a lot, get &#34;big company&#34; experience, and then go start my next thing?</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what I did. I joined a mortgage lending fintech startup (<em>not</em> Coinbase, this was a few years before); it was roughly 100 people, 20 of whom were in engineering. And for the first 18 months, everything about it felt right: a tight-knit engineering team with just enough process to get by. It was also easier than starting a startup since I could work outside the existential threat of whether you&#39;re making something people want. It was nice to never have to think about product market fit, and just focus on a smaller problem. The lack of existential fear was nice.</p>

<p>Lots of good things happened along the way, but this post isn&#39;t about those things.</p>

<p>As the company continued to grow, I did start to noticing small thing changing. Looking back at it now, this phenomenon experts refer to as &#34;growth,&#34; but to me it felt like we were losing our way and starting to &#34;act like a big company.&#34; Both of these things were true, both felt bad, but only in retrospect did I realize that neither are bad. Things that worked when we were a 10-person eng team weren&#39;t really working at 30. </p>

<p>I have lots of ideas on what happened/what went wrong, but this isn&#39;t a post about managing eng teams; it&#39;s about how I learned to manage myself. If you&#39;re interested in the former, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Got-Here-Wont-There-ebook/dp/B000Q9J128">read this</a>. There&#39;s no such thing as a good strategy or a bad strategy; you have to consider the situation you&#39;re applying the strategy in. After all, even the smartest fish of all has 0 value if you&#39;re evaluating it on its ability to climb up a tree.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve learned: if you&#39;re an early employee at a startup, by doing your job properly you&#39;re setting yourself up for obsolescence. If you do everything right, you&#39;ll be in a situation where you have to adapt or leave. Adapt to what? Things that you thought were reserved for &#34;big companies&#34; are now things you have to do. Things like JIRA, stand-ups, 1:1s, performance reviews, etc. </p>

<p>Expecting that your engineering team will grow but look exactly the same that it does when you&#39;re small is like expecting a baby to grow into a bigger version of itself, instead of an adult. Things that grow take different shape, and this is normal and to be expected.</p>

<p>I use this 2x2 matrix a lot since it&#39;s a useful framework when thinking about a growing company:</p>

<p>Processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are good / Feel good</li>
<li>Are good / Feel bad</li>
<li>Are bad / Feel good</li>
<li>Are bad / Feel bad</li>
</ul>

<p>Back to my story.</p>

<p>What was previously a relatively flat org became hierarchical and full of process. Part of these changes was getting two more layers of managers. I reported in to a director who I didn&#39;t really like that much. To be honest, I never really gave him a chance and judged right away. This was a mistake. I&#39;m not going to share more about him specifically. But there were just a lot of things I valued that he didn&#39;t really care about. He didn&#39;t understand the business and wasn&#39;t willing to put in the work to learn about it. He called people &#34;leaf nodes.&#34; And he couldn&#39;t spell. We had a recurring daily standup meeting and the title was &#34;Dialy Standup.&#34; And this wasn&#39;t a one-time thing, it repeated every single day.</p>

<p>Things were fine at first but started to deteriorate over the next few months when I didn&#39;t get in line. Our relationship got more and more tumultuous, and I was insistent on winning every argument and feeling like I was coming out on top. </p>

<p>Ok, so around this time I was also in a long distance relationship. My (then) girlfriend became was at Yale. New Haven is pretty far from California, but fortunately I never had an issue working remotely some of the time. I could go whenever I wanted and nobody would ask questions; after all, I was getting my work done. Work was mostly on autopilot, all was fine. Until one Thursday in June. I still wasn&#39;t investing time in building a good relationship with my manager. </p>

<p>This same guy who previously misspelled &#34;daily&#34; in the recurring &#34;dialy standup&#34; calendar invite was sending these perfect emails summarizing my 1:1s with him. The guy who previously did not formulate a proper sentence was using words like &#34;ostensibly&#34; and &#34;allegedly.&#34;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a pro-tip I learned: if your manager normally cannot spell and does not use proper grammar or capitalization, and then all of a sudden starts writing memos that are formulated with perfect punctuation and spelling, it&#39;s not because he just installed Grammarly. No, he&#39;s building up a case against you. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another thing to look out for. The team I was on got disbanded, and I got put onto a different part of the system. At first glance I thought this was good because I wanted to get better at diving into project source code and ramping up on code someone else wrote. As expected, several-year-old startup code has its own complications. </p>

<p>We&#39;d be in our sprint estimate meetings where each person would estimate effort for their work. Except when I&#39;d give an estimate, my manager would then turn to the person who also wrote that piece of the architecture and use their estimate instead of mine. </p>

<p>In June, two couples we knew had weddings, both in New Haven. I missed the first one because of increasing pressure at work. I sort of got pulled completely from one part of the company and tossed into a completely different part. And at stand-ups, my manager would ask everybody to estimate how long something should take, but when it was for my tasks, he&#39;d ask the lead architect for that part of the system to estimate, then tell me to do it in that amount of time.</p>

<p>Stressful times. I listened to this one song on loop that&#39;s designed to make your heart rate go down. But every time I&#39;d try and make a code change, rspec would take 2 minutes to set up fixtures and it was a shit-show. Then sometimes there were these 30/360 interest calculations that would be off by 1e-32 that would only ail after the test suite got 90% of the way through. But I pushed through and got my work done.</p>

<p>This was a Wednesday and I had missed the wedding the prior weekend. And I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to make it to the next one, but on Wednesday morning I decided I&#39;d go. So I emailed my manager to let him know I was going to be working remotely and updated my calendar to show that I&#39;d be working remotely on Thursday and Friday, and partially unavailable on Thursday morning when the flight didn&#39;t have wifi.</p>

<p>I send the email, and a few minutes later get a calendar invite for 4:30pm that day with my manager. Weird. He wasn&#39;t in the office that day, so I wonder why he&#39;d be coming in to talk to me at 4:30pm. I know a lot of seasoned folks will read this and see the writing on the wall, but honestly at this point, I didn&#39;t really expect it to be anything.</p>

<p>He shows up at 4:20p and we&#39;re both awkwardly standing outside the big conference room. I try to make small-talk but he responds with one-word answers. The room frees up and we walk in. He sits across the table and starts talking.</p>

<p>Then a few minutes in, I hear a knock on the door.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s the HR rep.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I still remember how that conversation went. There was some small talk of &#34;I know you&#39;re going to go on to do better things&#34; but the truth is, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s anything more than a platitude. It&#39;s so easy to say that to someone.</p>

<p>Anyways, we go through and I&#39;m asked to sign some papers. I do and keep my cool the whole way through. What was going through my mind at the time? I had recently read Man&#39;s Search for Meaning and was inspired by a lot of the ideas. Especially about being able to take adversity. Obviously, getting asked to leave a cushy corporate job is nothing compared to Frankl&#39;s experiences, but at the time, this was a big deal for me at the time. It&#39;s not about how big of a deal something is to you - it&#39;s about how big a deal it is to the person experiencing it at the time. And to my well-sheltered, happy life, this was probably one of the top 3 scariest things I&#39;d been through at the time.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really want to be there anymore, but I also wanted to know the specifics as to why I was being asked to leave. I read through the papers and there was something written about working remotely without giving sufficient notice before working remotely,. So I asked why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I&#39;ve gone and worked remotely a dozen times, including while you were my manager and you never had an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Our policy on that changed last week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We both knew that was bullshit, but I didn&#39;t feel like fighting it. I think I made the HR person a little bit uncomfortable when I didn&#39;t flinch or get animated. I still remember her saying &#34;you&#39;re the calmest person I&#39;ve ever seen go through this.&#34; Fuck that, it wasn&#39;t worth losing my cool over them.</p>

<p>I put my stuff in a box. Some pleasantries were exchanged on the way out, I got strange/sad looks from coworkers, but just stayed focused on keeping cool. I (got) walked out of the building, and that was the end of that chapter. I did stop for ice cream on the way home because why not.</p>

<p>Newly unemployed and due to get married in four weeks, I decided on the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>I wouldn&#39;t tell a soul about this experience until I figured out what I was going to do.</li>
<li>I was going to the wedding and was going to try my best to have a great time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next morning I was on my flight to the east coast. Somewhere over Utah, I got an email from manager&#39;s manager (the CTO). Apparently lots of people were asking about the circumstances around my departure and we agreed I should send a farewell email. I thought about writing something clever, but these types of communications are best kept polite and cordial. My advice: don&#39;t be an asshole. Just write the note and move on.</p>

<p>I drafted a short note, got it approved, and hit send. My email account got deactivated again a few minutes later; even some of my (now former) coworkers responses bounced. I could have chosen to get upset about it, but instead I called the stewardess, ordered a stiff drink and started making a list of people I should reach out to and opportunities I thought were interesting. I sent 20 emails to generate some consulting business and found a project within a week. </p>

<p>I showed up to the wedding and it was a blast. I started camping out at the Yale Libraries and got into a good routine. This was going to pass.</p>

<p>A sidenote: within 12 months, both my manager, and also his manager had something in common with me: none of us worked at that company anymore.</p>

<h2>Recurse Center</h2>

<p>Another thing I did: I applied for the Recurse Center. I&#39;d always heard great things about it from others, and I figured this would be a good chance to try it. So, I applied and got in. Even there I was afraid to talk about what had happened, so I embellished the story of how I got pushed out and reduced it to &#34;I decided it was time for something new&#34; but sort of omitted the fact that the circumstances weren&#39;t great.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something really important that I learned. When somebody asks you why you left your last company, you can say absolutely anything you want with ONE important rule: do not say anything negative about your past employer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of: &#34;I didn&#39;t like my manager,&#34; say &#34;we had differences of opinion and we&#39;re the average of the five closest people we spend time with&#34;</li>
<li>Instead of &#34;there was too much tech debt,&#34; say &#34;I wanted to join a company at a different stage&#34;</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve been on the interviewer side of the table before, and you&#39;ll never win anything by being negative during an interview.</p>

<p>Those next few months were pretty great. I had spun up another consulting project, this time with a big bank that you&#39;ve definitely heard of. This project paid twice what I was making at this last company. And trust that I worked my butt off for this project. I was putting in roughly 50 hours/week on this project, another 40 at RC, and generally wondering what to do next.</p>

<h2>Earn</h2>

<p>A few weeks later, I was out in San Francisco for a meeting with said bank. My phone buzzed at 5:30am; it was an Earn.com push notification. It was from Balaji and it said &#34;are you interested in an engineering role at Earn.com?&#34;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know much about Earn.com and didn&#39;t know much about Balaji, but I&#39;d followed him on Twitter for a while and knew he seemed interesting. So I responded &#34;yes&#34; and a few days later got sent a HackerRank puzzle. I finished the hiring exam and got back to what I was doing before. I later found out that out of 250 people who had taken the quiz, I had gotten the highest score.</p>

<p>Later that day I did two quick google hangouts, one with John and another with Ali. And later that day, Balaji called and asked if/when I&#39;d be interested in flying out to San Francisco to work with the team for a week. I had another trip already scheduled out there for my consulting engagement and was going to be there in two weeks.. so I asked if two weeks worked. Balaji&#39;s response was &#34;what&#39;s the soonest you can come out.&#34;</p>

<p>That really left an impression. Get it done now. A lot of people ask what it&#39;s like to work with Balaji, and this is one part of what makes him so effective. If we can do something now, let&#39;s do it now. Move quickly and compete. But all this was extra, I was just happy I was working with someone who didn&#39;t mis-spell &#34;daily.&#34;</p>

<p>The next day I was on plane to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Earn had a product called the Greenlister which relied on the Gmail API. This project started off as a hackathon idea and ended up getting some adoption. But there was a problem: it grew quickly but wasn&#39;t the company&#39;s core focus. It was taking ~2h for the email server to process a push from the Gmail API. And when a worker did get the notice, it&#39;d spend lots of time waiting on DNS requests to resolve. Lots of blocking IO and my goal was to make it really fast.</p>

<p>Feeling hungry for an opportunity to prove myself, I worked pretty hard that week. I started on Monday; by Wednesday afternoon I had solved the core issues and had a lot of the service written using asyncio primitives. I also did a deep deep patch of the Gmail API where I rewrote every network call to support coroutines. What I thought would be a month-long project took a few days. Maybe I had learned those core things that I thought I was looking for two years prior.</p>

<p>Later on that day around 4pm, I got a 4:30pm calendar invite with Balaji.</p>

<p>This time I walked in and there was also lots of paperwork on a conference table, but this time the paperwork was an employment agreement, an Earn.com NDA, and a Coinbase NDA.</p>

<h2>Coinbase</h2>

<p>Working at Coinbase was a brilliant time. I&#39;ll write about that some other day. </p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>For now, though, I&#39;m starting a new company and you should reach out if you&#39;re an engineer and want to learn more: <a href="mailto:omar@center.app">omar@center.app</a>.</p>
