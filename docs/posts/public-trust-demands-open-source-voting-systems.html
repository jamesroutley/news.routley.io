    <h1>Public trust demands open-source voting systems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><div><div><p>October 10, 2025</p><p> — </p><p>Ben Adida</p></div><div><h4>Yesterday, news broke that Dominion Voting Systems <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dominion-voting-liberty-vote-2020-conspiracy-theories-fed1e2d7f00b264bf5f8e01a106124f1">was sold to a new company, Liberty Vote</a>. Dominion, the second-largest voting systems vendor in the US that currently tabulates 1 in 5 American votes, is no more.</h4><p>There is indeed a crisis of trust in American elections. As the saying goes, trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair. We urgently need a new strategy that repairs voter trust. American freedom and democracy depend on it.</p><p>We must start with a foundational commitment to transparency. Every voting machine vendor in the US claims to be transparent. It may come as a surprise, then, that most Americans vote on machines that run proprietary, secret software! A voting machine that every American can trust must run software that is fully open to public scrutiny. </p><p>Today, VotingWorks makes the only open-source voting equipment in the US. Open-source is the modern standard for public-trust and high-security software. Signal, the most secure and battle-tested messaging app, is open-source. The US Military <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/portals/0/documents/library/softwaredev-opensource.pdf">recommends open-source</a>. A modern voting system needs to be open-source.</p><p>Liberty Vote, and every other vendor of voting machines in the US, can fulfill their commitment to transparency by making their technology open-source today. If every vendor takes this opportunity, together, we can turn the page and launch a new generation of voting systems every American can trust. </p><p>‍</p><h2>About Voting Works</h2><p>Read about the company: <a href="https://voting.works">https://voting.works</a></p><p>View our complete source code: <a href="https://github.com/votingworks">https://github.com/votingworks</a></p><p>Contact us with questions: <a href="mailto:hello@voting.works">hello@voting.works</a> </p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div>
