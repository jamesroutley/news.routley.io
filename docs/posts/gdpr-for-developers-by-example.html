    <h1>GDPR for Developers by Example</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>GDPR has been in place for years now, and we’re starting to learn more and more about how it’s going to be enforced and what it really means. The many questions people had that could only be answered by court decisions have now been answered. Over the past years, I’ve seen systems try and fail to correct implement GDPR. Here are the things I’ve learnt from court decisions and from mistakes made.</p><h2 id="the-right-to-deletion">The right to deletion<a href="#the-right-to-deletion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One of the most well-known rights GDPR provides is the right to be deleted. This is where you must delete data relating to a user on demand.</p><h3 id="void-if-theyve-used-a-paid-service">Void if they’ve used a paid service<a href="#void-if-theyve-used-a-paid-service" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One big thing with this right is that it does not override other laws or legal rights of the company. Countries such as Germany have a legal requirement to keep all data relating to financial transactions. GDPR also gives an exemption when it’s being held for legal defence purposes. What this means, in reality, is once a user has paid you the money, you need to keep their data. Their right to demand their data be deleted doesn’t matter as the other legal rights override it.</p><h4 id="examples">Examples:<a href="#examples" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user who has paid for a subscription then cancels it wishes their data to be deleted.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user who has only used the free plan wishes their data to be deleted.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user who hasn’t bought anything themselves but is a member of a paid service for another user requests to be deleted.</p><h3 id="delete-from-newsletters-list-and-other-third-parties-as-well">Delete from newsletters list and other third parties as well.<a href="#delete-from-newsletters-list-and-other-third-parties-as-well" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The right to be deleted when executed also includes the third-party data processors you have processing data on your behalf when technically feasible. This may be one of the most forgotten aspects of deleting user data. In many systems, they only focus on deleting data they have and processing and forget about their data processors.</p><h4 id="examples-1">Examples<a href="#examples-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You use a newsletter system.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You use a logging system</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have backups</p><h3 id="can-be-done-via-a-request---does-not-have-to-be-automated">Can be done via a request - does not have to be automated.<a href="#can-be-done-via-a-request---does-not-have-to-be-automated" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Many of the major sites allow you to delete your data at the click of a button. It is possible that you make it a manual action that is done when the user clicks a button within the system. While this is the most user-friendly way, if you’re just starting out and don’t have the time and resources to focus on building this, then it can be done manually. The act of requesting of the deletion must be easy and not have hurdles, as making the process harder and more time-consuming would breach this right.</p><h4 id="examples-2">Examples<a href="#examples-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user clicks a button within their account settings</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user emails customer support, and customer support click a button in the admin system.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user has to write a letter to customer support, and customer support clicks a button in the admin system.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user emails customer support, and then customer support creates a ticket for the technical team to delete the data, and it’s processed that week.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user emails customer support, and then customer support creates a ticket for the technical team to delete the data, and it’s processed a month later.</p><h2 id="cookie-law">Cookie Law<a href="#cookie-law" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The cookie law is a requirement to get consent to use cookies on a website for anything that isn’t functionally required and inform the user about the data that is being written and retrieved from their computer.
The cookie law consent isn’t GDPR.</p><p>One of the things many people complain about in relation to GDPR is that sites ask for consent and have popups for cookies. The requirement to get consent for cookies is not part of GDPR. It’s actually a separate law, which is known as the cookie law.</p><h3 id="the-cookie-consent-isnt-just-for-cookies">The Cookie consent isn’t just for cookies.<a href="#the-cookie-consent-isnt-just-for-cookies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>While it’s commonly called the cookie law, it actually covers anything where you’re storing and/or retrieving data on the user’s computer. This includes localStorage and other methods of storing and retrieving data from the user&#39;s computer.</p><p>So switching over to using localStorage isn’t a valid loophole that some believe it is.</p><h4 id="examples-3">Examples:<a href="#examples-3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have an app that stores data in a cookie</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a flash app that stores high scores on the user&#39;s computer</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have an app that only stores data in the cloud</p><h3 id="if-technically-required-to-fulfil-the-users-actions-no-consent-is-required">If technically required to fulfil the user&#39;s actions, no consent is required.<a href="#if-technically-required-to-fulfil-the-users-actions-no-consent-is-required" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>While creating the cookie law, lawmakers understood that some cookies are literally required in order for the site to function properly. For this reason, they created exemptions that cookies that are functionally required don’t need to be consented to in order to be used.</p><h4 id="example-of-functionality-required-cookies">Example of functionality required cookies:<a href="#example-of-functionality-required-cookies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Keeping track of cookie consent</li><li>Loadbalancing cookies</li><li>Cookies to keep track of the user session when they’ve logged in</li><li>Cookies to keep track of a user&#39;s shopping cart</li></ul><p>Analytics is explicitly defined as not a valid functional requirement, and Analytic cookies must be consented to.</p><h4 id="examples-4">Examples:<a href="#examples-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a login system and use cookies to keep track of the logged-in user.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a checkout basket, and you need cookies to track the user&#39;s basket</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a cookie for getting track of independent user sessions</p><p>One of the main things with GDPR is the informed consent of the user on how their data will be processed, and with the cookie law, this means if you’re using a third party tool to add extra value to your business flow, then you need to allow the user to make an informed decision on if it is added or not.</p><h3 id="you-must-get-consent-before-theyre-included">You must get consent before they’re included.<a href="#you-must-get-consent-before-theyre-included" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You must get consent before you activate the features you need to get consent for. This is probably the most common mistake when using consent banners. They have a consent banner, but they’ve already loaded everything before you’ve even clicked anything.</p><h4 id="examples-5">Examples<a href="#examples-5" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want consent to use Google Fonts</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to use a service that uses cookies</p><h3 id="you-must-allow-them-to-refuse-consent">You must allow them to refuse consent<a href="#you-must-allow-them-to-refuse-consent" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A user must be able to reject whatever you wish then to consent to. Consent must be given willingly and refusing consent must not lead to negative consequences.</p><h4 id="examples-6">Examples<a href="#examples-6" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You only provide an ok button on your consent banner</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You provide an ok button and a reject button that the user needs to navigate and find</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You provide an ok button, and next to it is a reject all button</p><h3 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-understand-what-theyre-consenting-to">The user must be able to understand what they’re consenting to<a href="#the-user-must-be-able-to-understand-what-theyre-consenting-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The user must be provided in clear language who is going to process the data, what data they will be processing and for which reasons the data will be processed for.</p><h4 id="examples-7">Examples<a href="#examples-7" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You give a confusing unclear explanation of what data is used and by whom</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You provide a list of companies who will be processing data, listing what data they will get and the reason they need that data.</p><h3 id="the-user-must-be-able-to-withdraw-consent">The user must be able to withdraw consent.<a href="#the-user-must-be-able-to-withdraw-consent" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You must gain the user’s consent, but an important aspect is the user must be able to change their minds and withdraw consent. If you only allow a user to give or deny consent once but don’t allow them to change their preferences, you would fail to allow the user to withdraw consent for how their personal data is used.</p><h4 id="examples-8">Examples<a href="#examples-8" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You allow people to sign up for a newsletter but don’t allow them to unsubscribe</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a consent banner that is only viewable when the user first arrives</p><h3 id="not-everything-requires-consent">Not everything requires consent.<a href="#not-everything-requires-consent" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are many cases where you don’t actually have to gain the consent of the user to process their personal data or to do something. GDPR has quite a few exceptions. If you need something because otherwise, your application won’t work, then consent isn’t required. If you need to do something because you have a contract with their employer and to fulfil the contract with their employer you.</p><h4 id="examples-9">Examples<a href="#examples-9" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a contract with the person’s employer to provide them with a service</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You need to process the personal data of employees to ensure they’re taking time off</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to process the personal data to know how many employees have an A as the second letter of their first name.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You need to process a customer&#39;s personal data for fraud prevention</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to process a customer’s data to know when to send the coupons</p><p>Having a consent banner that is invalid doesn’t protect you or reduce your fines. There isn’t a percentage of complying with the law. Amazon got fined €35 million because their cookie consent banner was invalid. If your consent banner isn’t 100% compliant, you’re liable for fines. This is why major companies outsource the compliance banner to another company, so the other company handles the pain of ensuring compliance while the original company focuses on what they’re in the business to do.</p><h4 id="examples-10">Examples<a href="#examples-10" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You include third-party code that needs consent before you get consent</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You only allow people to accept</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You send people away from your site if they refuse consent</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You don’t allow people to change their consent status</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You make it harder to refuse consent</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This is just a small part of the GDPR requirements. I will follow up with the rest in the near future.</p><p>But if you want to add Live Chat or even just get free website analytics without having to add cookies and a cookie banner, then try out <a href="https://blether.chat?utm_source=gdpr-dev-part-1&amp;utm_campaign=content_marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blether</a>.
