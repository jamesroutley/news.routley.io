    <h1>50% of new NPM packages are spam</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><div id="post-content-wrapper"><p><strong>More than half of all new packages that are currently (29 Mar 2023) being submitted to npm are SEO spam.</strong> That is - empty packages, with just a single README file that contains links to various malicious websites.</p>


<p>Out of the ~320k new npm packages or versions that <a target="_blank" href="https://sandworm.dev">Sandworm</a> has scanned over the past week, at least ~185k were labeled as SEO spam. <strong>Just in the last hour as of writing this article, 1583 new e-book spam packages have been published.</strong></p>
<p>All the identified spam packages are currently live on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of the main attacker profiles for the week&#39;s worth of data we&#39;re sampling in this article (22-29 Mar 2023):</p>


<h2 id="heading-the-russian-telegram-channel">The Russian Telegram Channel</h2>
<p>Most of the spam packages detected by Sandworm come from a single Telegram channel that seems to be targeting Russian-speaking people. Package names are set to match searches on various sensitive topics, like the war in Ukraine or investment decisions made by Gazprom. The package description, however, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Forget about financial problems forever: a new method of earning will allow you to earn millions without leaving your home!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680120051492/affa6d03-ddef-4241-99a2-1ad24c4d0cc3.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>The links point to the malicious Telegram channel, with over 7k members. All 93k+ packages analyzed have this identical Telegram URL in their description.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-classics-free-booksvideos">The Classics: Free Books/Videos</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680120301454/e0725267-3ebb-445e-8b28-bfdfd015c3b5.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>The second biggest SEO spam actors on npm are the more conventional ads for free books and videos online. These lead to websites that require the user to perform a series of tasks to obtain a (non-existent) download link, basically watching and interacting with ads. The domains used in URLs by these spam packages change a lot, so they&#39;re harder to detect.</p>
<h2 id="heading-fortnite-v-bucks">Fortnite V-Bucks</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680120721695/809e7536-c931-4ac5-a28f-8a100e90881b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>A new trend is fake packages promising free Fortnite V-Bucks. These usually take users to elaborate pages where they&#39;re tricked into thinking they need to verify they&#39;re human by performing a series of tasks - again, ads and surveys.</p>
<h2 id="heading-sandworms-response">Sandworm&#39;s Response</h2>
<p>We&#39;re in the process of reporting all of the identified spam packages to npm. We suspect this is only the tip of the iceberg since we&#39;ve been able to identify many packages that have been live in the npm repo for years (like <code>uyo-xint</code>). We&#39;ll have a deep look into spam across the entire registry in a future blog post.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://sandworm.dev">Sandworm</a> continuously monitors the npm registry. We post updates and investigate new software supply-chain threats as soon as we identify them. Like, follow, and subscribe to our newsletter for more!</p>
