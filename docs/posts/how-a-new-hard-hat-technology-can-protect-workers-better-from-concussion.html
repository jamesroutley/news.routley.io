        <p>A new generation of hard hats is promising better protection against on-the-job concussions, also known as mild traumatic brain injuries.</p><p>These hard hats incorporate technology that not only protects the head from a direct impact, but also from a glancing blow that causes the head to rotate suddenly – a major cause of concussions.</p><p>&#34;The human brain is readily injured by a rotational force,&#34; says <a href="https://www.legacyhealth.org/For-Health-Professionals/legacy-research-institute/research/scientists/bottlang">Michael Bottlang</a>, director of the Legacy Biomechanics Lab in Portland, Ore. For example, he says, a boxer will &#34;drop like a fly&#34; from a punch to the chin that causes the head to turn rapidly.</p><p>So Bottlang and<a href="https://summitdocs.com/steven-madey/#"> Dr. Steven Madey</a>, an orthopedic surgeon in Portland, have developed a hard hat intended to absorb rotational force. It&#39;s made and sold by <a href="https://wavecel.com/">WaveCel</a>, a company the two men founded to make safer bike helmets.</p><p>The WaveCel hard hat is just the latest effort to update the products, known as industrial safety helmets, which brain injury experts say are overdue for an upgrade.</p><p>&#34;Unfortunately, today&#39;s most frequently used hard hats look identical to the ones from the &#39;60s,&#34; Bottlang says.</p><p>MIPS, a Swedish company, offers <a href="https://mipsprotection.com/helmet-safety/">a competing technology</a> to protect a worker&#39;s brain from sudden rotation. </p><p>Upgraded helmets like these, &#34;are keeping the brain more stationary, and that has a lot of potential benefit,&#34; says <a href="https://neurosurgery.ufl.edu/residency/current-residents/brandon-lucke-wold/">Dr. Brandon Lucke-Wold</a>, a neurosurgeon at the University of Florida who has no ties to the helmet industry.</p><h3>Understanding workplace concussions</h3><p>About one-fourth of all concussions among adults occur on the job, especially at construction sites. Falls, which often cause the head to turn or tip suddenly, are the most frequent cause.</p><p>One reason workplace brain injuries are so common is that hard hats — unlike sports helmets — haven&#39;t changed much since their invention a century ago.  </p><p>Lucke-Wold, who often treats patients with brain injuries, wears a state-of-the art bike helmet during his daily commute. </p><p>&#34;But the construction workers I saw biking home today were wearing hard hats that are very similar to what I saw 10 to 15 years ago,&#34; he says.</p><p>A typical hard hat consists of a plastic outer shell with an inner suspension system made from webbing. Some models include foam padding on the sides and a chin strap.</p><p>This design is good at protecting the brain from direct hit, say a hammer dropped by a worker two stories up. But traditional hard hats aren&#39;t so good when the impact comes at an angle.</p><p>Studies show that&#39;s because an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Illustration-of-the-biomechanics-of-an-oblique-impact-lower-compared-to-a_fig1_263935897">oblique impact</a> can cause the helmet, and the head inside it, to turn suddenly and violently. And a growing body of research shows that the brain is highly vulnerable to this sort of rotational force. </p><p>The reason is that the brain is a bit like an egg yoke — a soft capsule surrounded by liquid, and contained inside a hard shell. </p><p>You can shake an egg forcefully without disrupting the contents. But experiments show that if you <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0035314">spin one hard enough</a>, the yoke inside will rupture even though the shell remains intact.</p><p>Most hard hats act like an egg shell.</p><p>&#34;They do a job at reducing force, so they serve a purpose,&#34; Madey says. &#34;But if they&#39;re not optimized to decrease the spin, they&#39;re not optimized to prevent injury.&#34;</p><h3>A helmet that works like sand</h3><p>Madey and Bottlang initially founded WaveCel to make better sports helmets.</p><p>Their inspiration came from observing what happens to a ball when it strikes the ground at an angle, the way a biker&#39;s head often does in a crash. </p><p>The ball doesn&#39;t just bounce, Madey says. &#34;It will hit the ground, it&#39;ll have friction and it&#39;ll create spin.&#34; </p><p>Unless the ground is made of sand.</p><p>&#34;If you throw a ball into a sandpit, the sand gives underneath, it doesn&#39;t impart spin to the ball,&#34; Madey says. And the ball doesn&#39;t bounce.</p><p>So Madey and Bottlang developed a helmet liner made from a special plastic honeycomb designed to act like sand.    </p><p>&#34;The honeycomb structure is a very light, breathable material that is not only good at absorbing  linear force, but also breaks that spin the way sand would,&#34; Madey says.</p><p>The WaveCel liner can be found in several big-brand sports helmets. </p><p>An independent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109224/">study found </a>that bike helmets with either WaveCel or MIPS technology were better than conventional helmets at reducing rotational force. A study led by Bottlang and Madey found that WaveCel <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9379520/">outperformed MIPS</a> for the type of head impacts caused by falls.</p><p>One potential barrier to widespread acceptance of the new helmets is price.</p><p>WaveCel hard hats cost $169 to $189, which is several times the amount for a standard hard hat and more than many premium models, including some with MIPS technology.</p><p>&#34;If I have one goal in the next few years, it&#39;s to bring the price down,&#34; Bottlang says.</p>
