    <h1>Biff â€“ a batteries-included web framework for Clojure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Biff curates libraries and tools from across the ecosystem and composes them into one polished whole.</p><div><div><p>Bring immutability to your database, not just your code. Biff adds schema enforcement with Malli.</p></div><div><p>Create rich, interactive UIs without leaving the backend. Throw in a dash of _hyperscript for light client-side scripting.</p></div><div><p>Passwordless, email-based authentication, with support for magic link and one-time passcode flows.</p></div><div><p>Biff comes with code for provisioning an Ubuntu VPS, or you can deploy an Uberjar with Docker.</p></div><div><p>Changes are evaluated whenever you save a file. Connect to a production REPL and develop your whole app on the fly.</p></div><div><p>Get started with the tutorial, delve into the reference docs, or tinker with the starter project and inspect the doc strings.</p></div></div><p><span>Strong defaults, weakly held.</span> Biff is designed to be taken apart and modified, so it doesn&#39;t get in the way as your needs evolve.</p></div>
