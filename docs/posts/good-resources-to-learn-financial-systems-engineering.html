    <h1>Ask HN: Good resources to learn financial systems engineering?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I work mainly in energy market communications and systems that facilitate energy trading, balancing and such. Currently most parties there take minutes to process messages and I think there could be a lot to learn from financial systems engineering. Any good resources you can recommend?</p></div></div>
