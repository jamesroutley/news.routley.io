    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><p>What is ultra sound money?</p><p>Ultra sound money is an Ethereum meme focusing on the likely decrease of the ETH supply.
If capped-supply gold is sound, decreasing-supply ether is ultra sound.</p></span></p><p><span><p>How can ETH supply decrease?</p><p>The ETH supply decreases whenever more ETH is destroyed via fee burn than ETH is created via issuance.
Fee burn is a scarcity engine fuelled by Ethereum&#39;s transactional utility.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What is fee burn?</p><p>Fee burn is a mechanism which destroys ETH base fees paid for transaction inclusion on Ethereum.
Fee burn started August 5, 2021 with the activation of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">EIP-1559</a>.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What are base fees?</p><p>Base fees are protocol-quoted minimum fees for transaction inclusion in an Ethereum block.
Priority fees paid in addition to base fees are not burned.</p></span></p><p><span><p>When will ETH be ultra sound?</p><p>The ETH supply will likely decrease when PoW issuance is removed, leaving only PoS issuance.
The removal of PoW will happen at the merge, likely Q3 2022.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What is the merge?</p><p>The merge (see <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3675">EIP-3675</a>) is the hot-swapping of issuance-heavy PoW for issuance-light PoS.
The merge will cause an issuance shock called the triple halvening.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What is the triple halvening?</p><p>The triple halvening is an issuance cliff roughly equivalent to three Bitcoin halvenings.
At the merge total issuance drops from ~15K ETH/day to ~1.5K ETH/day.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What are the origins of the meme?</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Z4ZpBiTwA&amp;t=1770s">Aug 2020</a></span>â€”Vitalik Buterin jokes about supersonic money

The ultra sound fam wears the bat signal to spread the meme.</p></span></p></div></div>
