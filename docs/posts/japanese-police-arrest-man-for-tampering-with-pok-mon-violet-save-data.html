    <h1>Japanese Police Arrest Man for Tampering with Pokémon Violet Save Data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><p>Police in Japan have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of selling illegally modified Pokémon save data to customers online — a practice which is banned under the country’s <a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Unfair Competition Prevention Act</a>.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/kochi/20240410/8010020207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese website NHK News</a>, and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hacked-pokemon-seller-arrested-by-japanese-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, the suspect was apprehended by police on April 9 after a ‘police cyber patrol’ discovered evidence that the individual had used special tools to illegally modify save data for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-violet">Pokémon Violet</a> in order to change Pokémon move sets.A 36-year-old man was arrest for selling illegally modified Pokemon save data.</p><p>The 36-year-old allegedly took custom orders for rare Pokémon, and sold the resulting tampered data between December 2022 to March 2023, for up to 13,000 yen ($84) a time on a website that served as a marketplace for video game assets and items. He also offered deals in which six Pokémon would be created for the equivalent of roughly $30 in yen.</p><p>The 36-year-old has reportedly admitted to committing the crimes at the heart of the ongoing investigation, while providing the justification that he did it to earn a living. According to Automaton, the suspect could face up to five years imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen (over $32,600).</p><p>This isn’t the first time that criminals have sought to make money off of Game Freak’s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon card heist saw one desperate man <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist?_gl=1*17zenfa*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg2MzE0MTUzOC4xNzEyODUwNTk0*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxMjg1MDU5My4xLjAuMTcxMjg1MDU5My4wLjAuMA..">attempt to descend from a six-story building in order to steal a treasure trove of trading cards</a> and cash from a Tokyo store. </p><p>2022 saw the trend continue, with criminals in Tokyo committing a series of high-value Pokemon burglaries, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">including one instance in which theives made off with a haul of cards worth over $60,000</a>. Its worth noting that the raw last for Pokemon — and the trouble it can land you in — is felt well beyond the criminal fraternity. As a case in point January 2022 saw two Los Angeles police officers fired <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lapd-officers-fired-for-chasing-snorlax-in-pokemon-go-instead-of-robbers">after they ignored a call to attend a burglary in order to chase down a Snorlax</a> in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a>.</p><p>While you’re here why not take a moment to check out IGN’s ranking of the top 10 best pokemon video games of all time, or discover <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-face-off-ign-readers-have-chosen-which-pocket-monster-is-the-very-best">which Pokemon our readers have crowned as the very best of all time in our 2021 face off</a>.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.
