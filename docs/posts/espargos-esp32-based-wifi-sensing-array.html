    <h1>Espargos: ESP32-based WiFi sensing array</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Real-Time Indoor Localization Demo</h2><div><p>With ESPARGOS, existing WiFi devices like smartphones, robots and other machines can be localized in indoor environments without requiring any changes to those devices.
In line-of-sight environments, ESPARGOS can simply locate devices by triangulation. <a href="https://dichasus.inue.uni-stuttgart.de/tutorials/tutorial/dissimilarity-metric-channelcharting/">Channel Charting</a> allows the system to locate devices even if there is no line-of-sight path between ESPARGOS and the end device.
This application was publicly demonstrated at the Berlin 6G Conference 2024.</p></div></div><div><h2 id="obtain">How to obtain ESPARGOS?</h2><p>At the <a href="https://www.inue.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute of Telecommunications at the University of Stuttgart</a>, we have manufactured a small batch of ESPARGOS devices and have already provided some boards to partners for evaluation, primarily research project members and other research institutions.
We still have a very small (single-digit) number of boards available that we can provide to interested parties, but we kindly ask for your understanding that we must prioritize requests.
Please <a href="mailto:euchner@inue.uni-stuttgart.de">contact me</a> if you would like to receive an ESPARGOS board, or in case you have any questions or ideas to share about use cases, research ideas, open sourcing, manufacturing, or other topics.</p><p>We are still evaluating how to proceed, if we can (and should) make ESPARGOS available to a wider audience.
The hardware design and firmware files of ESPARGOS are currently not open source, but the <a href="https://github.com/ESPARGOS/pyespargos"><code>pyespargos</code></a> library including the demo applications are free software.
If you would like to receive updates about future developments regarding ESPARGOS, you can sign up to receive updates.</p><p><a>Sign up for Updates</a></p></div></div>
