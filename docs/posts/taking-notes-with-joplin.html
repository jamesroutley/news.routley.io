    <h1>Taking Notes with Joplin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> is an open-source
note-taking application designed to handle taking many kinds of notes,
whether it is managing code snippets, writing documentation, jotting
down lecture notes, or drafting a novel. Joplin has Markdown support,
a plugin system for extensibility, and accepts multimedia content,
allowing users to attach images, videos, and audio files to their
notes. It can provide synchronization of content across devices using
end-to-end encryption, or users can opt to stick to local storage
only. Joplin even offers a <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/terminal/">command-line
version</a> for terminal-based usage. <a href="https://joplinapp.org/news/20250114-release-3-2/">Joplin
3.2</a>, the most recent feature release, brought long-awaited
multi-window support, multi-column layouts, enhanced accessibility,
and theme detection.</p>

<h4 id="history">History</h4>

<p>Laurent Cozic <a href="https://www.20i.com/blog/joplin-creator-laurent-cozic/">started
work</a> on Joplin in 2016, with an Android version released in July
2017, and the first desktop release (<a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v0.10.19">v0.10.19</a>)
made available in November 2017. The <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/changelog/desktop/">complete
changelog</a> of the project is available on the Joplin web site. The
application is <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/faq/#why-is-it-named-joplin">named in
honor</a> of ragtime composer and pianist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin">Scott Joplin</a>,
whom Cozic admires. More than 650 people have contributed code to the
project over its lifetime; based on the activity <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin">on GitHub</a> and the steady
stream of releases, it is an active and thriving project.</p>

<p>In 2022, Joplin&#39;s user applications <a href="https://joplinapp.org/news/20221221-agpl">switched</a> from the
MIT license to the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License">AGPLv3</a>)
with the 2.9 release. The Joplin project also makes its Joplin Server
available for users who want to run their own synchronization
server. However, that application is released under a
source-available, non-free <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/server/LICENSE.md">Personal
Use License</a> that forbids commercial use and seems to disallow
modification as well.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting started</h4>

<p>Joplin is a multi-platform application, with versions for Linux,
macOS, and Windows. It is built with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> for cross-platform
compatibility. Mobile applications are also available for Android and
iOS. It is available for Linux as an AppImage from the <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/install/">download page</a> of the web
site. The page also provides instructions for installing the terminal
application and <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/clipper">WebClipper</a>, a browser
extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows saving web pages directly
to Joplin as notes. The command-line version is not included with the
Joplin download, and is installed using Node.js&#39;s npm package manager.</p>

<p>Joplin&#39;s editor supports writing content in <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/markdown/">Markdown</a> or using
a Rich Text editor for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>
experience. However, the project <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/rich_text_editor/">warns</a>
that the Rich Text editor has some limitations in working with Joplin
plugins that use Markdown. Notes are stored in the Markdown format
whether the user chooses the standard Joplin editor or Rich Text
editor. All notes, notebooks, and attachments are stored in an SQLite
database. Editing with external text editors or file management tools
is possible by selecting &#34;Edit with external editor&#34; from the
application. However, this approach is only feasible when mediated by
Joplin. Directly editing Joplin&#39;s notes can disrupt
synchronization.</p>

<p>It also offers an <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/import_export/">export
feature</a> that supports multiple formats, including its own Joplin
Export Format (JEX), as well as JSON, PDF, and plain Markdown, to back
up or transfer data. Similarly, it provides import capabilities,
allowing for migration from other note-taking applications. Users can
import from JEX, Markdown files, and Evernote data via <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-Notes-and-Notebooks-as-ENEX-or-HTML">ENEX
files</a> while preserving note structure and attachments.</p>

<p>It includes a to-do list function that allows creation and
management of tasks similarly to regular notes. Each to-do item is a
special type of note with an additional &#34;completed&#34; status field. When
creating a new to-do note, users can assign a title, add detailed
content, and set a due date. To-dos can be marked as completed, of
course, which updates their status and changes their sorting order in
the interface, typically moving completed items to the bottom. Notes
themselves can include Markdown to-do lists.</p>

<p>Joplin supports synchronization via a number of FOSS and proprietary
synchronization methods. The easiest open-source option is likely <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/nextcloud">Nextcloud</a>, a
widely used self-hosted cloud-storage solution, with synchronization via
its <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/webdav">WebDAV</a>
interface. It requires a properly configured Nextcloud instance and
authentication credentials. WebDAV support extends beyond Nextcloud,
permitting synchronization with any WebDAV-compatible server. This
requires manually entering the server URL and credentials.</p>

<p>Joplin offers an account-synchronization feature that allows access
from multiple devices and enables note sharing with other users. <a href="https://joplinapp.org/plans/">Joplin Cloud</a> is a paid
cloud-storage service. It also supports synchronization methods
besides Joplin Cloud, making it possible to choose based on
infrastructure and privacy requirements. It also has <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/onedrive">OneDrive</a>
integration, which relies on their respective APIs to store and
retrieve encrypted note data from these services. Users must
authenticate through OAuth, and Joplin manages synchronization
automatically. Each method operates based on Joplin&#39;s <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/spec/server_delta_sync/">delta-based
sync API</a>, which minimizes data transfer by only updating modified
items.</p>

<p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/terminal#local-filesystem-synchronisation">Local
filesystem synchronization</a> is another option. This method is
suitable for those using external synchronization tools like <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/using-syncthing-with-joplin/19889">Syncthing</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>, or a shared
network drive. Since this approach does not involve cloud storage, it
offers complete data control but requires additional configuration for
multi-device synchronization.</p>

<p>Joplin notes can be encrypted by providing a master password. This
gives users <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/e2ee">end-to-end
encryption</a> if they are using any of the synchronization
providers. Note that this does not encrypt Joplin&#39;s data stored in
SQLite or other user data.</p>

<h4 id="interface-and-workflow">Interface and workflow</h4>

<p>Joplin&#39;s interface is structured as a three-pane layout. The left
pane serves as the navigation panel, displaying a hierarchical list of
notebooks and sub-notebooks, along with user-defined tags. This panel
also provides quick access to synchronization status and configuration
settings. The application requires no special configuration, so one can
start writing immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1016512/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/joplin-sm.png" alt="[Joplin&#39;s interface]" title="Joplin&#39;s interface" border="0"/>
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The central pane is the note list, where notes within the selected
notebook are displayed. Notes are sorted by configurable criteria such
as modification date, creation date, or title. Each note entry in this
pane includes metadata such as title, timestamp, and an optional preview
of the content. Joplin supports both list-based and board-style task
management, with drag-and-drop functionality for reordering or changing
task states.</p>

<p>The rightmost pane functions as the editor and viewer. This content
area dynamically updates based on the selection, showing a list or
board-style view of tasks, notes, or documents. Sorting and filtering
options allow organization by parameters. Joplin supports multiple
editor modes, including a rich-text WYSIWYG editor and a Markdown
editor with a split-view preview. The Markdown editor supports <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark syntax</a> with extensions
for functionality such as checkboxes, footnotes, and mathematical
expressions. Code blocks are rendered with syntax highlighting using
<a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>.</p>

<p>The interface includes a toolbar with essential formatting controls,
a search bar supporting full-text search with filtering options, and a
command palette for quick access to features via keyboard shortcuts.
Additionally, Joplin supports a distraction-free mode, which can be
activated by toggling individual panes. The entire UI is configurable,
with support for themes and a customizable CSS file for further styling
adjustments.</p>

<p>The latest version, <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v3.2.13">v3.2.13</a>,
contains some minor bug fixes and was released at the end of
February 2025. Joplin version 3.2 introduced several
new features. The multi-window support allows notes, but not
notebooks, to be opened in separate windows. This means users can
finally have multiple notes open at a time, which makes it much easier
to compare content, cross-reference materials, and organize
projects. It may not be immediately obvious how to do this, however,
as the option to open new windows is buried in a context menu. To open
notes in a separate window, right-click on a note and select the &#34;Edit
in…&#34; option. This launches the note in a new, dedicated window for
editing or viewing. The feature required <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11181">significant
architectural changes</a>, which included enabling independent
operation of multiple windows with synchronized states to ensure
real-time updates.</p>

<p>The note list now supports <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/9924">multi-column
layouts</a>, allowing sorting and display based on various metadata
fields. By selecting &#34;Detailed&#34; as the &#34;Note list style&#34; from the &#34;View&#34;
menu, users can view and edit notes along with their metadata (last
modification date, completion status, etc.) directly in the central
pane.</p>

<p>System <a href="https://github.com/DistributedProofreaders/guiguts-py/issues/785">theme
detection</a> has been implemented, which automatically aligns the
application&#39;s appearance with the desktop&#39;s dark or light theme. In
addition to the generic &#34;Light&#34; and &#34;Dark&#34; themes, it is possible to
choose from other color combinations, such as &#34;Dracula&#34; or &#34;Solarized
Light&#34;. <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/10795">Accessibility
enhancements</a> include improved keyboard navigation and optimized
user-interface contrast. For example, previously, pressing <tt>Shift+Tab</tt>
from the notebook list would cause the focus to jump unexpectedly to
the editor. This problem has <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11641">been
addressed</a> by changing the behavior of the shortcut, which now
moves focus to the &#34;Add new notebook&#34; button. Moreover, the contrast
of scroll bars has been improved, making them more
distinguishable.</p>

<p>Developers can extend Joplin&#39;s functionality using its
JavaScript-based <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/api/">Extension
API</a>, which integrates with the Electron framework. The API allows
access to core features like note management, UI modification, and data
synchronization. <a href="https://joplinapp.org/plugins/">Plugins</a>
are defined via a manifest file and can be developed using JavaScript or
TypeScript. Those already available offer a wide range of features. For
example, the <a href="https://joplinapp.org/plugins/plugin/plugin.calebjohn.MathMode/">Math
Mode</a> plugin allows using a note page as a calculator.</p>

<p>Joplin supports drawing functionality through the default inclusion
of the <a href="https://joplinapp.org/plugins/plugin/io.github.personalizedrefrigerator.js-draw/">Freehand
Drawing plugin</a>. It can be used to create and manipulate free-form
sketches or annotations directly within the interface, using
vector-based rendering. However, its feature set remains limited
compared to dedicated graphic-design software.</p>

<p>Joplin&#39;s <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/ocr/">optical
character recognition (OCR) feature</a> scans documents like PDFs that
are attached to notes. It offers reliable performance for scanning
documents with printed text, but is not yet ready for handwritten
notes. The project is looking to expand its OCR functionality to support
<a href="https://joplinapp.org/news/20241217-project-4-htr/">handwritten
text recognition</a>. Joplin&#39;s OCR yields acceptable results when
applied to high-resolution documents with a linear
layout. Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios where I have tried to
use it, its usefulness has been limited for documents that have
complex formatting like tables. Users may have better luck with other
OCR systems on Linux that perform better than Joplin&#39;s built-in
system, though it is convenient to have an integrated option.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/">Help section</a> of the Joplin web
site and the <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/">Discourse
forum</a> serve as good starting points to find help, if needed.</p>

<h4 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h4>

<p>Joplin has several limitations that may impact its usability,
performance, and extensibility. Since it is based on Electron, Joplin
has higher resource consumption compared to native
alternatives. Memory usage can be high compared to native
applications, especially when handling large note collections or
extensive synchronization operations. For example, Joplin consumes
more than 500MB of RAM right after startup on my system according to
Ubuntu&#39;s System Monitor. Joplin may feel sluggish on lower-end or
older hardware due to Electron&#39;s overhead.</p>

<p>Synchronization, though flexible, depends on external storage
providers or self-hosted solutions. Performance varies based on the
selected backend, with WebDAV implementations often experiencing latency
issues due to inconsistent server performance. Joplin&#39;s delta-based sync
mechanism reduces data transfer, but initial synchronization of large
note sets can be slow. Additionally, its <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/conflict/">conflict resolution</a>
is limited, requiring manual intervention when multiple edits occur on
different devices before synchronization.</p>

<p>The WYSIWYG editor can introduce inconsistencies when switching
between rich text and Markdown modes, particularly for complex
formatting structures. Table editing is limited, requiring manual
adjustments in Markdown mode. Joplin&#39;s plugin ecosystem faces
limitations due to the constraints imposed by the underlying Electron
framework, which affect the scope and performance of potential
extensions.</p>

<h4 id="development">Development</h4>

<p>As an Electron application, Joplin is mostly written in
JavaScript and TypeScript. The project releases <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/release_cycle">three major
versions per year</a> and has a roadmap with feature-freeze dates and
tentative release dates through May 2027, though the roadmap does not
indicate specific features planned for those versions. The development
approach is adaptive, with priorities shaped by user feedback, <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pulls">pull requests</a>, and
community discussions. This means that while major release dates are
scheduled, the exact features and improvements included in each version
are determined closer to their release.</p>

<p>When a new stable release of Joplin is published, older versions do
not receive further updates. So, for example, the 3.2.x line is still
receiving updates, and 3.3.x is the development branch. The 3.1.x
versions are no longer being updated. The <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/">Contributing to Joplin page</a>
provides a starting point for contributing. There, users can choose an
area to get involved in.</p> 

<p>To enable access to <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/about/prereleases">pre-releases</a>,
navigate to the Configuration menu, open the &#34;Application&#34; section, and
enable the option labeled &#34;Get pre-releases when checking for updates&#34;.
Bugs encountered in pre-release versions can be reported either on
GitHub or the Joplin forum. The latest Joplin desktop pre-release, <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/desktop-pre-release-v3-3-is-now-available-updated-16-03-2025/43840">version
3.3.3</a>, focuses on accessibility, performance, and usability
improvements. Key updates include new features such as multiple
instance support, an upgrade to Electron 35.0.1, and various bug
fixes.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>While Joplin provides flexibility, performance can vary depending on
the synchronization method, and users may have problems with delayed
content updates across devices. The interface is functional, supporting
both Markdown and rich-text editing, but it may feel less polished or
intuitive compared to proprietary alternatives like Obsidian. The plugin
system is still developing, and mobile performance can be limited.
Overall, Joplin is a solid choice, but users may encounter a few rough
patches depending on how they use the application.</p></div></div>
