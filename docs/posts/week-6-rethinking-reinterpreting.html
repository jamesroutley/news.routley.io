    <h1>Week 6: Rethinking, reinterpreting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week, I said </span><strong>I was going to try to make a much nicer data model</strong><span> for my Elixir / Phoenix IMDB app. I made </span><strong>this assumption</strong><span> based on the belief </span><strong>that the IMDB API I was using had access to the additional data I needed</strong><span>. Unfortunately, I realized after some research that </span><strong>this was not the case</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>It turns out that </span><strong>if I want to show some of the IMDB data</strong><span> I’d like to display, </span><strong><span>I’d have to write a web scraper, or download, extract, and parse some of their </span><a href="https://datasets.imdbws.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">daily-updated datasets</a></strong><span>. I’m not too interested in writing a web scraper at the moment (and I’m afraid it might break regularly when the IMDB page changes their layout), but parsing their data files seems like it could work, even if I’ll have to pay a bit to fly.io to get enough space on the server to hold the files.</span></p><p><span>But by the time I realized this (near the end of last week), </span><strong>I realized I’d been working on this app for a while now, and could use a break</strong><span>. It seems like a lot of other Recursers are thinking the same thing as we come up on the midpoint of our batch, so it’s only natural I suppose.</span></p><p><span>After some thought, I decided </span><strong><span>I wanted my next project to be working through </span><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Crafting Interpreter</a></strong><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">s</a><span>, since one of my fellow Recursers is going through the book currently too, and it feels like the most important gap in my knowledge that I think would be best to work through with someone else. I started the book today, and it really is such a pleasant read so far (the drawings! The examples! The tone! The lettering!) It’s a lovely introduction to an intimidating topic, and </span><strong>I’m really looking forward to reading it! And to sharing what I learn from reading it with you all too, of course.</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>I promise </span><strong>I’ll return later to my Elixir / Phoenix app eventually</strong><span>, though, to get that data read in and looking pretty! Just switching gears for a little bit. </span></p><p><span>Oh, and about </span><strong>that promised post about Elixir’s pattern matching</strong><span>: I realized that, since Elixir already has </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/patterns-and-guards.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a good doc about this</a><span>, </span><strong>my time would be be better spent doing a short teaser presentation</strong><span> to get people interested in the power of pattern matching instead. </span><strong><span>You can find it on Youtube </span><a href="https://youtu.be/hgd2SEmwj5U" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a></strong><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
