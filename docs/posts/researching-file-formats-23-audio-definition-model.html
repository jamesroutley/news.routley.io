<p><span>01 Feb 2024</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>This format is about audio, but it’s a text-based document that describes audio. You can say it <em>defines</em> an <em>audio model</em>. It is typically stored as XML, but JSON is a valid option, too. While the rest of the software engineering field goes “ick” when it hears about XML, both the cultural heritage sector and audio/video media engineering sector still use it heavily.</p>

<p>ADM is coming out of research from the <a href="https://adm.ebu.io/">European Broadcasting Union</a>, which have other hits like <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/metadata/ebucore">EBUCore</a> for describing media elements. The idea behind ADM is to standardize how audio is stored, inspired by the rise of extra high-def sounds (like, going beyond Dolby 5.1). Where does it go, physically? Or are there different language tracks? If so, what are the order? Stereo and/or mono, or something else?</p>

<p>Formally, “Audio for broadcasting and cinema is evolving towards an immersive and interactive experience, which requires the use of more flexible audio formats. A fixed channel-based approach is not sufficient to encompass these developments and so combinations of channel, object and scene-based formats are being developed” (<a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.2076-2-201910-I!!PDF-E.pdf">source</a>)</p>

<p>BBC R&amp;D seems like they are quite invested in this format, making a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/audio-definition-model-software">toolkit for ADM usage</a>.</p>
