  <p>It is my increasingly firm belief that computers are tools that strip us of our humanity, converting our behaviour and thoughts into data that can be captured and commodified by other machines and their owners. They are not “just tools” – how can they be when we consider who made them and for what purposes, and how they continue to be used in our social and work lives?</p>

<blockquote>The computer. The Internet. Artificial intelligence. These are military technologies, first and foremost. First and foremost and for a while now. And while certainly we must resist the teleology that positions these technologies always and forever thus, we have accomplished little, I&#39;d argue, in wresting them free from their origins in “command control communication intelligence,” from that cybernetic move to reduce everyone and everything to code.</blockquote>

<p>Many of us work in jobs that involve using computers and we are no doubt dealing with lots of <em>data</em>. We also have mortgages to pay and children to put through marketised education systems that have shifted the cost from the state to individuals. Living is an expensive, precarious undertaking. We have little to no freedom in forming the shape of our jobs, and the use of <i>analytics</i> – a term rooted in the military, surveillance and finance – in some form or other.</p>
<p>If you work in digital marketing, you’ll deal in depersonalising, martial and downright hostile language every day. We undertake <i>campaigns</i>, formulate a <i>strategy</i> and <i>tactics</i>, <i>track</i> website visitors – often without them knowing – and <i>convert prospects</i>. Data is a key weapon in this war.</p>
<p>How useful this activity is for anyone apart from Google is the subject of a different article. But consider whether you want – let alone need – to be doing this to your readers on your personal website.</p>
<p>When I started this blog – 17 years ago! – I installed WordPress’s analytics plugin, which told me how many people were visiting, what they looked at and who was linking to me. I didn’t ask whether I could track this information, and no-one volunteered it. Regardless of whether it was <i>anonymised</i> (yet another grisly marketing term), I was <i>surveilling</i> my readers.</p>

<p>I ditched analytics quite early in this blog’s history when I realised that knowing about my website visitors had zero effect on anything in the real world. For example, when Smashing Magazine linked to a WordPress theme I’d published I got thousands of visitors over a couple of days. The only practical outcome was that a couple of people approached me to redesign their websites. This would have happened regardless of whether I knew that I’d been linked to, and how many clicks this link had generated.</p>
<p>The other reason you might put analytics on your site is to know when someone links to your writing. Again, if the linker doesn’t intend to tell you, then you’re surveilling. You do not <em>need</em> to know every time your writing is mentioned.</p>
<p>If you link to someone else and you’d like them to know, there are ways to automate a notification, through <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a>, for example, or you can do the radical thing and actually tell them by sending an email or message on social media.</p>
<p>We should resist the urge to data-fy and commodify our personal websites. Unintuitively, that means smaller, more closed communities and networks where communication is intentional rather than automated and surveilled. You’ll never know everything about your website, or its readers, and nor should you.</p>
