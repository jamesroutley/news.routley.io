    <h1>Ask HN: Which books/resources to understand modern Assembler?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d like to learn more about Assembler in order to be able to work with LLVM and JIT as well as to write high performance low-level code. I’m familiar with the basics of x86 but I haven’t touched Assembler in a while, so I’m wondering which resources and in particular books you’d recommend?</p></div></div>
