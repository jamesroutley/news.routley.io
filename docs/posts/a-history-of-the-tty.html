    <h1>A History of the TTY</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>It&#39;s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern technology.
From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in appliances, there
must be uncountable devices that think they are connected to a TTY.</p>
<p>I will omit the many interesting details of the Linux terminal infrastructure
here, as it could easily fill its own article. But most Linux users are at
least peripherally aware that the kernel tends to identify both serial devices
and terminals as TTYs, assigning them filesystem names in the form of
/dev/tty*. Probably a lot of those people remember that this stands for
teletype or perhaps teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter
is more common.</p>
<p>Indeed, from about the 1950s (the genesis of electronic computers) to the 1970s
(the rise of video display terminals/VDTs), teleprinters were the most common
form of interactive human-machine interface. The &#34;interactive&#34; distinction here
is important; early computers were built primarily around noninteractive input
and output, often using punched paper tape. Interactive operation was a more
advanced form of computing, one that took almost until the widespread use of
VDTs to mature. Look into the computers of the 1960s especially, the early days
of interactive operation, and you will be amazed at how bizarre and unfriendly
the command interface is. It wasn&#39;t really intended for people to use; it was
for the Computer Operator (who had attended a lengthy training course on the
topic) to troubleshoot problems in the noninteractive workload.</p>
<p>But interactive computing is yet another topic I will one day take on. Right
now, I want to talk about the heritage of these input/output mechanisms. Why is
it that punched paper tape and the teleprinter were the most obvious way to
interact with the first electronic computers? As you might suspect, the
arrangement was one of convenience. Paper tape punches and readers were already
being manufactured, as were teleprinters. They were both used for
communications.</p>
<p>Most people who hear about the telegraph think of Morse code keys and rhythmic
beeping. Indeed, Samuel Morse is an important figure in the history of
telegraphy. The form of &#34;morse code&#34; that we tend to imagine, though, a
continuous wave &#34;beep,&#34; is mostly an artifact of radio. For telegraphs, no
carrier wave or radio modulation was required. You can transmit a message
simply by interrupting the current on a wire.</p>
<p>This idea is rather simple to conceive and even to implement, so it&#39;s no
surprise that telegraphy has a long history. By the end of the 18th century
inventors in Europe and Great Britain were devising simple electrical
telegraphs. These early telegraphs had limited ranges and even more limited
speeds, though, a result mostly of the lack of a good way to indicate to the
operator whether or not a current was present. It is an intriguing aspect of
technical history that the first decades of experimentation with electricity
were done with only the clumsiest means of measuring or even detecting it.</p>
<p>In 1820, three physicists or inventors (these were vague titles at the time)
almost simultaneously worked out that electrical current induced a magnetic
field. They invented various ways of demonstrating the effect, usually by
deflecting a magnetic needle. This innovation quickly lead to the
&#34;electromagnetic telegraph,&#34; in which a telegrapher operates a key to switch
current, which causes a needle or flag to deflect at the other end of the
circuit. This was tremendously simpler than previous means of indicating
current and was applied almost immediately to build the first practical
telegraphs. During the 1830s, the invention of the relay allowed telegraph
signals to be repeated or amplified as the potential weakened (the origin of
the term &#34;relay&#34;). Edward Davy, one of the inventors of the relay, also
invented the telegraph recorder.</p>
<p>From 1830 to 1850, so many people invented so many telegraph systems that it is
difficult to succinctly describe how an early practical telegraph worked. There
were certain themes: for non-recording systems, a needle was often deflected
one way or the other by the presence or absence of current, or perhaps by
polarity reversal. Sometimes the receiver would strike a bell or sound a buzzer
with each change. In recording systems, a telegraph printer or telegraph
recorder embossed a hole or left a small mark on a paper tape that advanced
through the device. In the first case, the receiving operator would watch the
needle, interpreting messages as they came. In the second case, the operator
could examine the paper tape at their leisure, interpreting the message based
on the distances between the dots.</p>
<p>Recording systems tended to be used for less time-sensitive operations like
passing telegrams between cities, while non-recording telegraphs were used for
more real-time applications like railroad dispatch and signaling. Regardless,
it is important to understand that the teleprinter is about as old as the
telegraph. Many early telegraphs recorded received signals onto paper.</p>
<p>The interpretation of telegraph signals was as varied as the equipment that
carried them. Samuel Morse popularized the telegraph in the United States based
in part on his alphabetic code, but it was not the first. Gauss famously
devised a binary encoding for alphabetic characters a few years earlier, which
resembles modern character encodings more than Morse&#39;s scheme. In many telegraph
applications, though, there was no alphabetic code at all. Railroad signal
telegraphs, for example, often used application-specific schemes that encoded
types of trains and routes instead of letters.</p>
<p>Morse&#39;s telegraph system was very successful in the United States, and in 1861
a Morse telegraph line connected the coasts. It surprises some that a
transcontinental telegraph line was completed some fifty years before the
transcontinental telephone line. Telegraphy is older, though, because it is
simpler. There is no analog signaling involved; simple on/off or polarity
signals can be amplified using simple mechanical relays. The tendency to
view text as more complex than voice (SMS came after the first cellphones,
for one) has more to do with the last 50 years than the 50 years before.</p>
<p>The Morse telegraph system was practical enough to spawn a large industry, but
suffered a key limitation: the level of experience required to key and copy
Morse quickly and reliably is fairly high. Telegraphers were skilled and, thus,
fairly well paid and sometimes in short supply [1]. To drive down the cost of
telegraphy, there would need to be more automation.</p>
<p>Many of the earliest telegraph designs had employed parallel signaling. A
common scheme was to provide one wire for each letter, and a common return.
These were impractical to build over any meaningful distance, and Morse&#39;s
one-wire design (along with one-wire designs by others) won out for obvious
reasons. The idea of parallel signaling stayed around, though, and was
reintroduced during the 1840s with a simple form of multiplexing: one &#34;logical
channel&#34; for each letter could be combined onto one wire using time division
muxing, for example by using a transmitter and receiver with synchronized
spinning wheels. Letters would be presented by positions on the wheel, and a
pulse sent at the appropriate point in the revolution to cause the teleprinter
to produce that letter. With this alphabetic teleprinter, an experienced
operator was no longer required to receive messages. They appeared as text on a
strip of paper, ready for an unskilled clerk to read or paste onto a message
card.</p>
<p>This system proved expensive but still practical to operate, and a network of
such alphabetic teleprinters was built in the United States during the mid 19th
century. A set of smaller telegraph companies operating one such system, called
the Hughes system after its inventor, joined together to become the Western
Union Telegraph Company. In a precedent that would be followed even more closely
by the telephone system, practical commercial telegraphy was intertwined with a
monopoly.</p>
<p>The Hughes system was functional but costly. The basic idea of multiplexing
across 30 channels was difficult to achieve with mechanical technology. Ã‰mile
Baudot was employed by the French telegraph service to find a way to better
utilize telegraph lines. He first developed a proper form of multiplexing,
using synchronized switches to combine five Hughes system messages onto one
wire and separate them again at the other end. Likely inspired by his close
inspection of the Hughes system and its limitations, Baudot went on to develop
a more efficient scheme for the transmission of alphabetic messages: the Baudot
code.</p>
<p>Baudot&#39;s system was similar to the Hughes system in that it relied on a
transmitter and receiver kept in synchronization to interpret pulses as
belonging to the correct logical channel. He simplified the design, though, by
allowing for only five logical channels. Instead of each pulse representing a
letter, the combination of all five channels would be used to form one symbol.
The Baudot code was a five-bit binary alphabetic encoding, and most computer
alphabetic encodings to the present day are at least partially derived from it.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of Baudot&#39;s design is that it was not quite as easy to
operate as telegraphy companies would hope. Baudot equipment could keep up 30
words per minute with a skilled operator who could work the five-key
piano-style keyboard in good synchronization with the mechanical armature that
read it out. This took a great deal of practice, though, and pressing keys out
of synchronization with the transmitter could easily cause incorrect letters to
be sent.</p>
<p>In 1901, during the early days of the telephone, Donald Murray developed an
important enhancement to the Baudot system. He was likely informed by an older
practice that had been developed for Morse telegraphs, of having an operator
punch a Morse message into paper tape to be transmitted by a simple tape reader
later.  He did the same for Baudot code: he designed a device with an easy to
use typewriter-like keyboard that punched Baudot code onto a strip of paper
tape with five rows, one for each bit. The tape punch had no need to be
synchronized with the other end, and the operator could type at whatever pace
they were comfortable.</p>
<p>The invention of Murray&#39;s tape punch brought about the low-cost telegram
networks that we are familiar with from the early 20th century. A clerk would
take down a message and then punch it onto paper tape. Later, the paper tape
would be inserted into a reader that transmitted the Baudot message in perfect
synchronization with the receiver, a teleprinter that typed it onto tape as
text once again. The process of encoding and decoding messages for the
telegraph was now fully automated.</p>
<p>The total operation of the system, though, was not. For one, the output was
paper tape, that had to be cut and pasted to compose a paragraph of text.
For another, the transmitting and receiving equipment operated continuously,
requiring operators to coordinate on the scheduling of sending messages (or
they would tie up the line and waste a lot of paper tape).</p>
<p>In a wonderful time capsule of early 20th century industrialism, the next major
evolution would come about with considerable help from the Morton Salt Company.
Joy Morton, its founder, agreed to fund Frank Pearne&#39;s efforts to develop an
even more practical printing telegraph. This device would use a typewriter
mechanism to produce the output as normal text on a page, saving considerable
effort by clerks. Even better, it would use a system of control codes to
indicate the beginning and end of messages, allowing a teleprinter to operate
largely unattended. This was more complex than it sounded, as it required
finding a way for the two ends to establish clock synchronization before the
message.</p>
<p>There were, it turned out, others working on the same concept. After a series
of patent disputes, mergers, and negotiations, the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company
would market this new technology. A fully automated teleprinter, lurching into
life when the other end had a message to send, producing pages of text like a
typewriter with an invisible typist.</p>
<p>In 1928, Morkrum-Kleinschmidt adopted a rather more memorable name: the
Teletype Corporation. During the development of the Teletype system, the
telephone network had grown into a nationwide enterprise and one of the United
States&#39; largest industrial ventures (at many points in time, the country&#39;s
single largest employer). AT&amp;T had already entered the telegraph business by
leasing its lines for telegraph use, and work had already begun on telegraphs
that could operate over switched telephone lines, transmitting text as if it
were a phone call. The telephone was born of the telegraph but came to consume
it. In 1930, the Teletype Corporation was purchased by AT&amp;T and became part of
Western Electric.</p>
<p>That same year, Western Electric introduced the Teletype Model 15. Receiving
Baudot at 45 baud [2] with an optional tape punch and tape reader, the Model 15
became a workhorse of American communications. By some accounts, the Model 15
was instrumental in the prosecution of World War II. The War Department made
extensive use of AT&amp;T-furnished teletype networks and Model 15 teleprinters as
the core of the military logistics enterprise. The Model 15 was still being
manufactured as late as 1963, a production record rivaled by few other
electrical devices.</p>
<p>It is difficult to summarize the history of the networks that teleprinters
enabled. The concept of switching connections between teleprinters, as was done
on the phone network, was an obvious one. The dominant switched teleprinter
network was Telex, not really an organization but actually a set of standards
promulgated by the ITU. The most prominent US implementation of Telex was an
AT&amp;T service called TWX, short for Teletypewriter Exchange Service. TWX used
Teletype teleprinters on phone lines (in a special class of service), and was
a very popular service for business use from the &#39;40s to the &#39;70s.</p>
<p>Incidentally, TWX was assigned the special purpose area codes 510, 610, 710,
810, and 910, which contained only teleprinters. These area codes would
eventually be assigned to other uses, but for a long time ranked among the
&#34;unusual&#34; NPAs.</p>
<p>Western Union continued to develop their telegraph network during the era of
TWX, acting in many ways as a sibling or shadow of AT&amp;T. Like AT&amp;T, Western
Union developed multiplexing schemes to make better use of their long-distance
telegraph lines. Like AT&amp;T, Western Union developed automatic switching systems
to decrease operator expenses. Like AT&amp;T, Western Union built out a microwave
network to increase the capacity of their long-haul network. Telegraphy is one
of the areas where AT&amp;T struggled despite their vast network, and Western Union
kept ahead of them, purchasing the TWX service from AT&amp;T. Western Union would
continue to operate the switched teleprinter network, under the Telex name,
into the &#39;80s when it largely died out in favor of the newly developed fax
machine.</p>
<p>During the era of TWX, encoding schemes changed several times as AT&amp;T and
Western Union developed better and faster equipment (Western Union continued to
make use of Western Electric-built Teletype machines among other equipment).
ASCII came to replace Baudot, and so a number of ASCII teleprinters existed.
There were also hybrids. For some time Western Union operated teleprinters on
an ASCII variant that provided only upper case letters and some punctuation,
with the benefit of requiring fewer bits. The encoding and decoding of this
reduced ASCII set was implemented by the Bell 101 telephone modem, designed in
1958 to allow SAGE computers to communicate with one another and then widely
included in TWX and Telex teleprinters. The Bell 101&#39;s descendants would bring
about remote access to time-sharing computer systems and, ultimately, one of
the major forms of long-distance computer networking.</p>
<p>You can see, then, that the history of teleprinters and the history of
computers are naturally interleaved. From an early stage, computers operated
primarily on streams of characters. This basic concept is still the core of
many modern computer systems and, not coincidentally, also describes the
operation of teleprinters.</p>
<p>When electronic computers were under development in the 1950s and 1960s,
teleprinters were near the apex of their popularity as a medium for business
communications. Most people working on computers probably had experience with
teleprinters; most organizations working on computers already had a number of
teleprinters installed. It was quite natural that teleprinter technology would
be repurposed as a means of input and output for computers.</p>
<p>Some of the very earliest computers, for example those of Konrad Zuse, employed
punched tape as an input medium. These were almost invariably repurposed or
modified telegraphic punched tape systems, often in five-bit Baudot.
Particularly in retrospect, as more materials have become available to
historians, it is clear that much of the groundwork for digital computing was
laid by WWII cryptological efforts.</p>
<p>Newly devised cryptographic machines like the Lorenz ciphers were essentially
teleprinters with added digital logic. The machines built to attack these
codes, like Colossus, are now generally recognized as the first programmable
computers. The line between teleprinter and computer was not always clear. As
more encoding and control logic was added, teleprinters came to resemble simple
computers.</p>
<p>The Manchester Mark I, a pioneer of stored-program computing built in 1949,
used a 5-bit code adopted from Baudot by none other than Alan Turing. The major
advantage of this 5-bit encoding was, of course, that programs could be read
and written using Baudot tape and standard telegraph equipment. The addition of
a teleprinter allowed operators to &#34;interactively&#34; enter instructions into the
computer and read the output, although the concept of a shell (or any other
designed user interface) had not yet been developed. EDSAC, a contemporary of
the Mark I and precursor to a powerful tea logistics system that would set off
the development of business computing, also used a teleprinter for input and
output.</p>
<p>Many early commercial computers limited input and output to paper tape, often
5-bit for Baudot or 8-bit for ASCII with parity, as in the early days of
computing preparation of a program was an exacting process that would not
typically be done &#34;on the fly&#34; at a keyboard. It was, of course, convenient
that teleprinters with tape punches could be used to prepare programs for entry
into the computer.</p>
<p>Business computing is most obviously associated with IBM, a company that had
large divisions building both computers and typewriters. The marriage of the
two was inevitable considering the existing precedent. Beginning around 1960 it
was standard for IBM computers to furnish a teleprinter as the operator
interface, but IBM had a distinct heritage from the telecommunications industry
and, for several reasons, was intent on maintaining that distinction. IBM&#39;s
teleprinter-like devices were variously called Data Communications Systems,
Printer-Keyboards, Consoles, and eventually Terminals. They generally operated
over proprietary serial channels.</p>
<p>Other computer manufacturers didn&#39;t have typewriter divisions, and typewriters
and teleprinters were actually rather complex mechanical devices and not all
that easy to build. As a result, they tended to buy teleprinters from
established manufacturers, often IBM or Western Electric. Consider the case of
a rather famous non-IBM computer, the DEC PDP-1 of 1960. It came with a CRT
graphics display as standard, and many sources will act as if this was the
primary operator interface, but it is important to understand that early CRT
graphics displays had a hard time with text. Text is rather complex to render
when you are writing point-by-point to a CRT vector display from a rather slow
machine. You would be surprised how many vertices a sentence has in it.</p>
<p>So despite the ready availability of CRTs in the 1960s (they were, of course,
well established in the television industry), few computers used them for
primary text input/output. Instead, the PDP-1 was furnished with a modified IBM
typewriter as its console. This scheme of paying a third-party company (Soroban
Engineering) to modify IBM typewriters for teleprinter control was apparently
not very practical, and later DEC PDP models tended to use Western Electric
Teletypes as user terminals. These had the considerable advantage that they
were already designed to operate over long telephone circuits, making it easy
to install multiple terminals throughout a building for time sharing use.</p>
<p>Indeed, time sharing was a natural fit for teleprinter terminals. With a
teleprinter and a computer with a suitable modem, you could &#34;call in&#34; to a time
sharing computer over the telephone from a remote office. Most of the first
practical &#34;computer networks&#34; (term used broadly) were not actually networks of
computers, but a single computer with many remote terminals.  This architecture
evolved into the BBS and early Internet-like services such as CompuServe. The
idea was surprisingly easy to implement once time sharing operating systems
were developed; the necessary hardware was already available from Western
Electric.</p>
<p>While I cannot swear to the accuracy of this attribution, many sources suggest
that the term &#34;tty&#34; as a generic reference to a user terminal or serial I/O
channel originated with DEC. It seems reasonable; DEC&#39;s software was very
influential on the broader computer industry, particularly outside of IBM.
UNIX originally targeted a PDP-11 with teleprinters. While I can&#39;t prove it, it
seems quite believable that the tty terminology was adopted directly from RT-11
or another operating system that Bell Labs staff might have used on the PDP-11.</p>
<p>Computers were born of the teleprinter and would inevitably come to consume
them. After all, what is a computer but a complex teleprinter? Today,
displaying text and accepting it from a keyboard is among the most basic
functions of computers, and computers continue to perform this task using an
architecture that would be familiar to engineers in the 1970s. They would
likely be more surprised by what hasn&#39;t changed than what has: many of us still
spend a lot of time in graphical software pretending to be a video display
terminal built for compatibility with teleprinters.</p>
<p>And we&#39;re still using that 7-bit ASCII code a lot, aren&#39;t we. At least Baudot
died out and we get to enjoy lower case letters.</p>
<p>[1] Actor, singer, etc. Gene Autry had worked as a telegrapher before he began
his career in entertainment. This resulted in no small number of stories of a
celebrity stand-in at the telegraph office. Yes, this is about to be a local
history anecdote. It is fairly reliably reported that Gene Autry once
volunteered to stand in for the telegrapher and station manager at the small
Santa Fe Railroad station in Socorro, New Mexico, as the telegrapher had been
temporarily overwhelmed by the simultaneous arrival of a packed train and a
series of telegrams. There are enough of these stories about Gene that I think
he really did keep his Morse sharp well into his acting career.</p>
<p>[2] Baud is a somewhat confusing unit derived from Baudot. Baud refers to the
number of symbols per second on the underlying communication medium. For simple
binary systems (and thus many computer communications systems we encounter
daily), baud rate is equivalent to bit rate (bps). For systems that employ
multi-level signaling, the bit rate will be higher than the baud rate, as
multiple bits are represented per symbol on the wire. Methods like QAM are
useful because they result in bit rates that are many multiples of the baud
rate, reducing the bandwidth on the wire.</p>
