<p>Dear Duxbury Community,</p>
<p>This week brings sad news for our Duxbury Systems family. Our colleague, David Holladay, passed away in a hospital on Thursday, February 15th, following an accident at home that morning. David was a cancer survivor and valiantly battled multiple medical problems over his last five years.</p>
<p>David was an early innovator in braille software. Together, he and his wife, Caryn Navy, founded Raised Dot Computing (later Braille Planet) in 1981. David’s early work on Apple II computers was groundbreaking in support of accessibility for blind users through speech and production of braille and of print from braille input. He went on to support production of print math from Nemeth Code mathematics braille. Later work at Raised Dot Computing culminated in the introduction of MegaDots, an innovative product with unparalleled support for braille formats.</p>
<p>David and Caryn joined Duxbury Systems in 1999 and have been part of the family ever since. David’s work at Duxbury focused largely on extending the reach of DBT to many, many countries and languages around the world. Though confined to bed over the last several years of his life, David’s passion for braille wouldn’t allow him to rest. He was working until his very last day.</p>
<p>It is our belief that the larger braille world will miss David as much as we do here at Duxbury.</p>
<hr/>
<p>David’s funeral will be at Congregation Shalom in Chelmsford Massachusetts at noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, with burial at 1 PM at Beth El Cemetery in Chelmsford.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I am responding to the devastating announcement about my dearest husband David Holladay’s passing, to add the information on streaming his funeral service.</p>
<p>Streaming of the service, scheduled for noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, Feb. 19, will be available during or after the service at: <a href="https://congregationshalom.org/worship-2/">congregationshalom.org/worship-2/</a>.</p>
<p>Press the Play button just after the level 3 heading “Live streaming of services is now available!” Note that if your screen reader does not recognize that as a button, you can use an alternative, such as a simulated left click.</p>
<p>With warmest regards for the community that meant so much to David,</p>
