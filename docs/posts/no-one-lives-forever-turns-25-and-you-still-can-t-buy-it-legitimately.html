For the most part, this has been
across machines I largely have administrative control over. HPC systems are
always a notable exception. Over the past half year, I’ve found myself working
on dozens of machines where even <code>chezmoi</code> and <code>pixi~/~micromamba</code> workflows
cannot comfortably bring <code>$HOME</code> ergonomics <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="the-road-to-bash-is-paved-with-shell-s">The road to <code>bash</code> is paved with <code>$SHELL</code> s</h3><p>There are far too many today to bother enumerating, but in short order <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p><dl><dt><code>nushell</code></dt><dd>Pleasant for many use-cases, the process of converting my
dotfiles was <a href="https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles/compare/chezmoi...toNu">fairly repetitive</a>, and its incompatibility with <code>spack</code> made it a
non-starter <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</dd><dt><code>fish</code></dt><dd>Adopted to resolve the <code>spack</code> issue. However, I found I was the
wrong audience for it; features like global, browser-based customization are
not useful for my terminal-centric, <code>chezmoi</code> focused workflow <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</dd><dt><code>xonsh</code></dt><dd><a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/xonsh-excursion/">Ergonomic</a>, and better than <code>subprocess</code> for scripts, but a
non-starter in terms of being a good <code>$SHELL</code> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></dd></dl><p>For the most part I had resigned myself to <code>fish</code>. It was fast, needed very few
plugins <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p><p>Eventually I came across <a href="https://www.codyhiar.com/blog/switching-back-to-bash-from-zsh/">this post by Cody Hiar</a> on <code>ble.sh</code>, and decided to take
the plunge and shift back. A driving force for this is also that most of my
<code>dotfiles</code> focus on using <code>rust</code> equivalents of what used to purely <code>SHELL</code>
specific themes / tools; e.g. <code>starship</code> over <code>powerline10k</code>.</p><h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2><p><code>ble.sh</code> is great but it isn’t a catch-all solution. In particular, there are
still inherent issues with using <code>bash</code> as a customized shell, due to concerns
about clobbering settings from existing machines, e.g. <code>lua</code> module
settings.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>POSIX compatibility is here to stay on most machines. It is unlikely that this
will change in the near future. To that end, it makes more sense to adaptively
stick to <code>bash</code> and save my “<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-language-strangeness-budget/">strangeness budget</a>&#34; <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> for new-fangled programming
