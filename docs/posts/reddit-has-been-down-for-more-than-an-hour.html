    <h1>Reddit has been down for more than an hour</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reddit is currently experiencing a big outage affecting its websites and apps, according to <a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/">the company’s status page</a>. I’m consistently seeing an error message when trying to load Reddit on my Chrome browser. </p><p>“We’ve identified an internal systems issue and are working to determine a fix,” the company wrote at 12:56PM ET on its status page. The preceding message, from nearly 40 minutes before, notes that Reddit is “is currently offline.”</p><p>The problem appears to be widespread, with about 50,000 people <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/">reporting issues on Downdetector</a>. Many <em>Verge</em> staffers are experiencing problems loading Reddit as well. </p><p>It’s unclear exactly what the issue is. Reddit’s status page says that both the desktop and mobile web are going through a “major outage,” while native mobile apps are experiencing a “partial outage.” The iOS app is still very broken for me; the Home and Discover tabs are showing content but not comment threads.</p><p>When reached for comment, Reddit spokesperson Courtney Geesey-Dorr pointed to the company’s status page.</p><p><em><strong>Update March 14th, 4:19PM ET</strong>: Added new status update from Reddit.</em></p></div></div></div>
