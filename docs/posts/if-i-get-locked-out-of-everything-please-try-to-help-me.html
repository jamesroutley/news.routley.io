    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m dirt poor. Everyone here should know that.</p><p>So my phone has been failing to charge for three weeks and I bought a new phone today and can&#39;t get it set up because the old one is dead and I can&#39;t get a verification code. So I moved the old sim card on the advice of one of my sons and the codes are still going to the old physical phone and Google says it will send me a link in 72 hours.</p><p>Google is convinced I&#39;m trying to break into my own accounts because I can&#39;t get access to codes on my dead phone. So I may lose my access to my google account, my blogs, etc.</p><p>If anyone has contacts at google and can tell them, yea, verily, Doreen Michele Traylor is a real person who is real poor and we all know her and please let her keep her phone number and her (my full name) google account and get me out of this fucking nightmare, that would be coolios.</p><p>Please and thank you.</p></div></div></div>
