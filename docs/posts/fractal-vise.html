    <h1>Fractal Vise</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><SPAN face="Times New Roman">I have been 
              developing my Morphing™ Fractal jaws for years use with engraving 
              vises. There have been various versions. While there was an old 
              (early 1900s patent) milling machine vise with similar jaws, it was not 
              suitable for use with engraving vises. The patent pending 
              improvements allow for use with engraving vises and other vises. 
              Please be aware of imitators, as the use of jaws with an engraving vise may infringe any patent that 
              issues from my pending patent applications.Â  <b>

              <p><SPAN face="Times New Roman">These fit various 
              makes and sizes of engraving vises.Â  Shown above larger version 
              with 16 fingers on the 90lbs Titan vise.Â Â While smaller 
              8 finger is shown above on a 30lb Goliath and a 12lb PalmControl vise.Â

              However if you would like one you can order by placing a 
              down payment.Â Â  The final price of them has not been 
              determined.Â Â  You will be contacted when yours is ready 
              if you make a down payment.Â  At that time we will know the 
              price and you may pay the remaining balance or you may cancel and 
              have your down payment returned.Â Â Or if at any time you 
              become tired while waiting you may cancel to have your down 
              payment returned.</SPAN>Â  <br/>
