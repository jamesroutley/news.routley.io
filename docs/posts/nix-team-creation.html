    <h1>Nix Team Creation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          
<p>Nix is the cornerstone of the ecosystem, but Nix itself is still mostly developed as if it were one-man project with some occasional contributors.</p>
<p>Having only one acknowledged maintainer has a lot of practical downsides. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of knowledge about the codebase and its future stays implicit, making the codebase harder to approach, and leading to all sorts of misunderstandings with the broader community of users and developers</li>
<li>The response time suffers a lot. Some simple pull requests can linger without any formal approval or rejection for months (or even forever).
<ul>
<li>At the time of this writing, there are <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pulls?page=4&amp;q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+-commenter%3Aedolstra+-commenter%3Athufschmitt">100 open PRs which didn’t get any comment by someone in position of merging them</a>. It means that most of these PRs are in a limbo state where no one knows whether they should eventually be merged or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because of the other reasons, potential contributors are discouraged, meaning that a lot of potential work and expertise is wasted.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remedy these issues, we need to distribute the task of maintaining the Nix package manager to a team of people.</p>
<p>This was already tried in the past with <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/8bb86f8bddd98deb3c03c5698d5eff0b9072d0a7/rfcs/0025-nix-core-team.md">NixOS/rfcs#25</a>. This experiment <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/8bb86f8bddd98deb3c03c5698d5eff0b9072d0a7/rfcs/0044-disband-nix-core.md">was canceled</a> because its scope was too wide (overlapping with the RFC process in particular) and it didn’t yield sufficient results.</p>

<p>We announce the creation of the <em>Nix team</em>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="responsibilities-3" href="#responsibilities-3"></a>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Nix team shall take ownership of the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix">Nix source code</a>:</p>
<p>This includes, but isn’t limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish, communicate, and maintain a technical roadmap</li>
<li>Enable contributors</li>
<li>Ensure capacity for reviewing PRs and addressing issues</li>
<li>Define and assert quality criteria for contributions</li>
<li>Keep code healthy, documentation up to date</li>
<li>Manage the release lifecycle</li>
<li>Regularly publish reports on work done</li>
<li>Engage with third parties in the interest of the project</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="composition-of-the-team-4" href="#composition-of-the-team-4"></a>Composition of the team</h2>
<p>The initial team members are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eelco Dolstra (<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/edolstra">@edolstra</a>) – Team lead</li>
<li>Théophane Hufschmitt (<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/regnat">@regnat</a>)</li>
<li>Valentin Gagarin (<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/fricklerhandwerk">@fricklerhandwerk</a>)</li>
<li>Thomas Bereknyei (<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/tomberek">@tomberek</a>)</li>
<li>Robert Hensing (<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/u/roberth">@roberth</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Team members are expected to commit a sufficient amount of time to work for the team. This implies in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being present at the regular team meetings (or excused)</li>
<li>Taking time between the meetings to work on tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Details on the process of joining or leaving the team will follow.</p>
<h2>
<a name="communication-5" href="#communication-5"></a>Communication</h2>
<p>The primary communication channels for the team are</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nix/issues">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nix/pulls">pull requests</a> through the team’s <a href="https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/projects/19">project board</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nix-dev:nixos.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nix hackers</a> Matrix channel</li>
</ul>
<p>The team holds a weekly meeting every Friday at  <span data-date="2022-10-07" data-time="13:00:00" data-format="LT" data-timezone="Europe/Paris" data-email-preview="2022-10-07T11:00:00Z UTC">11:00 AM</span> → <span data-date="2022-10-07" data-time="14:00:00" data-format="LT" data-timezone="Europe/Paris" data-email-preview="2022-10-07T12:00:00Z UTC">12:00 PM</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>1</sup>: Over the single month of November 2021, the repository received more than 120 pull requests by more than 40 different people. More broadly, some contributors did some big refactorings on specific parts of the code base, and are arguably as much if not more knowledgeable than the maintainer about these.</p>
