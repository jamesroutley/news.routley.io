Bob passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort. To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything.

Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.&#34;</p><p><strong>Robert Duvall told <em>Newsweek</em> in a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/character-count-251271">2014 interview</a>:</strong> &#34;<em>The Chase </em>is where I met Marlon Brando, kind of my hero coming up. He called me into his dressing room and asked about the script, &#39;Whuh you think about this?&#39; He thought it was pretty sh***y. I laughed and said, &#39;It&#39;s OK.&#39; We talked during the filming, but I&#39;d pass him in the daytime, and he&#39;d never say &#39;Good morning&#39; or anything! Brando knew you were waiting to say &#39;Good morning&#39; to him, so he wouldn&#39;t. I guess he had his own system.&#34;</p><h2>What Happens Next</h2><p>As of Monday, the family and representatives had not released a medical cause of death or announced public memorial plans</p><p><em>Update 2/16/26 2:13 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with more information.</em></p></article></div>
