                      <p>The National Academy of Sciences was established in 1863 by an Act of Congress, signed by President
Lincoln, as a private, nongovernmental institution to advise the nation on issues related to science and
technology. Members are elected by their peers for outstanding contributions to research. Dr. Marcia McNutt is
president.

The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964 under the charter of the National Academy
of Sciences to bring the practices of engineering to advising the nation. Members are elected by their peers for
extraordinary contributions to engineering. Dr. John L. Anderson is president.

The National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) was established in 1970 under the
charter of the National Academy of Sciences to advise the nation on medical and health issues. Members are
elected by their peers for distinguished contributions to medicine and health. Dr. Victor J. Dzau is president.

The three Academies work together as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
to provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex

     This report is dedicated to committee member Dr. RamÃ³n L. Carrasquillo, who unexpectedly passed away
before this reportâs release. His pragmatic and insightful contributions strengthened the report. In addition to his
extensive engineering and materials science expertise, his deep connection to Puerto Rico helped the commit-
tee develop a nuanced understanding of the community and culture surrounding the Arecibo Observatory. He is
remembered by the committee as a thoughtful, warm, and generous colleague.

     It has been my privilege to chair this committee of distinguished subject-matter experts in its investigation
and final probable cause determination of one of the most publicized and baffling failures of the modern era. It
became clear shortly after the Arecibo Telescopeâs collapse that the zinc used to anchor the steel supporting cable
wires into their sockets had allowed the failed cables to slip out of their sockets, known as spelter sockets. The
sockets slowly lost their grip on a critical number of the cable wires via slow zinc âcreep,â a process where the
zinc deformed slowly at a load below half the socketâs nominal strength. Although the committee agrees with
the conclusions from other forensic reports regarding zinc creep at the connection being the failure mechanism,
the baffling question was, âWhy was there excessive zinc creep at such loading?â Such a failure had never been
reported previously in over a century of widespread zinc spelter socket successful use.
     Fortunately, the committee had the benefit of the detailed analysis and well-documented reports from NASA;
Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.; and Thornton Tomasetti, Inc., without which it could not have completed its
task. Building on their work, the committee presents a clear and plausible explanation of why the telescopeâs sockets
failed when no such sockets have ever been reported to have failed before. Unfortunately, there was not enough
data available to prove our explanation. It is simply the most plausible hypothesis based on the data we do have.
     Without the depth and breadth of expertise on the committee, its task would remain uncompleted. I think I
speak for everyone on the committee when I say that none of us could have done this alone. I want to thank my
colleagues for their unwavering dedication to the task. Their professionalism and competence made my job an
enjoyable one.

                                                                                     Roger L. McCarthy, Chair
                                                        Committee on Analysis of Causes of Failure and Collapse
                                                          of the 305-Meter Telescope at the Arecibo Observatory
