								<p>We are pleased to announce that Works in Progress has a new home at <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where we’ll be teaming up with Stripe Press to further ideas for economic, scientific and technological advancement.</p>
<p>In the short-term, nothing will change: we’re going to continue publishing great authors with interesting ideas about science, economics, and technology – except we’ll be doing more of it. Nick, Ben, and Sam will be dedicated to Works in Progress full-time at Stripe, with Saloni working part-time as an editor for Works in Progress and Stripe Press as she finishes her PhD.</p>
<p>Over the long term, we hope to grow Works in Progress into one of the liveliest corners of the internet for people interested in new and underrated ideas for solving difficult problems.</p>
<p>We’re really excited about this. We have editorial independence from Stripe, and in general, we’re going to avoid subjects that Stripe might have a direct interest in. (So sadly not too many essays on the state of global payments infrastructure—but you can always check out <a href="https://bam.kalzumeus.com/">Bits About Money</a> for those.) We plan to focus on doing more of what we’ve been doing so far: clear, practical, and insightful essays that help us to understand the problems that matter to us, from authors we think are great. As ever, if you have any questions you can reach us on Twitter or email us at <a href="mailto:hello@worksinprogress.co">hello@worksinprogress.co</a>.</p>
