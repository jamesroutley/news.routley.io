<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/sigridellis/">Sigrid Ellis</a>, the topic of the traditional &#34;how bad is the pain, on a scale from 1 to 10&#34; doctor&#39;s office/hospital question came up, as did <a href="https://www.rasch.org/rmt/rmt264f.htm">its flaws</a>. Sigrid said something and gave me permission to publish it here:</p><blockquote>Pain scales are particularly useless for chronic pain .... &#34;I think about my pain constantly&#34; is a 4, &#34;my pain interferes with my daily tasks&#34; is a 7, but if I tell doctors that my pain is at a 7 while also conversing normally and smiling and joking, they assume I am either exaggerating, lying, or that I don&#39;t understand the scale. It&#39;s only good for acute pain, if it&#39;s good at all.</blockquote><blockquote>For chronic pain I think a more useful scale would be as follows:</blockquote><blockquote>0: I am heavily and effectively medicated to the point that my chronic pain is not noticeable.</blockquote><blockquote>1: I am medicated to the point that I feel able to do activities I cannot do under my usual medication regime.</blockquote><blockquote>2: I am medicated to the point that I can do additional normally medicated tasks.</blockquote><blockquote>3: My pain levels are at the level accomplished by my usual daily medications. I can do my normal daily tasks, but not anything more.</blockquote><blockquote>4: I am taking my normal medications, but my pain levels are not adequately controlled. I cannot do all of my normal tasks. However, this doesn&#39;t hurt enough to justify additional medication because this state happens too often and I can&#39;t afford - medically, emotionally, economically, etc. - to waste the additional meds for something this minor.</blockquote><blockquote>5: My pain is breaking through normal daily meds and I am taking additional meds for breakthrough pain. I may be able to conduct my daily tasks or even additional tasks, depending on the side effects of my breakthrough meds.</blockquote><blockquote>6: My pain is not controlled by breakthrough pain medication. I cannot perform all of my daily tasks, but I can do most of them through the pain.</blockquote><blockquote>7: My pain is not controlled by breakthrough medication. I cannot do all of my daily tasks. Some things will be skipped or dropped or given to others.</blockquote><blockquote>8: My pain is not controlled by breakthrough meds. I can barely accomplish any of my daily tasks or self-care. I may not shower or cook or get out of bed. If I have emergency pain management meds, I might take them at this point.</blockquote><blockquote>9: I need to take emergency pain medication if I have any. I will probably be unable to perform daily tasks or self-care due to the nature of emergency pain management medications. My pain may or may not be controlled by all of my meds.</blockquote><blockquote>10: Nothing controls or mitigates this pain. Not daily, breakthrough, or emergency medications. I cannot do any daily tasks.</blockquote><blockquote>..... The only purpose of a pain scale at all, in my opinion, is to convey information to other people in a format they will respond to. .....</blockquote><blockquote>Particularly with pain scales, I know how my pain feels to me. The point where &#34;how I feel&#34; impacts &#34;what I can do&#34; is the point where my feelings start to become visible to others. Either because I am in visible distress or because my functionality is impaired. At that point, a scale indicating in what manner my functionality is impaired and what I need other people to either do for me or how they should modify their expectations is the important point.</blockquote><blockquote>That&#39;s what I want doctors to understand.</blockquote><p>I appreciated getting Sigrid&#39;s perspective and figured you might too.</p><p>Many of us have learned to translate our concerns into words like &#34;interferes with work&#34; or &#34;keeps me home from my job&#34; or &#34;can&#39;t do normal activities&#34; with doctors, who have jargon like &#34;activities of daily living&#34; on checklists to check. (And to say &#34;my friend had this problem and [thing] helped; would it help me?&#34; rather than &#34;I did some research and learned [thing] might help; could we try it?&#34; because the former does not bother a doctor&#39;s sense of entitlement to deference regarding who gets input into diagnosis and treatment.) Here&#39;s hoping that, if you have chronic pain, Sigrid&#39;s formulation helps you think about your pain treatment and talk about it with your practitioners more effectively.</p>
