    <h1>Lego announces Smart Brick, the &#39;most significant evolution&#39; in 50 years, no AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On March 1st, 2026, The Lego Group will begin selling the most ambitious brick it’s ever made: a tiny computer that fits entirely inside a classic 2x4 Lego brick. When it detects NFC-equipped smart tags nearby, embedded inside new Lego tiles and new Lego minifigures, or when it sees other Smart Bricks, the company claims it will make entire Lego sets come to life — starting with the humming lightsabers, roaring engines, light-up blasters, and the music of Lego Star Wars.</p><p>These “Smart Bricks” and “Smart Play” initiatives, just announced at CES 2026, aren’t like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys">huge Lego Mario toys</a> that required two AAA batteries and mostly only activated when their bottom-mounted cameras detected color or barcodes. They’re wirelessly charged, with a pad that can charge multiple bricks at a time and a battery that “will still perform after years of inactivity.”</p><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="894" data-pswp-width="1783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Lego’s new smart brick next to Lego smart tiles and smart Lego minifigures." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/lego_8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"/></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><p>They have light and sound, light sensors, inertial sensors to detect movement, tilt, and gestures, and they form a Bluetooth mesh network with other Smart Bricks, so they’re aware of each other’s position and orientation — so Lego Star Wars ships and figures can do battle, for example, or so <em>The Imperial March</em> plays when you sit Emperor Palpatine on his throne.</p><p>When built into Lego cars, the bricks could detect which one crosses a finish line first, or change from engine noises to crashing sound effects if the vehicle is flipped over. The computer inside is a custom ASIC that is smaller than a single Lego stud and is firmware updatable via a smartphone app.</p><p>The bricks also have a microphone, one that Lego Group spokesperson Jessica Benson explains is used as a virtual button rather than recording anything. “I’ve seen it where you blow on it, if you put it on a birthday cake, for instance, it makes things happen. It’s very much used as another sensor point, it’s not recording any details, it’s just picking up those inputs that are to do with sound and reacting in real time to what the kids are doing with it.”</p><p>There’s also no AI in this product at all, Benson confirms, and no camera. (Without a camera to scan barcodes, they’re not compatible with Lego Mario tiles.)</p><p>The first sets shipping March 1st will all be Lego Star Wars:</p><div><ul><li><span>A $70, 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter set with one smart brick, one TIE Fighter smart tag, and one Darth Vader smart figure.</span></li><li><span>A $100, 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set with one smart brick, five tags (X-Wing, Imperial turret, transporter, command center, and “R2-D2 accessories”), and both Luke and Leia smart figs.</span></li><li><span>A $160, 962-piece Darth Vader’s Throne Room Duel &amp; A-Wing set with two smart bricks, three figs (Luke, Emperor Palpatine, Vader) and five tags (A-Wing, throne, Death Star turret, and two lightsabers).</span></li></ul></div><p>At roughly 4 x 4 x 5.5 inches (10 x 11 x 15cm) for the TIE Fighter and 2 x 8.5 x 7.5 (6 x 22 x 19cm) for the X-Wing <em>including</em> little outpost buildings, these are a good bit smaller than the “normal minifig scale” Lego Star Wars ships we’ve gotten in the past — the Smart Bricks add to the cost, as you’d expect.</p><div><div><div><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>The 473-piece Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter set comes with one smart brick, one smart tag, and one smart minifigure.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Lego</cite></span></p></section></div></div></div><p>If all you’re getting for that money is replacing the imaginative laser and humming sounds kids can already make with their own mouths, that’d be one thing — but there’s enough tech in here that they could possibly be much more. Lego spokesperson Jack Rankin suggests the tags can lead to more creative forms of mix-and-match play, too — when kids tried an early smart tag that quacked like a duck and combined that with a helicopter set, they enjoyed having a duck helicopter, too.</p><p>It’s highly unlikely they’ll stop at a few Lego Star Wars sets. The Lego Group is calling the new computer bricks “the most significant evolution in the Lego System-in-Play since the introduction of the Lego Minifigure in 1978,” and there are unconfirmed rumors that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631679/lego-pokemon-building-sets-availability">the upcoming Lego Pokémon sets</a> will be the next to get them. The company <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-reveals-details-smart-brick-and-sets/">already quietly piloted them in 2024</a> in a Lego City set, too.</p><p>“Lego Smart Play will continue to expand through new updates, launches and technology,” the company writes. In an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855584/lego-smart-bricks-interview-julia-goldin">exclusive interview with Lego product and marketing head Julia Goldin</a>, it sounds like The Lego Group doesn’t want to pre-announce any future Lego sets, but that this isn’t an experiment, either.</p><div><p>This is definitely not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/20/23308217/lego-brick-computer-james-brown">computer brick I asked Lego to make</a> — but I’m <em>very</em> much looking forward to trying them this week at CES.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>
