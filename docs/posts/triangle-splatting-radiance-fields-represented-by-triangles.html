    <h1>Triangle splatting: radiance fields represented by triangles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
            The code will be released on Tuesday, June 3rd.

            Triangle Splatting achieves high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with triangles.
        In contrast, the inherent softness of Gaussian primitives often leads to blurring and a loss of fine details, for example, beneath the bench or at the room’s door, whereas Triangle Splatting preserves sharp edges and accurately captures fine details.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>

            <p><img src="https://trianglesplatting.github.io/assets/function.png" alt="Window function visualization"/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Our rendering pipeline uses <strong>3D triangles</strong> as primitives, each defined by three learnable 3D vertices, color, opacity, and a smoothness parameter \( \sigma \). The triangles are projected onto the image plane using a standard pinhole camera model with known intrinsics and extrinsics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of binary masks, we introduce a <strong>smooth window function</strong> that softly modulates the triangle&#39;s influence across pixels. This function is derived from the 2D <strong>signed distance field (SDF)</strong> of the triangle, which measures the distance from a pixel \( \mathbf{p} \) to the triangle’s edges.
            </p>

            <p>
                The signed distance field \( \phi(\mathbf{p}) \) is defined as the maximum of three half-plane distances:
            </p>

            <p>
                \( \phi(\mathbf{p}) = \max\left( L_1(\mathbf{p}),\; L_2(\mathbf{p}),\; L_3(\mathbf{p}) \right) \)
            </p>

            <p>
                where each half-space function is defined as:
            </p>

            <p>
                \( L_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{n}_i \cdot \mathbf{p} + d_i \)
            </p>

            <p>
                with \( \mathbf{n}_i \) denoting the outward-facing unit normal of the \( i \)-th edge, and \( d_i \) its signed offset from the origin.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final <strong>window function</strong> is:
            </p>

            <p>
                \( I(\mathbf{p}) = \text{ReLU}\left( \frac{\phi(\mathbf{p})}{\phi(\mathbf{s})} \right)^\sigma \)
            </p>

            <p>
                where \( \mathbf{s} \) is the triangle’s incenter, i.e., the point where \( \phi \) is minimized. This function satisfies:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximum opacity at the triangle incenter</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Zero influence at and beyond the triangle boundary</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Adjustable sharpness via the parameter \( \sigma \)</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The figure above illustrates how the window function behaves in 1D and 2D. As \( \sigma \to 0 \), the function approximates a binary triangle mask. As \( \sigma \) increases, the transition becomes smoother, and in the limit \( \sigma \to \infty \), it becomes a delta function centered at \( \mathbf{s} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                To render an image, we accumulate contributions from all projected triangles using <strong>alpha blending</strong> in <strong>front-to-back depth order</strong>. Since all steps are differentiable, we can optimize the triangle parameters using gradient-based learning.

                Triangle Splatting produces sharper and more detailed images. Notably, it renders the flowers and the background with greater realism and captures finer details compared to 3DGS or 3DCS. (If the videos appear out of sync, please reload the page to ensure proper alignment.)

            Triangle Splatting unifies differentiable scene optimization with traditional graphics pipelines. The triangle soup is compatible with any mesh-based
            renderer, enabling seamless integration into traditional graphics pipelines. 
            In a game engine, we render at 2400+ FPS at 1280×720 resolution on an RTX4090.

            </p><p>
            The triangles are well aligned with the underlying geometry. All triangles share a consistent orientation and lie flat on the surface.
