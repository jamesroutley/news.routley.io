    <h1>Germany: Police seize bitcoins worth €2B</h1>

<p>An investigation is still underway and no charges have yet been filed, police said.</p>

<p>The Saxon State Criminal Police Office said the seizure of 50,000 bitcoins could be the biggest to date of its kind in Germany.</p>

<p>Police said they were investigating two men, aged 40 and 37, who are suspected of running a piracy website until the end of 2013. Authorities allege the men bought bitcoins from the money they earned from the portal.</p>

<p>They added that their investigation was into suspected unauthorized commercial exploitation of copyrighted works and subsequent commercial money laundering.</p>

<h2>Suspects transfer bitcoins to federal agency</h2>

<p>The seizure came after the &#34;accused voluntarily transferred&#34; the bitcoins to an official wallet of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), police added in a statement.</p>

<p>The BKA did not provide further details about the transfer, but investigators cited by German news agency dpa said no decisions had been made regarding cashing in the bitcoins. </p>

<p>Police said no further information would be available until the investigation comes to a close. </p>
