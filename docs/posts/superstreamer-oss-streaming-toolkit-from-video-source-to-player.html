    <h1>Superstreamer ‚Äì OSS streaming toolkit from video source to player</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Superstreamer is a self hostable platform that aims to simplify the complexities of video delivery. Transcode and package your media for online streaming with simple API calls and sane defaults, or craft dynamic HLS playlists on the fly with bumpers, ads and filters.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Transcode your video file into separate quality tracks (eg; 1080p, 720p, 480p).</li>
<li>Write <code>HLS CMAF</code> playlists directly to S3, ready for playback!</li>
<li>Want to insert a bumper like Netflix? Stitch it as an HLS interstitial on the fly.</li>
<li>Insert linear ads as interstitials by providing a simple VMAP.</li>
<li>Use our facade to interact with HLS.js, a heavily simplified wrapper that makes sense for player builders.</li>
<li>Awesome React components to start building your own player.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Give us a ‚≠ê if you like our work. Much appreciated!</p>

<p dir="auto">I&#39;ve lost count of the weekends I‚Äôve sacrificed to this project. If you think Superstreamer adding value to your company ‚Äî or just want to help me remember what sunlight looks like ‚Äî consider sponsoring!
