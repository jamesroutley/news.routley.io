<p>--------------</p><p><b>Update from 06/10/2023 : following my publication, I’ve been in contact with France Identité CISO and they could provide more information on the measures they have taken in the light of these findings:</b></p><p><span face="Calibri Light, sans-serif"><span><i>We would like to thank you for your in-depth technical research work on “France Identite” app that was launched in beta a year ago and for which you were rewarded. As you know, the app is now generally available on iOS and Android through their respective app stores.</i></span></span></p><p><span face="Calibri Light, sans-serif"><span><i>Your work, alongside French cybersecurity agency (ANSSI) research, made us update and modify deeply the E2EE Secure Channel used between the app and our backend. It is now mostly based on TLS1.3. Those modifications were released only a few weeks after you submitted your work through our private BugBounty program with YesWeHack. That released version also fixes the three other vulnerabilities you submitted.</i></span></span></p><p><span face="Calibri Light, sans-serif"><span><i>From the beginning of “France Identite” program, it was decided to implicate cybersecurity community, launching first a private BugBounty program. We are now happy to announce the BugBounty program will soon be publicly available, and the source code published in early 2024. You and all security researchers are welcome to participate.</i></span></span></p><p>--------------</p><p>More than a year ago I was invited to a private bug bounty with an unusual target: &#39;<a href="https://france-identite.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">France Identité</a>&#39;, the new french digital ID. The bug bounty program itself was disappointing to me so I&#39;d say that, likely, it wasn&#39;t necessarily worth my efforts, although I’ve been rewarded with some bounties for the reports. On the other hand, the scope was very interesting so for me, the technical part eventually made up for the negative aspects.</p><p>It was a pure black-box approach against the preproduction version. I received a &#39;specimen&#39; French ID card (carte d&#39;identité), which obviously did not correspond to any actual citizen. However, I didn&#39;t get a PIN, so I couldn&#39;t fully cover all the functionalities implemented in the &#39;France Identité&#39; system. </p><p>Now let&#39;s see what I found.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifus2Dwor1w8Es4jfJvYvUm4M2kjSJrOuwvAon10FkZthha8aH_CHJ9gXA6yFddVP1y4CHZFn28tk3aBJn0Lt4RUmiYOkHM_BVrtaDR8VCg_S2Aokc9CFUZ24bLX-LphYKHy48r00YyBI0kz_vB0_RxzQghCsZ3MOE7UztgdEZhLDoYlEuO18f-5qUODvV/s830/french_id.png"><img data-original-height="528" data-original-width="830" height="255" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifus2Dwor1w8Es4jfJvYvUm4M2kjSJrOuwvAon10FkZthha8aH_CHJ9gXA6yFddVP1y4CHZFn28tk3aBJn0Lt4RUmiYOkHM_BVrtaDR8VCg_S2Aokc9CFUZ24bLX-LphYKHy48r00YyBI0kz_vB0_RxzQghCsZ3MOE7UztgdEZhLDoYlEuO18f-5qUODvV/w400-h255/french_id.png" width="400"/></a></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>A relatively common approach to designing cost effective, user-friendly, chip-to-cloud solutions is to leverage the communication capabilities of the user&#39;s mobile phone. As a result, instead of endowing the smart device (e.g., digital ID Card) with all the required electronics and software that would enable it to autonomously transmit and receive data from the internet, the product is developed to use a short-range communication stack such as Bluetooth/NFC (something any modern mobile phone supports by default) and then, an App in the phone will create a communication channel with the backend, thus acting as a bridge for both worlds.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuK7_DPa-cmxqvQ7u9X1Dxgx1c9iWhkqfeVCrKbO-mi9rxRfUr_U9FPQg3eV92PYHcRXM77DjrDsFCq6Np2Fq6mNsQhsLHlZvkzShxNJacJXK2BBdX54y_aNajr3tCj19JqwJ1VRvoyOEOoBDMP-It3IVT7irCZ9QrvTLTxOWG8qXR-uVOoo3P62I1Hg"><img data-original-height="906" data-original-width="1418" height="408" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhuK7_DPa-cmxqvQ7u9X1Dxgx1c9iWhkqfeVCrKbO-mi9rxRfUr_U9FPQg3eV92PYHcRXM77DjrDsFCq6Np2Fq6mNsQhsLHlZvkzShxNJacJXK2BBdX54y_aNajr3tCj19JqwJ1VRvoyOEOoBDMP-It3IVT7irCZ9QrvTLTxOWG8qXR-uVOoo3P62I1Hg=w640-h408" width="640"/></a></p></div>
