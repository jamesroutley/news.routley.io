<h3 data-block-key="dspne">Patient advocacy (which means catching mistakes)</h3><p data-block-key="eosir">People with complex chronic illnesses need you to take notes, read medical stuff, and catch things that would otherwise fall through the cracks, because you cannot count on any doctor or other medical professional to do it.</p><p data-block-key="c7r5l">You may have heard of the phrase <b>“patient advocate.”</b> When you accompany someone to a doctor’s office visit, or stay bedside when they’re in the hospital, you can be their patient advocate, and sometimes provide institutional memory beyond what’s in the medical information systems. There can be, and usually are, frequent changes in which specific doctors and nurses care for your patient (more about this in <a href="#keeping-up-hospital">“keeping up during a hospital stay”</a>). So you have the opportunity to vastly improve the quality of care they get.</p><p data-block-key="5i9sf">Part of that is because simply having a witness in the room who isn’t the patient generally causes doctors and other medical providers to act better. They cut fewer corners.</p><p data-block-key="5gavc">Plus, you can just plain speak up and ask questions, sometimes better than the patient can. They’re probably exhausted, and emotionally processing the bad things happening in their bodies, and perhaps apt to minimize their symptoms, reticent about admitting how things have gotten worse. You can make notes with them ahead of time about questions they want to ask, and then help make sure the provider answers them.</p><p data-block-key="8sr3i">Let’s take a moment to consider <b>pain</b>, as requested by <a href="http://bookmaniac.org/">Liz Henry</a>: It’s often hard for patients to communicate well about their pain. Many patients habitually understate how much pain they’re in, or <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2022/a-perspective-on-pain-scales/">need to adapt their explanations of their chronic pain to customary “1-10” pain scales that don’t offer much nuance</a>. Pain can also cause incoherence, agitation, confusion, and other issues that get in the way of them communicating <i>at all</i>. So you also have to keep aware of these patterns and ensure your loved one is getting pain relief, which means sometimes gently contradicting them in front of the doctor (example: “Actually, I think the pain gets worse than that at night, doesn’t it? <i>[describe specific recent experience]</i>”).</p><p data-block-key="pu03">But another huge thing you can do is to pay attention, take notes, and develop and maintain a continuing understanding of your loved one’s health and treatments - and a relationship with the supporting medical team. And if you don’t do it, <b>likely no one else will</b>.</p><p data-block-key="2kr2j">At least in the US, you usually <b>can’t depend on your medical providers</b> to thoroughly keep track of all of a patient’s conditions, medications, etc. and keep them in mind when treating the patient. Any one doctor, nurse practitioner, physical therapist, etc. sees a lot of patients, whether in or out of a hospital. Ideally, they’d thoroughly review the chart before a visit, and then accurately update it during or afterwards. It’s hard for them to do that – and the “one size fits all” templates in electronic health records often make it hard for them to delete incorrect or obsolete data, or highlight what’s most important.</p><p data-block-key="f77da">And a person with serious illness often has something like eight or more providers (example: primary care provider, dentist, ophthalmologist, pharmacist, physical therapist, home health care aide, cardiologist, and neurologist). Ideally, they would all share information with each other and provide what’s called <b>“continuity of care”</b> so that nothing falls through the cracks, they don’t prescribe duplicative or contradictory medications, intermittent symptoms don’t get forgotten, and so on.</p><p data-block-key="d6nj4">But it’s very likely they aren’t all affiliated with the same hospital or other organization, so they don’t share electronic medical records with each other. Even once a patient has been admitted to a hospital, that hospital’s medical records probably don’t reflect test results and notes from some specialist visits, because those specialists aren’t at that hospital.</p><p data-block-key="1nj3v">(Unfortunately, <a href="https://adsei.org/2023/07/06/how-the-health-system-makes-us-sicker/">these patterns are not limited to the United States, as this account from Australia demonstrates</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="23nkc">So, <b>you – the patient advocate –</b> <b><i>are</i></b><b> continuity of care</b>. You - one person, or a family-and-friends-team - are the person or group who absorbs all the comments and advice and photocopied handouts from medical providers, who reads the test results and compares them to each other, who regularly reviews symptoms and medications and ongoing treatments, and can thus notice all the patterns. You are the person or group who has an overall intuition for the brittle interconnected systems – cardiovascular, digestive, neurological, etc. – in a person with serious health problems. And so <b>you</b> are who is likely to notice errors.</p><p data-block-key="8c1rk">I have, at least once, caught a catch-22 problem where Specialist A was waiting for Specialist B to confirm Status S before A could perform Procedure P on my mom, but Dr. B was waiting for Dr. A to do P before confirming S, and neither of them had realized they were at an impasse. And you can’t count on anyone else to notice that sort of thing. It’s a bad situation, but the faster you accept it the less you’ll run into bewildering and painful “why didn’t they catch that?!” problems.</p><p data-block-key="5d2mh">Therefore: Sometimes you’ll need to ask probing questions or push back on behalf of your loved one. And this is a big reason my sister pointed out, when reviewing these notes, that another important component of patient advocacy is <b>developing and maintaining good relationships with the care team</b>. The mercenary way of talking about this is that you don’t want the doctors and nurses to get sick of you, so you need to be extra-nice to them to make up for sometimes being extra-pushy. The more humane way of understanding this is: give them a chance to get to know you as a loving, friendly, trustworthy person, so they’re better prepared to understand why you’re causing friction, and it’s emotionally easier for them to trust that you’ll appreciate if they bend a policy or otherwise go the extra mile for you. In India, I’m off-balance and don’t get the rhythms of this stuff right. In the US I do well by using fairly standard <i>How To Win Friends And Influence People</i> and <i>Getting To Yes</i> sorts of approaches: genuinely listening to them, explicitly appreciating them, explaining where I’m coming from when I have a concern, and so on. Sweet treats also help; see <a href="#food-friend-help">“Easy-to-eat food, and letting your friends help you”</a> for more.</p><p data-block-key="bbv6j">I’ve been pretty simplistic in this description of patient advocacy; it’s a complex skill. And I haven’t talked at all about what a patient advocate or “health advocate” can do to help someone navigate insurance, bills, and health care bureaucracy, and the fact that <i>you can hire someone to do this</i>. <a href="https://natematias.com/portfolio/2023-08-15-health-advocate/">Nathan Matias recently published a blog post about that.</a></p><p data-block-key="f7vmq">But a big part of all this is <i>taking and referring to notes</i>. Which leads to…</p>
