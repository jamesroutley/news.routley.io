 <p>UPDATE</p>
 <p>Apple Maps on the web launches in beta</p>
 <p>Today, <a href="http://beta.maps.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Maps on the web</a> is available in public beta, allowing users around the world to access Maps directly from their browser.<sup>1</sup></p>
 <p>Now, users can get driving and walking directions; find great places and useful information including photos, hours, ratings, and reviews; take actions like ordering food directly from the Maps place card; and browse curated Guides to discover places to eat, shop, and explore in cities around the world. Additional features, including Look Around, will be available in the coming months.</p>
 <p>All developers, including those using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">MapKit JS</a>, can also link out to Maps on the web, so their users can get driving directions, see detailed place information, and more.</p>
 <p>Maps on the web is currently available in English, and is compatible with Safari and Chrome on Mac and iPad, as well as Chrome and Edge on Windows PCs. Support for additional languages, browsers, and platforms will be expanded over time.</p>
