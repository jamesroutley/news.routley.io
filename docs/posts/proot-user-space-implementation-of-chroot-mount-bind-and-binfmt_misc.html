    <h1>PRoot: User-space implementation of chroot, mount â€“bind, and binfmt_misc</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div xmlns="" id="description"><h2>Description</h2><p>PRoot is a user-space implementation of <tt>chroot</tt>, <tt>mount --bind</tt>,
and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  This means that users don&#39;t need any privileges
or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new
root filesystem, making files accessible somewhere else in the
filesystem hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.  Also, developers
can use PRoot as a generic Linux process instrumentation engine thanks
to its extension mechanism, see <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/care">CARE</a> for an example.  Technically
PRoot relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call available in
every Linux kernel.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It&#39;s a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users&#39; computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em>
guest environment.  That way all of the cross-compilation issues are
avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or
CPU-independent programs, like interpreters.</p><p>It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were &#34;normal&#34; host programs.</p></div><div xmlns="" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div id="chroot\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> equivalent</h3><p>To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
<tt>proot</tt> the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-programs
is:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div id="mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The bind mechanism enables one to relocate files and directories.  This is
typically useful to trick programs that perform access to hard-coded
locations, like some installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog &#34;/opt/bin&#34;
[...] # prog is installed in &#34;/tmp/alternate_opt/bin&#34; actually</pre><p>As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to <em>overlay</em> system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:</p><pre>ls -l /etc/hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts</pre><pre>proot -b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo &#39;1.2.3.4 google.com&#39; &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo &#39;5.6.7.8 google.com&#39; &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8</pre><p>Another example: on most Linux distributions <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is a symbolic
link to <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, whereas it points to <tt>/bin/dash</tt> on Debian
and Ubuntu.  As a consequence a <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> script tested with Bash
might not work with Dash.  In this case, the binding mechanism of
PRoot can be used to set non-disruptively <tt>/bin/bash</tt> as the default
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> on these two Linux distributions:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh [...]</pre><p>Because <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is initially a symbolic link to <tt>/bin/dash</tt>, the
content of <tt>/bin/bash</tt> is actually bound over this latter:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/dash</pre><p>In most cases this shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but it is still possible to
strictly bind <tt>/bin/bash</tt> over <tt>/bin/sh</tt> -- without dereferencing
it -- by specifying the <tt>!</tt> character at the end:</p><pre>proot -b &#39;/bin/bash:/bin/sh!&#39;

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
c229085928dc19e8d9bd29fe88268504  /bin/dash</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The two features above can be combined to make any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><p>works better with:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -b /proc

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        bash
?        proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/
?        sh
?        ps -o tty,command</pre><p>Actually there&#39;s a bunch of such specific files, that&#39;s why PRoot
provides the option <tt>-R</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    bash
pts/6    proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    sh
pts/6    ps -o tty,command</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ su\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>su</tt> equivalent</h3><p>Some programs will not work correctly if they are not run by the
&#34;root&#34; user, this is typically the case with package managers.  PRoot
can fake the root identity and its privileges when the <tt>-0</tt> (zero)
option is specified:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -0

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) [...]

# mkdir /tmp/foo
# chmod a-rwx /tmp/foo
# echo &#39;I bypass file-system permissions.&#39; &gt; /tmp/foo/bar
# cat /tmp/foo/bar
I bypass file-system permissions.</pre><p>This option is typically required to create or install packages into
the guest rootfs.  Note it is <em>not</em> recommended to use the <tt>-R</tt>
option when installing packages since they may try to update bound
system files, like <tt>/etc/group</tt>.  Instead, it is recommended to use
the <tt>-S</tt> option.  This latter enables the <tt>-0</tt> option and binds
only paths that are known to not be updated by packages:</p><pre>proot -S /mnt/slackware-8.0/

# installpkg perl.tgz
Installing package perl...</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ binfmt_misc\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> equivalent</h3><p>PRoot uses QEMU user-mode to execute programs built for a CPU
architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users&#39;
point-of-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user-mode
they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU user-mode
command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port 1234:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q &#34;qemu-arm -g 1234&#34; emacs</pre><p>PRoot allows one to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file-system namespace.  It&#39;s typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This
mixed-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo &#39;Hello world!&#39;
Hello world!

$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo &#39;Hello mixed world!&#39;
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS=&#34;--sysroot=/&#34;   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div xmlns="" id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><div id=""><h3>PRoot</h3><p>The source code for PRoot and CARE are hosted in the same repository on <a href="https://github.com/proot-me/proot">GitHub</a>.
