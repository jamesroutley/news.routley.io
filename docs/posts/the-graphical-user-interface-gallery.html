<p><b><SPAN color="#FFFFFF"><SPAN size="+2">Welcome to my GUI Gallery</SPAN></SPAN></b></p>

<p>On these pages you will find many screen shots of various desktop computer
Graphical User Interfaces and operating systems. Many different people
have had different ideas of how a GUI should work and these screen shots
show many of the more popular ones.
</p><p>Yes, an actual update:

me</a>! (If you do, please be absolutely sure to put something meaningful

as spam)
</p><p>And be sure to check out my favorite GUI <b><a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/vision.html">VisiCorpVisi
On</a></b> now with a downloadable hard drive image that you can run under
MESS 0.101 or later. Back in in 1983<b> </b>there was a GUI platform and
office package for IBM PCs called Visi On from VisiCorp. Legend has it
Bill Gates saw a demo of this running at the 1982 comdex running on an
IBM PC. He freaked out because Microsoft didn&#39;t have anything like this
yet, ran back to Microsoft Headquarters, and had them start work on what,
several years later, became Windows.
