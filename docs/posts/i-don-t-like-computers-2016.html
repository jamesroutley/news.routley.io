<p>Welp, I kinda gave up waxing personal on this blog a while ago, but what the hell, why not make an exception once in a while.</p>
<p>So in the last couple of years I&#39;ve been thinking about work and stuff a lot. For a while there I wondered if I was getting burned out; after all, I&#39;ve been doing kinda-sorta-approximately the same job for about a decade now, and it can be stressful at times.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on that and avoiding too many long work days and all-nighters and stuff, but no, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually it. I think what&#39;s going on is, well, the post title:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually like computers any more.</p>

<p>I also suspect I&#39;m not the only one around here.</p>

<p>That could come off wrong, though. So let&#39;s look at that in a bit more detail.</p>

<p>I still actually really like my job, if I let myself just be absorbed in the day-to-day, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute detail of it and don&#39;t think much longer term than that. I enjoy digging into bug reports and figuring out what the crap&#39;s going wrong. I enjoy most of the code work I&#39;m doing these days, heck, even the bits that involve Perl, more often than not. I don&#39;t enjoy blocker bug meetings, but I can hack it.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing: somewhere along the way there, I kinda just totally lost any inherent interest in <em>what I&#39;m doing it for</em>.</p>

<p>I started out with Linux and F/OSS because I was, well, a kid who liked tinkering with computers. I spent most of my spare time either reading books or messing around on the internet - and for all you kids out there, this was the 1990s internet, when &#39;the internet&#39; was mostly email, usenet and FTP, and you accessed it over a dial-up modem that cost 2p a minute and got yelled at by your parents when you stayed online all night downloading <em>all six megabytes</em> of the Quake shareware release...</p>

<p>And I enjoyed that. It was fun. It was a hobby, in and of itself. And, you know, I got 1990s computers. And early 2000s computers. I was jacked in and surfing the wave, maaan. It was gonna be the year of the Linux desktop real soon now.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, in the last OH GOD TWENTY YEARS, we - along with a bunch of vulture capitalists and wacky Valley libertarians and government spooks and whoever else - built this whole big crazy thing out of that 1990s Internet and...I don&#39;t like it any more.</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t watch videos on computers.</li>
<li>I barely read Twitter.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t listen to podcasts.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t Instagram. Or Snapchat. Or Vine. Or...any of those things.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t Netflix.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t Spotify.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t Uber.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t have or want an Alexa. Or a Google Home. Or a Sonos.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want my light switches connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Or my fridge.</li>
<li>Or my thermostat.</li>
<li>Or really <em>anything</em> except my computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s not fun any more. I&#39;m not <em>against</em> all these things, necessarily. But they don&#39;t make me excited. I don&#39;t want them. I just don&#39;t really <em>care</em>. Computers - including cellphones, tablets, whatever - aren&#39;t my hobby any more. I don&#39;t stop working and then have fun fiddling around with my computers or doing stuff on the internet. I stop working and I want to go do something which doesn&#39;t involve the internet at all. I like sports. I like reading. If I play games, it&#39;s mostly Nintendo games which absolutely are <em>not</em> online. I like concerts. I like eating out, in old-fashioned restaurants. I like sitting on buses and going places. One of my major criteria for buying things is whether they can do their job without a network connection</p>

<p>I use computers for...well, I use them for reading stuff. That is, actually <em>reading</em> it. Text. Pictures if I have to. I use them for figuring out how to get places, and for buying stuff. And that&#39;s kind of mostly it.</p>

<p>I run Fedora on a bunch of computers because, I mean, it&#39;s kinda my job; I get to spend lots of funtimes keeping my desktop and two laptops and a FreeIPA server and a mail server and a web server all running. But I don&#39;t really <em>enjoy</em> it. I hope they keep working and as long as they do I leave them alone. When they stop working and I have to fix them I feel vaguely resentful. It&#39;s not fun. It&#39;s work.</p>

<p>I dunno where I&#39;m going with this. I don&#39;t have any big thesis. I just wanted to write it down. Like I said, I still love the hour-to-hour, day-to-day process of making Fedora. But...I don&#39;t have some burning reason to be involved in it in the first place, any more. It&#39;s not 1996 any more. It&#39;s not the year of the Linux desktop. It&#39;s never gonna be the year of the Linux desktop. It&#39;s never even going to be the year of the desktop ever again.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s just what I do...because it&#39;s what I do.</p>
