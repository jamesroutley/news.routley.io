    <h1>Bandcamp wrapped</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I still <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/01/27/my-music-library">use Bandcamp almost exclusively to buy music</a>, and keep a big library of MP3s. The downside is that this marks me as a weirdo, but otherwise it’s great and has been working well for me.</p><p>Since I last wrote about it, Bandcamp was acquired by Epic games (?) and then acquired from them by Songtradr, and its employees are trying to get <a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org/">recognized as a union</a>. Times are changing and Bandcamp is no longer a lovely indie company, but it’s still a heck of a lot better than Spotify.</p><p><a href="https://tmcw-bandcampwrapped.web.val.run/"><img alt="Bandcamp wrapped" src="https://macwright.com/images/2024-12-06-bandcamp-wrapped-bandcamp-wrapped.png"/></a></p><p>People (who?) are sharing their ‘Spotify wrapped’ auto-generated compilations and I wanted the same, for my Bandcamp purchases, so I <a href="https://tmcw-bandcampwrapped.web.val.run/">built it on Val Town</a>. You can create your own! Or <a href="https://www.val.town/v/tmcw/bandcampWrapped">edit the code of the tool that generates them</a>. Because of API limitations – really, the absence of an API – it requires you to copy &amp; paste content from your purchases page, but isn’t copy-and-paste really a kind of API?</p><p>Anyway:</p><hr/><hr/><p>Looking back on the year, I like how I can remember a few of these albums from my first exposure to them in odd places - I heard Jessie Mae Hemphill playing in a Chipotle, and Rosie Lowe playing in my hair salon.</p><p>It was apparently a big year for instrumental, electronic, minimalist music. The only ‘rock’ album that hooked me was <em>Wall of Eyes</em>, and the only pop album that made an impact was <em>Imaginal Disk</em> - the fuzzy <a href="https://magdalenabay.bandcamp.com/track/image">outro of Image</a> is something I keep re-listening to.</p><p>MIZU has been on heavy rotation, too – the only of these artists that I learned about by seeing them live - she opened for Tim Hecker and I think made a lot of fans there with a really theatric and heavy performance.</p><p>Buy some music! Listen to it repeatedly, and put it in your MP3 player!</p></div></div>
