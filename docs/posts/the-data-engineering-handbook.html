     <p>I like writing Javascript <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/">without a build system</a>
and for the millionth time yesterday I ran into a problem where I needed to
figure out how to import a Javascript library in my code without using a build
system, and it took FOREVER to figure out how to import it because the
library’s setup instructions assume that you’re using a build system.</p>
<p>Luckily at this point I’ve mostly learned how to navigate this situation and
either successfully use the library or decide it’s too difficult and switch to
a different library, so here’s the guide I wish I had to importing Javascript
libraries years ago.</p>
<p>I’m only going to talk about using Javacript libraries on the frontend, and
only about how to use them in a no-build-system setup.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to talk about:</p>
<ol>
<li>the three main types of Javascript files a library might provide (ES Modules, the “classic” global variable kind, and CommonJS)</li>
<li>how to figure out which types of files a Javascript library includes in its build</li>
<li>ways to import each type of file in your code</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-three-kinds-of-javascript-files">the three kinds of Javascript files</h3>
<p>There are 3 basic types of Javascript files a library can provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>the “classic” type of file that defines a global variable. This is the kind
of file that you can just <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code> and it’ll Just Work. Great if you
can get it but not always available</li>
<li>an ES module (which may or may not depend on other files, we’ll get to that)</li>
<li>a “CommonJS” module. This is for Node, you can’t use it in a browser at all
without using a build system.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s a better name for the “classic” type but I’m just going
to call it “classic”. Also there’s a type called “AMD” but I’m not sure how
relevant it is in 2024.</p>
<p>Now that we know the 3 types of files, let’s talk about how to figure out which
of these the library actually provides!</p>
<h3 id="where-to-find-the-files-the-npm-build">where to find the files: the NPM build</h3>
<p>Every Javascript library has a <strong>build</strong> which it uploads to NPM. You might be
thinking (like I did originally) – Julia! The whole POINT is that we’re not
using Node to build our library! Why are we talking about NPM?</p>
<p>But if you’re using a link from a CDN like <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.1/chart.umd.min.js">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.1/chart.umd.min.js</a>,
you’re still using the NPM build! All the files on the CDNs originally come
from NPM.</p>
<p>Because of this, I sometimes like to <code>npm install</code> the library even if I’m not
planning to use Node to build my library at all – I’ll just create a new temp
folder, <code>npm install</code> there, and then delete it when I’m done. I like being able to poke
around in the files in the NPM build on my filesystem, because then I can be
100% sure that I’m seeing everything that the library is making available in
its build and that the CDN isn’t hiding something from me.</p>
<p>So let’s <code>npm install</code> a few libraries and try to figure out what types of
Javascript files they provide in their builds!</p>
<h3 id="example-library-1-chart-js">example library 1: chart.js</h3>
<p>First let’s look inside <a href="https://www.chartjs.org">Chart.js</a>, a plotting library.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /tmp/whatever
$ npm install chart.js
$ cd node_modules/chart.js/dist
$ ls *.*js
chart.cjs  chart.js  chart.umd.js  helpers.cjs  helpers.js
</code></pre>
<p>This library seems to have 3 basic options:</p>
<p><strong>option 1:</strong> <code>chart.cjs</code>. The <code>.cjs</code> suffix tells me that this is a <strong>CommonJS
file</strong>, for using in Node. This means it’s impossible to use it directly in the
browser without some kind of build step.</p>
<p><strong>option 2:<code>chart.js</code></strong>. The <code>.js</code> suffix by itself doesn’t tell us what kind of
file it is, but if I open it up, I see <code>import &#39;@kurkle/color&#39;;</code> which is an
immediate sign that this is an ES module – the <code>import ...</code> syntax is ES
module syntax.</p>
<p><strong>option 3: <code>chart.umd.js</code></strong>. “UMD” stands for “Universal Module Definition”,
which I think means that you can use this file either with a basic <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code>, CommonJS,
or some third thing called AMD that I don’t understand.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-a-umd-file">how to use a UMD file</h3>
<p>When I was using Chart.js I picked Option 3. I just needed to add this to my
code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&#34;./chart.umd.js&#34;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and then I could use the library with the global <code>Chart</code> environment variable.
Couldn’t be easier. I just copied <code>chart.umd.js</code> into my Git repository so that
I didn’t have to worry about using NPM or the CDNs going down or anything.</p>
<h3 id="the-build-files-aren-t-always-in-the-dist-directory">the build files aren’t always in the <code>dist</code> directory</h3>
<p>A lot of libraries will put their build in the <code>dist</code> directory, but not
always! The build files’ location is specified in the library’s <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>For example here’s an excerpt from Chart.js’s <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<pre><code>  &#34;jsdelivr&#34;: &#34;./dist/chart.umd.js&#34;,
  &#34;unpkg&#34;: &#34;./dist/chart.umd.js&#34;,
  &#34;main&#34;: &#34;./dist/chart.cjs&#34;,
  &#34;module&#34;: &#34;./dist/chart.js&#34;,
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is saying that if you want to use an ES Module (<code>module</code>) you
should use <code>dist/chart.js</code>, but the jsDelivr and unpkg CDNs should use
<code>./dist/chart.umd.js</code>. I guess <code>main</code> is for Node.</p>
<p><code>chart.js</code>’s <code>package.json</code> also says <code>&#34;type&#34;: &#34;module&#34;</code>, which <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#modules-packages">according to this documentation</a>
tells Node to treat files as ES modules by default. I think it doesn’t tell us
specifically which files are ES modules and which ones aren’t but it does tell
us that <em>something</em> in there is an ES module.</p>
<h3 id="example-library-2-atcute-oauth-browser-client">example library 2: <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute/tree/trunk/packages/oauth/browser-client"><code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code></a>
is a library for logging into Bluesky with OAuth in the browser.</p>
<p>Let’s see what kinds of Javascript files it provides in its build!</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install @atcute/oauth-browser-client
$ cd node_modules/@atcute/oauth-browser-client/dist
$ ls *js
constants.js  dpop.js  environment.js  errors.js  index.js  resolvers.js
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like the only plausible root file in here is <code>index.js</code>, which looks
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>export { configureOAuth } from &#39;./environment.js&#39;;
export * from &#39;./errors.js&#39;;
export * from &#39;./resolvers.js&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>export</code> syntax means it’s an <strong>ES module</strong>. That means we can use it in
the browser without a build step! Let’s see how to do that.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-an-es-module-with-importmaps">how to use an ES module with importmaps</h3>
<p>Using an ES module isn’t an easy as just adding a <code>&lt;script src=&#34;whatever.js&#34;&gt;</code>. Instead, if
the ES module has dependencies (like <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code> does) the
steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up an import map in your HTML</li>
<li>Put import statements like <code>import { configureOAuth } from &#39;@atcute/oauth-browser-client&#39;;</code> in your JS code</li>
<li>Include your JS code in your HTML liek this: <code>&lt;script type=&#34;module&#34; src=&#34;YOURSCRIPT.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The reason we need an import map instead of just doing something like <code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from &#34;./oauth-client-browser.js&#34;</code> is that internally the module has more import statements like <code>import {something} from @atcute/client</code>, and we need to tell the browser where to get the code for <code>@atcute/client</code> and all of its other dependencies.</p>
<p>Here’s what the importmap I used looks like for <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&#34;importmap&#34;&gt;
{
  &#34;imports&#34;: {
    &#34;nanoid&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/nanoid/bin/dist/index.js&#34;,
    &#34;nanoid/non-secure&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/nanoid/non-secure/index.js&#34;,
    &#34;nanoid/url-alphabet&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/nanoid/url-alphabet/dist/index.js&#34;,
    &#34;@atcute/oauth-browser-client&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/@atcute/oauth-browser-client/dist/index.js&#34;,
    &#34;@atcute/client&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/@atcute/client/dist/index.js&#34;,
    &#34;@atcute/client/utils/did&#34;: &#34;./node_modules/@atcute/client/dist/utils/did.js&#34;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Getting these import maps to work is pretty fiddly, I feel like there must be a
tool to generate them automatically but I haven’t found one yet. It’s definitely possible to
write a script that automatically generates the importmaps using <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile">esbuild’s metafile</a> but I haven’t done that and
maybe there’s a better way.</p>
<p>I decided to set up importmaps yesterday to get
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/bsky-oauth-example">github.com/jvns/bsky-oauth-example</a>
to work, so there’s some example code in that repo.</p>
<p>Also someone pointed me to Simon Willison’s
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/download-esm/">download-esm</a>, which will
download an ES module and rewrite the imports to point to the JS files directly
so that you don’t need importmaps. I haven’t tried it yet but it seems like a
great idea.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-importmaps-too-many-files">problems with importmaps: too many files</h3>
<p>I did run into some problems with using importmaps in the browser though – it
needed to download dozens of Javascript files to load my site, and my webserver
in development couldn’t keep up for some reason. I kept seeing files fail to
load randomly and then had to reload the page and hope that they would succeed
this time.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an issue anymore when I deployed my site to production, so I guess it
was a problem with my local dev environment.</p>
<p>Also one slightly annoying thing about ES modules in general is that you need to
be running a webserver to use them, I’m sure this is for a good reason but it’s
easier when you can just open your <code>index.html</code> file without starting a
webserver.</p>
<p>Because of the “too many files” thing I think actually using ES modules with
importmaps in this way isn’t actually that appealing to me, but it’s good to
know it’s possible.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-an-es-module-without-importmaps">how to use an ES module without importmaps</h3>
<p>If the ES module doesn’t have dependencies then it’s even easier – you don’t
need the importmaps! You can just:</p>
<ul>
<li>put <code>&lt;script type=&#34;module&#34; src=&#34;YOURCODE.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML. The <code>type=&#34;module&#34;</code> is important.</li>
<li>put <code>import {whatever} from &#34;https://example.com/whatever.js&#34;</code> in <code>YOURCODE.js</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-use-esbuild">alternative: use esbuild</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to use importmaps, you can also use a build system like <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a>. I talked about how to do
that in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/">Some notes on using esbuild</a>, but this blog post is
about ways to avoid build systems completely so I’m not going to talk about
that option here. I do still like esbuild though and I think it’s a good option
in this case.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-the-browser-support-for-importmaps">what’s the browser support for importmaps?</h3>
<p><a href="https://caniuse.com/import-maps">CanIUse</a> says that importmaps are in
“Baseline 2023: newly available across major browsers” so my sense is that in
2024 that’s still maybe a little bit too new? I think I would use importmaps
for some fun experimental code that I only wanted like myself and 12 people to
use, but if I wanted my code to be more widely usable I’d use <code>esbuild</code> instead.</p>
<h3 id="example-library-3-atproto-oauth-client-browser">example library 3: <code>@atproto/oauth-client-browser</code></h3>
<p>Let’s look at one final example library! This is a different Bluesky auth
library than <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install @atproto/oauth-client-browser
$ cd node_modules/@atproto/oauth-client-browser/dist
$ ls *js
browser-oauth-client.js  browser-oauth-database.js  browser-runtime-implementation.js  errors.js  index.js  indexed-db-store.js  util.js
</code></pre>
<p>Again, it seems like only real candidate file here is <code>index.js</code>. But this is a
different situation from the previous example library! Let’s take a look at
<code>index.js</code>:</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of stuff like this in <code>index.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>__exportStar(require(&#34;@atproto/oauth-client&#34;), exports);
__exportStar(require(&#34;./browser-oauth-client.js&#34;), exports);
__exportStar(require(&#34;./errors.js&#34;), exports);
var util_js_1 = require(&#34;./util.js&#34;);
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>require()</code> syntax is CommonJS syntax, which means that we can’t use this
file in the browser at all, we need to use some kind of build step, and
ESBuild won’t work either.</p>
<p>Also in this library’s <code>package.json</code> it says <code>&#34;type&#34;: &#34;commonjs&#34;</code> which is
another way to tell it’s CommonJS.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-a-commonjs-module-with-esm-sh-https-esm-sh">how to use a CommonJS module with <a href="https://esm.sh">esm.sh</a></h3>
<p>Originally I thought it was impossible to use CommonJS modules without learning
a build system, but then someone Bluesky told me about
<a href="https://esm.sh">esm.sh</a>! It’s a CDN that will translate anything into an ES
Module. <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack.dev</a> does something similar, I’m not
sure what the difference is but one person mentioned that if one doesn’t work
sometimes they’ll try the other one.</p>
<p>For <code>@atproto/oauth-client-browser</code> using it seems pretty simple, I just need to put this in my HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&#34;module&#34; src=&#34;script.js&#34;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and then put this in <code>script.js</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from &#34;https://esm.sh/@atproto/oauth-client-browser@0.3.0&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to Just Work, which is cool! Of course this is still sort of using a
build system – it’s just that esm.sh is running the build instead of me. My
main concerns with this approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t really trust CDNs to keep working forever – usually I like to copy dependencies into my repository so that they don’t go away for some reason in the future.</li>
<li>I’ve heard of some issues with CDNs having security compromises which scares me. Also I don’t</li>
<li>I don’t really understand what esm.sh is doing and</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="esbuild-can-also-convert-commonjs-modules-into-es-modules">esbuild can also convert CommonJS modules into ES modules</h3>
<p>I also learned that you can also use <code>esbuild</code> to convert a CommonJS module
into an ES module, though there are some limitations – the <code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from</code> syntax doesn’t work. Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/442">github issue about that</a>.</p>
<p>I think the <code>esbuild</code> approach is probably more appealing to me than the
<code>esm.sh</code> approach because it’s a tool that I already have on my computer so I
trust it more. I haven’t experimented with this much yet though.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-the-three-types-of-files">summary of the three types of files</h3>
<p>Here’s a summary of the three types of JS files you might encounter, options
for how to use them, and how to identify them.</p>
<p>Unhelpfully a <code>.js</code> or <code>.min.js</code> file extension could be any of these 3
options, so if the file is <code>something.js</code> you need to do more detective work to
figure out what you’re dealing with.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“classic” JS files</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to use it:</strong>: <code>&lt;script src=&#34;whatever.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>Ways to identify it:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The website has a big friendly banner in its setup instructions saying “Use this with a CDN!”  or something</li>
<li>A <code>.umd.js</code> extension</li>
<li>Just try to put it in a <code>&lt;script src=...</code> tag and see if it works</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ES Modules</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ways to use it:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If there are no dependencies, just <code>import {whatever} from &#34;./my-module.js&#34;</code> directly in your code</li>
<li>If there are dependencies, create an importmap and <code>import {whatever} from &#34;my-module&#34;</code>
<ul>
<li>or use <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/download-esm/">download-esm</a> to remove the need for an importmap</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> or any ES Module bundler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ways to identify it:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Look for an <code>import </code> or <code>export </code> statement. (not <code>module.exports = ...</code>, that’s CommonJS)</li>
<li>An <code>.mjs</code> extension</li>
<li>maybe <code>&#34;type&#34;: &#34;module&#34;</code> in <code>package.json</code> (though it’s not clear to me which file exactly this refers to)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CommonJS Modules</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ways to use it:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://esm.sh/#docs">https://esm.sh</a> to convert it into an ES module, like <code>https://esm.sh/@atproto/oauth-client-browser@0.3.0</code></li>
<li>Use a build somehow (??)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ways to identify it:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Look for <code>require()</code> or <code>module.exports = ...</code> in the code</li>
<li>A <code>.cjs</code> extension</li>
<li>maybe <code>&#34;type&#34;: &#34;commonjs&#34;</code> in <code>package.json</code> (though it’s not clear to me which file exactly this refers to)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="it-s-really-nice-to-have-es-modules-standardized">it’s really nice to have ES modules standardized</h3>
<p>The main difference between CommonJS modules and ES modules from my perspective
is that ES modules are actually a standard. This makes me feel a lot more
confident using them, because browsers commit to backwards compatibility for
web standards forever – if I write some code using ES modules today, I can
feel sure that it’ll still work the same way in 15 years.</p>
<p>It also makes me feel better about using tooling like <code>esbuild</code> because even if
the esbuild project dies, because it’s implementing a standard it feels likely
that there will be another similar tool in the future that I can replace it
with.</p>
<h3 id="the-js-community-has-built-a-lot-of-very-cool-tools">the JS community has built a lot of very cool tools</h3>
<p>A lot of the time when I talk about this stuff I get responses like “I hate
javascript!!! it’s the worst!!!”. But my experience is that there are a lot of great tools for Javascript
(I just learned about <a href="https://esm.sh">https://esm.sh</a> yesterday which seems great! I love
esbuild!), and that if I take the time to learn how things works I can take
advantage of some of those tools and make my life a lot easier.</p>
<p>So the goal of this post is definitely not to complain about Javascript, it’s
to understand the landscape so I can use the tooling in a way that feels good
to me.</p>
<h3 id="questions-i-still-have">questions I still have</h3>
<p>Here are some questions I still have, I’ll add the answers into the post if I
learn the answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a tool that automatically generates importmaps for an ES Module that
I have set up locally? (apparently yes: <a href="https://jspm.org/getting-started">jspm</a>)</li>
<li>How can I convert a CommonJS module into an ES module on my computer, the way
<a href="https://esm.sh">https://esm.sh</a> does? (apparently esbuild can sort of do this, though <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/442">named exports don’t work</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="all-the-tools">all the tools</h3>
<p>Here’s a list of every tool we talked about in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simon Willison’s
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/download-esm/">download-esm</a> which will
download an ES module and convert the imports to point at JS files so you
don’t need an importmap</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DataExpert-io/esm.sh">https://esm.sh/</a> and <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack.dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jspm.org/getting-started">JSPM</a> can generate importmaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing this post has made me think that even though I usually don’t want to
have a build that I run every time I update the project, I might be willing to
have a build step (using <code>download-esm</code> or something) that I run <strong>only once</strong>
when setting up the project and never run again except maybe if I’m updating my
dependency versions.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://polotek.net/">Marco Rogers</a> who taught me a lot of the things
in this post. I’ve probably made some mistakes in this post and I’d love to
know what they are – let me know on Bluesky or Mastodon!</p>
