<p data-block-key="jl5cg">Ever since I came across the sort of pop psychology metaphor &#34;boundaries&#34; several years ago, I&#39;ve felt a little out of sync with it. And when I took some time to ask myself why, I realized: the word &#34;boundary&#34; makes it feel to me like this practice is about setting up <b>prohibitions</b>, all-or-nothing barriers. Like: &#34;don&#39;t cross this border and step on my land!&#34;</p><p data-block-key="e7ntp">But my usual way of thinking about this concept is: what does this living, working system (or interconnected system-of-systems) need in order to function well? Sure, sometimes we need to prohibit certain activities or even particular entities. But, often, in my experience of biological or mechanical or other systems, a system often needs <b>regulation</b> rather than prohibition.</p><p data-block-key="a5p7o">We need <b>moderation</b>: neither too little <i>nor</i> too much water, money, etc. Breathing or preventive maintenance in a <b>cadence</b>, with its frequency in a certain range. <b>Balances</b> -- salt <i>and</i> fat <i>and</i> protein <i>and</i> fiber <i>and</i> sugars <i>and</i> micronutrients, etc. <b>Sequencing</b> -- laying down a protective barrier makes it ok to then do a thing that will cause friction. Stuff like that. <b>Oversight</b> checks and <b>thresholds</b> for alerts, like, &#34;the director gets a heads-up about expenses over $5.000&#34; or &#34;if an animal has not breathed in 90 seconds it starts feeling anxious and that wakes it up.&#34; And so on.</p><p data-block-key="fds6r">So, in interpersonal systems, that might be like:</p><ul><li data-block-key="drdiv">I need <b>somewhat more</b> hours alone, and I need that to happen <b>every month</b>.</li><li data-block-key="7hous">When <i>[person]</i> complains to me, I need that to be <b>balanced</b> with consideration/compliments.</li><li data-block-key="4ms38">I&#39;ve reached my <b>current limit</b> on strangers talking my ear off about <i>[this topic]</i>, so I&#39;m going to excuse myself right now and go talk with someone else.</li><li data-block-key="4lmqj">When I get home, I need 5 minutes to do my putting-things-in-the-right-places stuff <b>before</b> I can answer non-urgent questions. If you interrupt me before I&#39;m done, I may be brusque and ask you to wait.</li><li data-block-key="7kc89">If you make an appointment you need me to be at, I need you to put it on the shared calendar and add me so I get an email <b>notification</b>. Otherwise I may not be there.</li></ul><p data-block-key="59prl">So the metaphor in my head isn&#39;t that I&#39;m setting new &#34;boundaries&#34;; it&#39;s more like I&#39;m noticing where the system&#39;s at risk of getting eroded, depleted, stuck, and then coming up with ways to protect or improve it. Perhaps a good word for this category of practices, for me, is &#34;<b>regulations</b>&#34; -- not in the sense that they&#39;re mandatory policies, but in that they are ways I try to accommodate what&#39;s happening and make it smoother.</p><p data-block-key="c75a4">Overall, if I&#39;m realizing something isn&#39;t working, I often try to think along the lines: &#34;assuming this other person&#39;s needs are valid, what needs to happen in our system(s) so that this need can be addressed without me/us getting battered? while I get my own needs met too, not just RIGHT now, but in a sustainable way?&#34;</p><p data-block-key="77gur">I have not addressed a <i>huge</i> range of adjacent topics here. What if the other person&#39;s needs are not valid? and; This metaphor might help me think about what boundaries to create, but what about enforcing them? and: Given that it can be quite sticky to create and enforce boundaries with one&#39;s most cherished friends and family, much as it&#39;s hard to decipher and trace a legacy system and get users of that legacy system users to migrate to a new interface, how can one most gracefully encourage and manage that migration? and; Isn&#39;t this a rather impressively oblique way to come around to <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2023/teaching-entitlement-and-the-verb-need/">recognizing one&#39;s own needs as legitimate and defending them accordingly</a>, Sumana?</p><p data-block-key="148sm">Regardless, this chunk of thinking has proven useful to a few friends, so, here you go.</p>
