    <h1>Sid Meier warns the games industry about monetisation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="compact"><article><header><p><span><strong>By Steffan Powell</strong></span></p></header><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>1991 was an impressive year for video game releases. </b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sonic the Hedgehog, with his colourful, fast-paced, ring collecting was the top-selling title. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>People were also bashing buttons until their fingers were sore, playing Street Fighter 2. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Few could have guessed at the time that one of the releases to have a lasting impact on the games industry, would be a strategy title that played like a virtual board game.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was hardly the sexy face of a burgeoning industry - but Civilization didn&#39;t need fancy graphics, cute characters or frantic gameplay to have hundreds of thousands of people hooked.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Instead, its blend of management simulation, exploration and diplomacy, helped create a gaming icon and a new genre.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Time magazine once named it one of the <a href="https://techland.time.com/2012/11/15/all-time-100-video-games/slide/civilization-1991/">100 greatest video games</a>. It has spawned five sequels, the most recent of which was released in 2016.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>MICROPROSE</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Civilization sees players try to conquer the world through a mix of diplomacy, exploration and warfare</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Games have changed dramatically since 1991, and grown significantly in popularity - they&#39;re now worth more than the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46746593">movie and music industries combined</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Speaking to the BBC on the 30th anniversary of its release, the brains behind Civilisation is warning the games industry to remember why people play in the first place.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The real challenge and the real opportunity is keeping our focus on gameplay,&#34; says American developer Sid Meier. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;That is what is unique, special and appealing about games as a form of entertainment. When we forget that, and decide it&#39;s monetisation or other things that are not gameplay-focused, when we start to forget about making great games and start thinking about games as a vehicle or an opportunity for something else, that&#39;s when we stray a little bit further from the path.&#34; </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Dominating-the-market"><span role="text">Dominating the market</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The financial model that supports how games companies make their money has changed dramatically in the past decade or so. Now many developers and publishers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2020/09/19/gaming-industry-value-200-billion-fortnite-microtransactions/?sh=25d0cc692bb4">rely on in-game purchases </a>to help with their bottom line rather than solely on the up-front cost of buying a title to play.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Piers Harding-Rolls from Ampere Analysis explains: &#34;In 2021, 79% of consumer spending on games globally was from in-app purchases, microtransactions and add-on content for games. This share is expected to grow.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Not all releases that include these mechanics have been welcomed by players - with several <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41997252">high-profile examples in recent years</a> of companies having to change their approach, after a negative reaction from fans. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>2k Games</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Civilization 6 was released in 2016 - it&#39;s the latest title in the franchise that has sold over 35 million copies</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some games companies are also exploring the introduction of non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) - a form of digital art that players can buy and own - into their games. There are those that believe this is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59167668">an inevitable part of gaming&#39;s future</a> and another way for companies to make money from gamers, but a<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/overcooked-and-going-under-devs-revolt-against-publisher-team17s-nft-plans/"> fiercely negative reaction </a>on social media has forced some to rethink their plans.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sid Meier says that if major companies continue to focus on ways like this to monetise gaming, they risk losing the audience: &#34;People can assume that a game is going to be fun and what it needs for success are more cinematics or monetisation or whatever - but if the core just is not there with good gameplay, then it won&#39;t work. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;In a sense gameplay is cheap... The game design part is critical and crucial but doesn&#39;t require a cast of thousands in the way some of the other aspects do. So it&#39;s perhaps easy to overlook how important the investment in game design and gameplay is.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>MICROPROSE</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Civilization helped create the 4X strategy genre of games - where players explore, expand, exploit and exterminate</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The global games market is<a href="https://ukiepedia.ukie.org.uk/index.php/Global_Video_Games_Market#2021_Stats"> reported to be worth around $175bn</a> (£129bn) and is forecast to almost double in five years. In the UK, the industry <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/news/uk-games-industry-valuation-2020">grew during lockdown </a>and is worth £7bn.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Sid Meier says that continued growth isn&#39;t guaranteed: &#34;There are lots of other ways that people can spend their leisure time... I think the way the internet works, once a shift starts to happen, then everybody runs to that side of the ship. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think we need to be sure that our games continue to be high quality and fun to play - there are so many forms of entertainment out there now. We&#39;re in a good position... but we need to be sure we realise how critical gameplay is - and how that is the engine that really keeps players happy, engaged and having fun.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sid says he has no plans to retire just yet, and explains the most gratifying change he&#39;s experienced during his more than 30 years in the industry, is the wider public&#39;s shift in attitude when it comes to games. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>People were telling him back in 1991 that he was &#34;wasting his time&#34; working in games - now he smiles, as people say to him: &#34;I wish I could get a job making games.&#34; </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Like-video-game-Listen-to-Press-X-to-Continue-the-BBC-Sounds-gaming-Podcast"><span role="text">Like video game?
