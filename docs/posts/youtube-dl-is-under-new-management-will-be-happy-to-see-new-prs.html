          <p dir="auto">Thanks to <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/rg3/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/rg3">@rg3</a> who created this program the project has a new maintainer.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, many thanks to <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/dstftw/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/dstftw">@dstftw</a> and <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/remitamine/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/remitamine">@remitamine</a> for holding the fort over the last several years.</p>
<p dir="auto">I hope that we&#39;ll be able to make a new release soon and subsequently keep the program more up-to-date than has been the case for the last few months.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project has a fork <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp">https://github.com/yt-dlp</a> that offers a lot of extra functions but demands an up-to-date Python version. This project will continue to target Python version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, at least until no-one complains about 2.6 compatibility.</p>
<p dir="auto">PRs are very welcome, although there is a significant back-log to be handled. Back-ports of yt-dlp features are also welcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, I&#39;d encourage anyone else who is interested in sharing maintenance duties to establish a track record and make themselves known. We want to keep this popular project alive with a community of future maintainers.</p>
