That’s because it is the world’s first, ever, fully painted feature film. Inspired by the letters and paintings left behind by the intriguing artist, it features 120 of his most popular works, including <em>Starry Night </em>(1889), <em>Portrait of the Postman Joseph </em>(1888), <em>Wheatfield with Crows </em>(1890)<em>,</em> and a whole lot more.</strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-6hk25"><span><span><a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://lovingvincent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener"><strong>The film</strong></a><strong> is comprised of over 65,000 frames entirely made up of oil paintings, with 12 individually painted frames appearing on screen per second. Considering that every brushstroke tells a story, it’s crazy to think that there are 898 shots — hence 898 oil paintings — in the hour-and-a-half long moving picture. So, it’s not surprising that the film’s stunning trailer went viral when it first premiered back in February 2016.</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-a004t"><div><p><iframe data-hook="video-ssr-viewer" title="ricos-video" allow="fullscreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQZvzHmAXhc" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><p id="viewer-e2aaa"><span><span><strong>As evidenced in part by the massive undertaking that is <em>Loving Vincent</em>, the world seems to have an unwavering fascination with the artist’s tumultuous life and the </strong><a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/12/vincent-van-gogh-murder-mystery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener"><strong>circumstances</strong></a><strong> surrounding his passing. </strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-4cgto"><span><span><a data-hook="linkViewer" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/loving-vincent-this-vincent-van-gogh-biopic-is-made-using-12-oil-paintings-a-second-a6897226.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener"><strong>According the filmmakers</strong></a><strong>:</strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-bu02q"><span><span><strong>&#34;The intrigue unfolds through interviews with the characters closest to Vincent and through dramatic reconstructions of the events leading up to his death…The plot is drawn from the 800 letters written by the painter himself...in his last letter [Vincent wrote]: &#39;Well, the truth is, we cannot speak other than by our paintings,&#39; and that is what we are doing — letting his paintings tell the story of what the painter had inside his heart, and ultimately, what happened to him.&#34;</strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-49uhj"><span><span><strong>The road to making <em>Loving Vincent</em> was a long one.

It paid off; after she completed the film’s intense three-week training program, she officially joined the crew. “The work day generally began by 9am and ended by 6pm with about a half-hour break for lunch,” recalled Kirk. “I think the directors needed to know that we could handle the intensity of the work. It took so much focus.”</strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-94pa9"><span><span><strong>Dorota Kobiela, one of the film’s directors, is also a skilled painter. “She had the final say on the quality of our work. It is because of her fastidious attention to detail, and her vision for using actual working fine artists to create every frame that makes this film so unique,” explained Kirk. “I truly felt a sense of commitment to this project, Dorota, and Hugh. [I wanted] to help them realize their vision.”</strong></span></span></p><p id="viewer-5k0vh"><span><span><strong>Artist-animators worked in Painting Animation Work Stations (PAWS) that resembled elaborate study cells that could be found at the library. They allow the workers to focus on painting and animating the brushstrokes without having to adjust the lighting or worry about other distracting details. “Every time a character spoke, there was movement in their entire face and body. I had to pay careful attention to make the brushstrokes look believable, yet still remain true to Van Gogh’s style,” Kirk shared.</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-er82c"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div id="new-image3129323" aria-label="Frame from &#34;Wheatfield with Crows&#34; (2017) by Dena Kirk "><wow-image id="345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg" data-image-info="{&#34;containerId&#34;:&#34;new-image3129323&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;,&#34;isLQIP&#34;:false,&#34;isSEOBot&#34;:true,&#34;imageData&#34;:{&#34;width&#34;:600,&#34;height&#34;:450,&#34;uri&#34;:&#34;345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_450,al_c,q_80,enc_auto/345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg" alt="Frame from &#34;Wheatfield with Crows&#34; (2017) by Dena Kirk " data-pin-url="https://www.artpublikamag.com/post/the-making-of-the-worlds-first-ever-fully-painted-feature-film-loving-vincent" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_720,h_540,al_c,lg_1,q_85/345484_fbba6b0442b645dfb5ca3024094e3db2~mv2.jpg"/></wow-image></div><p><span dir="auto">Frame from &#34;Wheatfield with Crows&#34; (2017) by Dena Kirk</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5a0kp"><span><span><strong>“I have often felt the satisfaction of finishing a painting and having it work.
