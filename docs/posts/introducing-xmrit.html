    <h1>Introducing Xmrit</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/introducing_xmrit.jpg" alt="Introducing Xmrit"><p>I&#x2019;m very pleased to announce the launch of <a href="https://xmrit.com/">Xmrit</a>.</p><p>Over the past eight months, my team at Commoncog have been iterating on a tool to rapidly create and share XmR charts. We&#x2019;ve been using Xmrit operationally for about five months now, and we are very confident that the tool is ready for wide use.</p><p>(Xmrit is pronounced &#x2018;<em>xa-merit</em>&#x2019;, in case you&#x2019;re wondering.)</p><p>So, what is it? Xmrit is a free, browser-based tool that makes it easy for you to create, modify, experiment with and share XmR charts. Here&#x2019;s what it looks like:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Xmrit" loading="lazy"></figure><p>If you do not know what XmR charts are, the broad pitch is that XmR charts tell you when <strong>something has changed in your data</strong>. This simple property unlocks something quite powerful: it allows you to uncover the causal structure of your business. For more information on how you may use XmR charts to accomplish this, read <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-first-principles/">Becoming Data Driven, From First Principles</a>.</p><p>There are a number of features that make Xmrit useful. For instance, I can generate links to quickly share analyses. The following is a chart of Commoncog&#x2019;s Average Session Duration:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/avg_session_duration.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Xmrit" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/avg_session_duration.png 600w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/avg_session_duration.png 1000w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/avg_session_duration.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You may play with this chart yourself <a href="https://xmrit.com/t/?v=0&amp;d=RGF0ZSxBdmcgU2Vzc2lvbiBEdXJhdGlvbiAocyksMjAyMy0xMC0yMixgICIkOWAgLyIxLTA1YCAiJDFgIDkjMS0xYCA3JTI2YCBbIjItMDNgICIkMTBgIC0kMTdgIDgkMjRgIEMkMzEsMjAyNC0wMS0wYCA8IGAgJiAxYCA8IGAgMSAyYCA3JTI4YCBFIjItMGAgOSMyLTFgIFojMi0xOA.Qz5euENbMKRDQ1maQyvHrkNAszNDdNwpQ3Vj10OINwpDbT1xQ4F3CkOcVHtDlLHsQ5c8KUN-kexDhko9Q4frhUOF2FJDhR1x&amp;s=U8X6iQ">at this link</a>.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll also notice that there&#x2019;s a divider placed in the chart. This is another Xmrit-only feature. Try dragging the divider around. Observe how Xmrit&#x2019;s chart responds and recalculates limit lines based on your divider position.</p><p>The divider position that you see in the image above is not accidental: it corresponds to the week where we <a href="https://commoncog.com/commoncogs-next-phase/">launched</a> the Commoncog <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/">Case Library</a>. Average session duration shifted permanently after we launched. When we discovered this behaviour, we started thinking:</p><ol><li>Hmm. Maybe the Case Library is sticky!</li><li>We should probably redesign the Commoncog website to make the library more prominent. If doing so increases average session duration even further, then we have confirmed point (1).</li></ol><p>This is what I mean when I say (quoting statistitican Donald Wheeler): &#x201C;XmR charts are the beginning of <em>knowledge</em>&#x201D;. <a href="https://commoncog.com/operational-rigour-is-the-pursuit-of-knowledge/">Knowledge is defined</a> as &#x2018;theories or models that allow you to better predict the outcomes of your business actions.&#x2019; We observe an exceptional change in our metrics. We investigate and discover some causal action. We then take new action to confirm that the causal relationship is true.</p><p>Rinse and repeat. At this point we&#x2019;ve had maybe a dozen such insights. We are &#x2014; as a teammate put it &#x2014; slowly uncovering the causal structure of Commoncog&#x2019;s core business. (&#x201C;I never thought we would be able to understand how a business <em>truly</em> works&#x201D; one of them said, during one of our WBRs). We&#x2019;ve already doubled revenue over the past year, as a result of such knowledge. I am quietly confident that we can do the same this year (and perhaps even surpass that target; it depends on what other pieces of knowledge we uncover in the coming weeks).</p><p>And now &#x2014; with Xmrit &#x2014; you can do the same.</p><p>There are a few more features that make Xmrit special:</p><ul><li>You can integrate with it by programmatically creating share links: <a href="https://xmrit.com/integration/">read this guide for more details</a>. This is, incidentally, how we integrate with our own internal WBR software.</li><li>You can lock limit lines. Read <a href="https://xmrit.com/manual/#what-is-the-locking-limits-button-for-and-how-do-i-use-it">this section of the User Manual</a> for why you might want to do this.</li><li><strong>We&#x2019;re going to open source it in a few days.</strong> If you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable plugging your company data into Xmrit, wait a few more days. Xmrit was always intended to be open sourced. If you&#x2019;d like an update, I recommend signing up for the free email course on <a href="https://xmrit.com/">Xmrit.com</a>. That puts you on our mailing list. We&#x2019;ll tell you when it&#x2019;s out.</li></ul><p>And on that note &#x2026;</p><h2 id="sign-up-for-xmrit%E2%80%99s-free-email-course">Sign up for Xmrit&#x2019;s Free Email Course!</h2><p>Sam Taylor is my collaborator on Xmrit. In a previous life, Sam worked in manufacturing. He has been very influential on my thinking about industrial methods and industrial business models. Over the past month, we&#x2019;ve been hard at work at writing up a free email course over at Xmrit.com to introduce you to these methods.</p><p>I&#x2019;m very proud of what we&#x2019;ve accomplished. This is over 10,000 words of teaching, spread over nine days, and I think it&#x2019;s pretty good stuff. It&#x2019;s very much what I wish I had when I first encountered these methods.</p><p>And so! To reiterate: if you&#x2019;re interested in using XmR charts in your company, you should <strong><a href="https://xmrit.com/">sign up for the free email course</a>.</strong></p><p>In a couple of months, we&#x2019;ll be launching a paid course called <a href="https://shop.xmrit.com/metrics-masterclass">The Metrics Masterclass</a> &#x2014; which covers <em>everything</em> you&#x2019;ll need to know about using XmR charts in practice.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><a href="https://shop.xmrit.com/metrics-masterclass"><img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/Metrics-Masterclass-banner.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing Xmrit" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1047" srcset="https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Metrics-Masterclass-banner.jpg 600w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Metrics-Masterclass-banner.jpg 1000w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/Metrics-Masterclass-banner.jpg 1600w, https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/Metrics-Masterclass-banner.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a><figcaption>Coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Sam and I intend to turn Xmrit.com into the world&#x2019;s best place to learn about these &#x2014; and other &#x2014; methods. (And, if you can believe it, Sam is even more passionate about these tools than I am!)</p><p>You shouldn&#x2019;t need to buy multiple books and read a dozen statistical papers, or do 1.5 years of trial and error to figure out how to use these charts outside of manufacturing. (Which, <em>ahem</em>, is what we&#x2019;ve done). The method is so simple and so useful that you should be able to use it <em>today.</em> The good news is that we&#x2019;ve already done the hard work for you.</p><p>The Metrics Masterclass will be $299 at launch. At preorder, it costs $199. And if you go through the <a href="https://xmrit.com/">free email course on Xmrit.com</a>, you&#x2019;ll get an additional discount at the end.</p><p>We hope that over the next few years, using our free tools, some simple methods, and much education &#x2014; both free <em>and</em> paid &#x2014; we&#x2019;ll be able to increase the number of data-driven companies that exist in the world.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>I&#x2019;d like to thank a number of people for working on Xmrit with me. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hang-bin-aw/?originalSubdomain=sg">Aw Hang Bin</a> wrote the first version of Xmrit during an internship he did with us last year. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samjataylor/">Sam Taylor</a>, of course, tested and shaped the Xmrit tool for a huge chunk of the life of the project. Ben rewrote the tool, and thought up and created the integration for Xmrit &#x2014; which led us to learn that we <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> have a good sense of routine variation in our metrics. I&#x2019;d also like to thank the rest of the Commoncog team who have been testing Xmrit in their own work contexts.</p><p>Commoncog members received <a href="https://commoncog.com/announcing-members-only-xmr-charts/">early access to Xmrit</a> a few weeks ago, so this isn&#x2019;t news to them. And hopefully they&#x2019;ve already started experimenting with it!</p><p>If I would say one last thing: </p><p>I hope that you&#x2019;ll take these ideas seriously. Go on, give it a try.</p><p>I look forward to hearing how it&#x2019;s turned out.</p><p>PS: Sam and I were on the Monday Morning Data Chat to talk about Xmrit and about Statistical Process Control.
