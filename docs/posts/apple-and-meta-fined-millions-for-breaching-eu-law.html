Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said this is due to the short period of the breaches, a focus on compliance rather than sanctions and a desire to avoid possible retaliation from Trump.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->PAY-OR-CONSENT MODEL<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The EU competition watchdog said Apple must remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent app developers from steering users to cheaper deals outside the App Store.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It said Meta&#39;s pay-or-consent model introduced in November 2023 breached the DMA.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The model gives Facebook and Instagram users who consent to be tracked a free service that is funded by advertising revenues. Alternatively, they can pay for an ad-free service.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Meta is discussing with the EU a new version introduced in November last year. The companies have two months to comply with the orders or risk daily fines.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Apple avoided a fine in a separate investigation into its browser options on iPhones after making changes that allow users to switch to a rival browser or search engine more easily. Regulators said these comply with the DMA and closed the investigtion on Wednesday.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div>       </div></div> </div>      <section><header> </header>   </section></div></article> </section></section></section>    </div></div>
