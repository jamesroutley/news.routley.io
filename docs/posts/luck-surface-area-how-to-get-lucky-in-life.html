<p>Luck surface area is a <a href="https://fronterablog.com/mental-model-examples-and-their-explanations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental model</a> that explains it’s possible to increase your chances to get lucky in life.</p>







<hr/>



<p>If there was a <em>magic potion</em> that makes people lucky, it would be expensive.</p>



<p>But people would still buy it.</p>



<p>After all, everybody wants to <strong>get lucky</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, since we don’t have such a potion, are there other ways to create your own luck?</p>



<p>Let’s see.</p>



<h2>Four levels of luck</h2>



<p>Luck is an event that happens out of your control that leads to a positive or negative outcome.</p>



<p>Since it’s out of your control, you can’t force it.</p>



<p>But you can <strong>increase your chances</strong> (by a lot) to get lucky.</p>



<p>To do that, let’s define luck better first.</p>



<p>Because not all luck is the same; there are four levels to it:<br/></p>



<ol><li><strong>Blind luck:</strong> This is what most people mean when they talk about luck. Where you were born, who your parents are, winning a lottery… Totally random.</li><li><strong>Hard work brings luck: </strong>You work on something so much that you attract luck. You tweet 5,000 times and nothing happens. But the next tweet gets a like from a big account and goes viral; you get thousands of new followers. This type of luck finds you only because you’ve hustled your way to it.</li><li><strong>You discover luck: </strong>When you have deep knowledge in an area, you start <em>seeing luck</em> nobody else can see. Millions of people watched an apple fall from a tree, but only Newton had the <strong>knowledge</strong> to turn it into a big discovery. Identifying trends, investment and <a href="https://fronterablog.com/trade-in-the-modern-era-information-arbitrage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information arbitrage</a> opportunities are other examples of discovering luck with knowledge.</li><li><strong>You attract luck: </strong>The ultimate state of being lucky. At this stage, you don’t need to look for luck. It comes to you all the time. Having a personal brand with a big audience, being known for what you do, or being in a position of power are good examples.</li></ol>



<h2>​</h2>



<p>Imagine lucky events as random arrows flying around. They are like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eros-Greek-god" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eros’ arrows</a>; you want to get hit.</p>



<p>The best way to get hit by a random arrow is to increase the surface area of the target — in this case, your <strong>luck surface area</strong>.</p>



<p>The bigger the surface, the more chances you have to get lucky.</p>

<p>​</p>



<p>With four levels of luck, you see how the surface expands from the 1st level to the 4th.</p>



<p>Now let’s get tactical.</p>



<h2>5 ways to expand your luck surface area:</h2>



<h3>1. Do &amp; Tell</h3>



<p>Everybody knows that “doing” and hard work are important. But most people miss the “telling” part.</p>



<p>Each new person that hears about your work increases the chances of a lucky event.</p>



<p>Marketing your work is <strong>as important as</strong> doing it.</p>



<h3>2. Follow your curiosity</h3>



<p>Society is good at suppressing our curiosity after we become adults.</p>



<p>But your childlike curiosity allows you to go deep into <strong>new subjects</strong> and <strong>make connections</strong> with the other things you know.</p>



<p>So you can be in a position to identify luck nobody else can see (or understand) — like Newton.</p>



<blockquote><p>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</p><cite><em>Seneca</em></cite></blockquote>



<h3>​</h3>



<p>Go to a party, join a digital community, and meet with friends of your friends.</p>



<p>Surround yourself with people who know more than you.</p>



<p>Each new person you meet <strong>expands</strong> your luck surface area.</p>



<h3>4. Build a personal brand</h3>



<p>Create value for people.</p>



<p>Become known with something. Build a reputation.</p>



<p>Luck will start <strong>finding you</strong> more often and in ways that you can’t imagine.</p>



<h3>5. Take luck as a skill</h3>



<p>Now you know it’s possible to get luckier. The <em>magic potion</em> exists.</p>



<p>So start seeing luck as an improvable skill. Work on it.</p>



<p>While others are <em>naively</em> waiting for it, become a person <strong>who attracts luck</strong>.</p>
