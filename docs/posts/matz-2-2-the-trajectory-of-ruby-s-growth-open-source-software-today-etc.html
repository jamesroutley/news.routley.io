</p>

<p>We begin with the topic of the first-ever Ruby conference held in America and look back on the path Ruby has taken. Starting with the groundbreaking web framework Ruby on Rails, developed by DHH in 2004, Ruby gained significant global recognition. It grew tremendously as it was adopted by startups, most notably GitHub. Matz also has a side as an open-source software (OSS) developer, and the conversation turned to his thoughts and concerns about the current generation. The lively conversation covered a wide range of topics, including the Ruby community, his relationships with famous developers like Dave Thomas, Martin Fowler, and Linus Torvalds, and even his favorite programming languages.</p>

<p>Matz is active both in Japan and internationally. Despite his great achievements, we believe his friendly and approachable personality has had a truly significant positive impact on the Ruby community. Matz, thank you once again for graciously accepting our sudden offer to do this recording!</p>

<p>We wish everyone a Happy New Year!</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>The first Ruby conference was held in America in November 2001.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>At that time, were you the only Japanese person who went, Matz?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>There were about two other Japanese people who came, and I thought that was amazing.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Were they committers or something?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>At that time, the concept of a &#34;committer&#34; wasn&#39;t really there, so they were more like acquaintances within the community.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Like, &#34;If Matz is going, we&#39;ll go too.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yes, they said, &#34;We&#39;ll go,&#34; so there were about three Japanese people.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>You know, the first Ruby conference only had about 36 attendees. Compared to today&#39;s conferences with hundreds of people, it felt like it could blow away with a puff of wind. Among them, there were three Japanese people, very modestly. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)">Dave Thomas</a> , who is here today, was also there.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Oh, already! That was early.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Um, so Dave Thomas published a book called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Ruby">Programming Ruby</a> in 2000.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, when people who learned about Ruby from reading that book decided to get together, um, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>, the American computer society, they booked a hotel conference room right before their main conference and decided to hold it there. That was the first Ruby conference.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, most of the people were attendees of the ACM&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA">OOPSLA</a> conference, which deals with object-oriented programming. They arrived a few days early and attended the Ruby conference as a side thing, that&#39;s the kind of crowd it was.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And at that conference, someone said, &#34;We need a package system for Ruby, right?&#34; and they were making a prototype for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Was it created at that time?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>At that time. It was made for, or thanks to, the conference.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Wow. I see, it didn&#39;t exist until then. For <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, it&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a>, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Perl had CPAN and such, yes.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Ruby didn&#39;t have something like that yet, back in 2001. And people were saying, &#34;We need something, right?&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Saying things like, &#34;What kind of thing, what features do we need?&#34; and while everyone was excitedly discussing it, someone was typing, and that&#39;s how the RubyGems prototype came about.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Originally, Matz, you made the Ruby by yourself, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yes, that&#39;s right. The Ruby language, yes.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And from there, Dave Thomas found it, is that how it happened?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right. I got contacted around &#39;97, &#39;98. He said something like Ruby was interesting, and we exchanged a few messages. Then in &#39;99, um, where was it, an editor from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oreilly.com/publisher/addison-wesley-professional/">Addison-Wesley</a> contacted me saying someone wanted to write a book about Ruby.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And when I asked who the author would be, they said <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer)">Dave Thomas</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author)">Andy Hunt</a> would write it. And I thought, I know those guys!</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And he wrote it with incredible speed. Yes, yes, I got an email on December 31, 1999.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Right around the time of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a>. And when I replied, Dave Thomas said something like, &#34;Okay, I&#39;m going to start writing now,&#34; and then I got a flood of emails like, &#34;I read the source code, what does this mean?&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Well, I can speak English, but I&#39;m not extremely proficient. So I was struggling and writing replies in English.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Then the book came out in November of that year. Incredibly fast.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Thats so fast!</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And so, the people who had seen that book Programming Ruby in the latter half of 2001, thought, &#39;This Ruby language is interesting, let&#39;s all get together.&#39; That gathering was the first Ruby Conference, in November 2001, which was about a year after the book&#39;s publication.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Wow.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, it&#39;s not that I want to speak English; honestly, I&#39;d rather not, but I speak it out of necessity due to the circumstances. That&#39;s how it feels.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Wow. Going back to the library example from earlier, that person probably received contact but didn&#39;t reply, from the sound of it.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>What a waste.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>It&#39;s a waste, isn&#39;t it? But in that situation, Matz, you replied.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right, I replied.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>So Dave Thomas found it, then a conference was held, and it started happening regularly.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s been held annually since 2001.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>So, did Ruby conferences originally start in America?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Conferences, yes, the world&#39;s first conference was the 2001 Ruby Conference.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Um, well, in Japan too, we&#39;ve had event-like things, study groups jokingly named something like &#34;Ruby Conference.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>But back then, Ruby was still very niche, so nobody believed that a regular, annual conference would be held. Um, so we jokingly talked about it, and we did hold such events in Japan around 1999 or 2000, but the first regular Ruby conference was in 2001.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And then <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">(Ruby on) Rails</a> came along,</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That was 2004. I actually missed it. Because my child was being born.</p>

But when he was helping with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> project, he discussed PHP&#39;s way of doing things with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://basecamp.com/about">Jason Fried</a>, who originally started Basecamp. When they talked about things like, &#34;Couldn&#39;t we write better stuff if we did it this way?&#34; and decided, &#34;Okay, let&#39;s go with this, let&#39;s start the project,&#34; DHH pushed for Ruby, saying PHP seemed like it would have limitations in the future. So they switched to Ruby, and he said Rails was created by taking the bottom half of Basecamp and carving it out.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And I don&#39;t know if DHH remembers, but I met him in 2001, quite a bit before Rails.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And at the reception, a very young guy came up. I think Dave Thomas was with me, and while Dave Thomas and I were talking, he approached us, and I remember having a bit of a discussion with him about languages.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And a few years later, that same guy was doing Ruby.</p>

And then he made Rails, and I thought, &#34;Wow, that&#39;s amazing.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Ruby itself, of course, as a language, but then when its killer app, Rails, appeared, the momentum from that point was incredible, I think.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>It truly became a global boom. Did the frequency of you being invited (to conferences, etc.) change completely then?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>The frequency, not so much.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>But 5 or 6 times a year means once every two months, right? That&#39;s quite frequent (laughs).</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yes, in 2004 DHH developed Ruby on Rails, yes.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And (Rails) became popular. It really took off when he made that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">1-minute video (15-minute video)</a>, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Ah, yes, when he uploaded that video of making a TODO application, that was probably late 2004 or 2005.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yes, back then, video wasn&#39;t that common, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a> didn&#39;t exist yet.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And he uploaded a video at that time. And, well, how should I put it, an application could be made in no time.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And from nothing, to making that TODO app—was it TODO?—it finished in about 15 minutes. And it wasn&#39;t like a cooking show where they practice and say, &#34;This is how it is,&#34; or &#34;Here&#39;s one I prepared earlier.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>He was making it while muttering to himself, like, &#34;How do I do this again?&#34; or something.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And being able to make a TODO app in 15 minutes like that was, well, quite shocking for us at the time.</p>

And, what was it, I was a student back then, and I really witnessed that (Ruby) boom.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And besides Ruby, at that time, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source (software)</a> was really blossoming, I think. And startups were naturally booming too, and Rails was a prime example.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Then GitHub was born, and there were stories about how GitHub brought in Rails, and they were talking about that kind of stuff too.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Hmm well, as I&#39;m talking, I&#39;m kind of wondering what I should even be talking about in this overseas migration podcast.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>These are stories that the this podcast usual audience might not often hear.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Well, if I just do it freely, people might just tune out, but (laughs) as the stories and topics get deeper, they resonate with specific people, but gradually they stop appealing to everyone.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s bound to happen.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>It does, that&#39;s a choice you have to make.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And back to the topic, during the Merge conference, I felt that trend flow from that time, you know, it felt a bit nostalgic.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>When I saw it, I thought, &#34;This is what I was seeing back then.&#34; It&#39;s not just about Ruby. Matz, you also have another face, as an OSS developer, an open-source developer, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>I haven&#39;t done much prominent stuff recently, but there was a long time when people didn&#39;t understand what open-source software was. Back then, as someone with experience actually creating open-source software, I often had opportunities to talk about what it is, its characteristics, and its goals.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>In 2000, yes. Around the early 2000s, until about 2010, I often talked about open source in general quite a bit.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>I sensed that boom too.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>It seemed to follow that open source trend from that time, from that era.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>As a conference, they were talking about developer experience, but it&#39;s developer-driven, and there&#39;s quite an ideological aspect to it, isn&#39;t there? That sense of freedom.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right, yes.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And on top of that, building it themselves. And with that, they actually changed things.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>For people in modern times, those who have gotten involved in software development recently, for example, open-source software isn&#39;t anything particularly rare. It&#39;s already there.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, for instance, instead of discussing the freedom aspect, it becomes more like, &#34;Let&#39;s just use what&#39;s available.&#34; In that sense, a kind of succession problem tends to arise.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Meaning, including the ideology of open-source software, I do have some concern about how many young people will inherit it.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>In other words, for example, Ruby was first created 30 years ago, and it&#39;s the same for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation), PHP, and &lt;a target=" _blank"="" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language">Java</a>&#34;&gt;Apache—though Java isn&#39;t strictly open source.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And among those many open-source software projects, quite a few were created 20 or 30 years ago. Some were even created earlier than that.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And many people use them because they&#39;ve always been available as open-source software. But if you think about the next 10, 20, 30 years, new open-source software should be continuously emerging even now.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>However, if people just take for granted things that were made 20 years ago, and end up only being consumers, then there might not be anyone to create new open-source software while inheriting its ideology. I have some anxiety about that.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Especially recently, there&#39;s this trend, right? Things that were open source are being made closed again.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right. There are also cases where you wonder, &#34;What exactly is open and to what extent?&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>For example, AI-related stuff. They call it &#34;open-source AI,&#34; but only a part of the source code is released, or the original data isn&#39;t released so there&#39;s no reproducibility. Can you really call that open source? There are cases like that.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>I see. So for you, Matz, the current trend... 10 years ago, or around the time you were just talking about, that trend was very strong, the power of open source.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Is that now, perhaps, regressing?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right. Well, precisely because it&#39;s become commonplace, if you search the internet, there&#39;s an abundance of software available for free.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>However, for each of those free-to-use software, there&#39;s someone behind the scenes creating it. And those people can&#39;t live on air, so they have to secure sponsors somewhere and maintain their livelihood simultaneously.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>But that&#39;s not visible to the users, is it?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, if people think that open-source software will always be available without any effort, it might die out somewhere along the line.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>I see. Do you discuss these kinds of topics, for example, with people abroad?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>I don&#39;t actively bring up these topics, but when the conversation turns to open source, I sometimes do.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>On a completely different note, someone like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus (Torvalds)</a> is very much in this context.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>I&#39;ve hardly ever met Linus.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Oh, is that so.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>We just sort of passed each other and exchanged brief greetings, that&#39;s about it. I think it was when he came to Japan, we passed by each other, and I introduced myself as the Ruby developer, saying &#34;Nice to meet you.&#34; That was about 20 years ago, just a quick greeting.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>You know, Linus, regarding GitHub—well, he created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, and then the GitHub service was built around it. In some talk, he said, &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m4hlWx7oRk&amp;t=1082s">Ruby people weird(strange) people</a>.&#34;</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>He said, &#34;Ruby people weird people&#34; (laughs).</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>It was meant in a positive way, a nuance of them trying new things, including various strange things. And, well, I&#39;d be happy if we were perceived that way.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Huh, interesting.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Apparently, Linus wanted Git to be deliberately complex and difficult to raise the barrier for commits. Because GitHub made it easy to use, he was told something like, &#34;You guys are the enemy.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Hmm, because they made it easy... No, if anything, I think Linus wanted to create a peer-to-peer distributed system.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>So, Git itself has individual local repositories, right? You can push to someone else&#39;s local repository, or use their local repository, and for releases, you&#39;d access a specific repository. Just looking at the Git specification, it feels like he wanted to create a completely symmetrical peer-to-peer system. But GitHub is centralized, isn&#39;t it?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>You go to the central GitHub service every time, right? He went to the trouble of creating a distributed system, but GitHub turned it back into a centralized one. So, in that sense, from Linus&#39;s ideological perspective, it might feel like an enemy.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Interesting. And GitHub is closed-source, sort of.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is, though.</p>

And speaking of open source, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)">Martin Fowler</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a> are also quite fond of open source, aren&#39;t they?</p>

I think he was the first one to say that.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Martin Fowler&#39;s naming skills are incredible.</p>

And I think it was at a dinner during the conference held in Denmark in 2015, he said something like, &#34;Ruby people are really nice and something,&#34; and I believe that&#39;s the basis for it.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s a bit interesting.

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Martin compliments by saying &#34;nice.&#34; That means the community is acceptable and friendly.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Compared to other open-source software communities, he said the Ruby community is open, nice, and friendly.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Yes, I really feel that. The character of the community, or rather, as we were discussing a little earlier, the quality of a community changes depending on what kind of companies or people use the language. Matz created Ruby entirely from scratch, and, well, you often say you don&#39;t even really know why Ruby became popular.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Well, you are &#34;humble&#34; in English, that very modest demeanor, I completely agree with Martin Fowler, I think it shapes the community. And, you know, I still really love the Ruby community. That&#39;s why I&#39;m still here, at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://euruko.org/">EuRuKo</a> too.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>You were asked about that a little earlier, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>I don&#39;t really know the background behind why it&#39;s like that, but I think that slightly modest, humble feeling is a characteristic of Japanese people.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Another thing is, at conferences, I always give a keynote, right?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s right.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>What that is, have you heard of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</a>?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>I know it. Huh, even Matz (Matz&#39;s nickname)?!</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>You know, when you achieve something, you feel like, &#34;No, I&#39;m probably not worthy of this evaluation.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s what they call Impostor Syndrome. So when people ask, &#34;Why is Ruby so wonderful?&#34; and I say, &#34;Well, I don&#39;t know,&#34; that&#39;s really what&#39;s behind it, deep down.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yeah, I don&#39;t remember doing anything that deserves that much praise, and its originality isn&#39;t that high either, so I wonder why. And then I answer, &#34;It&#39;s luck.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And that, um, well, what is it, I think that might be part of the background for being seen as humble.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Just hearing that now, it sounds like you lack confidence.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>No, there are assertive people, right? &#34;I&#39;m amazing because I&#39;m great.&#34; I can&#39;t be like that.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Interesting. This might be a bit blunt, but that&#39;s a different style from DHH, for example, isn&#39;t it?</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s right, DHH is assertive.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Yes, assertive.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>No, I think his style, that characteristic, is important though.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s true.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Well, so with just my style, it probably wouldn&#39;t have become popular.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And I think it&#39;s very likely that because DHH pushed Rails so strongly, Ruby was pulled along with it and became what it is.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Actually, before Ruby on Rails, I think the stronger impression of Ruby was, &#34;It might be a pretty good language, but it&#39;s not very exciting.&#34;</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Hmm, I also feel that my lack of assertiveness might have been a cause.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>But, you know, Dave Thomas, who&#39;s here this time too, came to Japan for a workshop 10 years ago, and I went to that workshop.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>And then, in the evening, I went to a drinking party, but hardly anyone came, probably because people couldn&#39;t speak English, I think.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>What a waste.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>But he said Ruby still feels like a friend to him, and even now he sometimes has new, fresh insights. I&#39;m looking forward to what he&#39;ll talk about this time.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Yes, he mentioned he&#39;d talk about various languages. He said there are some languages that even Matz doesn&#39;t know. So I&#39;m looking forward to what kind of languages he&#39;ll introduce.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>you&#39;re originally a programming language enthusiast, you know a ton of different languages.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s true. But, well, he is also the same as me!(laughs). He also tends to really love languages. He said he&#39;d introduce a few languages that I probably don&#39;t know either.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Wow!</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>And apparently, MatzLisp is a play on that.</p>

      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stevenrbaker.com/about.html">Steven (Baker)</a>, the creator of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, who is here this time, gave a keynote at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://2023.euruko.org/">previous EuRuKo</a> in Lithuania. He casually mentioned, though it wasn&#39;t his main point, something like, &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olc0qbSyJQw&amp;t=1724s">There are only two perfect languages in this world: Lisp and SmallTalk</a>.&#34;.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Now, you (Matz) are saying something similar, in terms of language specification.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>That&#39;s true. SmallTalk, well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, but it&#39;s a language worthy of respect, for me.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Wow, I&#39;ve never touched them. I&#39;m a Ruby child, raised on Ruby.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>Ah, this is great, I want to talk more about various things, unrelated to the Overseas Migration Channel (laughs).</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Aha, the talk about overseas migration was only a little bit at the beginning (laughs).</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s right (laughs).</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>We talked a bit about English, I think, but after that, it was all about Ruby.</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s right. Well, let&#39;s try to force it, force it back at the end (laughs).</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/guest_interview_profiles/matz-f68639e073d0f0fcb287a779e5592d0568856e49606f8dcc52da35f488602ae4.webp"/>Matz:  </span>Okay, let&#39;s bring it back, back to the topic of English!</p>
      <p><span><img src="https://debamitro.github.io/assets/logos/ctokoro_mini-eec8117d5357657959bf5a5eea6e6c4505717190025bb842fca85acd03b93dc3.webp"/>Chikahiro:  </span>That&#39;s right (laughs). So, so, up until now, this Ruby...</p>
