<h2 id="h-geospatial-data-isn-t-special-anymore-and-that-s-a-good-thing">Geospatial data isn’t special anymore, and that’s a good thing.</h2>


<p>Geospatial solutions were thought of as “special”, because what modernized the data ecosystem of today, left geospatial data mostly behind. This changes today. </p>





<h2 id="h-geospatial-challenges"><strong>Geospatial challenges</strong></h2>


<p>Geospatial data has been disconnected from the broader data ecosystem that modernized from open file formats like Apache Parquet, and open table formats like Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi.</p>


<h2 id="h-the-silos-will-break-down"><strong>The silos will break down</strong></h2>


<p>With native geospatial data type support in Apache Iceberg and Parquet, you can seamlessly run query and processing engines like Wherobots, DuckDB, Apache Sedona, Apache Spark, Databricks, Snowflake, and BigQuery on your data. All the while benefitting from faster queries and lower storage costs from Parquet formatted data.</p>


<h2 id="h-benefits-of-iceberg-and-parquet"><strong><strong>Benefits of Iceberg and Parquet</strong></strong></h2>


<p>These changes make geospatial solutions based on a data lake a lot more attractive. Here are a few benefits. </p>


<ul>
<li>Iceberg and Parquet alone don’t separate compute from storage, but together they make it possible to utilize low cost data lake storage, along with multiple independent high performance computing solutions for different use cases</li>



<li>ACID transactions and data versioning enable the use of multiple compute engines without conflicts</li>



<li>Time travel allows tracking of data changes over time</li>



<li>Query performance is higher from features like column pruning, row-group filtering, and fast file access</li>



<li>Open data formats minimize vendor lock-in</li>



<li>Geospatial data will be supported across a broader ecosystem of tools and services</li>



<li>And many more…</li>
</ul>


<p>In the coming weeks, we will be covering these features in detail and demonstrate how they’re beneficial for geospatial solutions. </p>


<h2 id="h-grassroots-efforts-made-this-happen"><strong>Grassroots efforts made this happen<br/></strong></h2>


<p>These changes were the result of grassroots initiatives, investment, and influence from community members at Planet, CARTO, Wherobots, and many others across the Cloud Native Geospatial community. This includes GeoParquet, which was a grassroots project and an extension of Parquet that proved its worth through use and popularity, countless meetups, and discussions. And we also want to give credit to the Iceberg community for working with members of the Wherobots team, to bring a solution forward while also influencing the Parquet community to make a GEO native data type.</p>


<blockquote>
<strong></strong><em><em>“The long-awaited incorporation of geospatial data types in the Iceberg V3 spec extends a core theme of Iceberg as a project to provide a universal ‘shared warehouse storage’ across many engines and users, and will now allow this huge, growing ecosystem to work on the same geospatial data as well, unlocking many exciting use cases. It is also a demonstration of Iceberg community’s willingness to take the time and ‘do hard things’, engaging in months of very active discussions across companies and OSS communities, finally reaching consensus on a spec that supports the largest variety of use cases in the fast-evolving geospatial data domain.”</em></em>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<strong>Thoughts from Chris Holmes, co-creator of Geo-parquet<br/></strong><em>“The community developed and rallied behind GeoParquet to make geospatial data in Parquet fully interoperable and to let the geospatial world tap into all the advantages the big data world has been getting from Parquet. I’m very excited to see Parquet and Iceberg formally support geospatial types, and look forward to the acceleration in geospatial innovation that these changes will activate across industries and for our planet.”</em>
</blockquote>


<h2 id="h-looking-ahead"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>


<p><strong><br/></strong>Committers are already working to bring support for these changes into Apache Sedona, and will notify the community as they are introduced. </p>


<p>At Wherobots, we’ve supported these GEO datatypes in <a href="https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/references/havasu/introduction/">Havasu (our Iceberg fork)</a> which we built to enable <a href="https://wherobots.com/building-a-spatial-data-lakehouse/">geospatial lakehouse architectures</a> with Wherobots, along with GeoParquet. We’ve begun developing native support for Iceberg and Parquet into how Wherobots operates on customer data, and will put our full support behind these native formats moving forward.</p>
