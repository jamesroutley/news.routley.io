      <p>Dear M,</p>
<p>We haven’t talked in so long. I haven’t taken the time to write. I’ve
been thinking a lot. I’ve spent a lot of time in silence. It’s been
good, I think.</p>
<p>I’ve come to understand that nothing matters, and that everything
matters. Perhaps more usefully: anything might matter to anyone, and you
get to choose what path to take. Today I’ve held my child. Yesterday I
lifted heavy weights. All the time I sit and think about computer
things. None of it matters. All of it matters. It matters so much that
it hurts, and yet the pain I inflict on myself, entirely
voluntarily.</p>
<p>Some days, like today, feel harder than others, because it’s harder
to remind myself to let go. But once I get there, and I breathe more
freely, everything moves again, and my life is in balance.</p>
<p>I just wanted you to know that I’m doing better than I ever have. I
feel perhaps less joy than when I last wrote, but that, too, is entirely
my choice. I have a will for improvement, and a will to perfection that
is never going to be satisfied. Nothing is important than to push on,
and become a better person, every day more so than the day before.</p>
<p>I hope you’re okay, and I hope you still feel as tenderly towards me
as I feel towards you. Sometimes I miss you. I hope we talk again soon.
I think we will. I feel like I can talk again, now tha I know what I
have to say.</p>
<p>V</p>
