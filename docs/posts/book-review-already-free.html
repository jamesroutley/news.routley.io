        <p>
          Like most people, my teens and twenties have been confusing and not
          always the most fun. I’ve struggled to make friends. In high school
          and university, I didn’t have as many romantic relationships as I
          wanted. When I was 24, I met a beautiful, wonderful woman who became
          my wife, but I still feel like I have a lot of room to be a better
          husband. I lucked into a relatively stable and interesting career, but
          my day-to-day experience with work has involved a lot of emotional
          swings and occasional disillusionment. In general, I’ve struggled to
          feel consistently happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven’t really figured out what to do about all this. I’ve thought
          about talking to a mental health professional, but never ended up
          doing it. I’ve told my wife and my friends about some of my feelings,
          but I haven’t felt comfortable being honest about all of it.

          About a month ago, Ben Congdon
          <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/12/25/My-Favorite-Books-of-2023-2025/">blogged</a>
          about his favourite books of the past couple of years. I wasn’t
          reading as much as I wanted to, and wanted to give myself some more
          book options, so I downloaded some of his recommendations, including
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12400671-already-free"><em>Already Free</em></a>
          by Bruce Tift.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really glad Ben recommended the book, and that I read it. I feel
          like it’s improved my thinking on some of the big questions I’ve had
          about myself and life over the last decade:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Why do the actions of the people around me sometimes activate me so
            much?
          </li>
          <li>How can I stop feeling activated in those situations?</li>
          <li>
            Why is it the people who are closest to me who rub me the wrong way
            the most?
          </li>
          <li>When I become a parent, how can I be a good one?</li>
          <li>Are the postrats onto something?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.brucetift.com/">Bruce Tift</a> is a therapist
          who’s also practiced Vajrayana Buddhism for 40 years. At the time of
          writing, he lived with his wife in Boulder, Colorado.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift studied at Naropa University, a private, Buddhist-inspired
          university founded by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6gyam_Trungpa">Chögyam Trungpa</a>. Trungpa died in 1987, and the impression I get from Wikipedia is
          that he did a number of morally reprehensible things while alive. Tift
          doesn’t mention this, saying that it was “good fortune” to have been
          Trungpa’s student, and quoting Trungpa several times in the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not sure what to make of this. I didn’t know about it until after
          I finished reading <em>Already Free</em>. Provisionally, I’m not going
          to discount what I’ve learned from the book, including the idea that
          being spiritually adept isn’t enough to make you a good person:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If we focus only on acceptance and immediacy, we may ignore
            historically conditioned patterns that are causing harm to ourselves
            and others. I’ve worked with a number of spiritual practitioners who
            are able to generate very spacious states of mind but who avoid
            dealing with basic human concerns like work and relationship. (106)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [I]f we want to live in society—if we’re going to be a parent, a
            partner, a teacher, or somebody trying to be of benefit to
            others—it’s very important to do the developmental work to process
            our “characterological” issues. Because even though we might not
            feel identified with those issues anymore, the people we relate to
            may still be profoundly affected by our unresolved reenactment
            behaviors. (125)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          Many of Tift’s clients complain that something is missing from what,
          on the surface, seems like a happy life. To him, it seems like they’re
          describing a missing sense of freedom. They want to achieve a mental
          state of “embodied presence, spontaneity, openheartedness, alertness,
          humor, courage, clarity, resilience, equanimity, confidence.” (292)
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift presents two views on this: the developmental and the fruitional.
        </p>
        <p>
          The developmental view, based on developmental psychology, looks at
          how our parents treated us in childhood. As children, we were
          basically powerless in the face of the adults around us. We couldn’t
          simply leave and navigate the world by ourselves. And, our parents had
          their own issues, issues that came across in their relationships with
          us. Maybe they were overbearing. Maybe they were distant. Maybe they
          couldn’t be there for us because of illness or divorce. In Tift’s
          case, he says his parents rewarded him disproportionately for
          demonstrating his independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make our relationships with our parents work, we suppressed the
          parts of ourselves that weren’t adapted to our circumstances. If our
          parents kept their distance, we might have become extremely
          independent and pushed down any desire to connect to them. Or, we
          might have constantly reached out to them for connection, suppressing
          the part of us that wanted to be separate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift emphasizes that these techniques saved us emotional pain when we
          were children. But, he claims, people bring these techniques into
          their adult relationships without checking if they’re still useful. We
          continue to suppress our desire to connect to others, or our desire to
          be separate. This causes unnecessary suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The developmental view of self-improvement is to notice situations
          where we habitually apply these behavioural patterns from our past.
          Instead, gradually, we can choose to apply new, adult techniques to
          these situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, the fruitional view cuts to the heart of the matter.
          Rather than spending a bunch of time working on our reactions to
          different situations, what if we just accepted our reactions for what
          they are? What if we paid attention to our experience of each moment?
          Is that experience actually going to hurt us, or is it, to use one of
          Tift’s favourite words, “workable”?
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift’s major claim is that, even in moments of very strong emotion,
          you should expect to find that your experience is workable. It’s safe
          for you to be aware of those feelings. It won’t hurt you or kill you.
          It may feel like a “survival-level threat”, but it’s not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift suggests first using the fruitional view to build a base of
          personal responsibility for our thoughts and feelings, and acceptance
          of both the positive and negative. Then, we can use the developmental
          view to look for concrete ways to improve our life circumstances: to
          have more positive thoughts and feelings, and fewer negative ones.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Tift spends two chapters applying these ideas to romantic
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Western society, “intimacy is only supposed to be positive and
          happy.” (228) But, in Tift’s eyes, relationships are also a source of
          disturbance. That includes his own marriage: “Just by being herself,
          my wife is almost guaranteed to touch some sore spot of mine. She’s
          not causing that sore spot. By her proximity, she pushes against my
          tender spots, my vulnerabilities.” (208)
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift is a couple’s therapist. He’s seen hundreds or thousands of
          unhappy couples in his work, and many fewer happy couples in his life.
          Still, his experience is consistent with mine. I see acquaintances in
          a positive light, then get upset or frustrated with my loved ones,
          friends, and teammates at work. I’m more likely to commit the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">fundamental attribution error</a>
          with the people closest to me than with a stranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift says that relationships tend to be composed of one person who
          wants to connect and one person who wants to be separate: a
          “distancer-pursuer” dynamic. These tendencies come from the way our
          families of origin treated us in childhood. In Tift’s view, each of us
          contains both a desire to connect and a desire to be separate, but we
          want to suppress the desire that was maladaptive in childhood. So, we
          choose partners that represents the parts of ourselves we’ve disowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve noticed this in my own relationships. With one exception, I
          believe I’ve been the distancer, and my partner’s been the pursuer.
          During the honeymoon phase, this is exciting! The other person brings
          a fresh, new energy to your life. But, as the relationship goes on,
          you start to feel angry at the other person, just like you feel angry
          at that disowned part of yourself. Your “fundamental aggression toward
          that energy start[s] to come out” (234). If you don’t address the
          aggression, it can damage or kill the relationship.
        </p>
        
        <p>What does Tift say to do about this?</p>
        <p>
          First, I’ll say that Tift notes his techniques aren’t for everyone:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “No style of therapeutic work is a good fit for everybody, and the
            work I’m discussing is really best suited to those with at least
            neurotic levels of organization. It’s not particularly appropriate
            for people with preneurotic organization, those who would be called
            borderline or psychotic, or those with pervasive traumatic
            organization.” (187)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In other words, it’s for people who are generally in touch with
          reality and function well day-to-day, and who haven’t experienced a
          lot of trauma. Tift says that it can be quite overwhelming, even
          retraumatizing, to experience sensations that were suppressed because
          of trauma. To work with those sensations, he recommends seeing a
          therapist with relevant experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for those problems that are less severe but still affect our
          quality of life? Tift recommends starting with the fruitional view. He
          asks his patients to say out loud to him, “I may live with this
          negative feeling, on and off, for the rest of my life.” He asks them
          to pay attention to the sensations they feel in their body when they
          say that. He wants them to check if those sensations are in fact a
          survival-level threat, or if they’re workable after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also gives a couple of developmental-view techniques for handling
          relationship conflict more skillfully. He suggests taking breaks
          during arguments and other situations where we notice we’re getting
          overwhelmed. Instead of complaining about our partner’s behaviour, he
          recommends making specific requests for behavioural changes, in a
          neutral or friendly way. He gives the example of asking a partner to
          clean up after themselves for five minutes before dinner every day,
          instead of resenting them for not doing it of their own accord.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, Tift’s description of unconditional practices stuck with me the
          most. Instead of, or in addition to, meditation and other timeboxed
          spiritual practices, Tift suggests building three habits that you can
          apply many times a day, and that you try to apply all the time. The
          first two are unconditional immediacy and kindness: paying attention
          to our immediate experience, no matter whether it’s positive or
          negative, and having an attitude of “kindness or even love” (90)
          towards it.
        </p>
        
        <p>The third unconditional practice is unconditional embodiment.</p>
        <p>
          When I lived in Canada, I was part of
          <a href="https://kwrationality.ca/">an awesome rationality meetup group</a>. As the website says, we liked to talk about “becoming e m b o d i e
          d”. But, I didn&#39;t really understand what embodiment was. Being more…
          in (em?) your body, I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading <em>Already Free,</em> I feel like I understand
          embodiment well enough that I can try to practice it unconditionally,
          in my daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practicing embodiment is kind of like
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics">Gendlin’s Focusing</a>, but it isn’t aimed at labelling or understanding sensations:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            With some types of body-centered therapy, the invitation is to stay
            embodied and then listen to the message that our body is trying to
            give us. Such therapies are valuable work. But the fruitional
            practice of immediacy is different. We don’t listen for any sort of
            message. Maybe there is no message. Maybe it’s just immediate
            experience. We don’t necessarily need to be making meaning about it.
            (190)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Western therapy mostly analyzes emotions and thoughts. Tift prefers
          paying attention to sensations in the body. “Sensation is less
          distractive, less personal, and less fascinating. It’s more
          straightforward—cleaner, in a certain way.” (204) I believe this
          perspective is more Buddhist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift sees emotions and thoughts as layers of interpretation on top of
          raw sensation. Sensation isn’t everything: “Concepts are very
          important. We need to be able to think conceptually in order to live
          more than biological lives. To recognize patterns, to plan for the
          future, to imagine possibilities—all require thinking.” (185) But:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “While perhaps less-literate societies would do well to take on a
            corrective practice of applying more interpretation to their
            experience, we in the Western world might want to do the corrective
            practice of embodied immediacy” (187)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          (Not everyone, though. E.g.
          <a href="https://hollyelmore.substack.com/p/i-believed-the-hype-and-did-mindfulness-meditation-for-dumb-reasons-now-im-trying-to-reverse-the-damage">here</a>
          and <a href="https://www.cheetahhouse.org/">here</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m very much a typical Western dude here. Probably since I was a
          preteen, I’ve lived mostly on the level of thoughts. High school,
          university, knowledge work, and reading thousands of words a day from
          Twitter and my RSS reader all require a lot of shape rotation and
          wordcellery. My other hobbies, like watching YouTube videos, are often
          a way to dissociate. I haven’t spent much time paying attention to raw
          sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tift thinks that becoming embodied is necessary, but not sufficient,
          to dissolve the patterns of emotional suppression that the
          developmental view focuses on. To form these patterns, we had to
          suppress parts of ourselves, and the sensations they caused in our
          bodies. Before we can start using more adult techniques, we have to
          learn to pay attention to those sensations again.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sensations might give rise to anxiety and even panic. It takes
          discipline to pay attention to them. In any given moment, it’s easier
          to ignore them. Who wants to feel a ball of anxiety in the pit of
          their stomach, pain in their heart, or their eyes tearing up? To help
          with this, Tift “often suggest[s] that [his] clients take this
          practice of embodied immediacy into their daily lives, ideally finding
          some structure to remind themselves to practice.” (183)
        </p>
        <p>
          And, wouldn’t you know it, he does one better and basically suggests
          installing a
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ESnzpoCJrAfwAzpMB/hammertime-day-3-taps">TAP</a>. In fact, it sounds a lot like
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/summoning-sapience">summoning sapience</a>, with a trigger of noticing strong sensations in our body. “[W]e may
          find that our habitual patterns may actually serve as a reminder to
          direct our attention to the experience of openness.” (166) “Why not
          just train ourselves to use our disturbance as a signal to wake up and
          pay attention?” (184)
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I love how <em>Already Free</em> emphasizes the value of working with
          the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that are already there, instead
          of wishing they were different:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It’s difficult to acknowledge the truth of separateness. It feels
            like we’re risking loss of the relationship. But the separateness is
            already there; it’s actually nothing new. What’s new is that we’re
            starting to work with it consciously. (230)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Tift is constantly telling the reader to investigate what is “most
          true in the moment”. Rather than deferring to him, he recommends
          everyone find out for themselves if their own experiences are
          threatening or manageable. Very rationalist of him. It makes me want
          to propose the Litany of Tift:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If my feelings are workable, I desire to believe that my feelings
            are workable. If my feelings are not workable, I desire to believe
            that my feelings are not workable. Let me not become attached to
            beliefs I may not want.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Another theme I love is taking personal responsibility for my own
          experience. For too long, I’ve been at least somewhat blaming other
          people for my negative emotions. In particular, I’d like to take
          Tift’s suggestion of viewing personal relationships as playgrounds for
          spiritual growth. If I’m going to experience disruption in my
          relationships, on and off, for the rest of my life, I might as well
          get some benefit out of it!

          I also appreciate the idea of unconditional practices. A few years
          ago, I had a daily meditation practice, but eventually I stopped.
          Unconditional embodiment feels easier to me than spending X minutes a
          day meditating. Frequency matters: “[I]f we can remember to do the
          practice twenty times a day, things will probably move along quite a
          bit faster than if we remember to do it once a week.” (183)

          I’m less sure about the parts of the book with stronger Buddhist
          influences. Tift talks about progressing on a spiritual path towards
          enlightenment, the self being an illusion, and how awareness is
          fundamental to our experience and always present. I’m not planning to
          lean into these ideas right now. I do think <em>Already Free</em> is
          quite useful, even discounting these parts of it.

          I’m a bit concerned that, if I train myself to tolerate intense
          sensations, I’ll lose my ability to detect subtle ones. I’m not too
          concerned, though. I’m already pretty disembodied. I don’t think it
          can get much worse!

          Another concern is that, by paying attention to sensation, I might
          accidentally train myself to suppress thoughts. In my experience with
          mindfulness meditation, I’ve had trouble just letting my thoughts rise
          and fall. I tend to really try to get in there and prevent myself from
          thinking anything. I could see that carrying over to unconditional
          embodiment.

          My biggest source of frustration with <em>Already Free</em> is Tift
          saying that the developmental and fruitional views “create a rich
          friction that’s never resolvable”, and how, similarly, you can’t
          resolve two concepts like connection and separateness, or have one
          without the other. These parts of the book feel like

          In 2020, I blogged about
          <a href="https://thomasbroadley.com/blog/a-small-mindfulness-win/">“a small mindfulness win”</a>. Unfortunately, I think that was the only situation in the past six
          years where I successfully applied embodied immediacy. In 2026, I’m
          going to change that.

          In the past week, I’ve been paying more attention to my
          moment-to-moment experience and… it’s been more workable than I
          expected. To be fair, I haven’t felt any particularly disturbing
          feelings. But, I have been able to pay attention to the smaller,
          day-to-day feelings of disturbance. They don’t feel as bad as, maybe,
          I’ve been building them up to be.
        </p>
        <p>My plan for February is to install the following TAP:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            When I have strong sensations in my body, I’ll pay attention to
            those sensations with a feeling of kindness.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To do that, I’m going to bring some unhappy or embarrassing memories
          to mind, and see for myself if the feelings that come along with them
          are actually problematic. I expect they won’t be, but I’m going to try
          to be open to proving myself wrong.
