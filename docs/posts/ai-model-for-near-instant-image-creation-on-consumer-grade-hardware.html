The pan-University Institute brings together Surrey&#39;s core AI-related expertise in vision, speech and signal processing, computer science, and mathematics, with its domain expertise across engineering and physical sciences, human and animal health, law and regulation, business, finance and the arts and social sciences. With this distinctive approach, PAI builds on Surrey&#39;s track record of collaboration with industry, the public sector, government and other relevant institutions to develop solutions to shared challenges.   </p><p>To find more details, visit <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank"><strong>surrey.ac.uk/ai</strong></a> or follow @peoplecentredai </p><p><strong>About SketchX </strong> </p><p>SketchX is a world-leading computer vision and AI research group within the Institute for People-Centred AI and the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey.  The group is led by Prof. Yi-Zhe SonG and specialises in pioneering AI technologies that push the boundaries of creative and interactive applications.
