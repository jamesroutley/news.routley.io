    <h1>Ask HN: Someone is proxy-mirroring my website, can I do anything?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi Hacker News community,</p><p>I&#39;m trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.</p><p>- Original: <a href="https://www.saashub.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.saashub.com</a></p><p>- Abuser/Proxy-mirror: <a href="https://sukuns.us.to" rel="nofollow">https://sukuns.us.to</a></p><p>My ideas of resolution:</p><p>1) Block them by IP - That doesn&#39;t work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.</p><p>2) Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to</p><p>3) Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.</p><p>4) Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.</p><p>i.e. I&#39;m out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.</p><p>p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub&#39;s content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I&#39;ve reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.</p></div></div></div>
