<p>Intel has removed support for SGX (software guard extension) in 12th Generation Intel Core 11000 and 12000 processors, rendering modern PCs unable to playback Blu-ray disks in 4K resolution.</p>
<p>This technical problem arises from the fact that Blu-ray disks require Digital Rights Management (DRM), which needs the presence of SGX to work.</p>
<p>This is a feature that Intel introduced in the Skylake generation back in 2016, enabling PCs to play protected Blu-ray disks for the first time.</p>
<p>As seen in Intel&#39;s current datasheets for the 11th and 12th generation of its Core desktop processors, the SGX is listed as a deprecated technology, so it&#39;s no longer available.</p>

<h2>Why did Intel abandon SGX?</h2>
<p>As a secure enclave technology, SGX was commonly targeted by security researchers who discovered numerous vulnerabilities and attack methods.</p>
<p>Examples of attacks targeting Intel SGX include:</p>
<ul><li>the Prime+Probe attack discovered in 2017,</li>
<li>a Spectre-like attack disclosed in 2018,</li>
<li>an Enclave attack discovered by researchers in 2019,</li>
<li>a MicroScope replay attack,</li>
<li>the so-called &#34;Plundervolt&#34; injection attack,</li>
<li>a Load Value Injection (LVI), and</li>
<li>the SGAxe attack on the CPU cache resulting in the leak of the enclave&#39;s content.</li>
</ul><p>In summary, Intel had more to gain from SGX&#39;s deprecation from the perspective of security. </p>
<p>Considering that most users don&#39;t care about Blu-ray playback on the PC, taking that decision must have been straightforward.</p>
<h2>Impact and solutions</h2>
<p>The issue impacts Ultra HD Blu-ray discs that use DRM, so if the Blu-ray Disc Association ever decides to lift the strict protections, the playback will return to nominal resolutions (3840 x 2160).</p>
<p>Also, since SGX was removed in recent chip generations, users who would like to avoid problems can stick to using 7000, 8000, 9000, or 10000-series CPUs.</p>
<p>Skylake (6000 series) has SGX but misses HDCP 2.2, and that would cause hurdles with HDMI 2.0 transmission.</p>
<p>CyberLink, the company behind the &#34;PowerDVD&#34; software product, has updated its FAQ to reflect the problem with newer gen Intel processors, claiming inability to resolve it in any way.</p>
<p>&#34;The removal of the SGX feature, and its compatibility with the latest Windows OS and drivers, has caused a substantial challenge for CyberLink to continue supporting Ultra HD Blu-ray movie playback in our player software.&#34; - details <a href="https://www.cyberlink.com/support/faq-content.do?id=26690" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the FAQ page</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;So much so, that it has been determined that it is no longer feasible for CyberLink to support the Ultra HD Blu-ray playback on newer CPUs and the latest Windows platforms.&#34;</p>
<p>In addition to using an older Intel CPU, CyberLink also advises people not to upgrade to Windows 11 to avoid having the needful drivers replaced.</p>
<h2>Blu-ray disks in 2022</h2>
<p>Blu-ray disks may sound like something from the distant past that has been phased out, but it&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dvd-collectors-physical-discs-not-dead-streaming-netflix-digital-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">not obsolete yet</a>.</p>
<p>People are still buying them because they have collectible value and they enjoy having something physical and tangible, giving a sense of ownership and possibly even attachment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Some people: I like getting my movies on plastic discs, because I actually own them that way.</p>
— Will Dormann (@wdormann) <a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1481961821825347587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 14, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Blu-ray disks can offer 4K content entertainment without an internet connection, and the quality is stable and guaranteed, contrary to streaming.</p>
<p>No matter if a movie leaves a streaming service or if the digital rights change in the future, a physical disk makes the content permanently available.</p>
<p>And finally, some people are just nostalgic or enjoy following the &#34;ritual&#34; of putting the disk on the drive.</p>
<p>For all the above reasons and many more, Ultra HD Blu-ray isn&#39;t dead yet, and Intel&#39;s decision to deprecate the SGX will impact a substantial number of users.</p>
