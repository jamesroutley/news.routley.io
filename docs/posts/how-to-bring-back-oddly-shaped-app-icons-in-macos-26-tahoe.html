    <h1>How to Bring Back Oddly Shaped App Icons in macOS 26 Tahoe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>June 11, 2025</p><p>macOS 26 Tahoe replaces the oddly shaped app icons that once brought joy and personality to the Dock with the familiar squircle icons from iOS.</p><p>Here&#39;s what that looks like. The lovely Things icon now sits awkwardly on a glass background ðŸ˜¢</p><img src="https://simonbs.dev/images/posts/how-to-bring-back-oddly-shaped-app-icons-on-macos-26-tahoe/before.png" alt="Dock in macOS 26 showing the Things app icon placed on a glass surface."/><p>I strongly dislike this change. Part of the Macâ€™s soul was in its expressive, varied app icons, a case of character over conformity.</p><p>Fortunately, there&#39;s a way to bring back the personality and charm that custom icon shapes add to macOS. This post shows how to do it both as a macOS user and as an app developer.</p><h3>For Users: Restoring Custom Icon Shapes</h3><p>When you manually assign an app icon through Finder, macOS respects the shape and doesn&#39;t force the glass background. Interestingly, this also works if you just replace the icon with the same one.</p><img src="https://simonbs.dev/images/posts/how-to-bring-back-oddly-shaped-app-icons-on-macos-26-tahoe/after.png" alt="Dock in macOS 26 showing the Things app icon with its old oddly shaped icon."/><p>Here&#39;s how to replace the app icon:</p><ol><li>Right-click the app in the Applications folder and choose <strong>Get Info</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the app again and choose <strong>Show Package Contents</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>Contents</strong> folder.</li><li>Then open the <strong>Resources</strong> folder.</li><li>Find the icon file with the <code>.icns</code> extension.</li><li>Drag that file onto the icon thumbnail in the info panel.</li><li>Quit and relaunch the app to see the updated icon in the Dock.</li></ol><p>Here&#39;s a short video showing the steps:</p><video autoplay="" playsinline="" muted="" loop="" controls="">

Steps needed to replace the app icon.
</video><p>App developers will likely start shipping new squircle-style icons soon. If you prefer the current look, it&#39;s a good idea to back up their <code>.icns</code> files now so you can restore the classic shape later.</p><h3>For Developers: Swapping Icons at Runtime</h3><p>Although squircle icons are now the default, developers can still display a custom-shaped icon in the Dock by setting a view on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile/contentview"><code>NSApplication.shared.dockTile.contentView</code></a>.</p><p>That&#39;s what I will do in <a href="https://www.festivitas.app">Festivitas</a> and <a href="https://www.smashsmash.app">Smash Smash</a>. The default icon keeps everything inside the squircle, and anything that extends beyond it gets clipped. On launch, I use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile">NSDockTile</a> API to replace it with the full version that includes the unique shape.</p><p>Here&#39;s what that looks like when users launch Festivitas and Smash Smash with those changes:</p><video autoplay="" playsinline="" muted="" loop="">
