    <h1>Christmas shopping the IBM way: computerized gift selection in 1962</h1>

<p>In 1962, the Simpson&#39;s department store in Toronto used an IBM computer to help customers select Christmas gifts, based on the characteristics of the recipients.<span id="fnref:refs"><a href="#fn:refs">1</a></span>
    I came across a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/christmas-shopping-the-ibm-way">video</a> that shows how it worked.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/christmas-list/National_Post.jpg"><img alt="&#34;Now!

<p>The IBM 1401 computer (below) was pre-programmed with 3000 categorized gifts.<span id="fnref:1401"><a href="#fn:1401">2</a></span>
A customer described the gift recipient:
their age range, their interests,
their gender (male, female, or couple), the gift category (e.g. apparel, personal, or &#34;the man who has everything&#34;), and the price range (ranging from $5 to &#34;money is no object&#34;).</p>

<p>This information was punched onto a card by an operator (called a &#34;girl&#34; in the interview) using an IBM 26 keypunch, as shown below.</p>

<p>After running the card through the computer, a gift list with ten suggestions was printed on the IBM 1403 line printer.
The list was torn off and given to the customer to help with their shopping.</p>

<p>The gift suggestions included
a King James bible, Eskimo soapstone, a leather-covered cigarette case,
Cossack boots,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marabou_(fashion)">Marabou</a>-trim bed jacket, 
Roto-Shine electric shoe polisher ($26.95),
a table lighter in the design of an antique pistol ($4.95),
a soda siphon ($15.95) &#34;a little more expensive, probably for your father or your husband&#34;,
an electrified magnifying glass &#34;to read the stock market report&#34; ($7.95),
or moccasins trimmed with seal fur ($6.95).
(Gift ideas seem to have changed drastically since the 1960s.)</p>
<p>The interviewer suggested that this computer might take all the fun out of Christmas shopping and called it a &#34;Santa monster&#34;,
but the operator insisted that most people need some help with their shopping.
It must have been an unusual experience for people to encounter a computer in person back then, but
this gift computer was very popular, with 2000 people a day using it.</p>
