    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/6FkfYWT/pandas-logo.png" alt="pd-logo"/>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/F66ks2y/polars-logo.png" alt="pl-logo"/></p>
<p>Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiency, you can check some of Polars benchmark <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I&#39;ve been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization. The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.</p>
<p>There has always been this thought in the back of my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pandas is written in C and Cython, which means the main engine is King C...there got to be a way to optimize Pandas and leverage the C engine!</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpsfireducks-devgithubio-target_blankfireducksa"><a href="https://fireducks-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">FireDucks</a></h3><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/vvdfDFF/fireducks-logo.png" alt="fd-logo"/>
Here comes FireDucks, the answer to my prayer: <mark>a speed demon Pandas library!</mark>. It was launched on October 2023 by a team of programmers from NEC Corporation which have 30+ years of experience developing <strong>supercomputers</strong>, <a href="https://www.nec.com/en/press/202310/global_20231019_01.html?source=post_page-----8694d4eab9c6--------------------------------" target="_blank">read the announcement here</a>.</p>
<p>Quick check the <a href="https://fireducks-dev.github.io/docs/benchmarks/" target="_blank">benchmark page here</a>! I&#39;ll let the numbers speak by themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the craziest bench, FireDucks even beat DuckDB! Also check Pandas &amp; Polars ranks.
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/mh604fJ/fd-bench-1.png" alt="fd-bench-1"/></p>
</li>
<li><p>Average 50x faster than Pandas.
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/C9kYzzK/fd-bench-2.png" alt="fd-bench-2"/></p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#39;s even faster than Polars!
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/w7By9PT/fd-bench-4.png" alt="fd-bench-4"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h3><p>Alrighty those bench numbers from FireDucks looks amazing, but a good rule of thumb is never take numbers for granted...don&#39;t trust, verify! Hence I&#39;m making my own set of benchmarks on my machine.</p>
<h4 id="1-create-150-mb-dummy-data">#1 Create 150 MB dummy data</h4><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/2ngyyJb/pd-fd-create-Data-full.png" alt="create-data"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Result:
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/bz5Fysp/fd-create-dummy.png" alt="create-data-result"/>
Note: fd = fireducks, pd = pandas.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-read-the-150-mb-dummy-data">#2 Read the 150 MB dummy data</h4><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/9HKrcYh/pd-fd-read-Data-full.png" alt="read-data"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Result:
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/p4VzgbX/fd-read-data.png" alt="read-data-result"/>
Note: fd = fireducks, pd = pandas.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-calculate-mean">#3 Calculate Mean</h4><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/Y8JYLTv/pd-fd-mean-full.png" alt="calc-mean"/></p>
<h4 id="4-calculate-sum">#4 Calculate Sum</h4><p><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/zbLKVXq/pd-fd-sum-full.png" alt="calc-sum"/></p>
<p>Yes the last two benchmark numbers are 130x and 200x faster than Pandas...are you not amused with these performance impact?! So yeah, the title of this post is not a clickbait, it&#39;s real. Another key point I need to highlight, the most important one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><mark>Using FireDucks requires ZERO Pandas code change</mark> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I&#39;m lost for words..frankly! What else would Pandas users want?</p>
<ul>
<li>Massive speedup: check.</li>
<li>100% compatibility with existing Pandas code: check.</li>
<li>Zero code change: check.</li>
<li>Effortless / super easy to use: check.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note for those group of people bashing Python for being slow...yes pure Python is super slow I agree. But it has been proven time and again it can be optimized and once it&#39;s been properly optimized (FireDucks, Codon, Cython, etc) it can be speedy as well since Python backend uses C engine!</p>
<p>Be smart folks! Noone sane would use &#34;pure Python&#34; for serious workload...leverage the vast ecosystem!</p>
