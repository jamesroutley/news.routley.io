            A physics-based platformer about rolling a ball to the top of a mountain, on the NES! You&#39;re going to fall, and fall, and fall some more, but it will all be worth it at the top. Just don&#39;t forget to collect 80 souls on the way up!

        <h2>Developer Postmortem</h2>

        <p>I made Little Sisyphus in one month for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/nesdev-compo-2023">2023 NESDev Compo</a>,
        using using NESFab for the programming, MTPaint+Gimp for the graphics, and FamiTracker for the audio.</p>

        <h3>Concept</h3>

        <p>Years ago I made a game called <a href="https://pubby.games/starevil.html">starevil</a>, which is a bizarre adventure with lots of twists and turns.
        Despite the game appearing to be a random mess, the development was fully planned out.
        I knew every scene I wanted to include in advance, having conjured those ideas in a fever-dream apotheosis event
        that only occurs to sleep-deprived programmers.</p>

        <p>I managed to implement all my ideas into starevil, except one: Stairville,
        which was a corrupted spelling of the game&#39;s title. 
        The idea behind Stairville was that your character would fall down a flight of stairs, and you&#39;d have to climb back up,
        but the controls would be very awkward and there&#39;d be awful ice physics that kept slipping you.
        It was a funny idea, but was code-intensive, so I shelved the idea until Little Sisyphus came around.
        Finally I had my chance for a falling-down-stairs game!
        </p>

        <sub>Trivia: starevil still retains a reference to Stairville in one of its buildings.</sub>

        <p>A game from the past</p>

        <p>Another thing that accelerated development was having worked on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1l7hoL4xOQ">platformer ages ago</a>.
        It was an old assembly project of mine, and one I could never finish, but I had all the pieces there: physics, slopes, breakable blocks, and so on.
        Much of Little Sisyphus is a reimplementation of that game, going so far as to base the character sprite on a design from that unfinished game.
        </p>

        <p>Even the plot is somewhat similar. My idea for the old game was you&#39;d play as a thief going around stealing things,
        and each level would have a different gimmick for the item you steal. 
        In the same vein, Little Sisyphus is a heist too, except the plot of Little Sisyphus is very compressed.
        Originally I was going to have cutscenes explaining the game, but I ran out of space, so all you get is a few sentences.</p>

        <h3>Physics</h3>

        <p>In the weeks preceding Little Sisyphus development, I spent my time creating demos for the NESFab programming language.
        These demos were small, self-contained things, like showing how to do scrolling or play sounds,
        but towards the end I made a few flashy physics examples involving bouncing balls and ropes. 
        Would you believe it, but when you already have code for physics, scolling, and so on, 
        it&#39;s really easy to duct-tape them together into a prototype.
        </p>

        <p>The first week of Little Sisyphus was merely these demos with a few features tacked on.
        I took the ball physics example and added a floor at Y=200 to bounce off of, then added another floor at Y=X to form a diagonal slope.
        Once I had the ball rolling around correctly, I rewrote the code to use tiles for collision rather than slope equations.
        </p>

        <p>For the ball, I used impulse-based physics, which means everything is done using forces and velocities. 
        For example, when the ball hits the ground, its vertical speed is multiplied by -0.5, which causes the ball to bounce.
        However, for the rope, I used a different technique called position-based dynamics.
        This style of physics simulation involves updating the positions first, moving the positions using constraints, 
        then deriving the velocities based on the distance traveled. Sounds complicated, but it&#39;s not, so look it up!</p>
