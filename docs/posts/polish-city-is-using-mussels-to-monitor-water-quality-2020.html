<!--more--><p><span>The Dębiec Water Treatment Plant in Poznań, Poland, employs the <a href="https://watersource.awa.asn.au/environment/natural-environment/hungry-turtles-can-clean-up-waterways/">natural intelligence</a> of mussels as sensors for <a href="https://watersource.awa.asn.au/tag/water-quality/">water quality</a> changes in the Warta River, the city’s primary surface water supply. </span></p> 
<p><span>With a low tolerance for pollutants, mussels are well known for clamping their shells shut when water quality is poor. And the treatment plant has devised a hybrid sensory system by combining the <a href="https://watersource.awa.asn.au/technology/innovation/this-waste-eating-shark-drone-is-cleaning-up-waterways/">pollution</a>-detecting prowess of mussels with computer technology. </span></p> 
<p><span>Eight mussels with sensors glued to their shells work with a network of computers. If the water is clean, the mussels stay open; if the water becomes polluted, they close, signalling to the sensors that water quality is low. </span></p> 
<p><span>It’s a handy mechanism for a notoriously polluted waterbody; the Warta River flows through some of the densest population areas in Poland, and some of the country’s oldest industrial zones.</span></p> 
<p><span>Engineers at the Dębiec Water Treatment Plant are alerted to water quality issues by the mussels, whose sensors work in conjunction with a computer system that monitors parameters tracked via artificial sensors. </span></p> 
<p><span>And while the system has been designed to take into account possible changes in the mussels behaviour, if four mussels close simultaneously, the system shuts down automatically. </span></p> 
<p><span>According to </span><em><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/poznan-mussel-water-plants-892524/"><span>ZMEScience</span></a></em><span>, the AquaNES project — supported by the European Union with the aim of integrating nature-based elements into water management systems — has been researching indicator organisms. </span></p> 
<p><span>“Using an organism as an indicator (bioindicator) cannot be accidental. It requires extensive field research that aims to accurately characterise natural occurrence conditions,” writes AquaNES.</span></p> 
<p><span>“The best indicator organisms are those that have specific life requirements, i.e. they have a narrow ecological (occurrence) scale. This means that a number of different factors will limit their vital functions or even eliminate them from the environment.”</span></p> 
<p><span>The hard-working mussels have been celebrated in the documentary film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhu26Q-CMec"><em>Gruba Kaśka</em></a>, directed by Julia Pełka, which explores the use of biological indicators to service human systems. </span></p> 
<p><span>“By making this film I wanted to show man’s dependence on nature. I thought it was brilliant that humans are using mussels to create a warning system against danger,” Pełka said. </span></p> 
<p><span>“They use the clams’ senses to protect themselves from the dangers of modern civilisation. You could say that people use them as protection from themselves.”</span></p></span></p>
