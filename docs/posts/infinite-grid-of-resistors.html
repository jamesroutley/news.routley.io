  <p>Between every pair of adjacent nodes is a resistance R,

  <p>For adjacent nodes, the usual solution of this puzzle is
  to consider the current flow field as the sum of two components, one being
  the flow field of a grid with current injected into a single node, and the
  other being the flow field of a grid with current extracted from a single
  (adjacent) node. The symmetry of the two individual cases then enables us to
  infer the flow rates through the immediately adjacent resistors, and hence we
  can conclude (as explained in more detail below) that the effective
  resistance between two adjacent nodes is R/2. This solution has a certain
  intuitive plausibility, since it’s similar to how the potential field of an
  electric dipole can be expressed as the sum of the fields of a positive and a
  negative charge, each of which is spherically symmetrical about its
  respective charge. Just as the electric potential satisfies the Laplace equation, the voltages of the grid nodes satisfy the discrete from of the Laplace equation, which is to say, the voltage at each node is the average of the voltages
  of the four surrounding nodes. It’s also easy to see that solutions are
  additive, in the sense that the sum of any two solutions for given boundary
  conditions is a solution for the sum of the boundary conditions.</p>

  <p>If we accept the premise of an infinite grid of resistors,
  along with some tacit assumption about the behavior of the voltages and
  currents “at infinity”, and if we accept the idea that we can treat the
  current fields for the positive and negative nodes separately, and that
  applying a voltage to a single node of the infinite grid will result in some
  current flow into the grid, the puzzle is easily solved by simple symmetry
  considerations. We assert (somewhat naively) that if we inject (say) four
  Amperes of current into a given node, with no removal of current at any
  finite point of the grid, the current will flow equally out through the four
  resistors, so one Ampere will flow toward each of the four adjacent nodes.
  This one Ampere must flow out through the three other lines emanating from
  that adjacent node, as indicated in the left hand figure below.</p>

  <p>The figure on the right shows the four nodes surrounding
  the “negative” node, assuming we are extracting four Amperes from that node
  (with no current injected at any finite node of the grid). Again, simple
  symmetry dictates the distribution of currents indicated in the figure.
  Adding the two current fields together, we see that the link between the
  positive and negative nodes carries a total of 2 Amperes away from the
  positive node, and the other three links emanating from the positive node
  carry away a combined total of 1 + 1 + 1 <span>-</span>
  (2Î± <span>+</span> Î²<span>)</span> = 2 Amperes. Thus the direct link carries
  the same current as all the other paths, so the resistance of the direct link
  equals the effective resistance of the entire grid excluding that link. The
  direct link is in parallel with the remainder of the grid, so the combined
  resistance is simply R/2.</p>

  <p>This is an appealing argument, and it certainly gives the
  “right” answer (as can be verified by other methods), but the premises are
  somewhat questionable, and the reasoning involves some subtle issues that
  need to be addressed before it can qualify as a rigorous proof. The
  fundamental problem with the simple argument, as stated above, is that it
  relies on the notion of forcing current into a node of an infinite grid,
  without satisfactorily explaining where this current goes. One “hand-waving”
  explanation is that we may regard the grid as being grounded “at infinity”,
  but this isn’t strictly valid, because the resistance from any given node to
  “infinity” is infinite. This is easily seen from the fact that a given node
  is surrounded by a sequence of concentric squares, and the number of
  resistive links beginning from the central node and expanding outward to
  successive concentric squares are 4, 12, 20, 28, …, etc., which implies that
  the total resistance to infinity is (at least roughly)</p>

  <p>The odd harmonic series diverges, so this resistance is
  infinite. Therefore, in order for current to enter the grid at a node and
  exit at infinity, we would require infinite potential (i.e., voltage) between
  the node and the grid points “at infinity”. To make the argument rigorous, we
  could consider a large but finite grid, and convince ourselves that the
  behavior approaches the expected result in the limit as the grid size
  increases. This is not entirely trivial, because we must be sure the two
  sequences of expanding grids, one concentric about the positive node and one
  concentric about the negative node, approach mutually compatible boundary
  conditions in the limit, giving zero net flow “to infinity”. To evaluate this
  limit, the voltage at the central node (relative to the voltage at infinity)
  must approach infinity to provide a fixed amount of current. This is
  discussed further in another <span><a href="https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath669/kmath669.htm">note</a></span>, where we also discuss the
  arbitrariness of the solution for a truly “infinite” grid. Strictly speaking,
  for a truly infinite grid, the solution is indeterminate unless some
  asymptotic boundary conditions are imposed (which are not specified in the
  usual statements of the problem). </p>

  <p>The unphysical aspect of the problem can also be seen in
  the fact that the flow field is assumed to be fully developed, to infinity, a
  situation that could not have been established by any realistic physical
  process in any finite amount of time. Of course, the postulated grid consists
  purely of ideal resistances, with no capacitances or inductances, so there
  are no dynamics to consider, and hence one could argue that the entire
  current field is established instantaneously to infinity - but this merely
  illustrates that the postulated grid is idealized to the point of violating
  the laws of physics. All real circuits have capacitance and inductance, which
  is why the propagation speed cannot be infinite. One might think that such
  idealizations are harmless for this problem, but they actually render the
  problem totally indeterminate if we apply them rigorously. Our intuitive
  sense that there is a unique answer comes precisely from our unconscious
  imposition of “physically reasonable” asymptotic behavior emanating from a
  localized source, based on the asymptotic behavior of a finite grid as the
  size increases – a conception that arises from our physical notions of
  locality and finite propagation of effects, notions which are not justified
  in the idealized setting.</p>

  <p>Setting aside these issues, and just naively adopting the
  usual tacit assumptions about the asymptotic conditions of the grid, we can
  consider the more general problem of determining the resistance between any
  two nodes. The most common method is based on superimposing solutions of the
  basic difference equation. Again this method tacitly imposes plausible
  boundary conditions to force a unique answer, essentially by requiring that
  the grid behaves like the limit of a large finite grid. Consider first the
  trivial example of a one-dimensional “grid” of unit resistors, in which the
