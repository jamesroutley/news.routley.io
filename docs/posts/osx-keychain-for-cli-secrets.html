    <h1>Osx Keychain For CLI Secrets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>For one of my current projects, I’m trying to create a secure way to store and access secrets such as API keys on my Mac, such that they can be accessed from bash scripts. I’m using the MacOS Keychain to store these secrets, so I decided to write about it because it is generally useful. Ideally, I would use a yubikey or something similar to store and access these secrets, but this alternative is an interesting option, and it balances security and convenience.</p><h2 id="keychain-settings-hardening-for-mac">Keychain Settings Hardening for Mac</h2><p>Before using this process I hardened the default settings for my Keychain. I want to make sure that the Keychain locks after a period of inactivity. To do this, I followed the steps below:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Open Keychain Access:</strong></p><ul><li>Open the Keychain Access application on your Mac. You can find it in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder, or you can use Spotlight to search for it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Adjust Auto-Lock Settings:</strong></p><ul><li>In Keychain Access, select the “login” keychain from the list on the left side.</li><li>Go to the menu bar and choose Edit &gt; Change Settings for Keychain “login”.</li><li>Here, you can set the Keychain to lock after a certain period of inactivity. Check the “Lock after” checkbox and enter the desired number of minutes.</li><li>You can also choose to lock the Keychain when your computer goes to sleep by selecting the “Lock when sleeping” checkbox.</li><li>After adjusting these settings, click Save.</li></ul></li></ol><p>When these settings are in place, and your Keychain locks, accessing it again should prompt for your Mac login password. This is preferable to having the Keychain unlocked all the time.</p><h2 id="touch-id">Touch ID</h2><p>Unfortunately, I haven’t found a way to require Touch ID for every use of the Keychain. I might revisit this later and write an update after contacting Apple Support. This would be an excellent feature to add to the Keychain, biometric authentication for every use. If that is not a planned feature, I will revisit this and write an update that uses a yubikey or something similar.</p><h2 id="storing-and-retrieving-secrets-from-keychain">Storing And Retrieving Secrets From Keychain</h2><p>Apple provides a command-line interface to create and retrieve secrets in macOS Keychain, this is especially handy for bash scripts. It is under the <code>security</code> command as two subcommands <code>add-generic-password</code> and <code>find-generic-password</code>. They are used as follows:</p><h4 id="create-the-new-secret-item">Create The New Secret Item</h4><p>To securely store a new secret item, lets use a contrived example of storing an API key for a service called “MyAPI”. This command will store the secret:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>security add-generic-password -a <span>&#34;MyAPIUser&#34;</span> -s <span>&#34;MyAPIService&#34;</span> -w <span>&#34;</span><span>$(</span><span>#subshell command that outputs secret)&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li><code>security add-generic-password</code>: Adds a password to the Keychain.</li><li><code>-a &#34;MyAPIUser&#34;</code>: Sets the account name (here, “MyAPIUser”).</li><li><code>-s &#34;MyAPIService&#34;</code>: Sets the service name (here, “MyAPIService”).</li><li><code>-w &#34;$(#subshell command that outputs secret)&#34;</code>: Takes the output of the subshell command and uses it as the password.</li></ul><p>I think this method is preferable for its security, as it avoids exposing the API key on-screen or storing it in a temporary variable in the environment of the shell or in a manually created temporary file. But it will get passed via a file descriptor, so be cautious that your default permissions for files are not too permissive.</p><h4 id="retrieve-the-new-secret-item">Retrieve The New Secret Item</h4><p>When retrieving the secret, it’s crucial not to print it to the console or store it in an environment variable for security reasons. Instead, you should pipe the output directly to the command that requires the secret. Here’s an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>security find-generic-password -a <span>&#34;MyAPIUser&#34;</span> -s <span>&#34;MyAPIService&#34;</span> -w | &lt;command_that_needs_the_secret&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>This command retrieves the stored API key for the service “MyAPIService”.</li><li><code>| &lt;command_that_needs_the_secret&gt;</code>: Replace this with the command that needs the API key. The key is passed directly to this command without being printed or stored in a temporary variable.</li></ul><p>This approach ensures the API key remains secure and is not exposed in the terminal history or environment.</p><h3 id="a-practical-example-ssh-key">A Practical Example (SSH Key)</h3><p>This example involves storing and retrieving an ssh private key from the keystore. The key is stored in the Keychain using <code>security add-generic-password</code>, and encoded in base64 to avoid issues with special characters.</p><p>When needed, it’s retrieved, decoded, and passed to <code>ssh-add</code> via a temporary file. The temporary file is created with <code>mktemp</code> and securely overwritten with random data after use. Clearly this is not the most secure method, but I think it is better than persistently storing the key in a file on disk. A much better method would be to use a yubikey or something similar, so that the key is completely stored in hardware.</p><h4 id="to-store-the-ssh-key">To Store The SSH Key</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>security add-generic-password -a <span>&#34;ec2user&#34;</span> -s <span>&#34;MySSHHost&#34;</span> -w <span>&#34;</span><span>$(</span>base64 -i ~/.ssh/the-key.pem<span>)</span><span>&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="to-retrieve-the-ssh-key-and-use-it">To Retrieve The SSH Key And Use It</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Create a secure temporary file in the home directory</span>
</span></span><span><span>tmpfile<span>=</span><span>$(</span>mktemp ~/sshkey.XXXXXX<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>chmod <span>600</span> <span>&#34;</span>$tmpfile<span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Retrieve the SSH key from Keychain and decode it into the temp file</span>
</span></span><span><span>security find-generic-password -a <span>&#34;ec2user&#34;</span> -s <span>&#34;MySSHHost&#34;</span> -w | base64 --decode &gt; <span>&#34;</span>$tmpfile<span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Load the SSH key into ssh-agent</span>
</span></span><span><span>ssh-add <span>&#34;</span>$tmpfile<span>&#34;</span> <span># ssh-agent requires a file with restricted permissions, so we can&#39;t use and fd/pipe</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Securely overwrite the temporary file with random data</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Remove the temporary file</span>
</span></span><span><span>rm <span>&#34;</span>$tmpfile<span>&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="to-delete-the-ssh-key-from-the-keychain">To Delete The SSH Key From The Keychain</h4><p>You may need to update the secret, or remove it. To do so, you can use the <code>security delete-generic-password</code> command. This command requires the account name and service name, which you can find using the <code>security find-generic-password</code> command. Heres an example using out ssh key from above:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>security delete-generic-password -a <span>&#34;ec2user&#34;</span> -s <span>&#34;MySSHHost&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this helps someone. I’m going to try to write and make more this year. Sending warmth and kindness to my reader. As always, I hope you are well.</p></div></div>
