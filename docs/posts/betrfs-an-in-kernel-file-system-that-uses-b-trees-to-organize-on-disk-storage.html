    <h1>BetrFS: an in-kernel file system that uses Bε trees to organize on-disk storage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <div id="objective">
                <p><b>What is BetrFS?</b></p><p>The B<sup>ε</sup>-tree File System, or BetrFS, is an in-kernel file system that
                    uses B<sup>ε</sup> trees to organize on-disk storage. B<sup>ε</sup> trees are a
                    write-optimized dictionary, and offer the same asymptotic behavior for
                    sequential I/O and point queries as a B-tree. The advantage of a B <sup>ε</sup>
                    tree is that it can also ingest small, random writes 1-2 orders of magnitude
                    faster than B-trees and other standard on-disk data structures. </p>
                <p>The goal of BetrFS is to realize performance that <i>strictly dominates</i> the
                    performance of current, general-purpose file systems.</p>
                <p><b>What is a Write-Optimized Dictionary?</b></p><p>Write-Optimized Dictionaries include B<sup>ε</sup> trees, Log-Structured Merge
                    Trees (LSM Trees), and COLAs. Speaking generally, a WOD is a hierarchical
                    structure with logarithmic search complexity (e.g., a tree), but the upper
                    levels of the hierarchy include a log for making small, random writes durable
                    quickly. Unlike a purely log-structured file system, the log is merged into the
                    tree structure in a timely and organized way; these costs are included in the
                    asymptotic analysis, and have good upper bounds. </p>
                <p>BetrFS is an in-kernel file system, based on the opensource <a href="https://github.com/Tokutek/ft-index"> fractal tree</a> implementation
                    from <a href="http://www.tokutek.com/">Tokutek Inc. </a>A fractal tree is a
                    specialized variant of a B <sup>ε</sup> tree.</p>
