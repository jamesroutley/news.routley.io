    <h1>How to Delete Your Data from Data Brokers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-_3af233de-0373-61c3-afce-ad572621b2cd-e1548a1d"><div><div><p>You probably don&#39;t think much about data brokers, but these behind-the-scenes companies collect, trade, and profit from our personal information every day. Data brokers like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax gather data about us from public records, online activities, store loyalty programs, and more. This data gets packaged into profiles and sold to other businesses for targeted advertising, credit checks, background screening, and who knows what else.</p><p>All this happens without our knowledge or consent. Most people have no idea the extent of their digital footprint or how to even access the data collected about them. While we willingly give away some personal information to use online services, plenty is taken without our permission.<br/></p><p>This lack of transparency and control is cause for concern. We have a right to know what personal data exists about us and where it is going. The good news is that there are steps you can take to uncover and delete your data from broker sites:</p><h3>Request Your Data &amp; Send Removal Requests</h3><p>Many data brokers allow you to access your personal information in their systems. Some even offer opt-out tools to stop data collection. Search for &#34;data broker opt-out&#34; to find relevant sites and submit access/deletion requests. <br/></p><p>Be sure to keep records of all your requests, including copies of any emails or letters sent. Maintaining this documentation can be useful if you need to follow up or dispute an unfulfilled request.<br/></p><p>For brokers without online tools, you&#39;ll need to directly request data removal via email or letter. Clearly state your name, address, relevant account numbers, and that you want your data deleted. Keep records of all requests.</p><p>Here is a list of the most prevalent data brokers:</p><ul role="list"><li>Acxiom</li><li>Experian</li><li>Equifax</li><li>TransUnion </li><li>PeopleSmart</li><li>BeenVerified</li><li>WhitePages</li><li>InstantCheckmate</li><li>Pipl</li><li>Intelius</li></ul><h3>Leverage Consumer Protection Laws</h3><p>Depending on your location, laws like the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> and <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> give consumers the right to request that companies delete their data. <br/></p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the European Union&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are two pivotal privacy laws that give consumers greater control over their personal data.<br/></p><p>The CCPA went into effect in 2020 and grants new rights to California residents, like:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>The right to know what personal information companies collect about them and how it is used.</li><li>The right to opt-out of the sale of their data.</li><li>The right to request that their personal information be deleted.</li></ul><p>The GDPR took effect in 2018 and imposes strict guidelines around collecting and handling EU citizens&#39; personal data, such as:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>Requiring affirmative consent before collecting an individual&#39;s data.</li><li>Obligating companies to honor requests for data erasure within one month.</li><li>Establishing protections for data breach notification and cross-border data transfers.</li></ul><p>Leveraging these landmark laws can strengthen your ability to take control of your data from brokers. Understand your rights and don&#39;t hesitate to cite CCPA or GDPR to compel compliance.<br/></p><h3>Use a Deletion Service</h3><p>Sites like <a href="https://joindeleteme.com/">DeleteMe</a>, <a href="https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1017&amp;aff_id=6796">Incogni</a> and <a href="https://abine.com/">Abine</a> will submit opt-out requests on your behalf and monitor to ensure your data stays removed. This simplifies the process, for a fee.<br/></p><p>Regaining control of your personal information takes persistence and vigilance, but is worth it. Data brokers will continue collecting our data until laws and consumer pressure demand change. But we can fight back by actively managing our digital footprints and being conscious about what we are consenting to online.</p><p>‍</p><p>* Links may contain affiliate links. </p></div></div></div></div>
