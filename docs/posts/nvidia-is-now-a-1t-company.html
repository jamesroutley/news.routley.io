However, <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/23608886/nvidia-q4-2023-earnings">by the time of Nvidia’s next report in February</a>, with ChatGPT all over the news, the outlook was more promising as Huang hyped the potential of Nvidia’s data center growth, and the most recent report showed a new record in data center revenue.</p><p>Over the weekend, Nvidia’s <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/2023/5/29/23739290/computex-2023-laptop-pc-announcement-news">Computex 2023</a> keynote was full of AI announcements, including a demo of games using its Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games to support <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters">natural language both for input and responses</a> and <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/2023/5/29/23741011/this-is-what-a-144tb-nvidia-gpu-looks-like">a new DGX GH200 supercomputer</a> built around its latest Grace Hopper Superchip that’s collectively capable of an exaflop of AI performance.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Line graph of NVDA stock price over the last six months" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s stock price shown opening at over $400 per share, bringing the company’s overall valuation beyond $1 trillion for the first time.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nvda">Google</a></cite></p></div></div></div><p>Its valuation pushed past the trillion-dollar benchmark as trading opened today at over $400 per share, putting it in the rarified air previously occupied by only a few large companies such as <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price">Apple</a> and <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value">Microsoft</a> after they surpassed the significant mark in August 2018 and August 2019, respectively.
