<p>Article published by: Leah Rowe</p>
<p>Date of publication: 8 January 2022</p>

<p>This event of such global importance to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a> projects, and the Free Software movement as a whole, has made me decide to write an article. <strong>The events in question, covered by this article, will occur on 11 January 2022. This is just three days away from today, 8 January 2022 when this article was written, so if you make a decision, you should make it now, today, and prepare. Please continue reading.</strong></p>
<p>If you live in New Hampshire or in one of the neighbouring states, especially Massachusetts, please listen up! If you are further away and unable to reach New Hampshire all that easily, please spread the following news anyway. It’s important. As alien as it may seem to many of my readers, I’m actually writing parts of this article as though someone who has never heard of Free Software is reading it, because I expect precisely that such people <em>will</em> read this particular article.</p>
<p>You will see the term <em>Free Software</em> used in this article, but some people call it Open Source Software. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">However, you should call it Free Software.</a> The word “free” refers to freedom, not price, though the software is usually also free as in gratis / zero price.</p>
<p>The opposite of Free Software is called <em>proprietary software</em>, or <em>non-free software</em>. Proponents of Open Source sometimes call non-free software <em>Closed Source</em>, but you should call it <em>non-free</em> or proprietary, to highlight the fact that it isn’t free.</p>

<p>An important bill is being proposed in New Hampshire, which would enshrine much of what we know as Free Software <em>into law</em>. Here is the proposed bill, technically named “HB1273”:</p>
<p>You can read it for yourself, but here is a paraphrasing of what it proposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Specifically</em> bans state-run websites from serving non-free javascript to clients</li>
<li>Creates a commission to provide oversight, watching the use of Free Software by state agencies</li>
<li>Bans state agencies from using proprietary software - maybe this could include schools, in the future!</li>
<li>If a person is tried in a criminal case, they have the right to audit the source code of any proprietary software that collects evidence against them</li>
<li>Encourages data portability (able to transfer data from one program to another)</li>
<li>Bans certain non-compete clauses and NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) pertaining to Free Software projects</li>
<li>Bans state/local law enforcement from assisting with the enforcement of copyright claims against Free Software projects</li>
<li>Bans state agencies from purchasing non-free software if free software exists, for a given task</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this is only a short summary. You are advised to read the bill in detail. It’s not very long.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may not seem that the bill affects individuals, but don’t be fooled; this is a hugely positive step forward for everyone! If the state is using Free Software, that most likely means it’ll be used in education aswell.</p>
<p>Although perhaps not immediately and readily apparent, this is a stake in the heart of proprietary software’s current dominance, because it would remove one key element of its attack against us; its abuse of education services.</p>
<p>If education services are using Free Software, that means they’ll probably have children (the ones being educated) using it too. This is a <em>huge</em> step, and it will result in more Free Software developers in the future. Free Software will become more and more mainstream to the masses, which can surely only be a good thing!</p>
<p>Freedom is always superior. The more people that have it, the better off we all are, because freedom is also collective; it relies on others around us also having it, so that we can defend each other. If more people have it, especially if it results in more Free Software developers in the future, that’s one thing, but imagine if <em>more</em> states like what they see and start to copy the new legislation.</p>
<p>Now imagine that countries besides the US start doing it, inspired by the US’s success (and I think it will be a resounding success).</p>
<p>Imagine a world where <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>, free as in freedom, is the default everywhere. Imagine a world where <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software licensing</a> is required reading material in schools. <em>Imagine a world where any five year old can install a free operating system such as GNU+Linux, and Computer Science is mandatory in schools from a young age. Imagine filing your tax returns with Free Software, exclusively. Imagine not even thinking about that, because it became the norm.</em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a world where proprietary software doesn’t exist, because it is obsolete; entire generations of people are taught to value freedom, and to staunchly defend it, helping each other learn and grow (and produce better software in the process, with less bugs, because people are now free to do that, without relying on some evil company).</em></p>
<p>Imagine a world where you’re no longer being spied on because NSA, Apple and Microsoft no longer have backdoor access to your computer. <em>Imagine having the ability to say no, because that’s what freedom is. Try to imagine it!</em></p>
<p>Free Software is a revolution that we in the Free Software movement have rigorously upheld and fought for, over many years, but we still face an uphill battle because children are not taught in schools about free computing, nor are they encouraged to learn; they are taught to view computers as <em>products</em> to throw away every 1-2 years, that they can run a few <em>apps</em> on but otherwise are not allowed to do anything with. The <em>concept</em> of a <em>general purpose, fully reprogrammable computer</em> is heavily suppressed in mainstream culture. <em>Most</em> people in the world do not run a free operating system; the idea of a computer being a mere <em>appliance</em> is normalized (as opposed to the idea of it being a highly liberating tool for development and the expansion of human knowledge).</p>
<p><em>This</em> is what we in the Free Software movement have fought for over the years. We believe that knowledge is a human right, that the ability to share, study, learn, adapt and modify the software is an inalienable right that everyone must have. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">The four freedoms are absolute.</a></p>
<p>One of our biggest problem has been simply that schools and governments do not teach people about free computing. The right to learn, the right to read and the right to hack. Our governments are made up of human beings just like you or me, and they can be bought/corrupted; Microsoft, Apple and many others (such as IBM) have done this for years, having the national infrastructures governing us run on their proprietary systems, instead of systems that respect freedom; it is essential that these systems run free software, because a free and democratic should expect nothing less. Those companies buy influence <em>and they own your politicians</em>.</p>
<p>All of this could change very soon. Something is happening in New Hampshire, which could redefine our movement and give <em>free software</em> real power instead.</p>

<div><h2 id="testify-in-support-of-the-bill">TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL</h2><p><a aria-hidden="true" href="#testify-in-support-of-the-bill">[link]</a></p></div>
<p><strong>The reading of the bill is happening on 11 January 2022. This is when you should go to New Hampshire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location of hearing: Legislative Office Building in Concord, New Hampshire:</strong></p>
<p>The organizer of the proposed bill, <em>Eric Gallager</em>, has left instructions on Twitter. The following is a <em>nitter</em> link, which lets you view the relevant Twitter thread without running non-free Javascript in your browser:</p>

<p><strong>Please read both threads very carefully!</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU NEED TO GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE IN PERSON!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re able to go to New Hampshire to attend the reading of the bill, please do so! Voice your support of the bill, and say why you think it’s important.</p>
<p>Tell the lawmakers that you demand freedom!</p>
<p>This thread on Twitter is where Eric announced that the reading of the bill is to proceed (original Twitter URL):</p>
<div><h2 id="more-statescountries-will-follow">More states/countries will follow</h2><p><a aria-hidden="true" href="#more-statescountries-will-follow">[link]</a></p></div>
<p>If this bill is passed in New Hampshire, more states will likely follow. It will lead to a massively renewed drive to liberate all computer users, and US laws tend to be copied/pasted around the world too.</p>
<p>This bill, if passed, will have a hugely positive impact on Free Software at a global level.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> support this bill. If you want to see it pass, please go to New Hampshire on 11 January 2022 to make sure your voice is heard.</p>

<p>The <em>proprietary</em> software companies like Microsoft and Apple will also be there, trying to argue the case <em>against</em> the use of Free Software.</p>
<p>There is already precedent; please watch this video, which shows how Microsoft (for example) might behave in the reading of the bill. This video is from a discussion within the European Union, several years ago:</p>
<p>They will try to trick the law makers by claiming things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Free software is insecure / you will get hacked”</strong> - nothing could be further from the truth! Free operating systems such as GNU+Linux, FreeBSD and especially OpenBSD, are among the most secure operating systems available.</li>
<li>“Free software is used by criminal hackers” - here, they use the term <em>hacker</em> to describe someone who illegally gains access to someone elses computer. Don’t fall for it. Maintainers of free operating systems like GNU+Linux distros or the BSDs are actively working to make the internet and computers in general <em>more secure</em></li>
<li><strong>“Software authors deserve to be paid!”</strong> - In fact, many free software devs are <em>paid</em> to work on Free Software! Many companies, including big ones, work on it. There are also hobbyists or otherwise unpaid people, who might work on Free Software for a number of reasons (wanting to make the world a better place, wanting the glory of recognition for solving a major problem, and more often than not, simply because <em>it is fun to do so and you make a lot of friends too!</em>) - No, these companies (e.g. Microsoft) are only arguing in reality for the ability to pay their <em>shareholders</em>, and they control the software exclusively. In fact, free software has repeatedly and consistently over the years <em>defined</em> the computing industry, creating all kinds of new employment opportunities; for example, docker is widely used today and it is free software, used by millions of companies for commercial gain, and the apache web server revolutionized the web back in the day, enabling lots of ISPs to easily host websites - many of the common protocols that we depend upon today, that businesses depend upon (and get paid to maintain or provide services/support for) are in fact free as in freedom!</li>
<li><strong>“Developers should get recognition for their work”</strong> - in free software, you can easily make a name for yourself with relatively few resources except your own computer and an internet connection, plus some cheap hosting. When most developers work on <em>proprietary</em> software such as Windows, they don’t get recognition; their copyright is assigned to their employer (e.g. Microsoft) who will take all the credit!</li>
<li><strong>“Free software is unreliable / costly to maintain”</strong> - actually, it has been well known for years that free software is generally more stable and reliable than proprietary. In cases where it isn’t, it is quickly improved, and in complete freedom. Free software has a lower cost to maintain and service, and you have a free market where you can choose who you hire to write/maintain it for you (if you won’t do that yourself); meanwhile, proprietary software such as Windows is often full of bugs, crashes often and there is only one provider of support most of the time, who will charge a heavy price, while also charging a lot of money for the software itself - free software is <em>free as in freedom</em>, but also usually <em>free as in zero price</em>.</li>
<li><strong>“Free software comes from potentially untrustworthy sources”</strong> - This is pure nonsense, because the very freedoms provided by free software (access to source code, ability to work on it yourself, and see what others did) means that people generally do not add malware to public software sources, because they’d be discovered instantly. <em>Distributions</em> of GNU+Linux and other free operating systems are often maintained by many people, who verify the safety of each software package that they provide; they are also usually provided by each <em>distro</em>, in a central repository unlike with, say, Windows where you really <em>are</em> randomly executing binaries from all kinds of locations (often even without checking the cryptographic checksums of those files, to verify their integrity). It’s very hard to become infected with malware on a free system, precisely because security is handled much better; the design of unix-like operating systems in particular is also naturally more secure, due to better separation of root/user privileges.</li>
<li><strong>“Free software isn’t controlled, and is unknown.”</strong> - this is completely false. These non-free software companies are only talking about <em>their</em> control, and it’s quite telling that they completely disregard yours, in this very sentence. In fact, Free Software <em>is</em> controlled, but it’s not controlled by some external entity; <em>your</em> installation of free software is controlled by <em>you</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <em>Matrix</em> films, proprietary operating systems like Windows/MacOS are basically like the Matrix; bland, no individuality, no independent thought, everything tightly controlled. By contrast, free operating systems (such as GNU+Linux distributions or the BSDs) are like zion/io; vibrant, full of life, buzzing with activity, everything loose and free, and everyone is different (a highly diverse culture of people from all walks of life, acting in common cause but nonetheless individuals).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Windows is known to have backdoors. Microsoft actively informs the NSA about how to exploit them, so that it can break into people’s computers and steal private data.</p>
<p>Proprietary software companies are evil, and must be opposed. They know that if this bill passes, their days are numbered.</p>
<p>Defend freedom! Don’t listen to any of the arguments against it by proprietary software companies; they don’t care about you, and instead only care about profit. They fundamentally do not want you to have any sort of freedom over your own computer, and they actively pursue tactics (such as DRM) to thwart you.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple are not your friends. There is no such thing as the Windows community. When you use proprietary systems, you are isolated from everyone around you, and so are they. <em>You</em> are the product, for the non-free software to exploit at the behest of their developers who only care about <em>money</em>.</p>
<p>However, there <em>is</em> such a thing as the Free Software community. It is a vibrant community, consisting of millions of people collectively all over the world, and they are all free to work with each other infinitely. It gave us most of the technology that we take for granted today, including <em>the modern internet, where ISPs run free software almost exclusively!</em></p>
