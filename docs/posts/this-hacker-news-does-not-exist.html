         <h3>This Hacker News Does Not Exist</h3>
         
         
         <p>This page is intended to be a humorous parody of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News</a>. It is not in any way affiliated with Hacker News. The page&#39;s theme and layout are based on the original site. The usernames are intended to be fictitious, as are the headlines. This site was made with <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/">Faker.js</a> (The original version), <a href="https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/">String.js</a>, and an old jQuery templating plugin written by John Resig in 2010.</p>
         <p>None of the headlines are real and are programatically generated and totally random. The <a href="https://coxomb.github.io/This-Hacker-News-Does-Not-Exist/comments.html">comments page</a> is a shameless rip of a <a href="https://archive.ph/YkBtG">Hackernews Parody Page by Brad Conte</a>. I apologize if any (fictitious) headlines may have offended you. Sometimes it might be off color, but that&#39;s not me, it&#39;s the Faker.js script at its worst.</p>
         <p>This project was inspired by <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">This Person Does Not Exist</a> and <a href="https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/">other similar &#39;Does Not Exist&#39; projects</a></p>
         <p>
            This project is <a href="https://github.com/coxomb/This-Hacker-News-Does-Not-Exist/tree/gh-pages">hosted on Github</a> and the source code is readily viewable. (Thank you Github for allowing me to host my project there).
