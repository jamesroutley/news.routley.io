He said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-24">The outright annexation of such a vast hostile country could be beyond Russia&#39;s military capabilities. But if the aim is just to replace Zelenskiy&#39;s government, it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting any new leadership Russia might try to install.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-25">&#34;I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,&#34; said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. &#34;I would hang every single one of them from bridges.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-26">(Don&#39;t Miss: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/how-ukraines-armed-forces-shape-up-against-russias-2022-02-01/">How Ukraine&#39;s armed forces shape up against Russia&#39;s</a>)</p><p data-testid="paragraph-27">Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes.

It voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union, and aims to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-33">Putin, who denied for months he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies, a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history. While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify as a separate nationality.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-34">&#39;WE&#39;RE AFRAID&#39;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-35">Queues of people waited to withdraw money and buy supplies of food and water in Kyiv.

Russia controls the strait leading into the sea where Ukraine has ports including Mariupol. Ukraine appealed to Turkey to bar Russian ships from the straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-40">In Russia, where state media have for weeks been airing footage of purported Ukrainian attacks that Western countries call crudely staged fakes, the broadcast regulator said all news outlets must cite only official Russian sources on Ukraine.
