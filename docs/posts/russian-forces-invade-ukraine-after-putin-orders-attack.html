Kyiv reported columns of troops pouring across the borders with Russia and Belarus stretching from the north and east, and landing on the coasts from the Black Sea in the southwest and Azov Sea in the southeast.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Fierce fighting was taking place in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast, Kherson and Odessa in the south, and at a military airport near the capital Kyiv, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said troops were trying to fend off Russians attempting to capture the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of the capital. Regional officials said Ukrainian authorities had lost control of some territory in the Kherson region near Russian-occupied Crimea.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">After President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard throughout the morning in Kyiv, a city of 3 million people.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The highway out of the city choked with traffic as residents fled.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war, their worst fears about Putin&#39;s ambitions realised.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">&#34;Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in the WW2 years,&#34; tweeted Zelenskiy.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself &amp; won&#39;t give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Calling on Ukrainians to defend their country, he said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight. He also urged Russians to take to the streets to protest against their government&#39;s actions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">U.S. President Joe Biden called the Russian action an &#34;unprovoked and unjustified attack&#34;. EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would impose a new round of sanctions that would hit Russia&#39;s economy severely.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said: &#34;These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">RUSSIAN BOMBING</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">In his address, Putin said he had ordered &#34;a special military operation&#34; to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to &#34;genocide&#34; in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">&#34;And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,&#34; Putin said. &#34;All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine.&#34; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">A resident of Kharkiv, Ukraine&#39;s second biggest city and close to the Russian border, said windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Blasts could be heard in the southern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists.

Russian-backed separatists claimed to have downed two Ukrainian planes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">&#39;RUSSIA ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE&#39;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-23">Even with a full-blown invasion under way, Putin&#39;s ultimate aim is obscure. He said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-24">The outright annexation of such a vast hostile country could be beyond Russia&#39;s military capabilities. But if the aim is just to replace Zelenskiy&#39;s government, it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting any new leadership Moscow might try to install.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-25">&#34;I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,&#34; said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. &#34;I would hang every single one of them from bridges.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-26">Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes. The West has pledged to impose severe sanctions. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-us-allies-will-respond-unjustified-attack-by-russia-ukraine-2022-02-24/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-27">&#34;Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,&#34; Biden said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-28">Russia is one of the world&#39;s biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a supply crisis as they emerge from the pandemic.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-29">Stocks and bond yields plunged; the dollar and gold soared. Brent oil surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-30">At least three major buyers of Russian oil said they had been denied letters of credit from Western banks, needed for shipments to go ahead. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-major-buyers-russian-oil-struggle-with-bank-guarantees-sources-2022-02-24/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-31">&#39;WE&#39;RE AFRAID&#39;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-32">A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe&#39;s biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and aims to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-33">Putin, who denied for months he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies, a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-34">While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify as a separate nationality.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-35">In Kyiv, queues of people waited to withdraw money and buy supplies of food and water. Cars stretched for dozens of kilometres (miles) on the highway leading from the capital west towards Poland, where Western countries have prepared for the likelihood of hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-36">&#34;We&#39;re afraid of bombardments,&#34; said Oxana, trying to flee and stuck in her car with her three-year-old daughter on the backseat. &#34;This is so scary.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-37">Three hours after Putin gave his order, Russia&#39;s defence ministry said it had taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded its air defences.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-38">Ukrainian media reported that military command centres in Kyiv and Kharkiv had been struck by missiles, while Russian troops had landed at Odessa and Mariupol.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-39">Russia announced it was shutting all shipping in the Azov Sea. Russia controls the strait leading into the sea where Ukraine has ports including Mariupol. Ukraine appealed to Turkey to bar Russian ships from the straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Reuters bureaus,
