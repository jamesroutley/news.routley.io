Available in two sizes and four gorgeous finishes that users love, the 11-inch iPad Air is super portable while on the go, and the 13-inch model provides an even larger display for more room to be creative and productive. Designed for iPad Air, the new Magic Keyboard enhances its versatility and delivers more capabilities at a lower price.

                 <div>iPad Air with M3 empowers users to be productive and creative wherever they are, from aspiring creatives using demanding apps and working with large files, to travelers editing content on the go. The powerful M3 chip offers a number of improvements over M1 and previous-generation models. Featuring a more powerful 8-core CPU, M3 is up to 35 percent faster for multithreaded CPU workflows than iPad Air with M1. M3 features a 9-core GPU with up to 40 percent faster graphics performance over M1. M3 also brings Apple’s advanced graphics architecture to iPad Air for the first time with support for dynamic caching, along with hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing. For graphics-intensive rendering workflows, iPad Air with M3 offers up to 4x faster performance than iPad Air with M1, enabling more accurate lighting, reflections, shadows, and extremely realistic gaming experiences.<sup>3</sup>

                 <div>iPad Air is built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence.<sup>4</sup> In Photos, the Clean Up tool makes it easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for. With Image Wand in the Notes app, users can make notes more visually engaging by turning rough sketches into delightful images, just by drawing a circle around the sketch with their Apple Pencil. Users can even circle empty space within a note, and Image Wand will gather context from the surrounding area to create a relevant image that complements the note and makes it more visual.

Users can now type to Siri, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next, and with extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording.

                 <div>With ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT.

                 <div>Designed to protect users’ privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPad into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.

<li>Designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, <strong>Calculator</strong> delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions. With Math Notes, users are now able to write out mathematical expressions or type to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new iPad Air and updated iPad are designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including the new iPad Air and iPad. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. The new iPad Air and iPad each feature at least 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The batteries contain 100 percent recycled cobalt and — in a first for iPad — over 95 percent recycled lithium. The new iPad Air and iPad meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and are free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.<sup>8</sup>
