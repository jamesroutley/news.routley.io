    <h1>Doubling Down on Open Source</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><main><div><p><span>June 4, 2025</span></p><p>Today we are open sourcing all remaining Product Features in Langfuse under the MIT license</p></div>
<p>The LLM landscape is changing rapidly and so are the workflows used to build and improve LLM apps. Today, <strong>we are open sourcing all Product Features in Langfuse</strong> to enable our community to iterate on their applications faster and provide our project with feedback on where to go next.</p>
<p>Newly open sourced features include managed <a href="https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals">LLM-as-a-judge evaluations</a>, <a href="https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/annotation">annotation queues</a>, <a href="https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/prompt-experiments">prompt experiments</a> and <a href="https://langfuse.com/docs/playground">the playground</a>, all of which are now freely available to self-host under the MIT license.</p>

<p><em>If you are self-hosting Langfuse already today, <strong>upgrade your deployment to the <a href="https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/upgrade">latest version</a></strong>. You will find a more powerful version of Langfuse.</em></p>
<h2 id="why-are-we-doing-this">Why are we doing this?<a href="#why-are-we-doing-this" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Langfuse is building the <strong>open source LLM Engineering Platform</strong>. We are building <em>the</em> platform to observe and improve LLM applications.</p>
<p>We are constantly shipping to be the technology of choice for our community. This requires trust, feedback and buy-in from our community.</p>
<p>We re-visited the gated features in our Enterprise Edition. If we want to be the first choice in the market, we need to allow our community to <strong>cover the entire dev cycle in our FOSS version</strong>. Features like LLM-as-a-Judge, Evals, or our Playground are market standard at this point and should be freely available. <strong>But why stop there?</strong></p>
<p>The best platform for developers has to be open at its core. By <strong>removing commercial barriers from our product features</strong>, weâ€™re fostering deeper trust, collaborating on contributions, accelerating adoption, gathering richer community feedback, and iterating faster than ever.</p>
<h2 id="our-open-source-journey">Our Open Source Journey<a href="#our-open-source-journey" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Langfuse was <a href="https://langfuse.com/blog/product-analytics-for-LLM-apps">launched</a> as an open source project.</strong> This was based on a few <a href="https://langfuse.com/why">core beliefs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data captured by Langfuse should be freely accessible</li>
<li>The AI landscape changes every week â€“ Langfuse must integrate agnostically with all models and application stacks</li>
<li>Great teams deserve the flexibility to extend the platform to support custom workflows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This positioning resonates and today we are doubling down on it.</strong></p>
<p>Langfuse has been an open core company from the start. <strong>Our core just expanded significantly</strong> and our periphery shrunk. Commercially licensed code is now limited to features for Enterprise Security and Platform Teams (e.g. SCIM, Audit Logs, Data Retention Policies â€“ regular <a href="https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/authentication-and-sso">SSO</a> is and continues to be MIT licensed).</p>
<h3 id="langfuses-open-core-model">Langfuseâ€™s Open Core Model<a href="#langfuses-open-core-model" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>

<p>As we open source previously commercial features, we are fully investing our commercial focus in Langfuse Cloud and Enterprise platform teams in self-hosting.</p>
<h2 id="thousands-of-langfuse-deployments">Thousands of Langfuse Deployments<a href="#thousands-of-langfuse-deployments" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Besides &gt;7,000,000 monthly SDK installs and &gt;5,500,000 Docker pulls, there are &gt;8,000 monthly active self-hosted instances of Langfuse out in the wild. This boggles our minds.</p>
<p>We expect that todayâ€™s changes solidify Langfuse as the first choice for a powerful and truly open source platform in LLMOps.</p>
<p>Today is the day to start self-hosting Langfuse. Head over to <a href="https://langfuse.com/self-hosting">our self hosting docs</a> and use the new <a href="https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-05-22-terraform-modules">terraform modules</a> for deploying Langfuse at production-scale.</p>
