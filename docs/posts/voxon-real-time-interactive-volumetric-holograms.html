    How do I control the Voxon VX2 display?
  </p> 
  <p>
    The Voxon VX2 can be controlled using software installed on a connected computer. The software interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing you to load and manage content, adjust settings, and interact with the 3D display using standard input devices such as a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen. Additionally, the VX2 can be integrated with other input devices, such as game controllers, motion sensors, or custom hardware, to enable more advanced and interactive control options. Each VX2 comes with a 3D space navigator controller, an intuitive 6DOF controller.

  <p>
    What makes the Voxon VX2 different from other 3D displays?
  </p> 
  <p>
    The Voxon VX2 stands out from other 3D displays because it produces true volumetric images, meaning the images occupy a physical volume and can be seen from all sides, much like a real object. Unlike stereoscopic 3D displays that rely on tricking the brain with two slightly different images for each eye, the VX2 doesn’t require any special eyewear and doesn’t suffer from issues like eye strain or limited viewing angles. This makes it a revolutionary tool for displaying 3D content in a way that is natural and intuitive. Persistence of vision is the phenomenon where the human eye retains an image for a short time after it disappears, allowing us to perceive a sequence of rapidly changing images as continuous. Voxon utilizes this concept with a rotating LED matrix to create 3D volumetric displays. The LED matrix rapidly rotates, displaying different 2D image slices of a 3D object at specific angles. Because of the speed at which the LED matrix spins and the persistence of vision effect, the human eye blends these slices together. This creates the illusion of a fully formed 3D object floating in space, which can be viewed from multiple angles without the need for special glasses or headsets.
