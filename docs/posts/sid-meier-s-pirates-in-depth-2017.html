Microsoft Word started out on the Xenix and MS-DOS operating systems. It would be touted as a &#34;what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG)&#34; word processor, although it was not. From what I can gather, Microsoft was willing to make this claim simply because the ASCII environment they used allowed for bold and italic text changes to be seen on screen. This was not a true indication of what would be seen when printed, nor did it offer variable fonts and sizes. A tiny little white lie told to disparage the most popular text based word proc...

     8 Color Icons   Amiga Workbench 1.3 Guide  (Can be used in WB 2+)  *UPDATE* *Unfortunately due to a false flag on this article as being spam, I&#39;ve limited the amount of links, downloads can be found at the end*  &#34;Old Blue&#34;. My affectionate pet name for the original color choices from Amiga Workbench up to the official version 1.3 (as well as early builds of the unreleased 1.4). Having grown up with an Amiga 500 using Kickstart/Workbench 1.2, I&#39;ve always felt quite at home with its simple but effective four color Workbench look. Blue was the first color, labeled as such from the computer&#39;s perspective, but more importantly adhering to your mind as the color you&#39;ll see the most, the background color. Rounding out the four color classic look was white, black, and orange. Some claim disdain for the look, though it was carefully chosen as a setup that could look good on both a computer monitor as well as a television.   I always adored it, it&#39;s like coming...

       The Game Of Life   Board Game from Milton Bradley   Shown here; 1960, 1977, 2004 Simpsons      My video review of the board Game of Life   My video review of the Windows 98 Game of Life   My written review of the Windows 98 Game of Life  *Next article  *Previous article  *Alphabetical list of writings     I&#39;ve always had fond memories of playing the Game of Life. As a kid I would occasionally be watched by my grandparents, and playing Life was often a staple of such visits. I can taste the Dominoes Pizza (pre-recipe change) just thinking about it. My Grandmother had the original version from 1960. My parents had a later version of Life from 1977, and I also have fond memories of playing that. I can feel the comfy bed that she would set the board on, there couldn&#39;t be a better way to play. There are a lot of instructions to read when playing Life, and it was nice to just lay back while my mom did the reading.    ^Instructions   I always knew that the version my parents ha...
