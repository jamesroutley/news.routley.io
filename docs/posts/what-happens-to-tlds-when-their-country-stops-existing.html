    <h1>What happens to TLDs when their country stops existing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When I was deciding on what TLD to get for my QR tattoo, one of my first
thoughts was to just use a subdomain of <code>aay.tw</code>. Makes sense; it’s short, and I
don’t have to pay any extra money.</p>
<p>However, someone brought up a good point — can I trust that <code>.tw</code> will be
around for the next few decades? After all, <code>.tw</code> is Taiwan’s domain, and if you
know anything about contemporary geopolitics, there’s a lot of variables
involved here. So, I ended up being safe and just picking out a new <code>.org</code>
because those will only go away when ICANN goes away.</p>
<p>Still, this is an interesting thing to think about. Suppose China ends up
invading and successfully annexing Taiwan; what would happen to the
<a href="https://domainnamestat.com/statistics/tld/tw-TLD_ID-1285">2.7 million registered domains under <code>.tw</code></a>?
Or, suppose Russia, for some reason, ends up annexing Ukraine (I really think
this is nearly impossible, but hey, it’s just a thought experiment). What will
happen to the
<a href="https://domaintyper.com/domain-names/top-level-domains/ccTLD/ua-domain">nearly 700 thousand domains under <code>.ua</code></a>?</p>
<p>In general, if a country stops existing, what happens to its TLD?</p>
<h2 id="historical-precedent">Historical precedent</h2>
<p>Note that this section is mostly sourced from Wikipedia articles so take what
you will of that.</p>
<h3 id="the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union">The collapse of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Back in 1989, the Eastern Bloc countries were assigned <code>.su</code> (Soviet Union),
<code>.pl</code> (Poland), <code>.cs</code> (Czechoslovakia), <code>.yu</code> (Yugoslavia) and <code>.dd</code> (East
Germany). domain. 15 months later, in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, and it
seems that ICANN had to deal with the fallout of that.<sup id="fnref-su"><a href="#fn-su">su</a></sup></p>
<p>This situation is not the same as the one with Taiwan or Ukraine; the Soviet
Union did not collapse because it was invaded, but because of internal political
failures that are out of scope for this article. It is still an example of a
state ceasing to exist, so there might be some historical precedent there.</p>
<h4 id="pl"><code>.pl</code></h4>
<p>Although the Polish People’s Republic ended, its successor, the Republic of
Poland, continued existing afterwards. In other words, there was a different
state, but it was still the same country. Thus, it inherited <code>.pl</code>.</p>
<h4 id="su"><code>.su</code></h4>
<p>The Union of Soviet Sovialist Republics collapsed, and its constituent republics
broken off of it (i.e. Ukraine, the Baltic States) got their own domains. ICANN
introduced <code>.ru</code> in 1994 to phase out <code>.su</code>, but the Russian government nad
internet users wanted to keep it, so ICANN let it happen.</p>
<p>It seems that ICANN wants to terminate it, IANA states that it’s being phased
out, but Russia still wants to keep it, and there’s still 100,000 domains
registered with it, so it seems to be in a gray area. Apparently, because of
this grayness and lax and outdated terms of use, it’s host to lots of cool sites
such as white supremacist site Daily Stormer (to escape deplatforming on
literally everywhere else), cybercrime activities, the pro-Putin youth movement
Nashi up until 2019, the Dontesk People’s Republic, and more.</p>
<h4 id="dd"><code>.dd</code></h4>
<p><code>.dd</code> was only ever used internally by some East German universities, so it was
just terminated. East and West Germany reunited only a year after <code>.dd</code> was
introduced, and West Germany already had <code>.de</code>, so they just used that.</p>
<h4 id="yu"><code>.yu</code></h4>
<p>When the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia dissolved, some of its
constituent states broke off and got their own TLDs, like Slovenia and Croatia.
However, Serbia and Montenegro came together to form the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, and they kept the <code>.yu</code> domain. But then, they named themselves
Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and they finally dissolved in 2006 and each got
their own TLDs. <code>.yu</code> ended up being put on a transition period before being
terminated in 2010. All of the <code>.yu</code> sites were simply wiped out.</p>
<h4 id="cs"><code>.cs</code></h4>
<p>Czechoslovakia was split in 1993, and <code>.cs</code> was deleted in 1995. There were
2,300 hosts on <code>.cs</code> before its termination.</p>
<h3 id="other-change-of-governments">Other change of governments</h3>
<p>In Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq, they changed their government, but control over
their respective TLDs (<code>.af</code>, <code>.ly</code>, <code>.iq</code>) were always given to the new
government.</p>
<p>On an interesting side note, although Iraq’s TLD was introduced in 1997, it was
in limbo for a few years because the delegated manager was imprisoned in Texas
for a while, until ICANN redelegated it in 2005.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>


















































<table><thead><tr><th>TLD</th><th>Country’s fate</th><th>TLD’s fate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>.pl</code></td><td>Transfer of power</td><td>Alive</td></tr><tr><td><code>.su</code></td><td>Broken up/Transfer of power for Russia</td><td>Alive, but kinda in limbo</td></tr><tr><td><code>.dd</code></td><td>Unified with/into West Germany</td><td>Dead</td></tr><tr><td><code>.cs</code></td><td>Broken up</td><td>Dead</td></tr><tr><td><code>.yu</code></td><td>Broken up</td><td>Dead</td></tr><tr><td><code>.af</code></td><td>Transfer of power</td><td>Alive</td></tr><tr><td><code>.ly</code></td><td>Transfer of power</td><td>Alive</td></tr><tr><td><code>.iq</code></td><td>Transfer of power</td><td>Alive</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This list is full of countries breaking up or changing governments, but no
annexations. I guess you could sorta view East Germany as being annexed into
West Germany, but at the same time, almost no one used <code>.dd</code> so there was also
that going for it. There isn’t too much historical precedent to look at.</p>
<h2 id="the-icann-agreements">The ICANN agreements</h2>
<p>ICANN does have
<a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/cctlds/cctlds-en">a publicly-available list of its ccTLD agreements that it has made with all countries with ccTLDs</a>.
This includes
<a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/sponsorship-agmt-2003-03-26-en">Taiwan’s</a>
and
<a href="https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ua-icann-af-10feb15-en.pdf">Ukraine’s</a>.</p>
<p>Based on my (admittedly cursory) scan of the Taiwan one, there’s a lot of
mention about “the territory of the Governmental Authority,” which implies that
if the Governmental Authority no longer has territory, things might become
somewhat hairy.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At this point, I’m too lazy to look deeper into the ICANN agreements. Too much
legalese. I guess if there’s a takeaway from this research, it’s that a ccTLD
could stop existing after the country stops existing.</p>
