<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Good day at the RC hub! </li>



<li>Joined the Game Jam Kickoff where we selected a theme: “Lost Signal.” I’m planning to make a <a href="https://bitsy.org/">Bitsy</a> game.</li>



<li>Learned about counting in binary, bitwise operators, and job search strategies w/ Jasmine.</li>



<li>I worked on a CS50P problem that was inspired by the song <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/8/seasons/">“Seasons of Love”</a>, which I <em>loved</em>, and I would be so happy if more computer programming problems were related to Broadway musicals. The task was to create a program using Python’s <code>datetime</code> module that prompts the user for their birthdate “and then <s>sings</s> prints how old they are in minutes, rounded to the nearest integer, using English words instead of numerals, just like the song from <em>Rent</em>, without any <code>and</code> between words.” I used my own birthdate to test and in an amazing coincidence discovered that I celebrate twenty million minutes this very day!</li>



<li>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/jamiepalatnik/8b9a17511243ef193ea62582e0c584f7">my program</a> to calculate how old you are in minutes.</li>
