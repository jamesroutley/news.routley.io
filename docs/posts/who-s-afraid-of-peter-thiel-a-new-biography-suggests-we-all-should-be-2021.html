    <h1>Who&#39;s Afraid of Peter Thiel? A New Biography Suggests We All Should Be (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body-main"><p><span>P</span>aypal cofounder Peter Thiel is famous for <a href="https://time.com/4348840/peter-thiel-gawker-lawsuit-hulk-hogan/">destroying media outlets</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=During%20the%20life%20of%20his,on%20the%20early%20Roth%20withdrawals." target="_blank" rel="noopener">not paying taxes</a>, and being a <a href="https://time.com/4416093/peter-thiel-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative tech billionaire</a>. A new biography, <em>The Contrarian</em>, suggests that he is after more than riches. TIME chatted with its author, journalist Max Chafkin.</p><p><strong>Why should we care about Peter Thiel, apart from the fact that he is another rich tech billionaire and they’re all weirdly fascinating?</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6099105/us-china-digital-currency-central-bank/">The U.S. Is Losing the Global Race to Decide the Future of Money—and It Could Doom the Almighty Dollar</a></em></p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as dangerous?</strong></p><p><strong>What do you find scary about his economic and political philosophy?</strong></p><p><strong>He would explain it as belief in efficiency and results, right? He would not say, ‘I don’t think everybody has the right to vote.’</strong></p><p><strong>A lot of people were very surprised that this nerdy, gay, Californian son of immigrants techpreneur decided to support Donald Trump’s presidency. Was it just the pure <em>I’m going to shut down government</em> aspect of Trump’s policies that he liked?</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em>H<a href="https://time.com/4418475/republican-convention-peter-thiel-lgbt-gay-rights/">ow Donald Trump Courted Gay Voters at the Convention</a></em></p><p><strong>Did Thiel get blowback about the January 6th attack on Congress?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you have a guess at his net worth?</strong></p><p><strong>When that story [that he used Roth IRAs to massively lower his taxes] broke, there was an outrage that somebody who had made so much money in America was not contributing to the national purse. Do you think he cared?</strong></p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as an outlier among his tech brethren, or as an exemplar?</strong></p><p><strong>In the beginning of the book, you paint a portrait of Thiel as a bullied child. Other kids put For Sale signs in his yard and then asked when he was leaving and so on. Was that the cradle of his reactionariness?</strong></p><p><strong>Most of your sources are anonymous. Why do you think people who spoke to you spoke to you?</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/5100101/peter-thiel-buying-gawker/">Peter Thiel Made an Offer to Buy Gawker, the Website He Helped Close</a></em></p><p><strong>Are you personally worried?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiel has been right a lot. I wonder if there’s a bit of you thinking, ‘If he’s been right about these things, what should I be looking for now?’</strong></p><p><strong>You note that he has funded two senators—Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley—and is now funding two more candidates. Do you worry he’ll wield outsized power over government?</strong></p><p><em>This conversation has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p></div></div>
