    <h1>World-first experimental cancer treatment paves way for clinical trial</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>An Australian-led international clinical trial will scientifically investigate the efficacy of the approach within a large cohort of eligible glioblastoma patients and could commence within a year.</p>
<p>The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be handing the baton to <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/">Dr Jim Whittle</a>, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.</p>
<p>“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”</p>
<p>Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.</p>
<p>“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”</p>
<p>The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.</p>
<p>Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.</p>
