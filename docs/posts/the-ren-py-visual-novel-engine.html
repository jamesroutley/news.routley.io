    <p>Ren&#39;Py is a visual novel engine – used by thousands of creators from around the world –
      that helps you use words, images, and sounds to tell interactive stories that run on computers and mobile devices.
      These can be both visual novels and life simulation games. The easy to learn script language allows
      anyone to efficiently write large visual novels, while its Python scripting is enough for complex
      simulation games.</p>
    <p>Ren&#39;Py is open source and free for commercial use.</p>
