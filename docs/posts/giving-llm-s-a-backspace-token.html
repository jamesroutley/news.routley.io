            <span>Abstract:</span>  In many domains, autoregressive models can attain high likelihood on the task
of predicting the next observation. However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE)
objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively
generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences
proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance
for the model&#39;s behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding
error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding
error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL)
problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the
distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences
from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences.
The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a
backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the
compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it
takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented
without adversarial training or major architectural changes. We identify the
SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for
autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically,
SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with
language models.
