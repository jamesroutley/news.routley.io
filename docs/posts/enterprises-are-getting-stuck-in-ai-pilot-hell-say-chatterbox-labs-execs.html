    <h1>Enterprises are getting stuck in AI pilot hell, say Chatterbox Labs execs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Interview</span> Before AI becomes commonplace in enterprises, corporate leaders have to commit to an ongoing security testing regime tuned to the nuances of AI models.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the view of Chatterbox Labs CEO Danny Coleman and CTO Stuart Battersby, who spoke to <em>The Register</em> at length about why companies have been slow to move from AI pilot tests to production deployment.</p>
<p>&#34;Enterprise adoption is only like 10 percent today,&#34; said Coleman. &#34;McKinsey is saying it&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-and-google-cloud-partner-to-help-industry-leaders-tap-into-4-trillion-of-business-value-with-generative-ai">a four trillion dollar market</a>. How are you actually ever going to move that along if you keep releasing things that people don&#39;t know are safe to use or they don&#39;t even know not just the enterprise impact, but the societal impact?&#34;</p>

    

<p>He added, &#34;People in the enterprise, they&#39;re not quite ready for that technology without it being governed and secure.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>In January, consulting firm McKinsey published a report examining the unrealized potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work">report</a>, &#34;Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI’s full potential,&#34; found growing interest and investment in AI technology, but slow adoption.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>...what you have to do is not trust the rhetoric of either the model vendor or the guardrail vendor, because everyone will tell you it&#39;s super safe and secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;Leaders want to increase AI investments and accelerate development, but they wrestle with how to make AI safe in the workplace,&#34; the report says.</p>
<p>Coleman argues that traditional cybersecurity and AI security are colliding, but most infosec teams haven&#39;t caught up, lacking the background to grasp AI&#39;s unique attack surfaces. He pointed to Cisco&#39;s acquisition of Robust Intelligence and Palo Alto Networks&#39; acquisition of Protect AI as examples of some players that have taken the right approach.</p>

        

<p>Battersby said the key for organizations that want to deploy AI at scale is to embrace a regime of continuous testing based on what the AI service actually does.</p>
<p>&#34;So the first thing is to think about what is safe and secure for your use case,&#34; he explained. &#34;And then what you have to do is not trust the rhetoric of either the model vendor or the guardrail vendor, because everyone will tell you it&#39;s super safe and secure.&#34;</p>
<p>That&#39;s critical, Battersby argues, because even authorized users of an AI system can make it do damaging things.</p>

        

<p>&#34;What we&#39;re trying to get across to you is that content safety filters, guardrails are not good enough,&#34; said Coleman. &#34;And it&#39;s not going to change anytime soon. It needs to be so much more layered.&#34;</p>
<p>While that may entail some cost, Battersby contends that constant testing can help bring costs down - for example, by showing that smaller, more affordable models are just as safe for particular use cases.</p>
