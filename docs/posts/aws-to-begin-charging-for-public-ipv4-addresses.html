    <h1>AWS to begin charging for public IPv4 addresses</h1>

       <p>We are introducing a new charge for public IPv4 addresses. Effective February 1, 2024 there will be a charge of $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether attached to a service or not (there is already a charge for public IPv4 addresses you allocate in your account but don’t attach to an EC2 instance).</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Public IPv4 Charge</strong></span></p> 
       <p>This change applies to all AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> database instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> nodes, and other AWS services that can have a public IPv4 address allocated and attached, in all AWS regions (commercial, <a href="https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/">AWS China</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/">GovCloud</a>). Here’s a summary in tabular form:</p> 
       <table> 
        <tbody> 
         <tr> 
          <td><strong>Public IP Address Type</strong></td> 
          <td><strong>Current Price/Hour (USD)</strong></td> 
          <td><strong>New Price/Hour (USD)</strong></td> 
         </tr> 
         <tr> 
          <td>In-use Public IPv4 address (including Amazon provided public IPv4 and Elastic IP) assigned to resources in your VPC, Amazon Global Accelerator, and AWS Site-to-site VPN tunnel</td> 
          <td>No charge</td> 
          <td>$0.005</td> 
         </tr> 
         <tr> 
          <td>Additional (secondary) <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Address</a> on a running EC2 instance</td> 
          <td>$0.005</td> 
          <td>$0.005</td> 
         </tr> 
         <tr> 
          <td>Idle Elastic IP Address in account</td> 
          <td>$0.005</td> 
          <td>$0.005</td> 
         </tr> 
        </tbody> 
       </table> 
       <p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Tier</a> for EC2 will include 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage per month for the first 12 months, effective February 1, 2024. You will not be charged for IP addresses that you own and bring to AWS using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html">Amazon BYOIP</a>.</p> 
       <p>Starting today, your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html">AWS Cost and Usage Reports</a> automatically include public IPv4 address usage. When this price change goes in to effect next year you will also be able to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">AWS Cost Explorer</a> to see and better understand your usage.</p> 
       <p>As I noted earlier in this post, I would like to encourage you to consider accelerating your adoption of IPv6. A new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/identify-and-optimize-public-ipv4-address-usage-on-aws/">blog post</a> shows you how to use Elastic Load Balancers and NAT Gateways for ingress and egress traffic, while avoiding the use of a public IPv4 address for each instance that you launch. Here are some resources to show you how you can use IPv6 with widely used services such as EC2, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>:</p>

       <p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/secure-connectivity-from-public-to-private-introducing-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint-june-13-2023/">enhanced EC2 Instance Connect</a> and gave it the ability to connect to your instances using private IPv4 addresses. As a result, you no longer need to use public IPv4 addresses for administrative purposes (generally using SSH or RDP).</p>

       <p>You can also see, sort, filter, and learn more about each of the public IPv4 addresses that you are using:</p>
