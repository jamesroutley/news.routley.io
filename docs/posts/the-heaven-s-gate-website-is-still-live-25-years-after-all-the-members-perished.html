    <h1>The Heaven’s Gate website is still live 25 years after all the members perished</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642219096870_3916"><div><h3>What The Cult Left Behind</h3><p>The UFO death cult Heaven’s Gate became one of the most sensational stories of its era after the bodies of 39 people with matching haircuts were discovered in a mansion on the outskirts of San Diego on March 26th, 1997. It was obvious to investigators at the scene that what they found was a ritualistic mass suicide they’d be answering questions about for a long time. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642263997177_4162"><div><p>As information trickled in on cable news, a loop of footage showing police finding the bodies played over the voices of talking heads attempting to make sense of the tragedy. Reporters scrambled to get more data on a group that had been obscure before the bodies were found. It was as rare of a moment as they come; Heaven’s Gate was “the fringe of the fringe” as one outlet put it, but the cult offered a few things to make the lives of reporters a little easier. They’d prepared for this moment in the spotlight. </p><h3></h3><p> The news glommed on to <a href="http://www.heavensgate.com">www.heavensgate.com</a>, an advanced-for-its-era website designed to get out the cult’s message and lure in potential followers. The URL turned heads, and it wasn’t just that no one had seen a cult advertising itself online before; it was also the design. The site wasn’t a hastily thrown together static form like many small organizations had back then, nor was it a blog (those didn’t exist yet)- this was a website with native coding and scrolling graphics that was clearly put together by someone who knew what they were doing. The site even had commerce. Sure, the aesthetic has a distinctly Windows 95 vibe and by today’s standards it looks completely ridiculous, but in ’97 this was a savvy website for the kind of industry the organization was in. That the design would have looked legitimate to internet users in the ‘90’s made it all the more dangerous, or so it was claimed.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642264368432_5121"><div><p>There are images from the news that stick out in the minds of people over 35 who watched the story unfold in real time. The unfortunate product placement for Nike, purple face coverings, those uniform haircuts. There was plenty to ogle at for the morbidly curious. The Heaven’s Gate logo and the front page of their website also were repeatedly splashed across screens, and these were perhaps the images that contained the most meaning for those following along at home.  </p><h3></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642264368432_9608"><div><p>It’s been 35 years since Heaven’s Gate captured the world’s attention, and people are still talking about it. In recent years there have been new documentaries and buzzy web features about the cult that have brought the story to a new generation. There’s also a remnant of Heaven’s Gate that’s been stuck in ember for the curious to examine since even before the cult made headlines. </p><h3>The Internet Is Fabric in the History of Heaven’s Gate  <br/> </h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642264368432_14143"><p>To understand the internet’s role in Heaven’s Gate, you’ve got to turn back the clock and start with the economics of running such an esoteric cult in the first place. </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642277702378_8623"><div><p>Exploiting members for their coding skills turned out to be more profitable than exploiting them for preexisting financial assets. It didn’t take long for the cult to be flush with internet cash, and this currency became the group’s primary source of income. With more resources at their disposal, the cult could afford new housing big enough to cram 40 or so members into one space. If leadership hadn’t been psychotic, who knows what the nerds could’ve accomplished?</p><p>Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate Heaven&#39;s Gate ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo ufo space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien space alien extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrial misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation misinformation freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom freedom second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming second coming angels angels angels angels angels angels angels angels angels angels end end times times end times end times end times end times end times end times end times end times end times, Key Words: (for search engines) 144,000, Abductees, Agnostic, Alien, Allah, Alternative, Angels, Antichrist, Apocalypse, Armageddon, Ascension, Atheist, Awakening, Away Team, Beyond Human, Blasphemy, Boddhisattva, Book of Revelation, Buddha, Channeling, Children of God, Christ, Christ&#39;s Teachings, Consciousness, Contactees, Corruption, Creation, Death, Discarnate, Discarnates, Disciple, Disciples, Disinformation, Dying, Ecumenical, End of the Age, End of the World, Eternal Life, Eunuch, Evolution, Evolutionary, Extraterrestrial, Freedom, Fulfilling Prophecy, Genderless, Glorified Body, God, God&#39;s Children, God&#39;s Chosen, God&#39;s Heaven, God&#39;s Laws, God&#39;s Son, Guru, Harvest Time, He&#39;s Back, Heaven, Heaven&#39;s Gate, Heavenly Kingdom, Higher Consciousness, His Church, Human Metamorphosis, Human Spirit, Implant, Incarnation, Interfaith, Jesus, Jesus&#39; Return, Jesus&#39; Teaching, Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Heaven, Krishna Consciousness, Lamb of God, Last Days, Level Above Human, Life After Death, Luciferian, Luciferians, Meditation, Members of the Next Level, Messiah, Metamorphosis, Metaphysical, Millennium, Misinformation, Mothership, Mystic, Next Level, Non Perishable, Non Temporal, Older Member, Our Lords Return, Out of Body Experience, Overcomers, Overcoming, Past Lives, Prophecy, Prophecy Fulfillment, Rapture, Reactive Mind, Recycling the Planet, Reincarnation, Religion, Resurrection, Revelations, Saved, Second Coming, Soul, Space Alien, Spacecraft, Spirit, Spirit Filled, Spirit Guide, Spiritual, Spiritual Awakening, Star People, Super Natural, Telepathy, The Remnant, The Two, Theosophy, Ti and Do, Truth, Two Witnesses, UFO, Virginity, Walk-ins, Yahweh, Yeshua, Yoda, Yoga<br/></p><p>Heavensgate.com didn’t end up having the conversion rate it intended after its launch, the cult lost more members then they gained after the site went live, but that mind boggling list illustrates the concepts leadership wanted to ensnare would-be members with. Some of the items here seem like longshots to attract devotees, for instance, the terms Harvest Time and Non Perishable are barking up the wrong tree. The mention of other cults sticks out too- what are the Children of God doing here? Perhaps the most curious of entries is listed at the very bottom when Star Wars sage Yoda is given a shout out. </p><h3></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642277702378_26436"><div><p>For over two decades the reason heavensgate.com kept getting renewed was a total mystery. In 2011, a Reddit forum started asking questions and began sifting through data associated with the website, but it wasn’t until 2017 that an investigation by The Daily Mirror turned up enough clues to crack the case.   </p><p>The gatekeepers of the domain turned out to be Arizona couple Mark and Sarah King, who left the cult after Bonnie Nettles’ death in the 1980’s. The King’s agreed to participate in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror after maintaining a domain in the shadows for as long as the entire lifecycle of Heaven’s Gate. The couple, now in their late 60’s, kept a relationship with Applewhite up until the end. </p><p>In the article revealing their identity, the couple are quoted as saying “We are very private... People who are close to us know what we do and accept our right to our beliefs, but the regular people we come into contact with during a normal day would not know of our circumstances and probably wouldn’t care.”</p><p>Wouldn’t care? That statement seems to underestimate people’s appetite for curiosities like heavensgate.com. A website going 25 years without a single update is bizarre enough with the economics involved. The fact the website in question belonged to a cult that took the lives of 39 people is beyond bizarre, and many are going to want answers. That the King’s came forward and turned out to be involved in a gambit similar to the one Marshal Applewhite ran is a somewhat satisfying resolution, if an unsettling one. The question now is how long the domain will remain active going forward.  </p></div></div></div>
