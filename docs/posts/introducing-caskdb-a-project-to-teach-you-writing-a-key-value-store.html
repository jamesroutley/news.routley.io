    <h1>Introducing CaskDB – a project to teach you writing a key-value store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>For the past few months, I have been learning about the internals of database systems. After doing a batch at <a href="https://avi.im/blag/tags/recurse-center/">Recurse Center (Nov 2021)</a> researching databases, I have been working on writing my toy database. I found many excellent articles on building compilers, but I could not find many practical resources for databases. So I wrote one. <a href="https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb">CaskDB</a> is the project I wish I had started with.</p><p>CaskDB is based on Riak’s Bitcask paper. The idea of Bitcask is brilliant yet straightforward, which makes it attractive for newbies to learn about key-value store internals and implement one.</p><p>I have set up this project in TDD fashion with the tests. So, you start with simple functions, pass the tests, and the difficulty level goes up. There are <a href="https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb/blob/d80cacb/hints.md">hints</a> if you get stuck. When all the tests pass, in the end, you would have written a persistent key-value store.</p><p>I had great fun implementing this, and I hope you do too. And I hope this makes you dig deep into the fantastic world of database engineering.</p><p>link - <a href="https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb">https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb</a></p></article></div>
