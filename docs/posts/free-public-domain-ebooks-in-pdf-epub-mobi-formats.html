<h2>Instant Download. No Registration. No App Required.</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Global Grey is a one-woman operation that has been running for over eight years. I format every single ebook myself, as well as maintaining the website. This is a passion project that was born from a love for reading and a commitment to make free ebooks that look good and feel enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>I use sources such as Project Gutenberg, Archive.org, and sometimes my own book collections. These texts serve as a foundation, and then public domain artwork is added to create a cover. Next comes editing and formatting for digital devices - either PDF, epub, or Kindle format. And voila, the process is complete.</p>
<p>Look around and start exploring. I hope you have fun finding your next favourite read!</p>

<p>Currently, Global Grey has over 2,000 free ebooks ranging from classic literature to occult books, psychology, folklore, and everything in-between. But there are so many books out there, I’m sure there are a few I haven&#39;t discovered yet!</p>
<p>So, don’t see something you like? Looking for a very specific book? I take requests! Just tell me what book you are after, and I will do my best to find it and add the text to the digital collection. </p>

<h3>New Free eBooks Added Every Week</h3>
<p>Global Grey is an ongoing project. That means I am constantly updating the online library. While some of the books take a long time to format, that doesn’t stop me. My site is maintained on a weekly basis, and you can typically see new books added each week as well.</p>
