But after some of the industry&#39;s biggest scandals of the past decade hinged on incriminating messages <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/11/trading-scandals-the-final-nail-in-chatrooms-coffins.html">preserved in chatrooms</a>, workers often leaned on side channels to conduct business.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>A widespread practice</h2><div><p>Encrypted messages sent on third-party platforms like Signal make it impossible for banks to record and retain logs of interactions. At Wells Fargo and other banks, the practice was pervasive and happening at all levels; even the managers responsible for enforcing the rules were guilty of the practice, regulators said Tuesday.</p><p>An analysis of 13 Wells Fargo employees, for instance, found that all had violated the bank&#39;s communications policies by using text messages to communicate with co-workers and market participants. They used the side channels to communicate with more than 100 other employees, including senior supervisors, over thousands of messages, according to the CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23" target="_blank">complaint</a>.</p><p>&#34;Employees&#39; use of unapproved communication methods was not hidden within the firm,&#34; the CFTC said. &#34;To the contrary, certain supervisors—the very people responsible for supervising employees to prevent this misconduct—routinely communicated using unapproved methods on their personal devices.&#34;</p><p><em>— CNBC&#39;s Jim Forkin contributed to this report</em></p></div></div></div>
