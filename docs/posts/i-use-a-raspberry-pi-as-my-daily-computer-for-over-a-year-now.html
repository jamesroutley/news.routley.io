    <h1>I use a Raspberry Pi as my daily computer for over a year now</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text_5"><p>For over a year now, I use a Raspberry Pi 4 (with 8GB of RAM) as my daily desktop computer. I browse the internet, read and send e-mails, program software, edit photos, create images, watch Youtube videos and play games on it. Without any significant problems.</p>
<p><strong>Why should you do this? RPis are single board computers, and although you can run a desktop OS on it, they seem better suited for other purposes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>And then? What did you do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>So Ubuntu Mate it is. Did you install the latest version, Jammy Jellyfish (version 22.04)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now I&#39;m also considering an RPi with Ubuntu Mate. What do you use it for? Can I play games on it as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>But doesn&#39;t your RPi get hot? And don&#39;t you need a fan to keep temperature at bay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p></div></div>
