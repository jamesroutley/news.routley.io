    <h1>&#39;We Currently Have No Container Ships,&#39; Seattle Port Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another shipping port official voiced concern about the drastic decline in imports as a result of President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump" data-sys="1">Donald Trump</a>&#39;s tariffs.</p><p>&#34;I can see it right over my shoulder here, I&#39;m looking out at the Port of Seattle right now, and we currently have no container ships at berth,&#34; Seattle port commissioner Ryan Calkins told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn" data-sys="1">CNN</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>&#34;That happens every once in a while at normal times, but it&#39;s pretty rare,&#34; he added. &#34;And so to see it tonight is I think a stark reminder that the impacts of the tariffs have real implications.&#34;</p><p><em>Newsweek</em> has reached out to the Port of Seattle via email outside of business hours for further comment.</p><h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2><p>Several port authorities have observed a similar drop in cargo volumes over the past few weeks, warning that such a decline could have significant and adverse effects on consumers—who may face rising prices and limited product availability—as well as the supply chain-linked sectors of the U.S. economy.</p><h2><strong>What To Know</strong></h2><p>Calkins told CNN that the current situation would impact the job security of longshoremen and those dealing directly with the freight, as well as industries responsible for transporting imports nationwide.</p><p>&#34;And that&#39;s hundreds of jobs right here in our region and across the country,&#34; he said, adding that his port had not witnessed such a significant downturn in activity since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><figure><div>

That&#39;s why the cargo volume is so light.&#34;</p><p><strong>Seroka</strong> said last week: &#34;American importers, especially in the retail sector, are telling me that they have about <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/boss-biggest-us-port-predicts-when-tariffs-could-bite-consumers-2067641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five to seven weeks of normal inventory</a> on hand today.&#34;</p><p><strong>Ryan Young, senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, </strong><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/americans-face-empty-shelves-within-weeks-2067118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously told <em>Newsweek</em></a>: &#34;Tariff-related shipping slowdowns will cause a regional cascade effect in the U.S., a little like when COVID-19 first hit. It will first be visible in West Coast ports, which have the fastest shipping times from Asia. After that it will spread to Gulf ports like Houston, which take a little longer to reach, then East Coast ports from the Carolinas up to New England.&#34;</p>	<figure data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"><div><div id="v_embed"></div></div>
