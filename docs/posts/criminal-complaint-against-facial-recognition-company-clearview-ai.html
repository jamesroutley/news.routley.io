It claims to have collected more than </span><a href="https://www.clearview.ai/" title="https://www.clearview.ai/"><span lang="EN-US">60 billion photos</span></a><span lang="EN-US">. This allows customers of Clearview AI to identify people by uploading a photo and obtaining other pictures of the same person, including links, the name of a subpage of a website and other meta data.

It allows for mass surveillance and immediate identification of millions of people. Clearview AI amassed a global database of photos and biometric data, which makes it possible to identify people within seconds. Such power is extremely concerning and undermines the idea of a free society, where surveillance is the exception instead of the rule.”</span></em><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Clearly illegal and intrusive. </strong>EU data protection authorities have already repeatedly held that Clearview AI, which processed the data of millions of Europeans, clearly violated the GDPR.
