    <h1>Copilot in Emacs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>I haven&#39;t done anything fancy with integrating AI tools into Emacs, but after
playing with Copilot a bit in VSCode, I decided that I wanted to at least get
the most basic autocomplete feature working.</p>
<p>All I did was install <a href="https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="nofollow">copilot.el</a> in Emacs, and now I can use it to autocomplete.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s record a demo while I write this blog post!</p>
<p><img src="https://slinkp.com/images/emacs_copilot_demo_3.gif" alt="Emacs Copilot Demo"/>
</p>

<p>It supports the basic features I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>ghost text</li>
<li>accepting suggestions with <code>TAB</code></li>
<li>cycling through suggestions (I bound to <code>s-up</code> and <code>s-down</code>)</li>
<li>Accepting by word (I bound to <code>C-right</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly I haven&#39;t used it often enough to get those in my muscle memory
(except TAB), but I have definitely gotten mileage out of it.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually I&#39;ll rig up more sophisticated LLM integrations into
Emacs. Meanwhile I am <a href="https://slinkp.com/programming-with-ai-tools-2025/" rel="nofollow">exploring other tools</a> more often.</p>
<p>What I&#39;d really like for completion in Emacs is a way to use other models such
as Claude or other LLMs instead of Copilot, but I haven&#39;t found a good way to
do that yet.
There are a few that support local models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jart/emacs-copilot" rel="nofollow">emacs-copilot</a> ... 2 years old and
  I&#39;m unclear what models I could run that would work well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjrusso/wingman" rel="nofollow">wingman</a> seems to be actively
  maintained. Requires a LLama model.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.el" rel="nofollow">codeium.el</a> which
appears to use Windsurf as its backend.</p>
