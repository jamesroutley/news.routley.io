            </small></p><p>Many programmers subscribe to the belief that they need large blocks of uninterrupted time to get anything done. Paul Graham wrote about this in <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Makerâ€™s Schedule, Managerâ€™s Schedule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that theyâ€™re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.</p>
<p>[Programmers] generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You canâ€™t write or program well in units of an hour. Thatâ€™s barely enough time to get started.</p>
<p>When youâ€™re operating on the makerâ€™s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love having a whole afternoon to work on something without interruption. Itâ€™s probably ideal for most people. But itâ€™s an exaggeration to say that itâ€™s <em>impossible</em> to program well in units of an hour.</p>
<h2>Parentâ€™s schedule</h2>
<p>Last summer, my wife and I had our third child. Before we had kids, Iâ€™d sometimes spend a full day â€” or even a weekend â€” working on a fun programming project. But now, with three kids and a full-time job, Iâ€™m lucky to find a half dozen free hours spread out across the week.</p>
<p>My primary side project is <a href="https://ohmjs.org">Ohm</a>, a parsing toolkit for JavaScript. Iâ€™ve been working on it since 2015, and been the sole maintainer since 2017. Since our third child was born, Iâ€™ve managed to ship:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new <a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/ohm-v16/">major version</a></li>
<li>three minor versions with various bug fixes and new features</li>
<li>a <a href="https://ohmjs.org">brand new web site</a> for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>â€¦and about 75% of the time I invested in this was in increments of one hour or less, when my kids were sleeping.</p>
<p>Trying to get work done this way was certainly a big adjustment, but I managed to develop some habits and find some tricks that made it work for me. Obviously I canâ€™t say that what works for me would work for everyone. But like almost everything in life, Iâ€™m pretty sure most people can improve significantly through practice.</p>
<h2>Some useful tactics</h2>
<p>Here are some things that I found to be helpful (caveat lector, YMMV, and all that) â€”</p>
<p><strong>Make progress every day.</strong> A few things (like minor bugs) might take less than an hour. But most things worth doing take longer, which means that I canâ€™t finish them in a single sitting. On those things, I try to make a little progress every day â€” even if itâ€™s only 20 or 30 minutes. It keeps the cache warm: if I work on something early in the morning, Iâ€™ll keep thinking about it over the course of the day. Then, if I have another half hour at the end of the day, the problem is still pretty fresh in my head.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not strict about <em>when</em> I do the work. Sometimes Iâ€™ll work in the early morning (~6am, right after making coffee), and sometimes in the evening (9â€“10pm). The most important thing is to make a little progress every day.</p>
<p><strong>Always know what the next thing to do is.</strong> For me, this means having either a clear end goal (e.g., fix this bug, make this test green) or a concrete next step (e.g., change all callers of <em>wiggle</em> to call <em>waggle</em>). If I plan this ahead of time, then when I sit down at my computer, I can immediately get to work.</p>
<p>I was never a huge fan of test-driven development, but I do find it helpful in this context. Once I have a failing test, I find it much easier to resume the work again later. And writing the test helps me figure out the next manageable unit of progress.</p>
<p>If I need to stop working right in the middle of something, sometimes I leave a note directly in the source code, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  TODO make sure examinedLength is properly calculated here!
  const origPos = inputStream.pos;
  if (!inputStream.matchString(this.obj)) {
    ...
  }</code></pre>


<p>This will cause a syntax error the next time I run the tests, which reminds me of what I need to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Pay attention to feedback loops.</strong> When working in such small increments, I find fast feedback to be even more important than usual. Depending on what Iâ€™m working on, this might mean unit tests, <a href="https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin">fast refresh</a> for React stuff, or using <a href="https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec">watchexec</a> to automatically re-run a script.</p>
<p><strong>For bigger things, make a plan and keep a log.</strong> When Iâ€™m starting a more complex task, like a performance investigation or a big refactoring, I take 10-15 minutes to write down a plan before I start the work. Nothing fancy, just a few bullet points in a text file. And when I get interrupted, I take 30 seconds to summarize my progress and any next steps I should take.</p>
<p>I find that planning my work this way also makes me more effective. When I had big blocks of uninterrupted time, I would usually just dive into a refactoring without thinking it through too deeply. But when I sit down to plan things out in detail, I often realize that Iâ€™m missing a critical detail and need to adjust my plan.</p>
<p><strong>Block distractions.</strong> If Iâ€™m not careful, I can fall into a habit of checking Twitter, HN, etc. as soon as I sit down at my computer. This can easily waste 20 or 30 minutes at the start of a working session. If Iâ€™ve only got an hour, itâ€™s half gone.</p>
<p>When I blocked those sites on my computer, I found it much easier to get into a focused state quickly. It also prevents me from quickly checking command-tabbing to the browser whenever Iâ€™m stuck too long on something tricky (which Iâ€™m also guilty of).</p>


<p>Most of these things I learned the hard way, as I struggled to try to get things done in the limited free time that I had. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything groundbreaking here, just a few small things that have made a difference for me. Maybe theyâ€™re useful to you, too.</p>
<p>Beyond the tactics, I suspect that practice is also important here. JB Rainsberger suggests that <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/1504836590941655046">using the Pomodoro technique will train you to achieve focus quickly</a>. Iâ€™ve used it off and on over the past couple years; itâ€™s possible that helped as well.</p>
