    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A warm <span>“</span>Grüezi<span>” </span>from Switzerland. My name is Renato. I am the founder and creator of Bionic Reading. It gives me great pleasure to introduce myself shortly, because we are developing a product for you. For people of all colors. And that<span>’</span>s why it<span>’</span>s only right and important for us to let you know who<span>’</span>s behind the product. Namely also a human being.</p><p>How I came to Bionic Reading is a somewhat strange story. During my studies, I was asked to design a book for a Swiss bestselling author. A small competition at our school. However, this book author did not write his texts in written German, but in a form of the Swiss language, which I did not understand with reading. So I noticed that I have great difficulties to read the text.</p><p>That was the beginning of taking a closer look at Bionic Reading. I now wanted to find out for whom this form of reading is also very helpful and created smaller test products. And look, I and my classmates were not the only ones who wanted to use this individually customizable form of reading.</p><p>And now we are launching our first product and hope you like it. We know that this is just the beginning. We have the path in front of us. But the end is still a long way off.</p><p>Good luck and have fun with Bionic Reading. Take care and stay healthy.</p></div></div>
