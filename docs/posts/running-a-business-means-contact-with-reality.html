    <h1>Running a Business Means Contact with Reality</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A year ago I decided to help build a service business for my mom because I wanted to learn about marketing and business. One of the largest blindspots engineers have is around sales and marketing. I was determined to not fall into this trap, but marketing seemed like a skill I couldn’t just learn by reading — a form of tacit knowledge. I needed some kind of sandbox to test out the marketing skills I was learning about and my mom had been bothering me to help her set up an organizing business for at least a few years now. I had previously set up an MVP website and a profile on Thumbtack (similar to Angie’s List), which provided her with a bit of side income. We decided to give it a real shot!</p>



<p>These are the lessons I’ve learned from working on this business. There have been a lot of reality checks — where my assumptions on how the world works have been rudely disproven.</p>



<p><strong>How People Buy Things</strong></p>



<p>Prior to beginning this business I hadn’t actually understood how to make money. I had begun a couple of side hustles but I always felt I was missing a key element. I was, and it’s called marketing. I know it’s difficult to believe but I just assumed the following steps</p>



<ol>
<li>I put a product into the world</li>



<li>???</li>



<li>customers would find it and purchase it from me.</li>
</ol>



<p>I didn’t realize that it required conscious, applied effort to get people to buy your service.</p>



<p>Getting people to buy things is generally a solved science. I kept thinking “no it can’t be that simple, we’re a special snowflake business”. Every single time the blindingly obvious thing that everyone was telling me to do turned out to be the correct move. I refused to believe that jamming a huge call to action button on a webpage would change conversions, I thought discerning clients wouldn’t appreciate it. Yet it was just that easy — adding giant buttons everywhere worked wonders. I had some weird preconceived notions that people would be put off by the salesy-ness, yet having a professional redo the website copy made a huge positive impact. I was wondering why people were calling us from other states — until I added the phrase “in New York City” in a few spots. </p>



<p>There was a lot of unlearning on my side, trying to understand that people don’t buy the way that I do. If I could give a quick insight into my perspective on selling — most people are busy and are easily swayed to do what they were intending to anyways. The way that this balances out in the world is because of the adversarial nature of markets. Customers are individually impressionable, but the wisdom of crowds provides a counterbalance.</p>



<p><strong>The Art of Organizing</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been on about six ride-alongs with my mom to help out with larger projects. 50% of professional organizing tends to be throwing stuff away. 40% is therapy, and 10% is putting stuff into nice neat boxes like you see on the internet. I was surprised by the amount of emotional effort required by this, but it really makes sense. Most people you talk to don’t have a great relationship with their stuff. While the acute problem is the surfeit of stuff, the emotional issues are what lead to overbuying. I’m pleased to say that for the scope of our work, we make a big impact, but without a long term engagement it’s tough to make a change.</p>



<p>A major issue was that my mom was rather bored with the more prosaic aspects of running a business — we ran into the E-Myth almost immediately. I think my mom really just wanted to do the work of organizing rather than actually running a business (I wanted to do the opposite). As such, we had an acute lack of before &amp; after photos, which really are the lifeblood of a professional organizing business. My mom wasn’t fastidious about taking them, and when she did… she wasn’t exactly a perfect photographer. Similarly, tracking which clients she had was also difficult, since I didn’t get feedback on which clients decided to book over the phone. We were working together, but in these cases I couldn’t do as much as I would’ve liked to help.</p>



<p>The business has been a giant blackpill on Temu. Seeing people pay my mom to throw away bags full of internet purchases has been depressing. Bringing yet cheaper goods into the States hasn’t actually increased quality of life whatsoever over the already cheap goods on Amazon. At a certain level of cheapness, you reach diminishing returns. Unfortunately — despite the very real benefits that mass affluence and consumer culture have, it’s difficult in my position to not think that we’ve gone too far. I’d like to write about this separately though, stay tuned.</p>



<p><strong>You Can Just Do Things</strong></p>



<p>Overall, this was an exercise for me in executing on extremely basic things, repeatedly. I was surprised to learn that business isn’t really complicated. It’s difficult to do, but not difficult to understand. Most things were, for better or worse, common sense.</p>



<p>I learned rather quickly, to my credit, that I overthink. I think there’s a place for strategy &amp; thought, but if your business doesn’t exist, it’s better to have elements built out, even if they’re bad, rather than having one perfect part of the business with nothing else complete. It’s comforting that everything can be an iterative process – you’re playing a long game. I built a crappy website, then built a better one, and now I’m remaking it yet again. This is strictly superior to trying to build the perfect website on the first try. You get exposure to the real world, get feedback, and get paid while doing it.</p>



<p>Starting this business I thought there’d be a lot of technical knowledge and learning about “business”. Instead, it was often rather straightforward what my next step needed to be at each point. It wasn’t super mysterious, I just kept optimizing each bottleneck as they came in. It was an entire attitudinal adjustment — I needed to keep grinding and working on lots of very small elements that make up a business. Working on only the things you like is impossible. The flip side is there as well -— since the buck stops with you, you have ultimate agency over everything.</p>



<p><strong>The Hard Parts</strong></p>



<p>When things aren’t working and you’re not sure why, it sucks. One such example was my Google Ads guy who I had hired. I kept him around for almost a full year, until I finally had the good sense to get another person to audit his work. Turns out the ads were set up poorly, which cost me a lot of clients over the course of the year. Unfortunately, I had to let him go and hire someone else. I’m happy to say that my ads are working well, but it was tough to make the call to switch freelancers, and it was even more difficult to stomach the sunk cost. The lesson was made easier to digest by the new ad guy being better, yet actually cheaper than the previous hire.</p>



<p>Most lessons are learned the hard way, though people try to warn you. It’s hard to hire great people. After hiring a ton of freelancers, I can say that the only person I hired who was really outstanding was my virtual assistant.</p>



<p>Another example of what my mom and I had to learn the hard way — providing the service your business exists to provide is not really your job as a business owner. That’s the second priority. The first priority is to get new business in the door. You can do the best job in the world, but if you have no new clients coming, you don’t have a business. It feels a bit like being a shark, if you ever stop finding new clients, you sink.</p>



<p><strong>What Now?</strong></p>



<p>Most of the issues we’re working on are related to the quality and number of leads. We have a good foundation to work off of, but now we need to dial in the website to speak to our ideal customer and build up a better reservoir of reviews.</p>



<p>The biggest problem facing us is social media. I haven’t been able to help my mom build a solid habit of filming her work — which means that we can’t take advantage of TikTok &amp; Instagram Reels. These are absolutely key in scaling the business and getting more leads.</p>
