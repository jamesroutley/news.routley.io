    <h1>Ask HN: Did anyone else lose their marbles?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Typical story I imagine-- ambitious, smart, promising career, was a technical co-founder at a small startup, and things seemed fine. Then I found myself wandering in the woods all day, crying for no reason and looking for non-existent fossils, which I found. I eventually saw petrified sea creatures everywhere and stopped going to work, or answering my phone, paying bills, etc. Things ended predictably, in horrible slow motion. Now I have a two year hole in my life, and I’ll never forgive myself for what I put my family through.</p><p>But nobody else will ever know that.
I’m functional and back in the industry, but it’s not the sort of thing people discuss at the water cooler.</p><p>So I’d like to ask if anyone else had a secret breakdown? I’m curious if my story is an outlier, or if this is one of those things that “just happens” to some people.</p></div></div></div>
