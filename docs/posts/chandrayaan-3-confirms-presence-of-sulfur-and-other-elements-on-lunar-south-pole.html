							<p>India recently achieved a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/23/1195411957/india-joins-an-elite-club-as-first-to-land-a-spacecraft-near-the-moons-south-pol">space exploration milestone</a> by becoming the first nation to land a rover on the Moon’s mysterious south pole. The ambitious <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html">Chandrayaan-3</a> mission’s rover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragyan_(rover)">Pragyan</a> has begun using its onboard instruments to study this unexplored frontier up close. Early results reveal the rover’s groundbreaking capabilities to analyze lunar soil composition, with potential implications for discovering frozen water.</p>
<p>Pragyan’s instruments are unlocking clues about the elemental makeup of the lunar surface near the south pole. A specialized <a href="https://appliedspectra.com/technology/libs.html">Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy</a> (LIBS) tool became the first equipment to ever perform in-situ measurements of this region’s composition. By shooting intense laser pulses at the soil, LIBS can induce plasma emissions that identify elemental signatures.</p>
<p>ISRO announced the rover’s LIBS results definitively confirm the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/LIBSResults.html">presence of sulfur</a> at the landing site. Additionally, preliminary scans detect traces of aluminum, iron, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen in the soil. Further hydrogen detection efforts are underway.</p>
<p>These atomic ingredients offer initial glimpses into the south pole’s geological story. LIBS provides a versatile technique to chemically analyze alien soils faster than traditional sample returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/science/news/chandrayaan3-what-happens-to-vikram-lander-and-pragyan-rover-after-14-days-heres-what-you-should-know-11692854593821.html">Pragyan’s two-week surface mission</a> will continue employing LIBS and other tools to scan for water ice deposits thought to exist in the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole. Finding accessible water sources could benefit future lunar habitation and deep space exploration.</p>
<p>India overcame <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2019/11/16/how-did-chandrayaan-2-fail-isro-answer.html">past setbacks</a> to achieve this south pole milestone. The country boldly envisions Chandrayaan-3 inaugurating an ambitious lunar exploration program. With the rover already making history through its technical innovations, India’s lunar dreams appear brighter than ever.</p>
