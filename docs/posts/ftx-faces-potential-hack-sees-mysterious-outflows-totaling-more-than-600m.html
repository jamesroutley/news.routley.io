FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don&#39;t go on FTX site as it might download Trojans,” wrote an account administrator in the FTX Support Telegram chat. The message was pinned by FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller.</p></div><div><p>According to on-chain data, various Ethereum tokens, as well as Solana and Binance Smart Chain tokens have exited FTX’s official wallets and moved to decentralized exchanges like 1inch. Both FTX and FTX US appear to be affected.</p></div><div><p>Miller tweeted earlier in the evening that he was “investigating abnormalities with wallet movements related to consolidation of ftx balances across exchanges.”</p></div><div><p>The transfers, which have not been addressed officially by FTX leadership, come on the same day that the firm officially <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/11/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-protections-in-us/" target="_blank">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> after apparently losing billions of dollars in user funds.</p></div><div><p>Many FTX wallet holders are also reporting that they are seeing $0 balances in their <a href="http://ftx.com/" target="_blank">FTX.com</a> and FTX US wallets. FTX’s API appears to be down, which could account for this.</p></div><div><p>On Twitter, members of the cryptocurrency community immediately speculated that the funds have been drained as part of some kind of an attack – pointing, as evidence, to the fact that some of the transactions appear to include notes containing lewd jokes and i<a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1591273268677578753">nsults directed towards FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried</a>.</p></div><div><p>Others <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1591267155034902534">speculated</a> that the outflows could be coordinated by a member of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/10/bankman-frieds-cabal-of-roommates-in-the-bahamas-ran-his-crypto-empire-and-dated-other-employees-have-lots-of-questions/">Bankman-Fried’s inner circle</a>, pointing out that the simultaneous and sophisticated hacks of FTX and FTX US are indicative of a potential inside job. Twitter sleuth ZachXBT tweeted Friday night that “multiple former FTX employees confirmed to me that they do not recognize these transfers.”</p></div><div><p>As the wallet address became publicly known many of the transactions appeared to be trolls, with names like “cumsock.eth” and “downsyndromemonkey.eth.&#34;</p></div><div><p>By midnight eastern time, FTX’s login portal was unavailable (the site is still online) giving users a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503">503 error</a> when they attempted to log in. A 503 error happens when the server is unavailable, commonly because it&#39;s down for maintenance or unavailable for access.</p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 12, 2022, 06:00 UTC):</b></i><i> Adds updates and details throughout.</i></p></div></div><div data-module-name="article-body/newsletter-cta" data-module-version="1"><hr/><p><span>Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.</span></p><p><span>By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk product updates, events and marketing and you agree to our <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/terms/">terms of services</a> and<!-- --> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</span></p></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/cheyenne-ligon/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/eddf8aa7-da53-47f8-bdf2-90cc26b9c13d.png" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Cheyenne Ligon is a CoinDesk news reporter with a focus on crypto regulation and policy.
