    <h1>New York Is Now Using Cameras with Microphones to Ticket Loud Cars</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>If you live in New York and drive a loud car, you could receive a notice from the city&#39;s Department of Environmental Protection telling you your car is too loud. Not because a police officer caught your noisy car, but because a computer did.</p><p>

<p>A photo of an official order from the New York City DEP was published to Facebook by a page called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/loweredcongress/posts/5024358850988531" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/loweredcongress/posts/5024358850988531">Lowered Congress</a> on Monday, directed at a BMW M3 that may have been a bit too loud. The notice reads as follows:</p><blockquote>I am writing to you because your vehicle has been identified as having a muffler that is not in compliance with Section 386 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which prohibits excessive noise from motor vehicles. Your vehicle was recorded by a camera that takes a pictures of the vehicle and the license plate. In addition, a sound meter records the decibel level as the vehicle approaches and passes the camera. </blockquote><p>The order goes on to tell the owner to bring their car to a location specified by the DEP—a sewage treatment plant, to be precise—for inspection. Show up, and you&#39;ll have the opportunity to get the car fixed to avoid a fine—much like California&#39;s &#34;fix-it&#34; ticket system. The document also informs the owner that if they fail to show up, they could face a maximum fine of $875, plus additional fines for continuing to ignore the summons. </p><p>A New York City DEP spokesman confirmed to <em>Road &amp; Track </em>via email the system is part of a small pilot program that&#39;s been running since September 2021. From the description above, it sounds like it works much like a speed camera that automatically records a violation and sends it to you in the mail by reading your license plate. Instead of a speed gun, this new system uses a strategically placed sound meter to record decibel levels on the road, matching it to a license plate using a camera.</p><p>The DEP tells us this new program is unrelated to Governor Kathy Hochul&#39;s recent initiative to curb noise pollution in New York. In September 2021 she signed <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a38114277/new-york-will-now-fine-you-dollar1000-for-a-noisy-aftermarket-exhaust/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a38114277/new-york-will-now-fine-you-dollar1000-for-a-noisy-aftermarket-exhaust/">the SLEEP bill</a> into law, raising fines for exhaust noise violation in the state from $150 to $1000—currently the highest in the nation.  </p><p>The program will be reevaluated on June 30, according to the DEP. From there it&#39;ll likely either be expanded or taken out of commission. We&#39;ll be sure to follow up then to find out. </p><p><em>Aaron Brown contributed to this report. </em></p>
