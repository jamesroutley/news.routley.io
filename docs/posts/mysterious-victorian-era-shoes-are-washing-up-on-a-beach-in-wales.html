        <p>Hundreds of black leather boots that appear to be from the 19th century have washed up on a beach, mystifying residents of a seaside village in southern Wales.</p>

<p>Volunteers have been finding the shoes while cleaning up litter from rock pools on a beach in Ogmore-by-Sea, a coastal town along the Bristol Channel. During one week in late December alone, they found 200 boots in one small area, reports <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy84ezd4421o">BBC Wales</a>’ Angela Ferguson. In total, they’ve discovered more than 400 shoes since September.</p>

<p>Beachcombers have discovered several shapes and styles of footwear, but they all appear to be from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Victorian-era">Victorian era</a>. The soles are attached with nails.</p>

<p>“Some of the boots are in pretty good condition, and with some you can very clearly see they are a men’s boot,” Emma Lamport, the founding director of <a href="https://www.beachacademywales.com/education">Beach Academy</a>, a group that organizes outdoor learning events and activities, tells BBC Wales.</p>

<p>In December, Beach Academy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSk91hkDN_x/?img_index=2">posted photos</a> of the shoes on social media, asking members of the public for help identifying them.</p>

<p>“They resemble shoes from times past rather than modern styles,” according to the post. “We are slowly excavating them from rockpool zones where they have been embedded into sediment or trapped in rocks. ... We have no idea how long they have actually been trapped there! Many stories, I’m sure.”</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSk91hkDN_x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>

<p>Some residents chimed in to describe their own mysterious discoveries, with one woman writing that she’s “collected buckets full [of shoes] over the years.”</p>

<p>Right now, the leading theory is that the shoes came from an Italian cargo vessel that sank nearby roughly 150 years ago. Its cargo—which included shoes—then “washed up the Ogmore River, and every now and then they appear, especially when there has been erosion of the river bank,” according to a statement from Beach Academy shared with <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hundreds-of-19th-century-black-leather-shoes-have-mysteriously-washed-up-on-a-beach-82031"><em>IFLScience</em></a>’s Tom Hale.</p>

<p>The cargo ship sank after colliding with an outcropping called <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57853220">Tusker Rock</a>, which is located roughly two miles from the beach where the shoes have been washing up.</p><div>
    
    <div>
    <h4>Quick fact: The dangers of Tusker Rock</h4>
    <p>The small island is less than 0.3 miles long, but it has claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57853220">dozens of sailors </a>since at least the late 1700s. </p>
    </div>
</div><p>Whatever the explanation, the shoes are “little reminders of history,” says <a href="https://www.peter-britton.com/">Peter Britton</a>, an artist who created the 2023 “Ghost Ships and Tides” exhibition at the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea based on his photographs of Tusker Rock, to BBC Wales.</p>

<p>“We were a little bit unnerved because we didn’t know where they’d come from in such large numbers,” Lamport tells the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/23/mystery-over-hundreds-victorian-shoes-welsh-beach/"><em>Telegraph</em></a>’s Eric Williams. “With something so old and historic, the story is a real mystery.”</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time historic footwear has made headlines. In August 2019, a local hiker discovered a 1,700-year-old Roman-inspired <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/melting-ice-in-norway-reveals-1700-year-old-sandal-180979972/">leather sandal</a> protruding from the snow in Norway. In the fall of 2023, archaeologists unearthed a 2,000-year-old <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/2000-year-old-childs-shoe-found-in-austria-180982946/">leather children’s shoe</a> from a rock salt mine in Austria, complete with a small fragment of material that likely served as a shoelace. And in the summer of 2025, researchers discovered <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-keep-finding-massive-shoes-at-an-ancient-roman-fort-and-they-have-no-idea-why-theyre-so-big-180987028/">massive leather shoes</a> while excavating a Roman-era fort near <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-discover-134-ancient-settlements-north-of-hadrians-wall-180980183/">Hadrian’s Wall</a>. Archaeologists recently found a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/generations-bearded-vultures-stashed-humans-treasures-including-650-year-old-sandal-in-these-bird-nests-180987443/">650-year-old sandal</a> made from woven twigs and grasses, preserved inside a historical bearded vulture nest in southern Spain.</p>
