This approach lets Gemini generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously, even revising or combining different ideas over time, before arriving at the best answer.</p><p data-block-key="br919">Moreover, by extending the inference time or &#34;thinking time,&#34; we give Gemini more time to explore different hypotheses, and arrive at creative solutions to complex problems.</p><p data-block-key="baesa">We’ve also developed novel reinforcement learning techniques that encourage the model to make use of these extended reasoning paths, thus enabling Deep Think to become a better, more intuitive problem-solver over time.</p></div>
