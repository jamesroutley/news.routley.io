    <h1>If only someone told me this before my first startup</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>1. Validate idea first.
I wasted at least 5 years building stuff nobody needed.</p><p>2. Kill your EGO.
It&#39;s not about me, but the user. I must want what the user wants, not what I want.</p><p>3. Don&#39;t chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will be chasing you.</p><p>4. Never hire managers.
Only hire doers until PMF.</p><p>5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.</p><p>6. Hire only fullstack devs.
There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.</p><p>7. Chase global market from day 1.
You&#39;ll win or fail despite the market you target in most cases, so go for bigger upside.</p><p>8. Do SEO from day 2.
As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It&#39;s my biggest regret.</p><p>9. Sell features, before building them.
Ask existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add.</p><p>10. Hire only people you would wanna hug.
My mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don&#39;t wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can&#39;t say why, but that&#39;s the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up.</p><p>11. Invest all money into your startups and friends.
Not crypt0, not stockmarket, not properties.
I did some math, if I kept investing all my money into all my friendsâ€™ startups, that would be about 70 investments.
3 of them turned into unicorns eventually. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my products, friends, and network.</p><p>12. Post on Twitter daily.
I started posting here in March this year. It&#39;s my primary source of new connections and traffic.</p><p>13. Don&#39;t work/partner with corporates.
Corporations always seem like an amazing opportunity. They&#39;re big and rich, they promise huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities.</p><p>14. Don&#39;t get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0.
I lost 1.5 years of my life this way.
I met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that space.</p><p>15. Don&#39;t build consumer apps. Only b2b.
Consumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It&#39;s just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don&#39;t.
Even if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge.</p><p>16. Don&#39;t hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year.
Some projects just don&#39;t work. In most cases, it&#39;s either the idea that&#39;s so wrong that you can&#39;t even pivot it or it&#39;s a team that is good one by one but can&#39;t make it as a team.</p><p>17. Tech conferences are a waste of time.
They cost money, take energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most people there are the &#34;good&#34; employees of corporations who were sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation.</p><p>18. Scrum is a Scam.
If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail.
The only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.</p><p>19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF.
In a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It&#39;s just yet another assignment in their boring job.</p><p>20. Bootstrap.
I spent way too much time raising money. I raised more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the VC-funded way, I don&#39;t know why. To be honest, I didn&#39;t know bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.</p><p>That&#39;s it.</p></div></td></div></div>
