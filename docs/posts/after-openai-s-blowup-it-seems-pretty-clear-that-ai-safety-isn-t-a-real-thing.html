That said, the long-term fallout from this gripping incident is bound to be a lot less enjoyable than the initial spectacle of it.</p><p>The “coup,” as many have referred to it, has largely been attributed to an ideological rift  between Sam and the OpenAI board over the pace of technological development at the company. So, this narrative goes, the board, which is supposed to have ultimate say over the direction of the organization, was <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerned about the rate at which Altman was pushing to commercialize the technology</a></span>, and decided to eject him with extreme prejudice.

This design is supposed to  prioritize the organization’s mission of pursuing the public good over money. OpenAI’s <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://openai.com/our-structure&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://openai.com/our-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own self-description</a></span> promotes this idealistic notion—that it’s main aim is to make the world a better place, not make money:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We designed OpenAI’s structure—a partnership between our original Nonprofit and a new capped profit arm—as a chassis for OpenAI’s mission: to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is safe and benefits all of humanity.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the board’s charter owes its allegiance to “humanity,” not to its shareholders. So, despite the fact that <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-partnership-rocky-start-1850536201&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-partnership-rocky-start-1850536201">Microsoft has poured a megaton of money and resources into OpenAI</a></span>, the startup’s board is still (hypothetically) supposed to have final say over what happens with its products and technology. That said, the company part of the organization is <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-seeks-new-valuation-of-up-to-90-billion-in-sale-of-existing-shares-ed6229e0&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-seeks-new-valuation-of-up-to-90-billion-in-sale-of-existing-shares-ed6229e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported to be worth tens of billions of dollars</a></span>. As many have already noted, the organization’s ethical mission seems to have come directly into  conflict with the economic interests of those who had invested in the organization. As per usual, the money won. </p><p>All of this said, you could make the case that we shouldn’t fully endorse this interpretation of the weekend’s events yet, since the actual reasons for Altman’s ousting have still not been made public. For the most part, members of the company either <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/22/sam-altman-fired-y-combinator-paul-graham/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/22/sam-altman-fired-y-combinator-paul-graham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren’t talking</a></span> about the reasons Sam was pushed out or have <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/openais-new-ceo-says-real-reason-behind-sam-altman-ouster-not-ai-safety:-gives-clue-on&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/openais-new-ceo-says-real-reason-behind-sam-altman-ouster-not-ai-safety:-gives-clue-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flatly denied</a></span> that his ousting had anything to do with AI safety. Alternate theories have swirled in the meantime, with some suggesting that the real reasons for Altman’s aggressive exit were decidedly more colorful—like accusations he <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursued additional funding</a></span> via autocratic Mideast regimes.</p><p>But to get too bogged down in speculating about the specific catalysts for OpenAI’s drama is to ignore what the whole episode has revealed: as far as the real world is concerned, “AI safety” in Silicon Valley is pretty much null and void. Indeed, we now know that despite its supposedly bullet-proof organizational structure and its stated mission of responsible AI development, OpenAI was never going to be allowed to actually put ethics before money.</p><p>To be clear, AI safety is a really important field, and, were it to be actually practiced by corporate America, that would be one thing.<strong> </strong>That said, the version of it that  existed at OpenAI—arguably one of the companies that has <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done the most</a></span> to pursue a “safety” oriented model—doesn’t seem to have been much of a match for the realpolitik machinations of the tech industry. In even more frank terms, the  folks who were supposed to be defending us from runaway AI (i.e., the board members)—the ones who were ordained with responsible stewardship over this powerful technology—don’t seem to have known what they were doing. They don’t seem to  have understood that Sam had all the industry  connections, the friends in high places, was well-liked, and that moving against him in a world where that kind of social capital is everything amounted to career suicide. If you come at the king, you best not miss.</p><p>In short: If the point of corporate AI safety is to protect humanity from runaway AI, then, as an effective strategy for doing that, it has effectively just flunked its first big test. That’s because it’s sorta hard to put your faith in a group of people who weren’t even capable of predicting the very predictable outcome that would occur when they fired their boss. How, exactly, can such a group be trusted with overseeing a supposedly “super-intelligent,” world-shattering technology? If you can’t outfox a gaggle of outraged investors, then you probably can’t outfox the Skynet-type entity you claim to be building. That said, I would argue we also can’t trust the craven, money-obsessed C-suite that has now reasserted its dominance. Imo, they’re <em>obviously</em> not going to do the right thing. So, effectively, humanity is stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>As the conflict from the OpenAI dustup settles, it seems like the company is well positioned to get back to business as usual.

Case in point: This weekend’s drama seems to have further radicalized an already pretty radical anti-safety ideology that had been circulating the business.

Over the weekend, as the narrative about “AI safety” emerged, some of the more fervent adherents of this belief system took to X to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1727457621425197230&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1727457621425197230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decry what they perceived to be an attack</a></span> on the true victim of the episode (<span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1727461698460651938&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1727461698460651938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitalism, of course</a></span>).</p><p>To some degree, the whole point of the tech industry’s embrace of “ethics” and “safety” is about reassurance. Companies realize that the technologies they are selling can be disconcerting and disruptive; they want to reassure the public that they’re doing their best to protect consumers and society. At the end of the day, though, we now know there’s no reason  to believe that those efforts will ever make a difference if the company’s “ethics” end up conflicting with its money.
