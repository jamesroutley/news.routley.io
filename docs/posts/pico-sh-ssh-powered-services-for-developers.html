    <h1>Pico.sh â€“ SSH powered services for developers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
        Our mission is to enable developers with services that 
        help them rapidly prototype on the web.  We want to make it
        easier than ever for developers to share their projects with the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our services allow users to publish content without needing to install anything.
        We accomplish this with the SSH tools (<code>rsync</code>, <code>sftp</code>,
        <code>sshfs</code>) you already have installed on your system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use our platform entirely using SSH and our TUI.
