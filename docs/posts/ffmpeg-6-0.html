    Releases</h4>

  <p>
    Approximately every 6 months the FFmpeg project makes a new major release.
    Between major releases point releases
    will appear that add important bug fixes but no new features.
    Note that these releases are intended for distributors and system integrators.
    Users that wish to compile from source themselves are strongly encouraged to
    consider using the development branch (see above), this is the only version on
    which FFmpeg developers actively work.  The release branches only cherry pick
    selected changes from the development branch, which therefore receives much more
    and much faster bug fixes such as additional features and security patches.
