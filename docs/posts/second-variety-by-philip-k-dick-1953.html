	<p id="synopsis">The claws were bad enough in the first
	place—nasty, crawling little death-robots.
	But when they began to imitate
	their creators, it was time for the
	human race to make peace—if it could!</p>

	<p><a id="page104" title="104"> </a>The Russian soldier made his
	way nervously up the ragged
	side of the hill, holding his gun
	ready. He glanced around him,
	licking his dry lips, his face set.
	From time to time he reached
	up a gloved hand and wiped
	perspiration from his neck, pushing
	down his coat collar.</p>

	<p>Eric turned to Corporal Leone.
	“Want him? Or can I have him?”
	He adjusted the view sight so the
	Russian’s features squarely filled
	the glass, the lines cutting across
	his hard, somber features.</p>

	<p>Leone considered. The Russian
	was close, moving rapidly, almost
	running. “Don’t fire. Wait.”
	Leone tensed. “I don’t think
	we’re needed.”</p>

	<p>The Russian increased his
	pace, kicking ash and piles of
	debris out of his way. He reached
	the top of the hill and stopped,
	panting, staring around him. The
	sky was overcast, drifting clouds
	of gray particles. Bare trunks of
	trees jutted up occasionally; the
	ground was level and bare,
	rubble-strewn, with the ruins of
	buildings standing out here and
	there like yellowing skulls.</p>

	<p>The Russian was uneasy. He
	knew something was wrong. He
	started down the hill. Now he
	was only a few paces from the
	bunker. Eric was getting fidgety.
	He played with his pistol, glancing
	at Leone.</p>

	<p>“Don’t worry,” Leone said.
	“He won’t get here. They’ll take
	care of him.”</p>

	<p>“Are you sure? He’s got damn
	far.”</p>

	<p>“They hang around close to the
	bunker. He’s getting into the
	bad part. Get set!”</p>

	<p>The Russian began to hurry,
	sliding down the hill, his boots
	sinking into the heaps of gray
	ash, trying to keep his gun up.
	He stopped for a moment, lifting
	his fieldglasses to his face.</p>

	<p>“He’s looking right at us,”
	Eric said.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The Russian came on. They
	could see his eyes, like two blue
	stones. His mouth was open a
	little. He needed a shave; his
	chin was stubbled. On one bony
	cheek was a square of tape,
	showing blue at the edge. A fungoid
	spot. His coat was muddy
	and torn. One glove was missing.
	As he ran his belt counter
	bounced up and down against
	him.</p>

	<p>Leone touched Eric’s arm.
	“Here one comes.”</p>

	<p>Across the ground something
	small and metallic came, flashing
	in the dull sunlight of mid-day. A
	metal sphere. It raced up the
	hill after the Russian, its treads
	flying. It was small, one of the
	baby ones. Its claws were out,
	two razor projections spinning
	in a blur of white steel. The
	Russian heard it. He turned instantly,
	<a id="page105" title="105"> </a>firing. The sphere dissolved
	into particles. But already
	a second had emerged and was
	following the first. The Russian
	fired again.</p>

	<p>A third sphere leaped up the
	Russian’s leg, clicking and whirring.
	It jumped to the shoulder.
	The spinning blades disappeared
	into the Russian’s throat.</p>

	<p>Eric relaxed. “Well, that’s
	that. God, those damn things give
	me the creeps. Sometimes I think
	we were better off before.”</p>

	<p>“If we hadn’t invented them,
	they would have.” Leone lit a
	cigarette shakily. “I wonder why
	a Russian would come all this
	way alone. I didn’t see anyone
	covering him.”</p>

	<p>Lt. Scott came slipping up the
	tunnel, into the bunker. “What
	happened? Something entered
	the screen.”</p>

	<p>“An Ivan.”</p>

	<p>“Just one?”</p>

	<p>Eric brought the view screen
	around. Scott peered into it.
	Now there were numerous metal
	spheres crawling over the prostrate
	body, dull metal globes
	clicking and whirring, sawing up
	the Russian into small parts to
	be carried away.</p>

	<p>“What a lot of claws,” Scott
	murmured.</p>

	<p>“They come like flies. Not
	much game for them any more.”</p>

	<p>Scott pushed the sight away,
	disgusted. “Like flies. I wonder
	why he was out there. They
	know we have claws all around.”</p>

	<p>A larger robot had joined the
	smaller spheres. It was directing
	operations, a long blunt tube
	with projecting eyepieces. There
	was not much left of the soldier.
	What remained was being
	brought down the hillside by the
	host of claws.</p>

	<p>“Sir,” Leone said. “If it’s all
	right, I’d like to go out there
	and take a look at him.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“Maybe he came with something.”</p>

	<p>Scott considered. He shrugged.
	“All right. But be careful.”</p>

	<p>“I have my tab.” Leone patted
	the metal band at his wrist. “I’ll
	be out of bounds.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>He picked up his rifle and stepped
	carefully up to the mouth of
	the bunker, making his way between
	blocks of concrete and steel
	prongs, twisted and bent. The air
	was cold at the top. He crossed
	over the ground toward the remains
	of the soldier, striding
	across the soft ash. A wind blew
	around him, swirling gray particles
	up in his face. He squinted
	and pushed on.</p>

	<p>The claws retreated as he came
	close, some of them stiffening
	into immobility. He touched his
	tab. The Ivan would have given
	something for that! Short hard
	radiation emitted from the tab
	<a id="page106" title="106"> </a>neutralized the claws, put them
	out of commission. Even the big
	robot with its two waving eyestalks
	retreated respectfully as
	he approached.</p>

	<p>He bent down over the remains
	of the soldier. The gloved hand
	was closed tightly. There was
	something in it. Leone pried the
	fingers apart. A sealed container,
	aluminum. Still shiny.</p>

	<p>He put it in his pocket and
	made his way back to the bunker.
	Behind him the claws came back
	to life, moving into operation
	again. The procession resumed,
	metal spheres moving through
	the gray ash with their loads.
	He could hear their treads scrabbling
	against the ground. He
	shuddered.</p>

	<p>Scott watched intently as he
	brought the shiny tube out of his
	pocket. “He had that?”</p>

	<p>“In his hand.” Leone unscrewed
	the top. “Maybe you
	should look at it, sir.”</p>

	<p>Scott took it. He emptied the
	contents out in the palm of his
	hand. A small piece of silk paper,
	carefully folded. He sat down by
	the light and unfolded it.</p>

	<p>“What’s it say, sir?” Eric said.
	Several officers came up the tunnel.
	Major Hendricks appeared.</p>

	<p>“Major,” Scott said. “Look at
	this.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks read the slip. “This
	just come?”</p>

	<p>“A single runner. Just now.”</p>

	<p>“Where is he?” Hendricks
	asked sharply.</p>

	<p>“The claws got him.”</p>

	<p>Major Hendricks grunted.
	“Here.” He passed it to his companions.
	“I think this is what
	we’ve been waiting for. They
	certainly took their time about
	it.”</p>

	<p>“So they want to talk terms,”
	Scott said. “Are we going along
	with them?”</p>

	<p>“That’s not for us to decide.”
	Hendricks sat down. “Where’s
	the communications officer? I
	want the Moon Base.”</p>

	<p>Leone pondered as the communications
	officer raised the
	outside antenna cautiously, scanning
	the sky above the bunker
	for any sign of a watching Russian ship.</p>

	<p>“Sir,” Scott said to Hendricks.
	“It’s sure strange they suddenly
	came around. We’ve been using
	the claws for almost a year. Now
	all of a sudden they start to
	fold.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe claws have been getting
	down in their bunkers.”</p>

	<p>“One of the big ones, the kind
	with stalks, got into an Ivan
	bunker last week,” Eric said. “It
	got a whole platoon of them before
	they got their lid shut.”</p>

	<p>“How do you know?”</p>

	<p>“A buddy told me. The thing
	came back with—with remains.”</p>

	<p>“Moon Base, sir,” the communications
	officer said.</p>

	<p><a id="page107" title="107"> </a>On the screen the face of the
	lunar monitor appeared. His
	crisp uniform contrasted to the
	uniforms in the bunker. And he
	was clean shaven. “Moon Base.”</p>

	<p>“This is forward command
	L-Whistle. On Terra. Let me
	have General Thompson.”</p>

	<p>The monitor faded. Presently
	General Thompson’s heavy features
	came into focus. “What is
	it, Major?”</p>

	<p>“Our claws got a single Russian
	runner with a message. We
	don’t know whether to act on it—there
	have been tricks like this
	in the past.”</p>

	<p>“What’s the message?”</p>

	<p>“The Russians want us to send
	a single officer on policy level
	over to their lines. For a conference.
	They don’t state the nature
	of the conference. They say that
	matters of—” He consulted the
	slip. “—Matters of grave urgency
	make it advisable that discussion
	be opened between a
	representative of the UN forces
	and themselves.”</p>

	<p>He held the message up to the
	screen for the general to scan.
	Thompson’s eyes moved.</p>

	<p>“What should we do?” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>“Send a man out.”</p>

	<p>“You don’t think it’s a trap?”</p>

	<p>“It might be. But the location
	they give for their forward command
	is correct. It’s worth a
	try, at any rate.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll send an officer out. And
	report the results to you as soon
	as he returns.”</p>

	<p>“All right, Major.” Thompson
	broke the connection. The screen
	died. Up above, the antenna came
	slowly down.</p>

	<p>Hendricks rolled up the paper,
	deep in thought.</p>

	<p>“I’ll go,” Leone said.</p>

	<p>“They want somebody at
	policy level.” Hendricks rubbed
	his jaw. “Policy level. I haven’t
	been outside in months. Maybe
	I could use a little air.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t you think it’s risky?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks lifted the view sight
	and gazed into it. The remains
	of the Russian were gone. Only
	a single claw was in sight. It
	was folding itself back, disappearing
	into the ash, like a crab.
	Like some hideous metal crab….</p>

	<p>“That’s the only thing that
	bothers me.” Hendricks rubbed
	his wrist. “I know I’m safe as
	long as I have this on me. But
	there’s something about them. I
	hate the damn things. I wish
	we’d never invented them.
	There’s something wrong with
	them. Relentless little—”</p>

	<p>“If we hadn’t invented them,
	the Ivans would have.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks pushed the sight
	back. “Anyhow, it seems to be
	winning the war. I guess that’s
	good.”</p>

	<p>“Sounds like you’re getting
	the same jitters as the Ivans.”
	<a id="page108" title="108"> </a>Hendricks examined his wrist
	watch. “I guess I had better get
	started, if I want to be there
	before dark.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>He took a deep breath and
	then stepped out onto the gray,
	rubbled ground. After a minute
	he lit a cigarette and stood gazing
	around him. The landscape
	was dead. Nothing stirred. He
	could see for miles, endless ash
	and slag, ruins of buildings. A
	few trees without leaves or
	branches, only the trunks. Above
	him the eternal rolling clouds of
	gray, drifting between Terra and
	the sun.</p>

	<p>Major Hendricks went on. Off
	to the right something scuttled,
	something round and metallic. A
	claw, going lickety-split after
	something. Probably after a
	small animal, a rat. They got
	rats, too. As a sort of sideline.</p>

	<p>He came to the top of the little
	hill and lifted his fieldglasses.
	The Russian lines were a few
	miles ahead of him. They had a
	forward command post there.
	The runner had come from it.</p>

	<p>A squat robot with undulating
	arms passed by him, its arms
	weaving inquiringly. The robot
	went on its way, disappearing
	under some debris. Hendricks
	watched it go. He had never seen
	that type before. There were
	getting to be more and more
	types he had never seen, new
	varieties and sizes coming up
	from the underground factories.</p>

	<p>Hendricks put out his cigarette
	and hurried on. It was interesting,
	the use of artificial
	forms in warfare. How had they
	got started? Necessity. The Soviet
	Union had gained great
	initial success, usual with the
	side that got the war going. Most
	of North America had been
	blasted off the map. Retaliation
	was quick in coming, of course.
	The sky was full of circling disc-bombers
	long before the war began;
	they had been up there for
	years. The discs began sailing
	down all over Russia within
	hours after Washington got it.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>But that hadn’t helped Washington.</p>

	<p>The American bloc governments
	moved to the Moon Base
	the first year. There was not
	much else to do. Europe was
	gone; a slag heap with dark
	weeds growing from the ashes
	and bones. Most of North America
	was useless; nothing could be
	planted, no one could live. A few
	million people kept going up in
	Canada and down in South
	America. But during the second
	year Soviet parachutists began
	to drop, a few at first, then more
	and more. They wore the first
	really effective anti-radiation
	equipment; what was left of
	American production moved to
	<a id="page109" title="109"> </a>the moon along with the governments.</p>

	<p>All but the troops. The remaining
	troops stayed behind as
	best they could, a few thousand
	here, a platoon there. No one
	knew exactly where they were;
	they stayed where they could,
	moving around at night, hiding
	in ruins, in sewers, cellars, with
	the rats and snakes. It looked as
	if the Soviet Union had the war
	almost won. Except for a handful
	of projectiles fired off from
	the moon daily, there was almost
	no weapon in use against them.
	They came and went as they
	pleased. The war, for all practical
	purposes, was over. Nothing
	effective opposed them.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>And then the first claws appeared.
	And overnight the complexion
	of the war changed.</p>

	<p>The claws were awkward, at
	first. Slow. The Ivans knocked
	them off almost as fast as they
	crawled out of their underground
	tunnels. But then they got better,
	faster and more cunning. Factories,
	all on Terra, turned them
	out. Factories a long way under
	ground, behind the Soviet lines,
	factories that had once made
	atomic projectiles, now almost
	forgotten.</p>

	<p>The claws got faster, and they
	got bigger. New types appeared,
	some with feelers, some that flew.
	There were a few jumping kinds.</p>

	<p>The best technicians on the moon
	were working on designs, making
	them more and more intricate,
	more flexible. They became uncanny;
	the Ivans were having a
	lot of trouble with them. Some
	of the little claws were learning
	to hide themselves, burrowing
	down into the ash, lying in wait.</p>

	<p>And then they started getting
	into the Russian bunkers, slipping
	down when the lids were raised
	for air and a look around. One
	claw inside a bunker, a churning
	sphere of blades and metal—that
	was enough. And when one
	got in others followed. With a
	weapon like that the war couldn’t
	go on much longer.</p>

	<p>Maybe it was already over.</p>

	<p>Maybe he was going to hear
	the news. Maybe the Politburo
	had decided to throw in the
	sponge. Too bad it had taken so
	long. Six years. A long time for
	war like that, the way they had
	waged it. The automatic retaliation
	discs, spinning down all over
	Russia, hundreds of thousands of
	them. Bacteria crystals. The Soviet
	guided missiles, whistling
	through the air. The chain
	bombs. And now this, the robots,
	the claws—</p>

	<p>The claws weren’t like other
	weapons. They were <em>alive</em>, from
	any practical standpoint, whether
	the Governments wanted to admit
	it or not. They were not
	machines. They were living
	<a id="page110" title="110"> </a>things, spinning, creeping, shaking
	themselves up suddenly from
	the gray ash and darting toward
	a man, climbing up him, rushing
	for his throat. And that was
	what they had been designed to
	do. Their job.</p>

	<p>They did their job well. Especially
	lately, with the new designs
	coming up. Now they
	repaired themselves. They were
	on their own. Radiation tabs protected
	the UN troops, but if a
	man lost his tab he was fair
	game for the claws, no matter
	what his uniform. Down below
	the surface automatic machinery
	stamped them out. Human beings
	stayed a long way off. It was too
	risky; nobody wanted to be
	around them. They were left to
	themselves. And they seemed to
	be doing all right. The new designs
	were faster, more complex.
	More efficient.</p>

	<p>Apparently they had won the
	war.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Major Hendricks lit a second
	cigarette. The landscape depressed
	him. Nothing but ash and
	ruins. He seemed to be alone,
	the only living thing in the whole
	world. To the right the ruins of
	a town rose up, a few walls and
	heaps of debris. He tossed the
	dead match away, increasing his
	pace. Suddenly he stopped, jerking
	up his gun, his body tense.
	For a minute it looked like—</p>

	<p>From behind the shell of a
	ruined building a figure came,
	walking slowly toward him, walking
	hesitantly.</p>

	<p>Hendricks blinked. “Stop!”</p>

	<p>The boy stopped. Hendricks
	lowered his gun. The boy stood
	silently, looking at him. He was
	small, not very old. Perhaps
	eight. But it was hard to tell.
	Most of the kids who remained
	were stunted. He wore a faded
	blue sweater, ragged with dirt,
	and short pants. His hair was
	long and matted. Brown hair. It
	hung over his face and around
	his ears. He held something in
	his arms.</p>

	<p>“What’s that you have?” Hendricks
	said sharply.</p>

	<p>The boy held it out. It was a
	toy, a bear. A teddy bear. The
	boy’s eyes were large, but without
	expression.</p>

	<p>Hendricks relaxed. “I don’t
	want it. Keep it.”</p>

	<p>The boy hugged the bear
	again.</p>

	<p>“Where do you live?” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>“In there.”</p>

	<p>“The ruins?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“Underground?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“How many are there?”</p>

	<p>“How—how many?”</p>

	<p>“How many of you. How big’s
	your settlement?”</p>

	<p>The boy did not answer.</p>

	<p><a id="page111" title="111"> </a>Hendricks frowned. “You’re
	not all by yourself, are you?”</p>

	<p>The boy nodded.</p>

	<p>“How do you stay alive?”</p>

	<p>“There’s food.”</p>

	<p>“What kind of food?”</p>

	<p>“Different.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks studied him. “How
	old are you?”</p>

	<p>“Thirteen.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>It wasn’t possible. Or was it?
	The boy was thin, stunted. And
	probably sterile. Radiation exposure,
	years straight. No
	wonder he was so small. His arms
	and legs were like pipecleaners,
	knobby, and thin. Hendricks
	touched the boy’s arm. His skin
	was dry and rough; radiation
	skin. He bent down, looking into
	the boy’s face. There was no
	expression. Big eyes, big and
	dark.</p>

	<p>“Are you blind?” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>“No. I can see some.”</p>

	<p>“How do you get away from
	the claws?”</p>

	<p>“The claws?”</p>

	<p>“The round things. That run
	and burrow.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

	<p>Maybe there weren’t any claws
	around. A lot of areas were free.
	They collected mostly around
	bunkers, where there were
	people. The claws had been designed
	to sense warmth, warmth
	of living things.</p>

	<p>“You’re lucky.” Hendricks
	straightened up. “Well? Which
	way are you going? Back—back
	there?”</p>

	<p>“Can I come with you?”</p>

	<p>“With <em>me</em>?” Hendricks folded
	his arms. “I’m going a long way.
	Miles. I have to hurry.” He
	looked at his watch. “I have to
	get there by nightfall.”</p>

	<p>“I want to come.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks fumbled in his pack.
	“It isn’t worth it. Here.” He
	tossed down the food cans he had
	with him. “You take these and
	go back. Okay?”</p>

	<p>The boy said nothing.</p>

	<p>“I’ll be coming back this way.
	In a day or so. If you’re around
	here when I come back you can
	come along with me. All right?”</p>

	<p>“I want to go with you now.”</p>

	<p>“It’s a long walk.”</p>

	<p>“I can walk.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks shifted uneasily. It
	made too good a target, two
	people walking along. And the
	boy would slow him down. But
	he might not come back this
	way. And if the boy were really
	all alone—</p>

	<p>“Okay. Come along.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The boy fell in beside him.
	Hendricks strode along. The boy
	walked silently, clutching his
	teddy bear.</p>

	<p>“What’s your name?” Hendricks
	said, after a time.</p>

	<p>“David Edward Derring.”</p>

	<p><a id="page112" title="112"> </a>“David? What—what happened
	to your mother and
	father?”</p>

	<p>“They died.”</p>

	<p>“How?”</p>

	<p>“In the blast.”</p>

	<p>“How long ago?”</p>

	<p>“Six years.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks slowed down.
	“You’ve been alone six years?”</p>

	<p>“No. There were other people
	for awhile. They went away.”</p>

	<p>“And you’ve been alone
	since?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks glanced down. The
	boy was strange, saying very
	little. Withdrawn. But that was
	the way they were, the children
	who had survived. Quiet. Stoic.
	A strange kind of fatalism gripped
	them. Nothing came as a
	surprise. They accepted anything
	that came along. There was no
	longer any <em>normal</em>, any natural
	course of things, moral or physical,
	for them to expect. Custom,
	habit, all the determining forces
	of learning were gone; only brute
	experience remained.</p>

	<p>“Am I walking too fast?”
	Hendricks said.</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“How did you happen to see
	me?”</p>

	<p>“I was waiting.”</p>

	<p>“Waiting?” Hendricks was
	puzzled. “What were you waiting
	for?”</p>

	<p>“To catch things.”</p>

	<p>“What kind of things?”</p>

	<p>“Things to eat.”</p>

	<p>“Oh.” Hendricks set his lips
	grimly. A thirteen year old boy,
	living on rats and gophers and
	half-rotten canned food. Down in
	a hole under the ruins of a town.
	With radiation pools and claws,
	and Russian dive-mines up above,
	coasting around in the sky.</p>

	<p>“Where are we going?” David
	asked.</p>

	<p>“To the Russian lines.”</p>

	<p>“Russian?”</p>

	<p>“The enemy. The people who
	started the war. They dropped
	the first radiation bombs. They
	began all this.”</p>

	<p>The boy nodded. His face
	showed no expression.</p>

	<p>“I’m an American,” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>There was no comment. On
	they went, the two of them,
	Hendricks walking a little ahead,
	David trailing behind him, hugging
	his dirty teddy bear against
	his chest.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>About four in the afternoon
	they stopped to eat. Hendricks
	built a fire in a hollow between
	some slabs of concrete. He
	cleared the weeds away and
	heaped up bits of wood. The
	Russians’ lines were not very far
	ahead. Around him was what had
	once been a long valley, acres of
	fruit trees and grapes. Nothing
	remained now but a few bleak
	<a id="page113" title="113"> </a>stumps and the mountains that
	stretched across the horizon at
	the far end. And the clouds of
	rolling ash that blew and drifted
	with the wind, settling over the
	weeds and remains of buildings,
	walls here and there, once in
	awhile what had been a road.</p>

	<p>Hendricks made coffee and
	heated up some boiled mutton
	and bread. “Here.” He handed
	bread and mutton to David.
	David squatted by the edge of
	the fire, his knees knobby and
	white. He examined the food and
	then passed it back, shaking his
	head.</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“No? Don’t you want any?”</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks shrugged. Maybe
	the boy was a mutant, used to
	special food. It didn’t matter.
	When he was hungry he would
	find something to eat. The boy
	was strange. But there were
	many strange changes coming
	over the world. Life was not the
	same, anymore. It would never
	be the same again. The human
	race was going to have to realize
	that.</p>

	<p>“Suit yourself,” Hendricks
	said. He ate the bread and mutton
	by himself, washing it down
	with coffee. He ate slowly, finding
	the food hard to digest.
	When he was done he got to his
	feet and stamped the fire out.</p>

	<p>David rose slowly, watching
	him with his young-old eyes.</p>

	<p>“We’re going,” Hendricks said.</p>

	<p>“All right.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks walked along, his
	gun in his arms. They were
	close; he was tense, ready for
	anything. The Russians should
	be expecting a runner, an answer
	to their own runner, but they
	were tricky. There was always
	the possibility of a slipup. He
	scanned the landscape around
	him. Nothing but slag and ash,
	a few hills, charred trees. Concrete
	walls. But someplace ahead
	was the first bunker of the Russian
	lines, the forward command.
	Underground, buried deep, with
	only a periscope showing, a few
	gun muzzles. Maybe an antenna.</p>

	<p>“Will we be there soon?”
	David asked.</p>

	<p>“Yes. Getting tired?”</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“Why, then?”</p>

	<p>David did not answer. He
	plodded carefully along behind,
	picking his way over the ash. His
	legs and shoes were gray with
	dust. His pinched face was
	streaked, lines of gray ash in
	riverlets down the pale white
	of his skin. There was no color to
	his face. Typical of the new children,
	growing up in cellars and
	sewers and underground
	shelters.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks slowed down. He
	lifted his fieldglasses and studied
	<a id="page114" title="114"> </a>the ground ahead of him. Were
	they there, someplace, waiting
	for him? Watching him, the way
	his men had watched the Russian
	runner? A chill went up his
	back. Maybe they were getting
	their guns ready, preparing to
	fire, the way his men had prepared,
	made ready to kill.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stopped, wiping
	perspiration from his face.
	“Damn.” It made him uneasy.
	But he should be expected. The
	situation was different.</p>

	<p>He strode over the ash, holding
	his gun tightly with both
	hands. Behind him came David.
	Hendricks peered around, tight-lipped.
	Any second it might happen.
	A burst of white light, a
	blast, carefully aimed from inside
	a deep concrete bunker.</p>

	<p>He raised his arm and waved
	it around in a circle.</p>

	<p>Nothing moved. To the right a
	long ridge ran, topped with dead
	tree trunks. A few wild vines had
	grown up around the trees, remains
	of arbors. And the eternal
	dark weeds. Hendricks studied
	the ridge. Was anything up
	there? Perfect place for a lookout.
	He approached the ridge
	warily, David coming silently behind.
	If it were his command he’d
	have a sentry up there, watching
	for troops trying to infiltrate
	into the command area. Of
	course, if it were his command
	there would be the claws around
	the area for full protection.</p>

	<p>He stopped, feet apart, hands
	on his hips.</p>

	<p>“Are we there?” David said.</p>

	<p>“Almost.”</p>

	<p>“Why have we stopped?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t want to take any
	chances.” Hendricks advanced
	slowly. Now the ridge lay directly
	beside him, along his right.
	Overlooking him. His uneasy
	feeling increased. If an Ivan
	were up there he wouldn’t have
	a chance. He waved his arm
	again. They should be expecting
	someone in the UN uniform, in
	response to the note capsule. Unless
	the whole thing was a trap.</p>

	<p>“Keep up with me.” He turned
	toward David. “Don’t drop behind.”</p>

	<p>“With you?”</p>

	<p>“Up beside me! We’re close.
	We can’t take any chances. Come
	on.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll be all right.” David remained
	behind him, in the rear, a
	few paces away, still clutching
	his teddy bear.</p>

	<p>“Have it your way.” Hendricks
	raised his glasses again,
	suddenly tense. For a moment—had
	something moved? He scanned
	the ridge carefully. Everything
	was silent. Dead. No life up
	there, only tree trunks and ash.
	Maybe a few rats. The big black
	rats that had survived the claws.
	Mutants—built their own shelters
	out of saliva and ash. Some
	<a id="page115" title="115"> </a>kind of plaster. Adaptation. He
	started forward again.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>A tall figure came out on the
	ridge above him, cloak flapping.
	Gray-green. A Russian. Behind
	him a second soldier appeared,
	another Russian. Both lifted
	their guns, aiming.</p>

	<p>Hendricks froze. He opened
	his mouth. The soldiers were
	kneeling, sighting down the side
	of the slope. A third figure had
	joined them on the ridge top, a
	smaller figure in gray-green. A
	woman. She stood behind the
	other two.</p>

	<p>Hendricks found his voice.
	“Stop!” He waved up at them
	frantically. “I’m—”</p>

	<p>The two Russians fired. Behind
	Hendricks there was a faint
	<em>pop</em>. Waves of heat lapped
	against him, throwing him to the
	ground. Ash tore at his face,
	grinding into his eyes and nose.
	Choking, he pulled himself to his
	knees. It was all a trap. He was
	finished. He had come to be
	killed, like a steer. The soldiers
	and the woman were coming
	down the side of the ridge toward
	him, sliding down through
	the soft ash. Hendricks was
	numb. His head throbbed. Awkwardly,
	he got his rifle up and
	took aim. It weighed a thousand
	tons; he could hardly hold it. His
	nose and cheeks stung. The air
	was full of the blast smell, a
	bitter acrid stench.</p>

	<p>“Don’t fire,” the first Russian
	said, in heavily accented English.</p>

	<p>The three of them came up to
	him, surrounding him. “Put
	down your rifle, Yank,” the other
	said.</p>

	<p>Hendricks was dazed. Everything
	had happened so fast. He
	had been caught. And they had
	blasted the boy. He turned his
	head. David was gone. What remained
	of him was strewn across
	the ground.</p>

	<p>The three Russians studied
	him curiously. Hendricks sat,
	wiping blood from his nose,
	picking out bits of ash. He shook
	his head, trying to clear it. “Why
	did you do it?” he murmured
	thickly. “The boy.”</p>

	<p>“Why?” One of the soldiers
	helped him roughly to his feet.
	He turned Hendricks around.
	“Look.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks closed his eyes.</p>

	<p>“Look!” The two Russians
	pulled him forward. “See. Hurry
	up. There isn’t much time to
	spare, Yank!”</p>

	<p>Hendricks looked. And gasped.</p>

	<p>“See now? Now do you understand?”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>From the remains of David
	a metal wheel rolled. Relays,
	glinting metal. Parts, wiring.
	One of the Russians kicked at
	the heap of remains. Parts popped
	out, rolling away, wheels and
	<a id="page116" title="116"> </a>springs and rods. A plastic section
	fell in, half charred. Hendricks
	bent shakily down. The
	front of the head had come off.
	He could make out the intricate
	brain, wires and relays, tiny
	tubes and switches, thousands of
	minute studs—</p>

	<p>“A robot,” the soldier holding
	his arm said. “We watched it
	tagging you.”</p>

	<p>“Tagging me?”</p>

	<p>“That’s their way. They tag
	along with you. Into the bunker.
	That’s how they get in.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks blinked, dazed.
	“But—”</p>

	<p>“Come on.” They led him toward
	the ridge. “We can’t stay
	here. It isn’t safe. There must be
	hundreds of them all around
	here.”</p>

	<p>The three of them pulled him
	up the side of the ridge, sliding
	and slipping on the ash. The
	woman reached the top and stood
	waiting for them.</p>

	<p>“The forward command,” Hendricks
	muttered. “I came to negotiate
	with the Soviet—”</p>

	<p>“There is no more forward
	command. <em>They</em> got in. We’ll explain.”
	They reached the top of
	the ridge. “We’re all that’s left.
	The three of us. The rest were
	down in the bunker.”</p>

	<p>“This way. Down this way.”
	The woman unscrewed a lid, a
	gray manhole cover set in the
	ground. “Get in.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks lowered himself.
	The two soldiers and the woman
	came behind him, following him
	down the ladder. The woman
	closed the lid after them, bolting
	it tightly into place.</p>

	<p>“Good thing we saw you,” one
	of the two soldiers grunted. “It
	had tagged you about as far as
	it was going to.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>“Give me one of your cigarettes,”
	the woman said. “I
	haven’t had an American cigarette
	for weeks.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks pushed the pack to
	her. She took a cigarette and
	passed the pack to the two soldiers.
	In the corner of the small
	room the lamp gleamed fitfully.
	The room was low-ceilinged,
	cramped. The four of them sat
	around a small wood table. A few
	dirty dishes were stacked to one
	side. Behind a ragged curtain a
	second room was partly visible.
	Hendricks saw the corner of a
	cot, some blankets, clothes hung
	on a hook.</p>

	<p>“We were here,” the soldier
	beside him said. He took off his
	helmet, pushing his blond hair
	back. “I’m Corporal Rudi Maxer.
	Polish. Impressed in the Soviet
	Army two years ago.” He held
	out his hand.</p>

	<p>Hendricks hesitated and then
	shook. “Major Joseph Hendricks.”</p>

	<p>“Klaus Epstein.” The other
	<a id="page117" title="117"> </a>soldier shook with him, a small
	dark man with thinning hair.
	Epstein plucked nervously at his
	ear. “Austrian. Impressed God
	knows when. I don’t remember.
	The three of us were here, Rudi
	and I, with Tasso.” He indicated
	the woman. “That’s how we
	escaped. All the rest were down
	in the bunker.”</p>

	<p>“And—and <em>they</em> got in?”</p>

	<p>Epstein lit a cigarette. “First
	just one of them. The kind that
	tagged you. Then it let others
	in.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks became alert. “The
	<em>kind</em>? Are there more than one
	kind?”</p>

	<p>“The little boy. David. David
	holding his teddy bear. That’s
	Variety Three. The most effective.”</p>

	<p>“What are the other types?”</p>

	<p>Epstein reached into his coat.
	“Here.” He tossed a packet of
	photographs onto the table, tied
	with a string. “Look for yourself.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks untied the string.</p>

	<p>“You see,” Rudi Maxer said,
	“that was why we wanted to talk
	terms. The Russians, I mean.
	We found out about a week ago.
	Found out that your claws were
	beginning to make up new designs
	on their own. New types
	of their own. Better types.
	Down in your underground factories
	behind our lines. You let
	them stamp themselves, repair
	themselves. Made them more and
	more intricate. It’s your fault
	this happened.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks examined the
	photos. They had been snapped
	hurriedly; they were blurred
	and indistinct. The first few
	showed—David. David walking
	along a road, by himself. David
	and another David. Three
	Davids. All exactly alike. Each
	with a ragged teddy bear.</p>

	<p>All pathetic.</p>

	<p>“Look at the others,” Tasso
	said.</p>

	<p>The next pictures, taken at a
	great distance, showed a towering
	wounded soldier sitting by
	the side of a path, his arm in a
	sling, the stump of one leg extended,
	a crude crutch on his
	lap. Then two wounded soldiers,
	both the same, standing side by
	side.</p>

	<p>“That’s Variety One. The
	Wounded Soldier.” Klaus reached
	out and took the pictures.
	“You see, the claws were designed
	to get to human beings.
	To find them. Each kind was better
	than the last. They got
	farther, closer, past most of our
	defenses, into our lines. But as
	long as they were merely
	<em>machines</em>, metal spheres with
	claws and horns, feelers, they
	could be picked off like any other
	object. They could be detected as
	lethal robots as soon as they
	<a id="page118" title="118"> </a>were seen. Once we caught sight
	of them—”</p>

	<p>“Variety One subverted our
	whole north wing,” Rudi said.
	“It was a long time before anyone
	caught on. Then it was too
	late. They came in, wounded soldiers,
	knocking and begging to
	be let in. So we let them in. And
	as soon as they were in they took
	over. We were watching out for
	machines….”</p>

	<p>“At that time it was thought
	there was only the one type,”
	Klaus Epstein said. “No one
	suspected there were other types.
	The pictures were flashed to us.
	When the runner was sent to
	you, we knew of just one type.
	Variety One. The big Wounded
	Soldier. We thought that was
	all.”</p>

	<p>“Your line fell to—”</p>

	<p>“To Variety Three. David and
	his bear. That worked even better.”
	Klaus smiled bitterly.
	“Soldiers are suckers for children.
	We brought them in and
	tried to feed them. We found out
	the hard way what they were
	after. At least, those who were
	in the bunker.”</p>

	<p>“The three of us were lucky,”
	Rudi said. “Klaus and I were—were
	visiting Tasso when it happened.
	This is her place.” He
	waved a big hand around. “This
	little cellar. We finished and
	climbed the ladder to start back.
	From the ridge we saw. There
	they were, all around the bunker.
	Fighting was still going on.
	David and his bear. Hundreds of
	them. Klaus took the pictures.”</p>

	<p>Klaus tied up the photographs
	again.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>“And it’s going on all along
	your line?” Hendricks said.</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“How about <em>our</em> lines?” Without
	thinking, he touched the tab
	on his arm. “Can they—”</p>

	<p>“They’re not bothered by your
	radiation tabs. It makes no difference
	to them, Russian, American,
	Pole, German. It’s all the
	same. They’re doing what they
	were designed to do. Carrying
	out the original idea. They track
	down life, wherever they find it.”</p>

	<p>“They go by warmth,” Klaus
	said. “That was the way you
	constructed them from the very
	start. Of course, those you designed
	were kept back by the
	radiation tabs you wear. Now
	they’ve got around that. These
	new varieties are lead-lined.”</p>

	<p>“What’s the other variety?”
	Hendricks asked. “The David
	type, the Wounded Soldier—what’s
	the other?”</p>

	<p>“We don’t know.” Klaus pointed
	up at the wall. On the wall
	were two metal plates, ragged at
	the edges. Hendricks got up and
	studied them. They were bent
	and dented.</p>

	<p>“The one on the left came off
	<a id="page119" title="119"> </a>a Wounded Soldier,” Rudi said.
	“We got one of them. It was going
	along toward our old bunker.
	We got it from the ridge, the
	same way we got the David tagging
	you.”</p>

	<p>The plate was stamped: I-V.
	Hendricks touched the other
	plate. “And this came from the
	David type?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.” The plate was stamped:
	III-V.</p>

	<p>Klaus took a look at them,
	leaning over Hendricks’ broad
	shoulder. “You can see what
	we’re up against. There’s another
	type. Maybe it was abandoned.
	Maybe it didn’t work. But
	there must be a Second Variety.
	There’s One and Three.”</p>

	<p>“You were lucky,” Rudi said.
	“The David tagged you all the
	way here and never touched you.
	Probably thought you’d get it
	into a bunker, somewhere.”</p>

	<p>“One gets in and it’s all over,”
	Klaus said. “They move fast. One
	lets all the rest inside. They’re
	inflexible. Machines with one
	purpose. They were built for only
	one thing.” He rubbed sweat
	from his lip. “We saw.”</p>

	<p>They were silent.</p>

	<p>“Let me have another cigarette,
	Yank,” Tasso said. “They
	are good. I almost forgot how
	they were.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>It was night. The sky was
	black. No stars were visible
	through the rolling clouds of
	ash. Klaus lifted the lid cautiously
	so that Hendricks could
	look out.</p>

	<p>Rudi pointed into the darkness.
	“Over that way are the
	bunkers. Where we used to be.
	Not over half a mile from us. It
	was just chance Klaus and I
	were not there when it happened.
	Weakness. Saved by our
	lusts.”</p>

	<p>“All the rest must be dead,”
	Klaus said in a low voice. “It
	came quickly. This morning the
	Politburo reached their decision.
	They notified us—forward command.
	Our runner was sent out
	at once. We saw him start toward
	the direction of your lines.
	We covered him until he was out
	of sight.”</p>

	<p>“Alex Radrivsky. We both
	knew him. He disappeared about
	six o’clock. The sun had just
	come up. About noon Klaus and
	I had an hour relief. We crept
	off, away from the bunkers. No
	one was watching. We came
	here. There used to be a town
	here, a few houses, a street. This
	cellar was part of a big farmhouse.
	We knew Tasso would be
	here, hiding down in her little
	place. We had come here before.
	Others from the bunkers came
	here. Today happened to be our
	turn.”</p>

	<p>“So we were saved,” Klaus
	said. “Chance. It might have
	<a id="page120" title="120"> </a>been others. We—we finished,
	and then we came up to the surface
	and started back along the
	ridge. That was when we saw
	them, the Davids. We understood
	right away. We had seen
	the photos of the First Variety,
	the Wounded Soldier. Our Commissar
	distributed them to us
	with an explanation. If we had
	gone another step they would
	have seen us. As it was we had
	to blast two Davids before we
	got back. There were hundreds
	of them, all around. Like ants.
	We took pictures and slipped
	back here, bolting the lid tight.”</p>

	<p>“They’re not so much when
	you catch them alone. We moved
	faster than they did. But they’re
	inexorable. Not like living
	things. They came right at us.
	And we blasted them.”</p>

	<p>Major Hendricks rested
	against the edge of the lid, adjusting
	his eyes to the darkness.
	“Is it safe to have the lid up at
	all?”</p>

	<p>“If we’re careful. How else
	can you operate your transmitter?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks lifted the small belt
	transmitter slowly. He pressed it
	against his ear. The metal was
	cold and damp. He blew against
	the mike, raising up the short
	antenna. A faint hum sounded
	in his ear. “That’s true, I suppose.”</p>

	<p>But he still hesitated.</p>

	<p>“We’ll pull you under if anything
	happens,” Klaus said.</p>

	<p>“Thanks.” Hendricks waited a
	moment, resting the transmitter
	against his shoulder. “Interesting,
	isn’t it?”</p>

	<p>“What?”</p>

	<p>“This, the new types. The new
	varieties of claws. We’re completely
	at their mercy, aren’t
	we? By now they’ve probably
	gotten into the UN lines, too.
	It makes me wonder if we’re not
	seeing the beginning of a new
	species. <em>The</em> new species. Evolution.
	The race to come after
	man.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Rudi grunted. “There is no
	race after man.”</p>

	<p>“No? Why not? Maybe we’re
	seeing it now, the end of human
	beings, the beginning of the new
	society.”</p>

	<p>“They’re not a race. They’re
	mechanical killers. You made
	them to destroy. That’s all they
	can do. They’re machines with a
	job.”</p>

	<p>“So it seems now. But how
	about later on? After the war is
	over. Maybe, when there aren’t
	any humans to destroy, their
	real potentialities will begin to
	show.”</p>

	<p>“You talk as if they were
	alive!”</p>

	<p>“Aren’t they?”</p>

	<p>There was silence. “They’re
	machines,” Rudi said. “They
	<a id="page121" title="121"> </a>look like people, but they’re machines.”</p>

	<p>“Use your transmitter, Major,”
	Klaus said. “We can’t stay
	up here forever.”</p>

	<p>Holding the transmitter tightly
	Hendricks called the code of
	the command bunker. He waited,
	listening. No response. Only
	silence. He checked the leads
	carefully. Everything was in
	place.</p>

	<p>“Scott!” he said into the mike.
	“Can you hear me?”</p>

	<p>Silence. He raised the gain up
	full and tried again. Only static.</p>

	<p>“I don’t get anything. They
	may hear me but they may not
	want to answer.”</p>

	<p>“Tell them it’s an emergency.”</p>

	<p>“They’ll think I’m being
	forced to call. Under your direction.”
	He tried again, outlining
	briefly what he had learned. But
	still the phone was silent, except
	for the faint static.</p>

	<p>“Radiation pools kill most
	transmission,” Klaus said, after
	awhile. “Maybe that’s it.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks shut the transmitter
	up. “No use. No answer.
	Radiation pools? Maybe. Or they
	hear me, but won’t answer.
	Frankly, that’s what I would do,
	if a runner tried to call from the
	Soviet lines. They have no reason
	to believe such a story. They may
	hear everything I say—”</p>

	<p>“Or maybe it’s too late.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks nodded.</p>

	<p>“We better get the lid down,”
	Rudi said nervously. “We don’t
	want  to  take  unnecessary
	chances.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>They climbed slowly back
	down the tunnel. Klaus bolted
	the lid carefully into place. They
	descended into the kitchen. The
	air was heavy and close around
	them.</p>

	<p>“Could they work that fast?”
	Hendricks said. “I left the bunker
	this noon. Ten hours ago.
	How could they move so quickly?”</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t take them long.
	Not after the first one gets in.
	It goes wild. You know what the
	little claws can do. Even <em>one</em> of
	these is beyond belief. Razors,
	each finger. Maniacal.”</p>

	<p>“All right.” Hendricks moved
	away impatiently. He stood with
	his back to them.</p>

	<p>“What’s the matter?” Rudi
	said.</p>

	<p>“The Moon Base. God, if
	they’ve gotten there—”</p>

	<p>“The Moon Base?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks turned around.
	“They couldn’t have got to the
	Moon Base. How would they get
	there? It isn’t possible. I can’t
	believe it.”</p>

	<p>“What is this Moon Base?
	We’ve heard rumors, but nothing
	definite. What is the actual situation?
	You seem concerned.”</p>

	<p>“We’re supplied from the
	<a id="page122" title="122"> </a>moon. The governments are
	there, under the lunar surface.
	All our people and industries.
	That’s what keeps us going. If
	they should find some way of getting
	off Terra, onto the moon—”</p>

	<p>“It only takes one of them.
	Once the first one gets in it admits
	the others. Hundreds of
	them, all alike. You should have
	seen them. Identical. Like ants.”</p>

	<p>“Perfect socialism,” Tasso
	said. “The ideal of the communist
	state. All citizens interchangeable.”</p>

	<p>Klaus grunted angrily. “That’s
	enough. Well? What next?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks paced back and
	forth, around the small room.
	The air was full of smells of
	food and perspiration. The
	others watched him. Presently
	Tasso pushed through the curtain,
	into the other room. “I’m
	going to take a nap.”</p>

	<p>The curtain closed behind her.
	Rudi and Klaus sat down at the
	table, still watching Hendricks.</p>

	<p>“It’s up to you,” Klaus said. “We
	don’t know your situation.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks nodded.</p>

	<p>“It’s a problem.” Rudi drank
	some coffee, filling his cup from
	a rusty pot. “We’re safe here for
	awhile, but we can’t stay here
	forever. Not enough food or supplies.”</p>

	<p>“But if we go outside—”</p>

	<p>“If we go outside they’ll get
	us. Or probably they’ll get us.
	We couldn’t go very far. How
	far is your command bunker, Major?”</p>

	<p>“Three or four miles.”</p>

	<p>“We might make it. The four
	of us. Four of us could watch all
	sides. They couldn’t slip up behind
	us and start tagging us. We
	have three rifles, three blast
	rifles. Tasso can have my pistol.”
	Rudi tapped his belt. “In the Soviet
	army we didn’t have shoes
	always, but we had guns. With
	all four of us armed one of us
	might get to your command
	bunker. Preferably you, Major.”</p>

	<p>“What if they’re already
	there?” Klaus said.</p>

	<p>Rudi shrugged. “Well, then we
	come back here.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks stopped pacing.
	“What do you think the chances
	are they’re already in the American
	lines?”</p>

	<p>“Hard to say. Fairly good.
	They’re organized. They know
	exactly what they’re doing. Once
	they start they go like a horde
	of locusts. They have to keep
	moving, and fast. It’s secrecy
	and speed they depend on. Surprise.
	They push their way in
	before anyone has any idea.”</p>

	<p>“I see,” Hendricks murmured.</p>

	<p>From the other room Tasso
	stirred. “Major?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks pushed the curtain
	back. “What?”</p>

	<p><a href="https://renschler.github.io/2025/07/10/images/illo2.jpg"><img src="https://renschler.github.io/2025/07/10/images/illo2-sm.jpg" width="373" height="551" alt="A womanly body, but it has a robotic head, hand and arm showing."/></a>
	</p>

	<p>Tasso looked up at him lazily
	<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a> original location of illo2-->
	<a id="page124" title="124"> </a>from the cot. “Have you any
	more American cigarettes left?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks went into the room
	and sat down across from her,
	on a wood stool. He felt in his
	pockets. “No. All gone.”</p>

	<p>“Too bad.”</p>

	<p>“What nationality are you?”
	Hendricks asked after awhile.</p>

	<p>“Russian.”</p>

	<p>“How did you get here?”</p>

	<p>“Here?”</p>

	<p>“This used to be France. This
	was part of Normandy. Did you
	come with the Soviet army?”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“Just curious.” He studied her.
	She had taken off her coat, tossing
	it over the end of the cot.
	She was young, about twenty.
	Slim. Her long hair stretched
	out over the pillow. She was
	staring at him silently, her eyes
	dark and large.</p>

	<p>“What’s on your mind?” Tasso
	said.</p>

	<p>“Nothing. How old are you?”</p>

	<p>“Eighteen.” She continued to
	watch him, unblinking, her arms
	behind her head. She had on
	Russian army pants and shirt.
	Gray-green. Thick leather belt
	with counter and cartridges.
	Medicine kit.</p>

	<p>“You’re in the Soviet army?”</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“Where did you get the uniform?”</p>

	<p>She shrugged. “It was given
	to me,” she told him.</p>

	<p>“How—how old were you
	when you came here?”</p>

	<p>“Sixteen.”</p>

	<p>“That young?”</p>

	<p>Her eyes narrowed. “What do
	you mean?”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks rubbed his jaw.
	“Your life would have been a lot
	different if there had been no
	war. Sixteen. You came here at
	sixteen. To live this way.”</p>

	<p>“I had to survive.”</p>

	<p>“I’m not moralizing.”</p>

	<p>“Your life would have been
	different, too,” Tasso murmured.
	She reached down and unfastened
	one of her boots. She
	kicked the boot off, onto the floor.
	“Major, do you want to go in the
	other room? I’m sleepy.”</p>

	<p>“It’s going to be a problem, the
	four of us here. It’s going to be
	hard to live in these quarters.
	Are there just the two rooms?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“How big was the cellar originally?
	Was it larger than this?
	Are there other rooms filled up
	with debris? We might be able
	to open one of them.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps. I really don’t know.”
	Tasso loosened her belt. She
	made herself comfortable on the
	cot, unbuttoning her shirt.
	“You’re sure you have no more
	cigarettes?”</p>

	<p>“I had only the one pack.”</p>

	<p>“Too bad. Maybe if we get
	back to your bunker we can find
	<a id="page125" title="125"> </a>some.” The other boot fell. Tasso
	reached up for the light cord.
	“Good night.”</p>

	<p>“You’re going to sleep?”</p>

	<p>“That’s right.”</p>

	<p>The room plunged into darkness.
	Hendricks got up and
	made his way past the curtain,
	into the kitchen.</p>

	<p>And stopped, rigid.</p>

	<p>Rudi stood against the wall,
	his face white and gleaming. His
	mouth opened and closed but no
	sounds came. Klaus stood in
	front of him, the muzzle of his
	pistol in Rudi’s stomach. Neither
	of them moved. Klaus, his hand
	tight around his gun, his features
	set. Rudi, pale and silent,
	spread-eagled against the wall.</p>

	<p>“What—” Hendricks muttered,
	but Klaus cut him off.</p>

	<p>“Be quiet, Major. Come over
	here. Your gun. Get out your
	gun.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks drew his pistol.
	“What is it?”</p>

	<p>“Cover him.” Klaus motioned
	him forward. “Beside me.
	Hurry!”</p>

	<p>Rudi moved a little, lowering
	his arms. He turned to Hendricks,
	licking his lips. The
	whites of his eyes shone wildly.
	Sweat dripped from his forehead,
	down his cheeks. He fixed
	his gaze on Hendricks. “Major,
	he’s gone insane. Stop him.”
	Rudi’s voice was thin and hoarse,
	almost inaudible.</p>

	<p>“What’s going on?” Hendricks
	demanded.</p>

	<p>Without lowering his pistol
	Klaus answered. “Major, remember
	our discussion? The Three
	Varieties? We knew about One
	and Three. But we didn’t know
	about Two. At least, we didn’t
	know before.” Klaus’ fingers
	tightened around the gun butt.
	“We didn’t know before, but we
	know now.”</p>

	<p>He pressed the trigger. A
	burst of white heat rolled out of
	the gun, licking around Rudi.</p>

	<p>“Major, this is the Second
	Variety.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Tasso swept the curtain aside.
	“Klaus! What did you do?”</p>

	<p>Klaus turned from the charred
	form, gradually sinking down the
	wall onto the floor. “The Second
	Variety, Tasso. Now we know.
	We have all three types identified.
	The danger is less. I—”</p>

	<p>Tasso stared past him at the
	remains of Rudi, at the blackened,
	smouldering fragments
	and bits of cloth. “You killed
	him.”</p>

	<p>“Him? <em>It</em>, you mean. I was
	watching. I had a feeling, but I
	wasn’t sure. At least, I wasn’t
	sure before. But this evening I
	was certain.” Klaus rubbed his
	pistol butt nervously. “We’re
	lucky. Don’t you understand?
	Another hour and it might—”</p>

	<p>“You were <em>certain</em>?” Tasso
	<a id="page126" title="126"> </a>pushed past him and bent down,
	over the steaming remains on
	the floor. Her face became hard.
	“Major, see for yourself. Bones.
	Flesh.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks bent down beside
	her. The remains were human remains.
	Seared flesh, charred
	bone fragments, part of a skull.
	Ligaments, viscera, blood. Blood
	forming a pool against the wall.</p>

	<p>“No wheels,” Tasso said calmly.
	She straightened up. “No
	wheels, no parts, no relays. Not
	a claw. Not the Second Variety.”
	She folded her arms. “You’re going
	to have to be able to explain
	this.”</p>

	<p>Klaus sat down at the table,
	all the color drained suddenly
	from his face. He put his head
	in his hands and rocked back and
	forth.</p>

	<p>“Snap out of it.” Tasso’s fingers
	closed over his shoulder.
	“Why did you do it? Why did
	you kill him?”</p>

	<p>“He was frightened,” Hendricks
	said. “All this, the whole
	thing, building up around us.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe.”</p>

	<p>“What, then? What do you
	think?”</p>

	<p>“I think he may have had a
	reason for killing Rudi. A good
	reason.”</p>

	<p>“What reason?”</p>

	<p>“Maybe Rudi learned something.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks studied her bleak
	face. “About what?” he asked.</p>

	<p>“About him. About Klaus.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Klaus looked up quickly. “You
	can see what she’s trying to say.
	She thinks I’m the Second Variety.
	Don’t you see, Major? Now
	she wants you to believe I killed
	him on purpose. That I’m—”</p>

	<p>“Why did you kill him, then?”
	Tasso said.</p>

	<p>“I told you.” Klaus shook his
	head wearily. “I thought he was
	a claw. I thought I knew.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“I had been watching him. I
	was suspicious.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“I thought I had seen something.
	Heard something. I
	thought I—” He stopped.</p>

	<p>“Go on.”</p>

	<p>“We were sitting at the table.
	Playing cards. You two were in
	the other room. It was silent. I
	thought I heard him—<em>whirr</em>.”</p>

	<p>There was silence.</p>

	<p>“Do you believe that?” Tasso
	said to Hendricks.</p>

	<p>“Yes. I believe what he says.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t. I think he killed Rudi
	for a good purpose.” Tasso
	touched the rifle, resting in the
	corner of the room. “Major—”</p>

	<p>“No.” Hendricks shook his
	head. “Let’s stop it right now.
	One is enough. We’re afraid, the
	way he was. If we kill him we’ll
	be doing what he did to Rudi.”</p>

	<p>Klaus looked gratefully up at
	<a id="page127" title="127"> </a>him. “Thanks. I was afraid. You
	understand, don’t you? Now
	she’s afraid, the way I was. She
	wants to kill me.”</p>

	<p>“No more killing.” Hendricks
	moved toward the end of the ladder.
	“I’m going above and try
	the transmitter once more. If I
	can’t get them we’re moving back
	toward my lines tomorrow morning.”</p>

	<p>Klaus rose quickly. “I’ll come
	up with you and give you a
	hand.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The night air was cold. The
	earth was cooling off. Klaus
	took a deep breath, filling his
	lungs. He and Hendricks stepped
	onto the ground, out of the tunnel.
	Klaus planted his feet wide
	apart, the rifle up, watching and
	listening. Hendricks crouched by
	the tunnel mouth, tuning the
	small transmitter.</p>

	<p>“Any luck?” Klaus asked
	presently.</p>

	<p>“Not yet.”</p>

	<p>“Keep trying. Tell them what
	happened.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks kept trying. Without
	success. Finally he lowered
	the antenna. “It’s useless. They
	can’t hear me. Or they hear me
	and won’t answer. Or—”</p>

	<p>“Or they don’t exist.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll try once more.” Hendricks
	raised the antenna. “Scott, can
	you hear me? Come in!”</p>

	<p>He listened. There was only
	static. Then, still very faintly—</p>

	<p>“This is Scott.”</p>

	<p>His fingers tightened. “Scott!
	Is it you?”</p>

	<p>“This is Scott.”</p>

	<p>Klaus squatted down. “Is it
	your command?”</p>

	<p>“Scott, listen. Do you understand?
	About them, the claws.
	Did you get my message? Did
	you hear me?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.” Faintly. Almost inaudible.
	He could hardly make
	out the word.</p>

	<p>“You got my message? Is
	everything all right at the bunker?
	None of them have got in?”</p>

	<p>“Everything is all right.”</p>

	<p>“Have they tried to get in?”</p>

	<p>The voice was weaker.</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks turned to Klaus.
	“They’re all right.”</p>

	<p>“Have they been attacked?”</p>

	<p>“No.” Hendricks pressed the
	phone tighter to his ear. “Scott,
	I can hardly hear you. Have you
	notified the Moon Base? Do they
	know? Are they alerted?”</p>

	<p>No answer.</p>

	<p>“Scott! Can you hear me?”</p>

	<p>Silence.</p>

	<p>Hendricks relaxed, sagging.
	“Faded out. Must be radiation
	pools.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks and Klaus looked at
	each other. Neither of them said
	anything. After a time Klaus
	said, “Did it sound like any of
	<a id="page128" title="128"> </a>your men? Could you identify
	the voice?”</p>

	<p>“It was too faint.”</p>

	<p>“You couldn’t be certain?”</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“Then it could have been—”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know. Now I’m not
	sure. Let’s go back down and get
	the lid closed.”</p>

	<p>They climbed back down the
	ladder slowly, into the warm cellar.
	Klaus bolted the lid behind
	them. Tasso waited for them, her
	face expressionless.</p>

	<p>“Any luck?” she asked.</p>

	<p>Neither of them answered.
	“Well?” Klaus said at last.
	“What do you think, Major? Was
	it your officer, or was it one of
	<em>them</em>?”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

	<p>“Then we’re just where we
	were before.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks stared down at the
	floor, his jaw set. “We’ll have to
	go. To be sure.”</p>

	<p>“Anyhow, we have food here
	for only a few weeks. We’d have
	to go up after that, in any case.”</p>

	<p>“Apparently so.”</p>

	<p>“What’s wrong?” Tasso demanded.
	“Did you get across to
	your bunker? What’s the matter?”</p>

	<p>“It may have been one of my
	men,” Hendricks said slowly. “Or
	it may have been one of <em>them</em>.
	But we’ll never know standing
	here.” He examined his watch.
	“Let’s turn in and get some
	sleep. We want to be up early
	tomorrow.”</p>

	<p>“Early?”</p>

	<p>“Our best chance to get
	through the claws should be
	early in the morning,” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The morning was crisp and
	clear. Major Hendricks studied
	the countryside through his fieldglasses.</p>

	<p>“See anything?” Klaus said.</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“Can you make out our bunkers?”</p>

	<p>“Which way?”</p>

	<p>“Here.” Klaus took the glasses
	and adjusted them. “I know
	where to look.” He looked a long
	time, silently.</p>

	<p>Tasso came to the top of the
	tunnel and stepped up onto the
	ground. “Anything?”</p>

	<p>“No.” Klaus passed the glasses
	back to Hendricks. “They’re out
	of sight. Come on. Let’s not stay
	here.”</p>

	<p>The three of them made their
	way down the side of the ridge,
	sliding in the soft ash. Across a
	flat rock a lizard scuttled. They
	stopped instantly, rigid.</p>

	<p>“What was it?” Klaus muttered.</p>

	<p>“A lizard.”</p>

	<p>The lizard ran on, hurrying
	through the ash. It was exactly
	the same color as the ash.</p>

	<p>“Perfect adaptation,” Klaus
	<a id="page129" title="129"> </a>said. “Proves we were right.
	Lysenko, I mean.”</p>

	<p>They reached the bottom of
	the ridge and stopped, standing
	close together, looking around
	them.</p>

	<p>“Let’s go.” Hendricks started
	off. “It’s a good long trip, on
	foot.”</p>

	<p>Klaus fell in beside him. Tasso
	walked behind, her pistol held
	alertly. “Major, I’ve been meaning
	to ask you something,” Klaus
	said. “How did you run across
	the David? The one that was
	tagging you.”</p>

	<p>“I met it along the way. In
	some ruins.”</p>

	<p>“What did it say?”</p>

	<p>“Not much. It said it was
	alone. By itself.”</p>

	<p>“You couldn’t tell it was a
	machine? It talked like a living
	person? You never suspected?”</p>

	<p>“It didn’t say much. I noticed
	nothing unusual.</p>

	<p>“It’s strange, machines so
	much like people that you can be
	fooled. Almost alive. I wonder
	where it’ll end.”</p>

	<p>“They’re doing what you
	Yanks designed them to do,”
	Tasso said. “You designed them
	to hunt out life and destroy. Human
	life. Wherever they find it.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks was watching Klaus
	intently. “Why did you ask me?
	What’s on your mind?”</p>

	<p>“Nothing,” Klaus answered.</p>

	<p>“Klaus thinks you’re the Second
	Variety,” Tasso said calmly,
	from behind them. “Now he’s
	got his eye on you.”</p>

	<p>Klaus flushed. “Why not? We
	sent a runner to the Yank lines
	and he comes back. Maybe he
	thought he’d find some good
	game here.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks laughed harshly. “I
	came from the UN bunkers.
	There were human beings all
	around me.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe you saw an opportunity
	to get into the Soviet
	lines. Maybe you saw your
	chance. Maybe you—”</p>

	<p>“The Soviet lines had already
	been taken over. Your lines had
	been invaded before I left my
	command bunker. Don’t forget
	that.”</p>

	<p>Tasso came up beside him.
	“That proves nothing at all,
	Major.”</p>

	<p>“Why not?”</p>

	<p>“There appears to be little
	communication between the varieties.
	Each is made in a different
	factory. They don’t seem to
	work together. You might have
	started for the Soviet lines without
	knowing anything about the
	work of the other varieties. Or
	even what the other varieties
	were like.”</p>

	<p>“How do you know so much
	about the claws?” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>“I’ve seen them. I’ve observed
	<a id="page130" title="130"> </a>them. I observed them take over
	the Soviet bunkers.”</p>

	<p>“You know quite a lot,” Klaus
	said. “Actually, you saw very
	little. Strange that you should
	have been such an acute observer.”</p>

	<p>Tasso laughed. “Do you suspect
	me, now?”</p>

	<p>“Forget it,” Hendricks said.
	They walked on in silence.</p>

	<p>“Are we going the whole way
	on foot?” Tasso said, after
	awhile. “I’m not used to walking.”
	She gazed around at the
	plain of ash, stretching out on
	all sides of them, as far as they
	could see. “How dreary.”</p>

	<p>“It’s like this all the way,”
	Klaus said.</p>

	<p>“In a way I wish you had been
	in your bunker when the attack
	came.”</p>

	<p>“Somebody else would have
	been with you, if not me,” Klaus
	muttered.</p>

	<p>Tasso laughed, putting her
	hands in her pockets. “I suppose
	so.”</p>

	<p>They walked on, keeping their
	eyes on the vast plain of silent
	ash around them.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The sun was setting. Hendricks
	made his way forward
	slowly, waving Tasso and Klaus
	back. Klaus squatted down, resting
	his gun butt against the
	ground.</p>

	<p>Tasso found a concrete slab
	and sat down with a sigh. “It’s
	good to rest.”</p>

	<p>“Be quiet,” Klaus said sharply.</p>

	<p>Hendricks pushed up to the
	top of the rise ahead of them.
	The same rise the Russian runner
	had come up, the day before.
	Hendricks dropped down,
	stretching himself out, peering
	through his glasses at what lay
	beyond.</p>

	<p>Nothing was visible. Only ash
	and occasional trees. But there,
	not more than fifty yards ahead,
	was the entrance of the forward
	command bunker. The bunker
	from which he had come. Hendricks
	watched silently. No motion.
	No sign of life. Nothing
	stirred.</p>

	<p>Klaus slithered up beside him.
	“Where is it?”</p>

	<p>“Down there.” Hendricks passed
	him the glasses. Clouds of ash
	rolled across the evening sky.
	The world was darkening. They
	had a couple of hours of light
	left, at the most. Probably not
	that much.</p>

	<p>“I don’t see anything,” Klaus
	said.</p>

	<p>“That tree there. The stump.
	By the pile of bricks. The entrance
	is to the right of the
	bricks.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll have to take your word
	for it.”</p>

	<p>“You and Tasso cover me from
	here. You’ll be able to sight all
	the way to the bunker entrance.”</p>

	<p><a id="page131" title="131"> </a>“You’re going down alone?”</p>

	<p>“With my wrist tab I’ll be
	safe. The ground around the
	bunker is a living field of claws.
	They collect down in the ash.
	Like crabs. Without tabs you
	wouldn’t have a chance.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe you’re right.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll walk slowly all the way.
	As soon as I know for certain—”</p>

	<p>“If they’re down inside the
	bunker you won’t be able to get
	back up here. They go fast. You
	don’t realize.”</p>

	<p>“What do you suggest?”</p>

	<p>Klaus considered. “I don’t
	know. Get them to come up to the
	surface. So you can see.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks brought his transmitter
	from his belt, raising the
	antenna. “Let’s get started.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Klaus signalled to Tasso. She
	crawled expertly up the side of
	the rise to where they were
	sitting.</p>

	<p>“He’s going down alone,”
	Klaus said. “We’ll cover him
	from here. As soon as you see
	him start back, fire past him at
	once. They come quick.”</p>

	<p>“You’re not very optimistic,”
	Tasso said.</p>

	<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks opened the breech
	of his gun, checking it carefully.
	“Maybe things are all right.”</p>

	<p>“You didn’t see them. Hundreds
	of them. All the same.
	Pouring out like ants.”</p>

	<p>“I should be able to find out
	without going down all the way.”
	Hendricks locked his gun, gripping
	it in one hand, the transmitter
	in the other. “Well, wish
	me luck.”</p>

	<p>Klaus put out his hand. “Don’t
	go down until you’re sure. Talk
	to them from up here. Make them
	show themselves.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks stood up. He stepped
	down the side of the rise.</p>

	<p>A moment later he was walking
	slowly toward the pile of
	bricks and debris beside the dead
	tree stump. Toward the entrance
	of the forward command bunker.</p>

	<p>Nothing stirred. He raised the
	transmitter, clicking it on.
	“Scott? Can you hear me?”</p>

	<p>Silence.</p>

	<p>“Scott! This is Hendricks. Can
	you hear me? I’m standing outside
	the bunker. You should be
	able to see me in the view sight.”</p>

	<p>He listened, the transmitter
	gripped tightly. No sound. Only
	static. He walked forward. A
	claw burrowed out of the ash
	and raced toward him. It halted
	a few feet away and then slunk
	off. A second claw appeared, one
	of the big ones with feelers. It
	moved toward him, studied him
	intently, and then fell in behind
	him, dogging respectfully after
	him, a few paces away. A moment
	later a second big claw
	joined it. Silently, the claws
	<a id="page132" title="132"> </a>trailed him, as he walked slowly
	toward the bunker.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stopped, and behind
	him, the claws came to a halt. He
	was close, now. Almost to the
	bunker steps.</p>

	<p>“Scott! Can you hear me?
	I’m standing right above you.
	Outside. On the surface. Are
	you picking me up?”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>He waited, holding his gun
	against his side, the transmitter
	tightly to his ear. Time passed.
	He strained to hear, but there
	was only silence. Silence, and
	faint static.</p>

	<p>Then, distantly, metallically—</p>

	<p>“This is Scott.”</p>

	<p>The voice was neutral. Cold.
	He could not identify it. But the
	earphone was minute.</p>

	<p>“Scott! Listen. I’m standing
	right above you. I’m on the surface,
	looking down into the bunker
	entrance.”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“Can you see me?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“Through the view sight? You
	have the sight trained on me?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks pondered. A circle
	of claws waited quietly around
	him, gray-metal bodies on all
	sides of him. “Is everything all
	right in the bunker? Nothing
	unusual has happened?”</p>

	<p>“Everything is all right.”</p>

	<p>“Will you come up to the surface?
	I want to see you for a
	moment.” Hendricks took a deep
	breath. “Come up here with me.
	I want to talk to you.”</p>

	<p>“Come down.”</p>

	<p>“I’m giving you an order.”</p>

	<p>Silence.</p>

	<p>“Are you coming?” Hendricks
	listened. There was no response.
	“I order you to come to the surface.”</p>

	<p>“Come down.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks set his jaw. “Let me
	talk to Leone.”</p>

	<p>There was a long pause. He
	listened to the static. Then a
	voice came, hard, thin, metallic.
	The same as the other. “This is
	Leone.”</p>

	<p>“Hendricks. I’m on the surface.
	At the bunker entrance. I
	want one of you to come up
	here.”</p>

	<p>“Come down.”</p>

	<p>“Why come down? I’m giving
	you an order!”</p>

	<p>Silence. Hendricks lowered the
	transmitter. He looked carefully
	around him. The entrance was
	just ahead. Almost at his feet.
	He lowered the antenna and fastened
	the transmitter to his belt.
	Carefully, he gripped his gun
	with both hands. He moved forward,
	a step at a time. If they
	could see him they knew he was
	starting toward the entrance. He
	closed his eyes a moment.</p>

	<p>Then he put his foot on the
	first step that led downward.</p>

	<p><a id="page133" title="133"> </a>Two Davids came up at him,
	their faces identical and expressionless.
	He blasted them into
	particles. More came rushing
	silently up, a whole pack of
	them. All exactly the same.</p>

	<p>Hendricks turned and raced
	back, away from the bunker,
	back toward the rise.</p>

	<p>At the top of the rise Tasso
	and Klaus were firing down. The
	small claws were already streaking
	up toward them, shining
	metal spheres going fast, racing
	frantically through the ash. But
	he had no time to think about
	that. He knelt down, aiming at
	the bunker entrance, gun against
	his cheek. The Davids were
	coming out in groups, clutching
	their teddy bears, their thin
	knobby legs pumping as they ran
	up the steps to the surface. Hendricks
	fired into the main body
	of them. They burst apart,
	wheels and springs flying in all
	directions. He fired again
	through the mist of particles.</p>

	<p>A giant lumbering figure rose
	up in the bunker entrance, tall
	and swaying. Hendricks paused,
	amazed. A man, a soldier. With
	one leg, supporting himself with
	a crutch.</p>

	<p>“Major!” Tasso’s voice came.
	More firing. The huge figure
	moved forward, Davids swarming
	around it. Hendricks broke
	out of his freeze. The First
	Variety. The Wounded Soldier.</p>

	<p>He aimed and fired. The soldier
	burst into bits, parts and relays
	flying. Now many Davids were
	out on the flat ground, away from
	the bunker. He fired again and
	again, moving slowly back, half-crouching
	and aiming.</p>

	<p>From the rise, Klaus fired
	down. The side of the rise was
	alive with claws making their
	way up. Hendricks retreated toward
	the rise, running and
	crouching. Tasso had left Klaus
	and was circling slowly to the
	right, moving away from the
	rise.</p>

	<p>A David slipped up toward
	him, its small white face expressionless,
	brown hair hanging
	down in its eyes. It bent over
	suddenly, opening its arms. Its
	teddy bear hurtled down and
	leaped across the ground, bounding
	toward him. Hendricks fired.
	The bear and the David both
	dissolved. He grinned, blinking.
	It was like a dream.</p>

	<p>“Up here!” Tasso’s voice.
	Hendricks made his way toward
	her. She was over by some columns
	of concrete, walls of a
	ruined building. She was firing
	past him, with the hand pistol
	Klaus had given her.</p>

	<p>“Thanks.” He joined her,
	grasping for breath. She pulled
	him back, behind the concrete,
	fumbling at her belt.</p>

	<p>“Close your eyes!” She unfastened
	a globe from her waist.
	<a id="page134" title="134"> </a>Rapidly, she unscrewed the cap,
	locking it into place. “Close your
	eyes and get down.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>She threw the bomb. It sailed
	in an arc, an expert, rolling
	and bouncing to the entrance of
	the bunker. Two Wounded Soldiers
	stood uncertainly by the
	brick pile. More Davids poured
	from behind them, out onto
	the plain. One of the Wounded
	Soldiers moved toward the bomb,
	stooping awkwardly down to pick
	it up.</p>

	<p>The bomb went off. The concussion
	whirled Hendricks
	around, throwing him on his
	face. A hot wind rolled over him.
	Dimly he saw Tasso standing
	behind the columns, firing slowly
	and methodically at the Davids
	coming out of the raging clouds
	of white fire.</p>

	<p>Back along the rise Klaus
	struggled with a ring of claws
	circling around him. He retreated,
	blasting at them and
	moving back, trying to break
	through the ring.</p>

	<p>Hendricks struggled to his
	feet. His head ached. He could
	hardly see. Everything was licking
	at him, raging and whirling.
	His right arm would not move.</p>

	<p>Tasso pulled back toward him.
	“Come on. Let’s go.”</p>

	<p>“Klaus—He’s still up there.”</p>

	<p>“Come on!” Tasso dragged
	Hendricks back, away from the
	columns. Hendricks shook his
	head, trying to clear it. Tasso
	led him rapidly away, her eyes
	intense and bright, watching for
	claws that had escaped the blast.</p>

	<p>One David came out of the
	rolling clouds of flame. Tasso
	blasted it. No more appeared.</p>

	<p>“But Klaus. What about him?”
	Hendricks stopped, standing unsteadily.
	“He—”</p>

	<p>“Come on!”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>They retreated, moving
	farther and farther away from
	the bunker. A few small claws
	followed them for a little while
	and then gave up, turning back
	and going off.</p>

	<p>At last Tasso stopped. “We can
	stop here and get our breaths.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks sat down on some
	heaps of debris. He wiped his
	neck, gasping. “We left Klaus
	back there.”</p>

	<p>Tasso said nothing. She opened
	her gun, sliding a fresh round of
	blast cartridges into place.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stared at her, dazed.
	“You left him back there on
	purpose.”</p>

	<p>Tasso snapped the gun together.
	She studied the heaps of
	rubble around them, her face expressionless.
	As if she were
	watching for something.</p>

	<p>“What is it?” Hendricks demanded.
	“What are you looking
	for? Is something coming?” He
	<a id="page135" title="135"> </a>shook his head, trying to understand.
	What was she doing?
	What was she waiting for? He
	could see nothing. Ash lay all
	around them, ash and ruins.
	Occasional stark tree trunks,
	without leaves or branches.
	“What—”</p>

	<p>Tasso cut him off. “Be still.”
	Her eyes narrowed. Suddenly her
	gun came up. Hendricks turned,
	following her gaze.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Back the way they had come
	a figure appeared. The figure
	walked unsteadily toward them.
	Its clothes were torn. It limped
	as it made its way along, going
	very slowly and carefully. Stopping
	now and then, resting and
	getting its strength. Once it almost
	fell. It stood for a moment,
	trying to steady itself. Then it
	came on.</p>

	<p>Klaus.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stood up. “Klaus!”
	He started toward him. “How
	the hell did you—”</p>

	<p>Tasso fired. Hendricks swung
	back. She fired again, the blast
	passing him, a searing line of
	heat. The beam caught Klaus in
	the chest. He exploded, gears and
	wheels flying. For a moment he
	continued to walk. Then he swayed
	back and forth. He crashed
	to the ground, his arms flung out.
	A few more wheels rolled away.</p>

	<p>Silence.</p>

	<p>Tasso turned to Hendricks.
	“Now you understand why he
	killed Rudi.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks sat down again
	slowly. He shook his head. He
	was numb. He could not think.</p>

	<p>“Do you see?” Tasso said. “Do
	you understand?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks said nothing.
	Everything was slipping away
	from him, faster and faster.
	Darkness, rolling and plucking at
	him.</p>

	<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks opened his eyes
	slowly. His body ached all over.
	He tried to sit up but needles of
	pain shot through his arm and
	shoulder. He gasped.</p>

	<p>“Don’t try to get up,” Tasso
	said. She bent down, putting
	her cold hand against his forehead.</p>

	<p>It was night. A few stars
	glinted above, shining through
	the drifting clouds of ash. Hendricks
	lay back, his teeth locked.
	Tasso watched him impassively.
	She had built a fire with some
	wood and weeds. The fire licked
	feebly, hissing at a metal cup
	suspended over it. Everything
	was silent. Unmoving darkness,
	beyond the fire.</p>

	<p>“So he was the Second Variety,”
	Hendricks murmured.</p>

	<p>“I had always thought so.”</p>

	<p>“Why didn’t you destroy him
	<a id="page136" title="136"> </a>sooner?” he wanted to know.</p>

	<p>“You held me back.” Tasso
	crossed to the fire to look into
	the metal cup. “Coffee. It’ll be
	ready to drink in awhile.”</p>

	<p>She came back and sat down
	beside him. Presently she opened
	her pistol and began to disassemble
	the firing mechanism, studying
	it intently.</p>

	<p>“This is a beautiful gun,”
	Tasso said, half-aloud. “The construction
	is superb.”</p>

	<p>“What about them? The
	claws.”</p>

	<p>“The concussion from the
	bomb put most of them out of
	action. They’re delicate. Highly
	organized, I suppose.”</p>

	<p>“The Davids, too?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“How did you happen to have a
	bomb like that?”</p>

	<p>Tasso shrugged. “We designed
	it. You shouldn’t underestimate
	our technology, Major. Without
	such a bomb you and I would no
	longer exist.”</p>

	<p>“Very useful.”</p>

	<p>Tasso stretched out her legs,
	warming her feet in the heat of
	the fire. “It surprised me that
	you did not seem to understand,
	after he killed Rudi. Why did
	you think he—”</p>

	<p>“I told you. I thought he was
	afraid.”</p>

	<p>“Really? You know, Major, for
	a little while I suspected you.
	Because you wouldn’t let me kill
	him. I thought you might be protecting
	him.” She laughed.</p>

	<p>“Are we safe here?” Hendricks
	asked presently.</p>

	<p>“For awhile. Until they get
	reinforcements from some other
	area.” Tasso began to clean the
	interior of the gun with a bit of
	rag. She finished and pushed the
	mechanism back into place. She
	closed the gun, running her
	finger along the barrel.</p>

	<p>“We were lucky,” Hendricks
	murmured.</p>

	<p>“Yes. Very lucky.”</p>

	<p>“Thanks for pulling me away.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Tasso did not answer. She
	glanced up at him, her eyes
	bright in the fire light. Hendricks
	examined his arm. He
	could not move his fingers. His
	whole side seemed numb. Down
	inside him was a dull steady
	ache.</p>

	<p>“How do you feel?” Tasso
	asked.</p>

	<p>“My arm is damaged.”</p>

	<p>“Anything else?”</p>

	<p>“Internal injuries.”</p>

	<p>“You didn’t get down when the
	bomb went off.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks said nothing. He
	watched Tasso pour the coffee
	from the cup into a flat metal
	pan. She brought it over to him.</p>

	<p>“Thanks.” He struggled up
	enough to drink. It was hard to
	swallow. His insides turned over
	and he pushed the pan away.
	<a id="page137" title="137"> </a>“That’s all I can drink now.”</p>

	<p>Tasso drank the rest. Time
	passed. The clouds of ash moved
	across the dark sky above them.
	Hendricks rested, his mind
	blank. After awhile he became
	aware that Tasso was standing
	over him, gazing down at him.</p>

	<p>“What is it?” he murmured.</p>

	<p>“Do you feel any better?”</p>

	<p>“Some.”</p>

	<p>“You know, Major, if I hadn’t
	dragged you away they would
	have got you. You would be
	dead. Like Rudi.”</p>

	<p>“I know.”</p>

	<p>“Do you want to know why I
	brought you out? I could have
	left you. I could have left you
	there.”</p>

	<p>“Why did you bring me out?”</p>

	<p>“Because we have to get away
	from here.” Tasso stirred the
	fire with a stick, peering calmly
	down into it. “No human being
	can live here. When their reinforcements
	come we won’t have
	a chance. I’ve pondered about it
	while you were unconscious. We
	have perhaps three hours before
	they come.”</p>

	<p>“And you expect me to get us
	away?”</p>

	<p>“That’s right. I expect you to
	get us out of here.”</p>

	<p>“Why me?”</p>

	<p>“Because I don’t know any
	way.” Her eyes shone at him in
	the half-light, bright and steady.
	“If you can’t get us out of here
	they’ll kill us within three hours.
	I see nothing else ahead. Well,
	Major? What are you going to
	do? I’ve been waiting all night.
	While you were unconscious I sat
	here, waiting and listening. It’s
	almost dawn. The night is almost
	over.”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks considered. “It’s
	curious,” he said at last.</p>

	<p>“Curious?”</p>

	<p>“That you should think I can
	get us out of here. I wonder
	what you think I can do.”</p>

	<p>“Can you get us to the Moon
	Base?”</p>

	<p>“The Moon Base? How?”</p>

	<p>“There must be some way.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks shook his head.
	“No. There’s no way that I know
	of.”</p>

	<p>Tasso said nothing. For a moment
	her steady gaze wavered.
	She ducked her head, turning
	abruptly away. She scrambled to
	her feet. “More coffee?”</p>

	<p>“No.”</p>

	<p>“Suit yourself.” Tasso drank
	silently. He could not see her
	face. He lay back against the
	ground, deep in thought, trying
	to concentrate. It was hard to
	think. His head still hurt. And
	the numbing daze still hung over
	him.</p>

	<p>“There might be one way,” he
	said suddenly.</p>

	<p>“Oh?”</p>

	<p>“How soon is dawn?”</p>

	<p><a id="page138" title="138"> </a>“Two hours. The sun will be
	coming up shortly.”</p>

	<p>“There’s supposed to be a ship
	near here. I’ve never seen it. But
	I know it exists.”</p>

	<p>“What kind of a ship?” Her
	voice was sharp.</p>

	<p>“A rocket cruiser.”</p>

	<p>“Will it take us off? To the
	Moon Base?”</p>

	<p>“It’s supposed to. In case of
	emergency.” He rubbed his forehead.</p>

	<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

	<p>“My head. It’s hard to think.
	I can hardly—hardly concentrate.
	The bomb.”</p>

	<p>“Is the ship near here?” Tasso
	slid over beside him, settling
	down on her haunches. “How far
	is it? Where is it?”</p>

	<p>“I’m trying to think.”</p>

	<p>Her fingers dug into his arm.
	“Nearby?” Her voice was like
	iron. “Where would it be?
	Would they store it underground?
	Hidden underground?”</p>

	<p>“Yes. In a storage locker.”</p>

	<p>“How do we find it? Is it
	marked? Is there a code marker
	to identify it?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks concentrated. “No.
	No markings. No code symbol.”</p>

	<p>“What, then?”</p>

	<p>“A sign.”</p>

	<p>“What sort of sign?”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Hendricks did not answer. In
	the flickering light his eyes were
	glazed, two sightless orbs.
	Tasso’s fingers dug into his arm.</p>

	<p>“What sort of sign? What is
	it?”</p>

	<p>“I—I can’t think. Let me
	rest.”</p>

	<p>“All right.” She let go and
	stood up. Hendricks lay back
	against the ground, his eyes
	closed. Tasso walked away from
	him, her hands in her pockets.
	She kicked a rock out of her way
	and stood staring up at the sky.
	The night blackness was already
	beginning to fade into gray.
	Morning was coming.</p>

	<p>Tasso gripped her pistol and
	walked around the fire in a circle,
	back and forth. On the ground
	Major Hendricks lay, his eyes
	closed, unmoving. The grayness
	rose in the sky, higher and
	higher. The landscape became
	visible, fields of ash stretching
	out in all directions. Ash and
	ruins of buildings, a wall here
	and there, heaps of concrete, the
	naked trunk of a tree.</p>

	<p>The air was cold and sharp.
	Somewhere a long way off a bird
	made a few bleak sounds.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stirred. He opened
	his eyes. “Is it dawn? Already?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks sat up a little. “You
	wanted to know something. You
	were asking me.”</p>

	<p>“Do you remember now?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“What is it?” She tensed.
	“What?” she repeated sharply.</p>

	<p><a id="page139" title="139"> </a>“A well. A ruined well. It’s in
	a storage locker under a well.”</p>

	<p>“A well.” Tasso relaxed.
	“Then we’ll find a well.” She
	looked at her watch. “We have
	about an hour, Major. Do you
	think we can find it in an hour?”</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>“Give me a hand up,” Hendricks
	said.</p>

	<p>Tasso put her pistol away and
	helped him to his feet. “This is
	going to be difficult.”</p>

	<p>“Yes it is.” Hendricks set his
	lips tightly. “I don’t think we’re
	going to go very far.”</p>

	<p>They began to walk. The early
	sun cast a little warmth down on
	them. The land was flat and barren,
	stretching out gray and lifeless
	as far as they could see. A
	few birds sailed silently, far
	above them, circling slowly.</p>

	<p>“See anything?” Hendricks
	said. “Any claws?”</p>

	<p>“No. Not yet.”</p>

	<p>They passed through some
	ruins, upright concrete and
	bricks. A cement foundation.
	Rats scuttled away. Tasso
	jumped back warily.</p>

	<p>“This used to be a town,” Hendricks
	said. “A village. Provincial
	village. This was all grape
	country, once. Where we are
	now.”</p>

	<p>They came onto a ruined
	street, weeds and cracks criss-crossing
	it. Over to the right a
	stone chimney stuck up.</p>

	<p>“Be careful,” he warned her.</p>

	<p>A pit yawned, an open basement.
	Ragged ends of pipes jutted
	up, twisted and bent. They
	passed part of a house, a bathtub
	turned on its side. A broken
	chair. A few spoons and bits of
	china dishes. In the center of the
	street the ground had sunk away.
	The depression was filled with
	weeds and debris and bones.</p>

	<p>“Over here,” Hendricks murmured.</p>

	<p>“This way?”</p>

	<p>“To the right.”</p>

	<p>They passed the remains of a
	heavy duty tank. Hendricks’ belt
	counter clicked ominously. The
	tank had been radiation blasted.
	A few feet from the tank a mummified
	body lay sprawled out,
	mouth open. Beyond the road
	was a flat field. Stones and
	weeds, and bits of broken glass.</p>

	<p>“There,” Hendricks said.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>A stone well jutted up, sagging
	and broken. A few boards lay
	across it. Most of the well had
	sunk into rubble. Hendricks
	walked unsteadily toward it,
	Tasso beside him.</p>

	<p>“Are you certain about this?”
	Tasso said. “This doesn’t look
	like anything.”</p>

	<p>“I’m sure.” Hendricks sat
	down at the edge of the well, his
	teeth locked. His breath came
	quickly. He wiped perspiration
	from his face. “This was
	<a id="page140" title="140"> </a>arranged so the senior command
	officer could get away. If anything
	happened. If the bunker
	fell.”</p>

	<p>“That was you?”</p>

	<p>“Yes.”</p>

	<p>“Where is the ship? Is it
	here?”</p>

	<p>“We’re standing on it.” Hendricks
	ran his hands over the
	surface of the well stones. “The
	eye-lock responds to me, not to
	anybody else. It’s my ship. Or it
	was supposed to be.”</p>

	<p>There was a sharp click. Presently
	they heard a low grating
	sound from below them.</p>

	<p>“Step back,” Hendricks said.
	He and Tasso moved away from
	the well.</p>

	<p>A section of the ground slid
	back. A metal frame pushed
	slowly up through the ash, shoving
	bricks and weeds out of the
	way. The action ceased, as the
	ship nosed into view.</p>

	<p>“There it is,” Hendricks said.</p>

	<p>The ship was small. It rested
	quietly, suspended in its mesh
	frame, like a blunt needle. A rain
	of ash sifted down into the dark
	cavity from which the ship had
	been raised. Hendricks made his
	way over to it. He mounted the
	mesh and unscrewed the hatch,
	pulling it back. Inside the ship
	the control banks and the pressure
	seat were visible.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Tasso came and stood beside
	him, gazing into the ship. “I’m
	not accustomed to rocket piloting,”
	she said, after awhile.</p>

	<p>Hendricks glanced at her. “I’ll
	do the piloting.”</p>

	<p>“Will you? There’s only one
	seat, Major. I can see it’s built
	to carry only a single person.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks’ breathing changed.
	He studied the interior of the
	ship intently. Tasso was right.
	There was only one seat. The
	ship was built to carry only one
	person. “I see,” he said slowly.
	“And the one person is you.”</p>

	<p>She nodded.</p>

	<p>“Of course.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“<em>You</em> can’t go. You might not
	live through the trip. You’re injured.
	You probably wouldn’t get
	there.”</p>

	<p>“An interesting point. But you
	see, I know where the Moon Base
	is. And you don’t. You might fly
	around for months and not find
	it. It’s well hidden. Without
	knowing what to look for—”</p>

	<p>“I’ll have to take my chances.
	Maybe I won’t find it. Not by
	myself. But I think you’ll give
	me all the information I need.
	Your life depends on it.”</p>

	<p>“How?”</p>

	<p>“If I find the Moon Base in
	time, perhaps I can get them to
	send a ship back to pick you up.
	<em>If</em> I find the Base in time. If not,
	then you haven’t a chance. I
	imagine there are supplies on the
	<a id="page141" title="141"> </a>ship. They will last me long
	enough—”</p>

	<p>Hendricks moved quickly. But
	his injured arm betrayed him.
	Tasso ducked, sliding lithely
	aside. Her hand came up, lightning
	fast. Hendricks saw the gun
	butt coming. He tried to ward
	off the blow, but she was too fast.
	The metal butt struck against
	the side of his head, just above
	his ear. Numbing pain rushed
	through him. Pain and rolling
	clouds of blackness. He sank
	down, sliding to the ground.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Dimly, he was aware that
	Tasso was standing over him,
	kicking him with her toe.</p>

	<p>“Major! Wake up.”</p>

	<p>He opened his eyes, groaning.</p>

	<p>“Listen to me.” She bent down,
	the gun pointed at his face. “I
	have to hurry. There isn’t much
	time left. The ship is ready to
	go, but you must tell me the information
	I need before I leave.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks shook his head, trying
	to clear it.</p>

	<p>“Hurry up! Where is the
	Moon Base? How do I find it?
	What do I look for?”</p>

	<p>Hendricks said nothing.</p>

	<p>“Answer me!”</p>

	<p>“Sorry.”</p>

	<p>“Major, the ship is loaded
	with provisions. I can coast for
	weeks. I’ll find the Base eventually.
	And in a half hour you’ll
	be dead. Your only chance of
	survival—” She broke off.</p>

	<p>Along the slope, by some
	crumbling ruins, something
	moved. Something in the ash.
	Tasso turned quickly, aiming.
	She fired. A puff of flame leaped.
	Something scuttled away, rolling
	across the ash. She fired again.
	The claw burst apart, wheels flying.</p>

	<p>“See?” Tasso said. “A scout.
	It won’t be long.”</p>

	<p>“You’ll bring them back here
	to get me?”</p>

	<p>“Yes. As soon as possible.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks looked up at her.
	He studied her intently. “You’re
	telling the truth?” A strange
	expression had come over his
	face, an avid hunger. “You will
	come back for me? You’ll get me
	to the Moon Base?”</p>

	<p>“I’ll get you to the Moon Base.
	But tell me where it is! There’s
	only a little time left.”</p>

	<p>“All right.” Hendricks picked
	up a piece of rock, pulling himself
	to a sitting position.
	“Watch.”</p>

	<p>Hendricks began to scratch in
	the ash. Tasso stood by him,
	watching the motion of the rock.
	Hendricks was sketching a crude
	lunar map.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>“This is the Appenine range.
	Here is the Crater of Archimedes.
	The Moon Base is beyond
	the end of the Appenine, about
	two hundred miles. I don’t know
	<a id="page142" title="142"> </a>exactly where. No one on Terra
	knows. But when you’re over the
	Appenine, signal with one red
	flare and a green flare, followed
	by two red flares in quick succession.
	The Base monitor will record
	your signal. The Base is
	under the surface, of course.
	They’ll guide you down with
	magnetic grapples.”</p>

	<p>“And the controls? Can I
	operate them?”</p>

	<p>“The controls are virtually
	automatic. All you have to do is
	give the right signal at the right
	time.”</p>

	<p>“I will.”</p>

	<p>“The seat absorbs most of the
	take-off shock. Air and temperature
	are automatically controlled.
	The ship will leave Terra and
	pass out into free space. It’ll line
	itself up with the moon, falling
	into an orbit around it, about a
	hundred miles above the surface.
	The orbit will carry you over the
	Base. When you’re in the region
	of the Appenine, release the signal
	rockets.”</p>

	<p>Tasso slid into the ship and
	lowered herself into the pressure
	seat. The arm locks folded automatically
	around her. She fingered
	the controls. “Too bad
	you’re not going, Major. All this
	put here for you, and you can’t
	make the trip.”</p>

	<p>“Leave me the pistol.”</p>

	<p>Tasso pulled the pistol from
	her belt. She held it in her hand,
	weighing it thoughtfully. “Don’t
	go too far from this location.
	It’ll be hard to find you, as it is.”</p>

	<p>“No. I’ll stay here by the well.”</p>

	<p>Tasso gripped the take-off
	switch, running her fingers over
	the smooth metal. “A beautiful
	ship, Major. Well built. I admire
	your workmanship. You people
	have always done good work. You
	build fine things. Your work,
	your creations, are your greatest
	achievement.”</p>

	<p>“Give me the pistol,” Hendricks
	said impatiently, holding
	out his hand. He struggled to his
	feet.</p>

	<p>“Good-bye, Major.” Tasso
	tossed the pistol past Hendricks.
	The pistol clattered against the
	ground, bouncing and rolling
	away. Hendricks hurried after it.
	He bent down, snatching it up.</p>

	<p>The hatch of the ship clanged
	shut. The bolts fell into place.
	Hendricks made his way back.
	The inner door was being sealed.
	He raised the pistol unsteadily.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>There was a shattering roar.
	The ship burst up from its metal
	cage, fusing the mesh behind it.
	Hendricks cringed, pulling back.
	The ship shot up into the rolling
	clouds of ash, disappearing into
	the sky.</p>

	<p>Hendricks stood watching a
	long time, until even the
	streamer had dissipated. Nothing
	stirred. The morning air was
	<a id="page143" title="143"> </a>chill and silent. He began to walk
	aimlessly back the way they had
	come. Better to keep moving
	around. It would be a long time
	before help came—if it came at
	all.</p>

	<p>He searched his pockets until
	he found a package of cigarettes.
	He lit one grimly. They had all
	wanted cigarettes from him. But
	cigarettes were scarce.</p>

	<p>A lizard slithered by him,
	through the ash. He halted,
	rigid. The lizard disappeared.
	Above, the sun rose higher in the
	sky. Some flies landed on a flat
	rock to one side of him. Hendricks
	kicked at them with his
	foot.</p>

	<p>It was getting hot. Sweat
	trickled down his face, into his
	collar. His mouth was dry.</p>

	<p>Presently he stopped walking
	and sat down on some debris. He
	unfastened his medicine kit and
	swallowed a few narcotic capsules.
	He looked around him.
	Where was he?</p>

	<p>Something lay ahead. Stretched
	out on the ground. Silent and
	unmoving.</p>

	<p>Hendricks drew his gun quickly.
	It looked like a man. Then he
	remembered. It was the remains
	of Klaus. The Second Variety.
	Where Tasso had blasted him.
	He could see wheels and relays
	and metal parts, strewn around
	on the ash. Glittering and
	sparkling in the sunlight.</p>

	<p>Hendricks got to his feet and
	walked over. He nudged the inert
	form with his foot, turning
	it over a little. He could see the
	metal hull, the aluminum ribs
	and struts. More wiring fell out.
	Like viscera. Heaps of wiring,
	switches and relays. Endless
	motors and rods.</p>

	<p>He bent down. The brain cage
	had been smashed by the fall.
	The artificial brain was visible.
	He gazed at it. A maze of circuits.
	Miniature tubes. Wires as
	fine as hair. He touched the
	brain cage. It swung aside. The
	type plate was visible. Hendricks
	studied the plate.</p>

	<p>And blanched.</p>

	<p>IV—IV.</p>

	<p>For a long time he stared at
	the plate. Fourth Variety. Not
	the Second. They had been
	wrong. There were more types.
	Not just three. Many more, perhaps.
	At least four. And Klaus
	wasn’t the Second Variety.</p>

	<p>But if Klaus wasn’t the Second
	Variety—</p>

	<p>Suddenly he tensed. Something
	was coming, walking through
	the ash beyond the hill. What
	was it? He strained to see. Figures.
	Figures coming slowly
	along, making their way through
	the ash.</p>

	<p>Coming toward him.</p>

	<p>Hendricks crouched quickly,
	raising his gun. Sweat dripped
	down into his eyes. He fought
	<a id="page144" title="144"> </a>down rising panic, as the figures
	neared.</p>

	<p>The first was a David. The
	David saw him and increased its
	pace. The others hurried behind
	it. A second David. A third.
	Three Davids, all alike, coming
	toward him silently, without expression,
	their thin legs rising
	and falling. Clutching their teddy
	bears.</p>

	<p>He aimed and fired. The first
	two Davids dissolved into particles.
	The third came on. And the
	figure behind it. Climbing silently
	toward him across the gray
	ash. A Wounded Soldier, towering
	over the David. And—</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>And behind the Wounded Soldier
	came two Tassos, walking
	side by side. Heavy belt, Russian
	army pants, shirt, long hair. The
	familiar figure, as he had seen
	her only a little while before.
	Sitting in the pressure seat of
	the ship. Two slim, silent figures,
	both identical.</p>

	<p>They were very near. The
	David bent down suddenly, dropping
	its teddy bear. The bear
	raced across the ground. Automatically,
	Hendricks’ fingers
	tightened around the trigger.
	The bear was gone, dissolved
	into mist. The two Tasso Types
	moved on, expressionless, walking
	side by side, through the
	gray ash.</p>

	<p>When they were almost to him,
	Hendricks raised the pistol waist
	high and fired.</p>

	<p>The two Tassos dissolved. But
	already a new group was starting
	up the rise, five or six
	Tassos, all identical, a line of
	them coming rapidly toward him.</p>

	<p>And he had given her the ship
	and the signal code. Because of
	him she was on her way to the
	moon, to the Moon Base. He had
	made it possible.</p>

	<p>He had been right about the
	bomb, after all. It had been designed
	with knowledge of the
	other types, the David Type and
	the Wounded Soldier Type. And
	the Klaus Type. Not designed by
	human beings. It had been designed
	by one of the underground
	factories, apart from all
	human contact.</p>

	<p>The line of Tassos came up to
	him. Hendricks braced himself,
	watching them calmly. The familiar
	face, the belt, the heavy
	shirt, the bomb carefully in
	place.</p>

	<p>The bomb—</p>

	<p>As the Tassos reached for him,
	a last ironic thought drifted
	through Hendricks’ mind. He
	felt a little better, thinking about
	it. The bomb. Made by the Second
	Variety to destroy the other
	varieties. Made for that end
	alone.</p>

	<p>They were already beginning
	to design weapons to use against
	each other.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
