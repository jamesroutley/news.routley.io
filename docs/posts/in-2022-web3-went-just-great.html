    <h1>In 2022, Web3 went just great</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>What. a. year.</p><p><span>2022 brought 855 new entries to </span><em>Web3 is Going Just Great</em><span>, which was </span><em>quite</em><span> the uptick from the only 147 entries recorded in 2021. This also means that </span><em>Web3 is Going Just Great</em><span> just surpassed the 1,000 entry milestone! ü•≥</span></p><p>$4.27 billion was stolen in various hacks and scams this year alone, although that is a very conservative estimate ‚Äî we just don‚Äôt yet have a great picture of quite how much money was lost to some of the major collapses this year.</p><p><span>To celebrate the New Year, and just over a year of running the W3IGG project, I‚Äôve put together a new </span><strong><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/charts/top" rel="">grift leaderboard</a></strong><span>, where you can explore the site‚Äôs entries ranked by the amount of money that was lost.</span></p><p><span>I‚Äôve also added starred posts, where entries that are particularly noteworthy (based on my completely subjective opinion) show a star icon in the corner. The timeline can be filtered to show only </span><strong><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?starred=true" rel="">starred posts</a></strong><span> ‚Äî¬†a highlight reel, of sorts.</span></p><p>These features have helped me pull together this recap, where I will summarize some of the major themes of this year in the cryptocurrency world. Before we jump in, though, one last celebratory announcement: Subscriptions to this newsletter are 20% off for the next week!</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/subscribe?coupon=bff985fd&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Get 20% off for 1 year&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/subscribe?coupon=bff985fd" rel=""><span>Get 20% off for 1 year</span></a></p><p>I‚Äôm so grateful to those of you who‚Äôve supported me in writing this newsletter already. If 2022 is any indication, 2023 is going to be a hell of a year, and I‚Äôm happy to have you all on this journey with me.</p><p><span>I don‚Äôt think anyone can disagree that </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?theme=collapse" rel="">major collapses</a><span> were the primary theme of 2022 in the cryptocurrency world. </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=terrausd-ust-stablecoin-struggles-to-retain-peg" rel="">Terra/Luna</a><span> was the first major domino to fall, on May 9, and that historic tumble kicked off a string of events that are </span><em>still</em><span> unfolding. The enormous contagion throughout the industry has contributed to many more recent collapses, including that of FTX. Terra/Luna‚Äôs founder is wanted by Interpol, though he insists he‚Äôs </span><em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=south-korea-reportedly-freezes-39-6-million-in-crypto-belonging-to-terra-founder-do-kwon-kwon-says-it-isnt-his" rel="">definitely not</a></em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=south-korea-reportedly-freezes-39-6-million-in-crypto-belonging-to-terra-founder-do-kwon-kwon-says-it-isnt-his" rel=""> on the run</a><span>. He must just be in Serbia because it‚Äôs so well known for its lovely December weather.</span></p><p><span>Crypto hedge fund </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=three-arrows-capital-crypto-hedge-fund-may-be-insolvent" rel="">Three Arrows Capital</a><span> and lender </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=babel-finance-suspends-withdrawals-and-redemptions" rel="">Babel Finance</a><span> were the next major collapses, occurring nearly simultaneously in mid-June. Much like Do Kwon, Three Arrows Capital‚Äôs founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu are also </span><em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=three-arrows-capital-founders-are-nowhere-to-be-found" rel="">definitely not</a></em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=three-arrows-capital-founders-are-nowhere-to-be-found" rel=""> on the run</a><em>. </em><span>Kyle Davies was last known to be in Bali, which at least is a more believable vacation destination, but which also happens to be in a country without an extradition agreement with the U.S.</span></p><p><span>Then we had the bankruptcies: </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy" rel="">Voyager</a><span> on July 6, and </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=celsius-files-for-bankruptcy" rel="">Celsius</a><span> on July 13. This kicked off a deluge of letters from both </span><a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/voyager-letters/" rel="">Voyager customers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/celsius-letters/" rel="">Celsius customers</a><span>, which illustrate some of the devastation to individuals that comes out of disasters like these.</span></p><p><span>Finally, November brought the </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-sam-bankman-fried-resigns" rel="">spectacular explosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange</a><span>, which (until this post) has been the focus of every single </span><a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/s/deep-dives" rel="">special edition issue</a><span> of this newsletter to date as I work to cover it in detail. The </span><a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/etc/ftx-contagion" rel="">contagion effect</a><span> of such an enormous collapse has been impressive, overshadowing even that of the fairly large disasters earlier this year.</span></p><p><span>When looking at </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/charts/top?dateRange=2022" rel="">2022‚Äôs list of hacks by dollar amount</a><span>, it‚Äôs clear even at a brief glance that </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#bridge" rel="">blockchain bridge</a><span> hacks were the most devastating in terms of total financial loss. Topping the charts is the </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=axie-infinity-suffers-625-million-exploit" rel="">March 29 hack</a><span> of the bridge used by the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity ‚Äî a hack that saw $625 million taken and </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=authorities-link-axie-infinity-hack-to-north-korean-lazarus-hacking-group" rel="">funneled to the North Korean Lazarus cybercrime group</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>Following it in second place is the massive $570 million </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=binance-smart-chain-halts-after-bridge-exploit" rel="">hack of a Binance bridge</a><span> on October 6. Fourth on the list is the $320 million </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=wormhole-bridge-hack" rel="">Wormhole bridge hack</a><span> in February, followed by the $190 million </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=nomad-bridge-exploit" rel="">Nomad bridge hack</a><span> in August. The $100 million hack of the </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=100-million-stolen-from-horizon-bridge" rel="">Harmony Horizon bridge</a><span> in June makes a total of five bridge-related entries in the top ten hacks by dollar amount this year.</span></p><p>The theft of sixteen NFTs, including eight Bored Apes, from collector Todd Kramer led to the catchphrase of the year: ‚Äúall my apes gone‚Äù.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png" width="450" height="157.5" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;normal&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:238,&#34;width&#34;:680,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:450,&#34;bytes&#34;:66381,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Tweet by toddkramer.eth (@toddkramer1): \&#34;I been hacked. all my apes gone. this just sold please help me\&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Tweet by toddkramer.eth (@toddkramer1): &#34;I been hacked. all my apes gone. this just sold please help me&#34;" title="Tweet by toddkramer.eth (@toddkramer1): &#34;I been hacked. all my apes gone. this just sold please help me&#34;" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a8f9eac-381e-4f48-969d-9121cb1817ff_680x238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Bored Apes were by no means the only NFTs stolen this year, but they were a particularly juicy target.

Another scam duo </span><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=animate-your-bored-ape-scammers-linked-to-more-phishing-attacks" rel="">created websites</a><span> that convinced collectors to grant access to their collections by promising to ‚Äúturn your [Bored Ape] animated‚Äù.

Various publications, including the </span><em><a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=nft-sales-drop-92-from-peak" rel="">Wall Street Journal</a></em><span> have tried to estimate just how far down the NFT market has crashed.
