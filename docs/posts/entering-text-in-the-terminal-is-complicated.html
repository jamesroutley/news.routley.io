    <h1>Entering text in the terminal is complicated</h1>
    
    

<p>The other day I asked what folks on Mastodon find confusing about working in
the terminal, and one thing that stood out to me was &ldquo;editing a command you
already typed in&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This really resonated with me: even though entering some text and editing it is
a very &ldquo;basic&rdquo; task, it took me maybe 15 years of using the terminal every
single day to get used to using <code>Ctrl+A</code> to go to the beginning of the line (or
<code>Ctrl+E</code> for the end &ndash; I think I used <code>Home</code>/<code>End</code> instead).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about why entering text might be hard! I&rsquo;ll also share a few tips
that I wish I&rsquo;d learned earlier.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-very-inconsistent-between-programs">it&rsquo;s very inconsistent between programs</h3>

<p>A big part of what makes entering text in the terminal hard is the
inconsistency between how different programs handle entering text. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>some programs (<code>cat</code>, <code>nc</code>, <code>git commit --interactive</code>, etc) don&rsquo;t support using arrow keys at all: if you press arrow keys, you&rsquo;ll just see <code>^[[D^[[D^[[C^[[C^</code></li>
<li>many programs (like <code>irb</code>, <code>python3</code> on a Linux machine and many many more) use the <code>readline</code> library, which gives you a lot of basic functionality (history, arrow keys, etc)</li>
<li>some programs (like <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> on my Mac) do support very basic features like arrow keys, but not other features like <code>Ctrl+left</code> or reverse searching with <code>Ctrl+R</code></li>
<li>some programs (like the <code>fish</code> shell or <code>ipython3</code> or <code>micro</code> or <code>vim</code>) have their own fancy system for accepting input which is totally custom</li>
</ol>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of variation! Let&rsquo;s talk about each of those a little more.</p>

<h3 id="mode-1-the-baseline">mode 1: the baseline</h3>

<p>First, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;the baseline&rdquo; &ndash; what happens if a program just accepts text by
calling <code>fgets()</code> or whatever and doing absolutely nothing else to provide a
nicer experience. Here&rsquo;s what using these tools typically looks for me &ndash; If I
start the version of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash">dash</a> installed on
my machine (a pretty minimal shell) press the left arrow keys, it just prints
<code>^[[D</code> to the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls l-^[[D^[[D^[[D
</code></pre>

<p>At first it doesn&rsquo;t seem like all of these &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; tools have much in
common, but there are actually a few features that you get for free just from
your terminal, without the program needing to do anything special at all.</p>

<p>The things you get for free are:</p>

<ol>
<li>typing in text, obviously</li>
<li>backspace</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+W</code>, to delete the previous word</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+U</code>, to delete the whole line</li>
<li>a few other things unrelated to text editing (like <code>Ctrl+C</code> to interrupt the process, <code>Ctrl+Z</code> to suspend, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not <em>great</em>, but it means that if you want to delete a word you
generally can do it with <code>Ctrl+W</code> instead of pressing backspace 15 times, even
if you&rsquo;re in an environment which is offering you absolutely zero features.</p>

<p>You can get a list of all the ctrl codes that your terminal supports with <code>stty -a</code>.</p>

<h3 id="mode-2-tools-that-use-readline">mode 2: tools that use <code>readline</code></h3>

<p>The next group is tools that use readline! Readline is a GNU library to make
entering text more pleasant, and it&rsquo;s very widely used.</p>

<p>My favourite readline keyboard shortcuts are:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Ctrl+E</code> (or <code>End</code>) to go to the end of the line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+A</code> (or <code>Home</code>) to go to the beginning of the line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+left/right arrow</code> to go back/forward 1 word</li>
<li>up arrow to go back to the previous command</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+R</code> to search your history</li>
</ol>

<p>And you can use <code>Ctrl+W</code> / <code>Ctrl+U</code> from the &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; list, though <code>Ctrl+U</code>
deletes from the cursor to the beginning of the line instead of deleting the
whole line. I think <code>Ctrl+W</code> might also have a slightly different definition of
what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is.</p>

<p>There are a lot more (<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html#EDITING_COMMANDS">here&rsquo;s a full list</a>), but those are the only ones that I personally use.</p>

<p>The <code>bash</code> shell is probably the most famous readline user (when you use
<code>Ctrl+R</code> to search your history in bash, that feature actually comes from
readline), but there are TONS of programs that use it &ndash; for example <code>psql</code>,
<code>irb</code>, <code>python3</code>, etc.</p>

<h3 id="tip-you-can-make-anything-use-readline-with-rlwrap">tip: you can make ANYTHING use readline with <code>rlwrap</code></h3>

<p>One of my absolute favourite things is that if you have a program like <code>nc</code>
without readline support, you can just run <code>rlwrap nc</code> to turn it into a
program with readline support!</p>

<p>This is incredible and makes a lot of tools that are borderline unusable MUCH
more pleasant to use. You can even apparently set up <a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a> to include your own
custom autocompletions, though I&rsquo;ve never tried that.</p>

<h3 id="some-reasons-tools-might-not-use-readline">some reasons tools might not use readline</h3>

<p>I think reasons tools might not use readline might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the program is very simple (like <code>cat</code> or <code>nc</code>) and maybe the maintainers don&rsquo;t want to bring in a relatively large dependency</li>
<li>license reasons, if the program&rsquo;s license is not GPL-compatible &ndash; readline is GPL-licensed, not LGPL</li>
<li>only a very small part of the program is interactive, and maybe readline
support isn&rsquo;t seen as important. For example <code>git</code> has a few interactive
features (like <code>git add -p</code>), but not very many, and usually you&rsquo;re just
typing a single character like <code>y</code> or <code>n</code> &ndash; most of the time you need to really
type something significant in git, it&rsquo;ll drop you into a text editor instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example idris2 says <a href="https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/interactive.html#editing-at-the-repl">they don&rsquo;t use readline</a>
to keep dependencies minimal and suggest using <code>rlwrap</code> to get better
interactive features.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-know-if-you-re-using-readline">how to know if you&rsquo;re using readline</h3>

<p>The simplest test I can think of is to press <code>Ctrl+R</code>, and if you see:</p>

<pre><code>(reverse-i-search)`':
</code></pre>

<p>then you&rsquo;re probably using readline. This obviously isn&rsquo;t a guarantee (some
other library could use the term <code>reverse-i-search</code> too!), but I don&rsquo;t know of
another system that uses that specific term to refer to searching history.</p>

<h3 id="the-readline-keybindings-come-from-emacs">the readline keybindings come from Emacs</h3>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m a vim user, It took me a very long time to understand where these
keybindings come from (why <code>Ctrl+A</code> to go to the beginning of a line??? so
weird!)</p>

<p>My understanding is these keybindings actually come from Emacs &ndash; <code>Ctrl+A</code> and
<code>Ctrl+E</code> do the same thing in Emacs as they do in Readline and I assume the
other keyboard shortcuts mostly do as well, though I tried out <code>Ctrl+W</code> and
<code>Ctrl+U</code> in Emacs and they don&rsquo;t do the same thing as they do in the terminal
so I guess there are some differences.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some more <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2019/08/22/readline.html">history of the Readline project here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mode-3-another-input-library-like-libedit">mode 3: another input library (like <code>libedit</code>)</h3>

<p>On my Mac laptop, <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> is in a weird middle ground where it
supports <em>some</em> readline features (for example the arrow keys), but not the
other ones. For example when I press <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code>, it prints out <code>;5D</code>,
like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; importt subprocess;5D
</code></pre>

<p>Folks on Mastodon helped me figure out that this is because in the default
Python install on Mac OS, the Python <code>readline</code> module is actually backed by
<code>libedit</code>, which is a similar library which has fewer features, presumably
because Readline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline#Choice_of_the_GPL_as_GNU_Readline's_license">GPL licensed</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I was eventually able to figure out that Python was using libedit on
my system:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 -c &quot;import readline; print(readline.__doc__)&quot;
Importing this module enables command line editing using libedit readline.
</code></pre>

<p>Generally Python uses readline though if you install it on Linux or through
Homebrew. It&rsquo;s just that the specific version that Apple includes on their
systems doesn&rsquo;t have readline. Also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">Python 3.13 is going to remove the readline dependency</a>
in favour of a custom library, so &ldquo;Python uses readline&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be true in the
future.</p>

<p>I assume that there are more programs on my Mac that use libedit but I haven&rsquo;t
looked into it.</p>

<h3 id="mode-4-something-custom">mode 4: something custom</h3>

<p>The last group of programs is programs that have their own custom (and sometimes
much fancier!) system for editing text. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>most terminal text editors (nano, micro, vim, emacs, etc)</li>
<li>some shells (like fish), for example it seems like fish supports <code>Ctrl+Z</code> for undo when typing in a command. Zsh&rsquo;s line editor is called <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide04.html">zle</a>.</li>
<li>some REPLs (like <code>ipython</code>), for example IPython uses the <a href="https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/">prompt_toolkit</a> library instead of readline</li>
<li>lots of other programs (like <code>atuin</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some features you might see are:</p>

<ul>
<li>better autocomplete which is more customized to the tool</li>
<li>nicer history management (for example with syntax highlighting) than the default you get from readline</li>
<li>more keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="custom-input-systems-are-often-readline-inspired">custom input systems are often readline-inspired</h3>

<p>I went looking at how <a href="https://atuin.sh/">Atuin</a> (a wonderful tool for
searching your shell history that I started using recently) handles text input.
Looking at <a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L382-L430">the code</a>
and some of the discussion around it, their implementation is custom but it&rsquo;s
inspired by readline, which makes sense to me &ndash; a lot of users are used to
those keybindings, and it&rsquo;s convenient for them to work even though atuin
doesn&rsquo;t use readline.</p>

<p><a href="https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/">prompt_toolkit</a> (the library
IPython uses) is similar &ndash; it actually supports a lot of options (including
vi-like keybindings), but the default is to support the readline-style
keybindings.</p>

<p>This is like how you see a lot of programs which support very basic vim
keybindings (like <code>j</code> for down and <code>k</code> for up). For example Fastmail supports
<code>j</code> and <code>k</code> even though most of its other keybindings don&rsquo;t have much
relationship to vim.</p>

<p>I assume that most &ldquo;readline-inspired&rdquo; custom input systems have various subtle
incompatibilities with readline, but this doesn&rsquo;t really bother me at all
personally because I&rsquo;m extremely ignorant of most of readline&rsquo;s features. I only use
maybe 5 keyboard shortcuts, so as long as they support the 5 basic commands I
know (which they always do!) I feel pretty comfortable. And usually these
custom systems have much better autocomplete than you&rsquo;d get from just using
readline, so generally I prefer them over readline.</p>

<h3 id="lots-of-shells-support-vi-keybindings">lots of shells support vi keybindings</h3>

<p>Bash, zsh, and fish all have a &ldquo;vi mode&rdquo; for entering text. In a
<a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/112723846172173621">very unscientific poll</a> I ran on
Mastodon, 12% of people said they use it, so it seems pretty popular.</p>

<p>Readline also has a &ldquo;vi mode&rdquo; (which is how Bash&rsquo;s support for it works), so by
extension lots of other programs have it too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that vi mode seems really cool, but for some reason even
though I&rsquo;m a vim user it&rsquo;s never stuck for me.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-what-situation-you-re-in-really-helps">understanding what situation you&rsquo;re in really helps</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life being confused about why a command line application
I was using wasn&rsquo;t behaving the way I wanted, and it feels good to be able to
more or less understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>I think this is roughly my mental flowchart when I&rsquo;m entering text at a command
line prompt:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the arrow keys not work? Probably there&rsquo;s no input system at all, but at
least I can use <code>Ctrl+W</code> and <code>Ctrl+U</code>, and I can <code>rlwrap</code> the tool if I
want more features.</li>
<li>Does <code>Ctrl+R</code> print <code>reverse-i-search</code>? Probably it&rsquo;s readline, so I can use
all of the readline shortcuts I&rsquo;m used to, and I know I can get some basic
history and press up arrow to get the previous command.</li>
<li>Does <code>Ctrl+R</code> do something else? This is probably some custom input library:
it&rsquo;ll probably act more or less like readline, and I can check the
documentation if I really want to know how it works.</li>
</ol>

<p>Being able to diagnose what&rsquo;s going on like this makes the command line feel a
more predictable and less chaotic.</p>

<h3 id="some-things-this-post-left-out">some things this post left out</h3>

<p>There are lots more complications related to entering text that we didn&rsquo;t talk
about at all here, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>issues related to ssh / tmux / etc</li>
<li>the <code>TERM</code> environment variable</li>
<li>how different terminals (gnome terminal, iTerm, xterm, etc) have different kinds of support for copying/pasting text</li>
<li>unicode</li>
<li>probably a lot more</li>
</ul>
