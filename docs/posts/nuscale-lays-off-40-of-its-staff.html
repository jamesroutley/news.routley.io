HuffPost reviewed the audio of the meeting. Two sources with direct knowledge of NuScale’s plans confirmed the details of the layoffs.</p><p>By Friday evening, NuScale’s stock price had plunged more than 8% as investors sold off shares. NuScale did not respond to a call, an email or a text message seeking comment.</p><p>Surging construction costs are imperiling clean energy across the country. In just the past two months, developers have pulled the plug on major offshore wind farms in New Jersey and New York after state officials refused to let companies rebid for contracts at a higher rate.</p><p>But the financial headwinds are taking an especially acute toll on nuclear power. It takes more than a decade to build a reactor, and the only new ones under construction in the U.S. and Europe went billions of dollars over budget in the past two decades. Many in the atomic energy industry are betting that <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/small-nuclear-reactors-energy_n_649f055be4b0c7e9d8e723e8?a4" target="_blank" role="link" data-vars-item-name="small modular reactors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="65985ac5e4b075f4cfd24dba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/small-nuclear-reactors-energy_n_649f055be4b0c7e9d8e723e8?a4" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2">small modular reactors</a> ― shrunken down, lower-power units with a uniform design ― can make it cheaper and easier to build new nuclear plants through assembly-line repetition.</p><p>The U.S. government is banking on that strategy to meet its climate goals. The Biden administration spearheaded a pledge to triple atomic energy production worldwide in the next three decades at the United Nations’ climate summit in Dubai last month, enlisting dozens of partner nations in Europe, Asia and Africa.</p><p>The two infrastructure-spending laws that President <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> signed in recent years earmark billions in spending to develop new reactors and keep existing plants open. And new bills in Congress to speed up U.S. nuclear deployments and sell more American reactors abroad are virtually all bipartisan, with progressives and right-wing <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/republican-party">Republicans</a> alike expressing support for atomic energy.</p><figure><div><div></div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/654c34142200004917cef345.jpg?cache=gib9CkN8cL&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&amp;format=webp"/><img loading="lazy" alt="A rendering from the Idaho National Laboratory shows what NuScale&#39;s debut power plant was supposed to look like." width="720" height="337" src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/654c34142200004917cef345.jpg?cache=gib9CkN8cL&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale"/></picture></div><div><figcaption>A rendering from the Idaho National Laboratory shows what NuScale&#39;s debut power plant was supposed to look like.</figcaption><div aria-label="Image Credit: Idaho National Laboratory"><p><span>Idaho National Laboratory</span></p></div></div></figure><p>But the U.S. trails rivals like China and Russia in deploying new types of reactors, including those based on technologies that scientists working for the federal government first developed.</p><p>Until November, NuScale appeared on track to debut the nation’s first atomic energy station powered with small modular reactors.

There’s variable expense, and there’s a lot of discretionary spending,” Hamady said. “We spend more as we have contracts, and we pull in our spending as contracts either get pushed out or delayed or whether we want to focus more on discretionary spend or nondiscretionary spend.”</p><p><em>Did you just lose your job at NuScale or another green energy company?

The constant need to replenish pipelines using a fuel with a wildly fluctuating price put a new premium on nuclear energy’s steady 24-hour output without needing refueling for two years or more. To boot, nuclear reactors don’t produce planet-heating emissions, and they generate orders of magnitude more electricity, more frequently and on less land, than solar panels or wind turbines.</p><p>Yet as the U.S. and its allies sanctioned the oil and gas exports funding Russia’s war chest, the Kremlin’s state-owned nuclear company, Rosatom, has remained immune, since American and European reactors depend on fuel that it enriches.
