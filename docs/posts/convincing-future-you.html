    <h1>Convincing Future You</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I often want to change or build a habit. Perhaps I&#39;d like to use screens less. Perhaps I&#39;d like to exercise. In any case, I have a behavior that that in-the-moment-me does not always perform the way reflective-me wants.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are a lot of tools to approach this problem: I can manipulate my environment. I can create accountability bets. I can do all the basic things for health (sleep, water, good food, etc.) that help with everything else. However, these don&#39;t always work. In this post, I&#39;ll talk about another way I look at this problem which I haven&#39;t seen before.</p>
<p>In short: building habits is convincing future you of something. Future you is a different person, so you need to focus on what <em>they</em> want, not what you want.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose you have a friend Bob, whom you think should exercise right now. It&#39;s a good time for Bob to exercise, but he doesn&#39;t want to go. Would it be effective to tell him that &#34;exercise will make him healthier&#34;? Probably not. Bob probably already knows that. Likely, there&#39;s something else that is keeping him from exercising. Your task is not to convince Bob that exercise is good. It&#39;s to convince him that exercise is a good choice for him <em>now</em> and to remove any barriers he might have.</p>
<p>Telling him he made a prior commitment is good. Offering to give him a treat afterwards is good. Telling him that you saw his crush at the gym is very good (or very bad). Telling him that he <em>should</em> exercise? Maybe less effective.</p>
<p>Now imagine Bob is future you. To convince future you to exercise, you need to have a the same conversation. It&#39;s not enough to find what makes you want to exercise in a moment of reflection; you have to find what will get you to the gym when you actually need to make that choice.  </p>
<p>This might not just be inspiring desire! You can use all the tactics of good salesmanship, which include the things I mentioned up top. A good salesman will control the environment in which the sale is made. They will remove barriers. And they&#39;ll think about what their client <em>wants</em>. You can too.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Notably, regimens and routines may not convince future you. Let&#39;s take an example of a bed-time routine. If I struggle to floss enough, I might give myself the rule that &#34;I will not brush my teeth until I have flossed.&#34;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Flossing is mildly unpleasant, but I like the feeling of following my own rules, so I will start flossing consistently. This worked for me!</p>
<p>It would not work, for me, however if I required myself to take a cold shower before I brushed my teeth.</p>
<p>To take cold showers, I&#39;d need to find a consistent and compelling reason for future me to want to take one. (For some people, having a routine might be that reason.)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> I&#39;m not quite sure what would work for me, but looking at problem this way gives me some ideas. Maybe I could make a competition with my friend. Maybe I&#39;d treat myself to chocolate if and only if I&#39;d taken a cold shower that day.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Or maybe there&#39;s another selling point I can&#39;t immediately think of.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, even my original example of flushing before brushing was motivated by more than the rule. I started dating someone with allergies, so oral hygiene became much more emotionally salient to me. It also helped that we got into a little debate over whether it was weird to floss before brushing.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Both of these facts helped make flossing something I wanted to do, rather than just a chore.</p>
<p>In general, creating social incentives helps me do hard things.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Maybe that will work for you too. But, I don&#39;t think the purpose of the post is to provide answers, or even suggestions. Instead, I want to pose a question: </p>
<p>&#34;How do I convince future me to do what present me wants?&#34;</p>
