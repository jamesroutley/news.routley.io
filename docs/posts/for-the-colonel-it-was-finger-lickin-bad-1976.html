<p>Here’s a gem from the archive of the NY Times. One day in September 1976, NY Times food critic Mimi Sheraton and Colonel Harland Sanders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/09/archives/for-the-colonel-it-was-fingerlickin-bad.html">stopped into a Manhattan Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>. The Colonel, then estranged from the company he founded, strolled into the kitchen after glad-handing some patrons and proceeded to tear into the quality of the food:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once in the kitchen, the colonel walked over to a vat full of frying chicken pieces and announced, ‘That’s much too black. It should be golden brown. You’re frying for 12 minutes — that’s six minutes too long. What’s more, your frying fat should have been changed a week ago. That’s the worst fried chicken I’ve ever seen. Let me see your mashed potatoes with gravy, and how do you make them?”</p>
	
<p>When Mr. Singleton explained that he first mixed boiling water into the instant powdered potatoes, the colonel interrupted. “And then you have wallpaper paste,” he said. “Next suppose you add some of this brown gravy stuff and then you have sludge.” “There’s no way anyone can get me to swallow those potatoes,” he said after tasting some. “And this cole slaw. This cole slaw! They just won’t listen to me. It should he chopped, not shredded, and it should be made with Miracle Whip. Anything else turns gray. And there should be nothing in it but cabbage. No carrots!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sanders sold his company to an investment group in 1964, which took the company public two years later and eventually sold to a company called Heublein. After selling, Sanders officially still worked for the company as an advisor but grew more and more dissatisfied with it, as evidenced by the story above. When the company HQ moved to Tennessee, the Colonel was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>This ain’t no goddam Tennessee Fried Chicken, no matter what some slick, silk-suited son-of-a-bitch says.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he got sued by a KFC franchisee after he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZskrsscU7HkC&amp;pg=SA4-PA17&amp;lpg=SA4-PA17&amp;dq=My+God,+that+gravy+is+horrible!+sanders&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zfKAaLx1Rx&amp;sig=iZUPCcCs3LlSlsdnEGKkbQzEJx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTpZn_3t3OAhVMCsAKHaviCY8Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20God%2C%20that%20gravy%20is%20horrible!%20sanders&amp;f=false">commented</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy tap water for 15 to 20 cents a thousand gallons and then mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste. And I know wallpaper paste, by God, because I’ve seen my mother make it.</p>

<p>To the “wallpaper paste” they add some sludge and sell it for 65 or 75 cents a pint. There’s no nutrition in it and the ought not to be allowed to sell it.</p>

<p>And another thing. That new crispy chicken is nothing in the world but a damn fried doughball stuck on some chicken.</p></blockquote>
