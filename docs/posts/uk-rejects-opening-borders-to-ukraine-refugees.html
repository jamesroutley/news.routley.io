What we want though is control and we want to be able to check.&#34; he told reporters. &#34;I think it&#39;s sensible given what&#39;s going on in Ukraine to make sure that we have some basic ability to check who is coming in.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The British government has been condemned by charities, opposition lawmakers and France after its insistence that refugees first acquire a visa meant some Ukrainians have been stuck in the French city of Calais, unable to enter Britain, and provoking a diplomatic row. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-urges-britain-do-more-help-ukraine-refugees-calais-2022-03-06/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The European Union has agreed to grant temporary residency to Ukrainians fleeing the invasion and give them access to employment, social welfare and housing for up to three years.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Britain has announced visa schemes for those who have family in the country or a willing sponsor. Media reports at the weekend said Britain had only issued about 50 visas for Ukrainians so far, although Johnson disputed that without giving further details.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said: &#34;There should be a simple route to sanctuary for those that are fleeing for their lives.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;The Home office is in a complete mess about this, they keep changing the rules,&#34; he told the BBC.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Scotland&#39;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Britain was not doing nearly enough. It should let refugees in and deal with the paperwork later, she said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">&#34;Having fleeing the terror in Ukraine, spending hours and hours and hours on arduous journeys, then having to jump through bureaucratic hoops is unconscionable,&#34; she told LBC radio.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Interior minister Priti Patel told the Sun newspaper she wanted to create a humanitarian route that would allow anyone from Ukraine to come to Britain. But Europe minister James Cleverly said he did not expect the existing requirements to change.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">&#34;We can&#39;t do with &#39;no questions asked&#39; because when people come to the UK we need to make sure they are supported,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Asked to clarify whether Patel was working on a third visa route, Britain&#39;s interior ministry sent a statement detailing existing measures but did not rule out future changes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">&#34;This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review,‚Äù it said.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Writing by Kate Holton; editing by Michael Holden and Angus MacSwan</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
