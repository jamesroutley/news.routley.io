</p><h2>Abstract</h2>

The Remembrance Agent (RA) is a program which augments human memory by
displaying a list of documents which might be relevant to the user&#39;s
current context.  Unlike most information retrieval systems, the RA runs
continuously without user intervention.  Its unobtrusive interface
allows a user to pursue or ignore the RA&#39;s suggestions as desired.


<h2>Introduction</h2>

The rise of the Internet has prompted a flurry of systems designed to find,
filter, and organize the huge amounts of information now available.
Information retrieval systems have been developed for applications ranging
from classification and prioritization of email (Maes 1994, Cohen 1996),
filter netnews (Lang 1995), answering queries based on Usenet FAQ&#39;s (Hamond
1994), and searching the Web (Mauldin and Leavitt, 1994).  A few
applications have also been developed to organize more  user specific
information such as notes files, diaries, and calendars (Jones 1986,
Lamming &amp; Flynn 1994).  However, almost all of these systems have
concentrated on query-based information-retrieval-on-demand.  For example,
they can answer questions such as &#34;when is that conference paper
deadline?&#34; or &#34;who&#39;s an expert on this particular algorithm?&#34;.
However, they do not help when the user does not remember enough to even
know to ask a question, or what question to ask.  This &#34;associative&#34;
form of recall is what reminds a user that an important conference exists
at all, or that there are references that should be mentioned in a paper
which the user might have missed.<p>

With more powerful desktop computers, most of a  computer&#39;s CPU time is
spent waiting for the user to hit the next keystroke, read the next page,
or load the next packet off the network.  There is no reason it can&#39;t be
using those otherwise wasted CPU cycles constructively by performing
continuous searches for information that might be of use in its user&#39;s
current situation.  For example, while an engineer reads email about a
project an agent might remind her of project schedules, status reports, and
other resources related to the project in question.  When she stops reading
email and starts editing a file, it should automatically changes it
recommendations accordingly.  </p><p> 

The Remembrance Agent described in this paper performs this continuous,
associative form of recall by continuously displaying relevant information
which might be relevant to an individual user in their current context.  It
is designed with the philosophy that, as a continuously running and
updating program, it should never distract from the user&#39;s primary task,
but should instead only augment it.  It therefor suggests information
sources which may be relevant to the user&#39;s current situation in the form
of one-line summaries at the bottom of the screen.  Here they can be easily
monitored, but won&#39;t distract from the primary work at hand.  The full text
of a suggestion can be brought up with a single keystroke. </p><p>

</p><h2>The Remembrance Agent: current implementation</h2>

The Remembrance Agent (RA) is broken into two parts.  A front end
continuously watches what the user types and reads, and sends this
information to the back end.  The back end finds old email, notes files,
and on-line documents which are somehow relevant to the user&#39;s context.
This information is then displayed by the front end in a way which doesn&#39;t
distract from the user&#39;s primary task.  <p>

Currently, the front-end runs in elisp under Emacs-19, a UNIX based text
editor which can also be used for applications such as email, netnews, and
web access.  It displays one-line suggestions at the bottom of the emacs
display buffer, along with a numeric rating indicating how relevant it
thinks the document is. These suggestions contain just enough info to
relate the contents of the full document being suggested.  For example, the
suggestion line for a piece of email would contain who the email was from,
when it was sent, and its subject-line.  A notes file would contain the
file-name, date last modified, the first few words of the file, and perhaps
the owner of the file.  With a simple key combination, the user can bring
up the full text of a suggested document.  The frequency with which the
front end provides new suggestions, the number of suggestions, and whether
to look at text notes files, old email, or other document sources is
customizable for each user.  The user can also customize how much of their
current document the RA looks at when creating a suggestion.  For example,
the top display line may look at the last 500 words when making a
suggestion, the two lines at the last 50 words, and the bottom line at the
last 10 words.  In this way, the RA can be relevant both to the user&#39;s
overarching context and to any tangent they happen to be on. </p><p>

The current implementation uses the SMART information retrieval program as
a back end, which decides  document similarity based on the frequency of
words common to the query and reference documents (Salton &amp; Lesk 1971).
SMART indexes all the document sources nightly, and also supplies relevant
documents based on the &#34;query&#34; text supplied by the front end.  While SMART
is not as sophisticated as many more modern information-retrieval systems,
it has the advantage that it requires no human pre-processing of the
documents being indexed. </p><h2>Evaluation</h2>

One difficulty in evaluating a system such as the RA is that there is a
large difference between relevant suggestions (those that have a strong
relation to the user&#39;s current context), and useful suggestions.  For
example, if the user receives email about ballroom dancing and the RA
suggests an announcement for a ballroom dance event, that suggestion is
highly relevant.  However, if the event being announced occurred six months
ago, that suggestion may be completely useless.  Furthermore, a suggestion
which might be useful in some situations might be more of an annoyance if
the user is trying to concentrate on their primary task.  For this reason,
traditional methods of evaluation compare computer-generated relevancy
scores with a human&#39;s opinion of relevancy (Harman, 1995) don&#39;t work well.
Since the usefulness of the RA depends on the user&#39;s current task, what
they already remember, how focused they are on their task, and a large
number of other factors it can only be evaluated properly in the context of
actual use.   <p>

The RA has been in alpha testing for about three months on a small number
of platforms, so usability testing up to this point has been limited to a
few users / developers.  The beta-test version is now being released to a
much larger user-base, so usability test will be starting shortly based
both upon user surveys and logs of how often users bring up the full text
of a suggestion.  However, despite the small numbers of users in the
alpha-testing, many lessons have been learned regarding both how the RA
should be designed and to what areas it should be applied.  These lessons
are discussed in the next section. </p><h2>Design Issues</h2>

There are three different ways of handling the timing of an automated task.
The first is to perform a task only when specifically requested.
Spell-checking a file and performing a web-search fall into this category.
A second way is for an automated task to always lurk in the background, but
to only act when a specific &#34;trigger&#34; occurs.  Such programs include
calendar programs that automatically tell you when you&#39;re going to be late
for a meeting, and programs that alert you when you have new email waiting.
Finally, there are tasks which are performed continuously, like a clock
program or CPU-load meter.  The RA falls into this third category.  <p>

There are several reasons for this design decision.  As stated earlier,
systems which only provide information &#34;on request&#34;  can&#39;t help with
associative recall.  The user has to know that there is knowledge to be had
in a particular situation.  The RA therefore needs at least some ability to
be proactive in its suggestions.  However, unlike the calendar program that
warns of upcoming meetings, it is impossible to create a back end which can
reliably know when a document is useful for a user.  Thus the RA will
always suggest many false positives.  It is also far less important that a
user see an individual suggestion than it is for a calendar program.  If
the RA only displayed a suggestion when the relevance passed a certain
threshold, the users&#39; attention would be drawn away from their primary task
whenever a new suggestion appeared.  With the high ratio of
false-positives, this would rapidly become a prohibitive distraction. </p><p>

For these reasons the RA&#39;s suggestions are kept unobtrusive.  There should
be no (or at least minimal) cost to the user to see a suggestion and ignore
it if deemed not useful at the time.  Suggestions are therefore kept to a
single line each, and are always printed at the bottom of the text-editor
window.  The full display area is also limited to a maximum of 9 lines,
though it defaults to operating with only three or four.  Finally, no color
cues or highlights were used in the suggestion-display area, and the
suggestions are only changed every 10 seconds or so to further avoid
distraction from the primary task.  However, suggestions must also pack
enough information to allow users to judge their usefulness quickly.
Especially important is a date field, as the age of a document is often the
best indicator of whether it is useful in a given situation.  In some
cases, the description line supplies desired information directly without
ever needing the full document.  For example, it might provide the spelling
of the last name of someone who recently sent email.   </p><p>

While suggestions are unobtrusive, it must be trivial both to access the
entirety of a suggested document and to return to the primary document once
the new one has been viewed.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that any more
than a second or two delay in bringing up a document is a serious barrier
to regular use.  In the current implementation, &#34;control-c&#34; and the display
line-number brings up the suggested document.  It is similarly easy to get
back to the primary document.</p><p>

Using the system has shown that suggestions are much more useful when the
document being suggested only contains one &#34;nugget&#34; of information, and
when that nugget is clearly displayed on its one-line description.  This
&#34;less is more&#34; approach solves several problems.  First, it allows the user
to tell what a suggestion contains from its description without having to
peruse the entire document.  Second, a document with only one primary point
is more likely to be  a good hit.  Documents which address several issues
will rarely match the user&#39;s situation exactly, but will often partially
match.  Finally, if a suggested document is read, the shorter it is the
quicker the user can get on with their primary work.  Email and short notes
files seem to be a very good length for RA suggestions.  In future versions
of the RA, longer documents will be broken up into pieces during indexing
so that a suggestion can relate to a particular piece.</p><p>

Personal email and notes files are a good source of documents for other
reasons as well.  Most importantly, they are both pre-personalized to the
individual user and automatically change as the user&#39;s interest changes.
This is one of the more important features of the RA, because it means that
through proper choice of data to index the RA automatically adapts to the
individual user.  This guarantees that the pool of suggestions is much
richer in potentially interesting information than, for example, the Web,
and also helps solve many synonym problems.  For example, when an AI
researcher mentions &#34;agents&#34; in a paper, that person&#39;s RA will suggest work
on autonomous agents.  A chemist&#39;s RA, on the other hand, will bring up
lists of various solvents and other chemical agents. </p><p>

Some of the future applications discussed in the next section require using
non-personalized indexes, which is analogous to using another person&#39;s
memory.  However, there are disadvantages beyond those discussed above.
For example, it is harder to judge the content of a suggestion  from its
one-line summary when the user is less familiar with it.  The user might
also not be able to properly judge the validity of an unfamiliar
suggestion.  For example, they might not know that a set of instructions
were made in jest, or were in a subsequent message shown to be incorrect.
Similarly, documentation or lectures geared towards one kind of audience
may be inappropriate for another, so it helps when the original context is
well understood.  Finally, there are privacy issues when using someone
else&#39;s memories.  Even if one accesses someone&#39;s email files with express
permission, the people who sent that person mail might not have approved.
</p><h2>Future Applications</h2>

<h3>Wearable computing</h3>

When running on a desktop computer, an RA can only guess the user&#39;s context
based on the document they are reading or editing.  However, the advent of
wearable computing (Starner et al. 1995) will allow RAs to work with much
more information and many more situations.  Global Positioning Systems
(GPS) will let the RA know where the user is, while camera and face
recognition will let it know who they&#39;re talking to.  With this extra
information, a (greatly enhanced) RA could know that it is around lunch
time, that according to camera input the user is with her lunch date,
according to her appointment book she has an appointment with her boss in
an hour, and according to her GPS she&#39;s downtown.  From this information it
could recommend several good restaurants known for their fast service that
are within a few blocks of downtown, which would be agreeable to her lunch
date as well.<h3>Reference advisor for technical papers</h3>

Another application currently being pursued is to have the RA suggest
technical reports on a given subject.  When it recommends other
researchers&#39; papers, these could be referenced or tagged for later reading.
When it recommends one&#39;s own old papers, these can be scanned for similar
material which might be used in the new paper.  Such a system could also
recommend conferences where the call-for-papers is similar in content to
one&#39;s own paper.<h3>Knowledge transfer</h3>

One of the large difficulties facing industry is bringing new members of an
existing work-group up to speed quickly.  If a work-group created its own
knowledge-base, new members could access the group Remembrance Agent.  This
would not only give the employee access to the group knowledge itself (as
would any database), but also to the meta-knowledge of when particular
information is relevant or valuable.  Similar applications would exist
wherever just-in-time training is required.  While this application uses a
knowledge base not familiar to the user at first, they will not suffer too
greatly from the lack-of-context problem discussed above because the
knowledge is focused on their current situation, namely their new position
within the group.  Any context they do not yet know, they need to learn
anyway, and the RA will help them learn it. <h3>Automatic Hypertexting</h3>
In the past year several on-line magazines have appeared, such as HotWired
(HotWired), many of which have paper counterparts.  One of the values added
by the on-line versions of these magazines are hyper-linked text, where a
reader can click on a word and get more information on that subject.  A
future RA could conceivably automatically turn normal email, netnews, or
papers into hyper-linked documents, automatically linking hot-words to
relevant background information.<h3>Background checker</h3>

Another Web-based RA could perform background checks on people sending
mail, referenced in papers, or recognized by a wearable-computer-mounted
camera.  Such an RA could automatically provide information on a person&#39;s
employer, job title, phone numbers, and profiles of  their interests based
on newsgroups they frequent.  At the click of a button, the user could
access that person&#39;s home-page for even more information.  <h3>Other future work</h3>

The current RA is only personalized through using personal data as the
suggestion pool, and by reindexing that data every night.  However, it
cannot learn which of these suggested documents are actually useful.  To
solve this problem, the back-end is being provided with an algorithm which
learns based on which suggestions the user asks to have displayed. This way
useless suggestions can be culled out over time and new ones tried. <h3>Related work</h3>

While most information retrieval efforts have focused on query-response
tasks (Harman, 1995), a few systems exist which continuously present the
user with suggested web-documents based on the user&#39;s interests and the
web-document currently being viewed.  WebWatcher (Armstrong, Freitag,
Joachims, and Mitchell, 1995) is one such system, though it requires
explicit interaction to indicate interest in certain topics.   Another
continuously proactive web-browsing system is Letizia (Lieberman, 1995),
which bases it&#39;s suggestions entirely on the user&#39;s past browsing activity
and links from their current page.  Letizia suggests pages within a few
links of the current page, and brings them up in a separate window for the
user to view or ignore as required.<h2>References</h2>
