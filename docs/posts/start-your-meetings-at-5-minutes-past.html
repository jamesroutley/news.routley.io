			<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/phb-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"/>I <a href="https://philipotoole.com/resume/">work as an Engineering Manager</a> at <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, and my teams practice a simple habit – we book all meetings to start at five minutes past the hour (or half hour).</span></p>

<p><span>This works better than trying to finish five minutes early. Meetings often don’t finish on time, and the impact is highest with back-to-back meetings. If you try to end at 1:55pm, you will likely talk until 2:00pm anyway, which then runs into the next meeting. But shifting the start time usually guarantees a break. Why? Because there is strong social pressure not to allow meetings to run much past the top of the hour <strong>when that is the official end-time</strong>. The same social pressure applies to meetings that end at the half-hour.</span></p>
<p><span>That short break changes the tone of a meeting. It takes a minute or two to move between events, even online. When people arrive at 1:05pm, they are settled and less stressed. You might fear that people will start arriving at 1:07pm, but I have seen the opposite. They respect the new time. They arrive by 1:05pm, ready to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Do we lose five minutes in every meeting? In theory, yes. </span><span>But meetings rarely started on the dot anyway before this change.</span></p>
<p><span>On balance, it is a win. The best proof is that the entire org does it now (the org didn’t copy my team — it just started organically), even though it is not mandatory. Like good code, a good team is built on small, sane details. Giving people five minutes to clear their heads, between back-to-back meetings, is a detail that works.</span></p>
<p>Try it — you’ll see it improves your day.</p>
