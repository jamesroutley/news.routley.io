    <h1>I tricked myself into working out 3 times per week</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>I’ve always liked doing different sports. Playing soccer, beach volleyball, skiing, playing squash, and so on. After I stopped playing soccer in school, about 15 years ago, I only worked out every now and then. Often just once or twice a month. Maybe even less. But I wanted to change that, without being able.</p><p>Rewind to summer 2018. I was hiking with my mom and my brother. My brother told me had been working out three times a week for a few years. He has inner motivation to do it - completely opposite of me. We talked about ways to get me into it, and landed on a bet.</p><blockquote><p>Every week you don’t work out 3 times, you pay the other one 20 USD</p></blockquote><p><span>It’s incredibly simple, yet incredibly powerful. If I fail, I pay him. If he fails, he pays me. Since we started ~3,5 years – 200 weeks – ago, I’ve had to pay him maybe ten times. While he’s only paid me like 2-3 times… But that means I’ve been working out three times a week for ~95% of the last weeks</span><a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a><span>. That’s a godzillion times better than what I did before!</span></p><p><strong>Some thoughts and principles</strong></p><ul><li><p><span>It’s trust-based. No reporting needed. You just say “</span><em>I didn’t make make it this week</em><span>” and transfer the money, so the overhead cost is practically nonexistent. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Set a realistic, </span><em>long-term </em><span>goal. I’ve heard friends that make short-term bets - “work out 6 times a week for two months”. You can probably do it, but as soon as the bet is over, it’s back to old routines. 3 times a week is my long-term goal.</span></p></li><li><p>You don’t need to have the same goal. Your goal might be twice a week, and your friend’s goal might be four times a week.</p></li><li><p>A ramp-up period might be nice. The first 10 weeks my goal was 2 times per week, before I moved to 3 times per week.</p></li><li><p>If you keep failing on a realistic exercise goal, i.e., it’s realistic given your time constraints and it’s a goal you want to achieve, turn up the bet. Everyone has their economic pain point.</p></li><li><p>I wish I hadn’t learnt this, but running while hangover is absolutely doable.</p></li></ul><p>I have friends who have been talking about their desire to work out regularly, and still they’ve written this method off. I believe it’s because they actually do not want it enough, but I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts of why this would not work and why.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
