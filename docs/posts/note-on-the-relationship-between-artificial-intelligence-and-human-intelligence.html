<p>I. <b> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></b></p>
<p>1.  With wisdom both ancient and new (cf. Mt. 13:52), we are called to reflect on 
the current challenges and opportunities posed by scientific and technological 
advancements, particularly by the recent development of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI). The Christian tradition regards the gift of intelligence as an essential aspect 
of how humans are created “in the image of God” (Gen. 1:27). Starting from an 
integral vision of the human person and the biblical calling to “till” and 
“keep” the earth (Gen. 2:15), the Church emphasizes that this gift of 
intelligence should be expressed through the responsible use of reason and 
technical abilities in the stewardship of the created world. </p>
<p>2. The Church encourages the advancement of science, technology, the arts, and 
other forms of human endeavor, viewing them as part of the “collaboration of man 
and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.”<a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> As Sirach affirms, God “gave skill to human beings, that he might be 
glorified in his marvelous works” (Sir. 38:6). Human abilities and creativity 
come from God and, when used rightly, glorify God by reflecting his wisdom and 
goodness. In light of this, when we ask ourselves what it means to “be human,” 
we cannot exclude a consideration of our scientific and technological abilities.</p>
<p>3. It is within this perspective that the present <i>Note</i> addresses the 
anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI—issues that are particularly 
significant, as one of the goals of this technology is <i>to imitate the human 
intelligence that designed it. </i>For instance, unlike many other human 
creations, AI can be trained on the results of human creativity and then 
generate new “artifacts” with a level of speed and skill that often rivals or 
surpasses what humans can do, such as producing text or images indistinguishable 
from human compositions. This raises critical concerns about AI’s potential role 
in the growing crisis of truth in the public forum. Moreover, this technology is 
designed to learn and make certain choices autonomously, adapting to new 
situations and providing solutions not foreseen by its programmers, and thus, it 
raises fundamental questions about ethical responsibility and human safety, with 
broader implications for society as a whole. This new situation has prompted 
many people to reflect on what it means to be human and the role of humanity in 
the world.</p>
<p>4. Taking all this into account, there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and 
significant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the 
heart of what Pope Francis has described as an “epochal change.”<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Its impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including 
interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and 
international relations. As AI advances rapidly toward even greater 
achievements, it is critically important to consider its anthropological and 
ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing 
harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress 
and the common good.</p>
<p>5. To contribute positively to the discernment regarding AI, and in response to 
Pope Francis’ call for a renewed “wisdom of heart,”<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> the Church offers its experience through the anthropological and ethical 
reflections contained in this <i>Note</i>. Committed to its active role in the 
global dialogue on these issues, the Church invites those entrusted with 
transmitting the faith—including parents, teachers, pastors, and bishops—to 
dedicate themselves to this critical subject with care and attention. While this 
document is intended especially for them, it is also meant to be accessible to a 
broader audience, particularly those who share the conviction that scientific 
and technological advances should be directed toward serving the human person 
and the common good.<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>6. To this end, the document begins by distinguishing between concepts of 
intelligence in AI and in human intelligence. It then explores the Christian 
understanding of human intelligence, providing a framework rooted in the 
Church’s philosophical and theological tradition. Finally, the document offers 
guidelines to ensure that the development and use of AI uphold human dignity and 
promote the integral development of the human person and society.</p>
<p>II. <b> <a name="What_is_Artificial_Intelligence">What is Artificial Intelligence?</a></b></p>
<p>7. The concept of “intelligence” in AI has evolved over time, drawing on a range of 
ideas from various disciplines. While its origins extend back centuries, a 
significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John 
McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the 
problem of “Artificial Intelligence,” which he defined as “that of making a 
machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so 
behaving.”<a name="_ftnref5" title="" href="#_ftn5"> [5]</a> This workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines 
capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and 
intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>8. Since then, AI research has advanced rapidly, leading to the development of 
complex systems capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks.<a name="_ftnref6" title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> These so-called “narrow AI” systems are typically designed to handle 
specific and limited functions, such as translating languages, predicting the 
trajectory of a storm, classifying images, answering questions, or generating 
visual content at the user’s request. While the definition of “intelligence” in 
AI research varies, most contemporary AI systems—particularly those using 
machine learning—rely on statistical inference rather than logical deduction. By 
analyzing large datasets to identify patterns, AI can “predict”<a name="_ftnref7" title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> outcomes and propose new approaches, mimicking some cognitive processes 
typical of human problem-solving. Such achievements have been made possible 
through advances in computing technology (including neural networks, 
unsupervised machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms) as well as hardware 
innovations (such as specialized processors). Together, these technologies 
enable AI systems to respond to various forms of human input, adapt to new 
situations, and even suggest novel solutions not anticipated by their original 
programmers.<a name="_ftnref8" title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>9. Due to these rapid advancements, many tasks once managed exclusively by humans 
are now entrusted to AI. These systems can augment or even supersede what humans 
are able to do in many fields, particularly in specialized areas such as data 
analysis, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. While each “narrow AI” 
application is designed for a specific task, many researchers aspire to develop 
what is known as “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI)—a single system capable 
of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the 
scope of human intelligence. Some even argue that AGI could one day achieve the 
state of “superintelligence,” surpassing human intellectual capacities, or 
contribute to “super-longevity” through advances in biotechnology. Others, 
however, fear that these possibilities, even if hypothetical, could one day 
eclipse the human person, while still others welcome this potential 
transformation.<a name="_ftnref9" title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>10. Underlying this and 
many other perspectives on the subject is the implicit assumption that the term 
“intelligence” can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence 
and AI. Yet, this does not capture the full scope of the concept. In the case of humans, 
intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, 
whereas in the context of AI, “intelligence” is understood functionally, often 
with the presumption that the activities characteristic of the human mind can be 
broken down into digitized steps that machines can replicate.<a name="_ftnref10" title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>11. This functional 
perspective is exemplified by the “Turing Test,” which considers a machine 
“intelligent” if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from that of a human.<a name="_ftnref11" title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> However, in this context, the term “behavior” refers only to the 
performance of specific intellectual tasks; it does not account for the full 
breadth of human experience, which includes abstraction, emotions, creativity, 
and the aesthetic, moral, and religious sensibilities. Nor does it encompass the 
full range of expressions characteristic of the human mind. Instead, in the case 
of AI, the “intelligence” of a system is evaluated methodologically, but also 
reductively, based on its<i> ability to produce appropriate responses—in this 
case, those associated with the human intellect—regardless of how those 
responses are generated</i>.</p>
<p>12. AI’s advanced features 
give it sophisticated abilities to <i>perform tasks</i>, but not the ability to
<i>think</i>.<a name="_ftnref12" title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> This distinction is crucially important, as the way “intelligence” is 
defined inevitably shapes how we understand the relationship between human 
thought and this technology.<a name="_ftnref13" title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> To appreciate this, one must recall the richness of the philosophical 
tradition and Christian theology, which offer a deeper and more comprehensive 
understanding of intelligence—an understanding that is central to the Church’s 
teaching on the nature, dignity, and vocation of the human person.<a name="_ftnref14" title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>III. <b> <a name="Intelligence_in_the_Philosophical">Intelligence in the Philosophical</a> and Theological Tradition</b></p>
<p><i><a name="Rationality">Rationality</a></i></p>
<p>13. From the dawn of human 
self-reflection, the mind has played a central role in understanding what it 
means to be “human.” Aristotle observed that “all people by nature desire to 
know.”<a name="_ftnref15" title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> This knowledge, with its capacity for abstraction that grasps the nature 
and meaning of things, sets humans apart from the animal world.<a name="_ftnref16" title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> As philosophers, theologians, and psychologists have examined the exact 
nature of this intellectual faculty, they have also explored how humans 
understand the world and their unique place within it. Through this exploration, 
the Christian tradition has come to understand the human person as a being 
consisting of both body and soul—deeply connected to this world and yet 
transcending it.<a name="_ftnref17" title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>14. In the classical 
tradition, the concept of intelligence is often understood through the 
complementary concepts of “reason” (<i>ratio</i>) and “intellect” (<i>intellectus</i>). 
These are not separate faculties but, as Saint Thomas Aquinas explains, they are 
two modes in which the same intelligence operates: “The term <i>intellect</i> is 
inferred from the inward grasp of the truth, while the name <i>reason</i> is 
taken from the inquisitive and discursive process.”<a name="_ftnref18" title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> This concise description highlights the two fundamental and complementary 
dimensions of human intelligence. <i>Intellectus</i> refers to the intuitive 
grasp of the truth—that is, apprehending it with the “eyes” of the mind—which 
precedes and grounds argumentation itself. <i>Ratio</i> pertains to reasoning 
proper: the discursive, analytical process that leads to judgment. Together, 
intellect and reason form the two facets of the act of <i>intelligere</i>, “the 
proper operation of the human being as such.”<a name="_ftnref19" title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>15. Describing the human 
person as a “rational” being does not reduce the person to a specific mode of 
thought; rather, it recognizes that the ability for intellectual understanding 
shapes and permeates all aspects of human activity.<a name="_ftnref20" title="" href="#_ftn20"> [20]</a> Whether exercised well or poorly, this capacity is an intrinsic aspect of 
human nature. In this sense, the “term ‘rational’ encompasses all the capacities 
of the human person,” including those related to “knowing and understanding, as 
well as those of willing, loving, choosing, and desiring; it also includes all 
corporeal functions closely related to these abilities.”<a name="_ftnref21" title="" href="#_ftn21"> [21]</a> This comprehensive perspective underscores how, in the human person, 
created in the “image of God,” reason is integrated in a way that elevates, 
shapes, and transforms both the person’s will and actions.<a name="_ftnref22" title="" href="#_ftn22"> [22]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="Embodiment">Embodiment</a></i></p>
<p>16. Christian thought 
considers the intellectual faculties of the human person within the framework of 
an integral anthropology that views the human being as essentially embodied. In 
the human person, spirit and matter “are not two natures united, but rather 
their union forms a single nature.”<a name="_ftnref23" title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> In other words, the soul is not merely the immaterial “part” of the person 
contained within the body, nor is the body an outer shell housing an intangible 
“core.” Rather, the entire human person is simultaneously both material and 
spiritual. This understanding reflects the teaching of Sacred Scripture, which 
views the human person as a being who lives out relationships with God and 
others (and thus, an authentically spiritual dimension) within and through this 
embodied existence.<a name="_ftnref24" title="" href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> The profound meaning of this condition is further illuminated by the 
mystery of the Incarnation, through which God himself took on our flesh and 
“raised it up to a sublime dignity.”<a name="_ftnref25" title="" href="#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>17. Although deeply rooted 
in bodily existence, the human person transcends the material world through the 
soul, which is “almost on the horizon of eternity and time.”<a name="_ftnref26" title="" href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> The intellect&#39;s capacity for transcendence and the self-possessed freedom 
of the will belong to the soul, by which the human person “shares in the light 
of the divine mind.”<a name="_ftnref27" title="" href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> Nevertheless, the human spirit does not exercise its normal mode of 
knowledge without the body.<a name="_ftnref28" title="" href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> In this way, the intellectual faculties of the human person are an 
integral part of an anthropology that recognizes that the human person is a 
“unity of body and soul.”<a name="_ftnref29" title="" href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> Further aspects of this understanding will be developed in what follows.</p>
<p><i><a name="Relationality">Relationality</a></i></p>
<p>18.  Human 
beings are “ordered by their very nature to interpersonal communion,”<a name="_ftnref30" title="" href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> 
 possessing the capacity to know one another, to give themselves in love, and to 
enter into communion with others. Accordingly, human intelligence is not an 
isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest 
expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and 
we learn through others.</p>
<p>19. The relational orientation of the human person is ultimately grounded in the 
eternal self-giving of the Triune God, whose love is revealed in creation and 
redemption.<a name="_ftnref31" title="" href="#_ftn31">[31]</a> The human person is “called to share, by knowledge and love, in God’s own 
life.”<a name="_ftnref32" title="" href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></p>
<p>20. This vocation to 
communion with God is necessarily tied to the call to communion with others. 
Love of God cannot be separated from love for one’s neighbor (cf. 1 Jn. 4:20; 
Mt. 22:37-39). By the grace of sharing God’s life, Christians are also called to 
imitate Christ’s outpouring gift (cf. 2 Cor. 9:8-11; Eph. 5:1-2) by following 
his command to “love one another, as I have loved you” (Jn. 13:34).<a name="_ftnref33" title="" href="#_ftn33">[33]</a> Love and service, echoing the divine life of self-giving, transcend 
self-interest to respond more fully to the human vocation (cf. 1 Jn. 2:9). Even 
more sublime than knowing many things is the commitment to care for one another, 
for if “I understand all mysteries and all knowledge 
[...] but do not have love, I am nothing” (1 Cor. 13:2).</p>
<p><i><a name="Relationship_with_the_Truth">Relationship with the Truth</a></i></p>
<p>21. Human intelligence is ultimately “God’s gift fashioned for the assimilation of 
truth.”<a name="_ftnref34" title="" href="#_ftn34">[34]</a>In the dual sense of <i>intellectus</i>-<i>ratio</i>, it enables the person to 
explore realities that surpass mere sensory experience or utility, since “the 
desire for truth is part of human nature itself. It is an innate property of 
human reason to ask why things are as they are.”<a name="_ftnref35" title="" href="#_ftn35">[35]</a> Moving beyond the limits of empirical data, human intelligence can “with 
genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable.”<a name="_ftnref36" title="" href="#_ftn36">[36]</a> While reality remains only partially known, the desire for truth “spurs 
reason always to go further; indeed, it is as if reason were overwhelmed to see 
that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.”<a name="_ftnref37" title="" href="#_ftn37">[37]</a> Although Truth in itself transcends the boundaries of human intelligence, 
it irresistibly attracts it.<a name="_ftnref38" title="" href="#_ftn38">[38]</a> Drawn by this attraction, the human person is led to seek “truths of a 
higher order.”<a name="_ftnref39" title="" href="#_ftn39">[39]</a></p>
<p>22.  This innate drive toward the pursuit of truth is especially evident in the 
distinctly human capacities for semantic understanding and creativity,<a name="_ftnref40" title="" href="#_ftn40">[40]</a> through which this search unfolds in a “manner that is appropriate to the 
social nature and dignity of the human person.”<a name="_ftnref41" title="" href="#_ftn41">[41]</a> Likewise, a steadfast orientation to the truth is essential for charity to 
be both authentic and universal.<a name="_ftnref42" title="" href="#_ftn42">[42]</a></p>
<p>23. The search for truth 
finds its highest expression in openness to realities that transcend the 
physical and created world. In God, all truths attain their ultimate and original meaning.<a name="_ftnref43" title="" href="#_ftn43">[43]</a> Entrusting oneself to God is a “fundamental decision that engages the 
whole person.”<a name="_ftnref44" title="" href="#_ftn44">[44]</a><a name="_Hlk181548087">
</a>In this way, the human person becomes fully what he 
or she is called to be: “the intellect and the will display their spiritual 
nature,” enabling the person “to act in a way that realizes personal freedom to 
the full.”<a name="_ftnref45" title="" href="#_ftn45">[45]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="Stewardship_of_the_World">Stewardship of the World</a></i></p>
<p>24. The Christian faith 
understands creation as the free act of the Triune God, who, as Saint 
Bonaventure of Bagnoregio explains, creates “not to increase his glory, but to 
show it forth and to communicate it.”<a name="_ftnref46" title="" href="#_ftn46">[46]</a> Since God creates according to his Wisdom (cf. Wis. 9:9; Jer. 10:12), 
creation is imbued with an intrinsic order that reflects God’s plan (cf. Gen. 1; 
Dan. 2:21-22; Is. 45:18; Ps. 74:12-17; 104),<a name="_ftnref47" title="" href="#_ftn47">[47]</a> within which God has called human beings to assume a unique role: <i>to</i>
<i>cultivate and care for the world</i>.<a name="_ftnref48" title="" href="#_ftn48">[48]</a></p>
<p>25. Shaped by the Divine 
Craftsman, humans live out their identity as beings made <i>in imago Dei</i> by 
“keeping” and “tilling” (cf. Gen. 2:15) creation—using their intelligence and 
skills to care for and develop creation in accord with God’s plan.<a name="_ftnref49" title="" href="#_ftn49">[49]</a> In this, human intelligence reflects the Divine 
Intelligence that created all things (cf. Gen. 1-2; Jn. 1),<a name="_ftnref50" title="" href="#_ftn50">[50]</a> continuously sustains them, and guides them to their ultimate purpose in 
him.<a name="_ftnref51" title="" href="#_ftn51">[51]</a> Moreover, human beings are called to develop their abilities in science 
and technology, for through them, God is glorified (cf<i>. </i>Sir.<i> </i>
38:6). Thus, in a proper relationship with creation, humans, on the one hand, 
use their intelligence and skill to cooperate with God in guiding creation 
toward the purpose to which he has called it.<a name="_ftnref52" title="" href="#_ftn52">[52]</a> On the other hand, creation itself, as Saint Bonaventure observes, helps 
the human mind to “ascend gradually to the supreme Principle, who is God.”<a name="_ftnref53" title="" href="#_ftn53">[53]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="An_Integral">An Integral</a> Understanding of Human Intelligence</i></p>
<p>26. In this context, human 
intelligence becomes more clearly understood as a faculty that forms an integral 
part of how the whole person engages with reality. Authentic engagement requires 
embracing the full scope of one’s being: spiritual, cognitive, embodied, and 
relational.</p>
<p>27. This engagement with 
reality unfolds in various ways, as each person, in his or her multifaceted 
individuality<a name="_ftnref54" title="" href="#_ftn54">[54]</a>, seeks to understand the world, relate to others, solve problems, express 
creativity, and pursue integral well-being through the harmonious interplay of 
the various dimensions of the person’s intelligence.<a name="_ftnref55" title="" href="#_ftn55">[55]</a> This involves logical and linguistic abilities but can also encompass 
other modes of interacting with reality. Consider the work of an artisan, who 
“must know how to discern, in inert matter, a particular form that others cannot 
recognize”<a name="_ftnref56" title="" href="#_ftn56">[56]</a> and bring it forth through insight and practical skill. Indigenous peoples 
who live close to the earth often possess a profound sense of nature and its 
cycles.<a name="_ftnref57" title="" href="#_ftn57">[57]</a> Similarly, a friend who knows the right word to say or a person adept at 
managing human relationships exemplifies an intelligence that is “the fruit of 
self-examination, dialogue and generous encounter between persons.”<a name="_ftnref58" title="" href="#_ftn58">[58]</a> As Pope Francis observes, “in this age of artificial intelligence, we 
cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity.”<a name="_ftnref59" title="" href="#_ftn59">[59]</a></p>
<p>28. At the heart of the 
Christian understanding of intelligence is the integration of truth into the 
moral and spiritual life of the person, guiding his or her actions in light of 
God’s goodness and truth. According to God’s plan, 
intelligence, in its fullest sense, also includes the ability to savor what is 
true, good, and beautiful. As the twentieth-century 
French poet Paul Claudel expressed, “intelligence is nothing without delight.”<a name="_ftnref60" title="" href="#_ftn60">[60]</a> 
Similarly, Dante, upon reaching the highest heaven in <i>Paradiso</i>, testifies 
that the culmination of this intellectual delight is found in the “light 
intellectual full of love, love of true good filled with joy, joy which 
transcends every sweetness.”<a name="_ftnref61" title="" href="#_ftn61">[61]</a></p>
<p>29. A proper understanding 
of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of 
facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the 
person’s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation 
toward the True and the Good.<a name="_ftnref62" title="" href="#_ftn62">[62]</a> As an expression of the divine image within the person, human intelligence 
has the ability to access the totality of being, contemplating existence in its 
fullness, which goes beyond what is measurable, and grasping the meaning of what 
has been understood. For believers, this capacity includes, in a particular way, 
the ability to grow in the knowledge of the mysteries of God by using reason to 
engage ever more profoundly with revealed truths (<i>intellectus fidei</i>).<a name="_ftnref63" title="" href="#_ftn63">[63]</a> True intelligence is shaped by divine love, which “is poured forth in our 
hearts by the Holy Spirit” (Rom. 5:5). From this, it follows that human 
intelligence possesses an essential <i>contemplative </i>dimension, an unselfish 
openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian 
purpose.</p>
<p><i><a name="The_Limits_of_AI">The Limits of AI</a></i></p>
<p>30. In light of the 
foregoing discussion, the differences between human intelligence and current AI 
systems become evident. While AI is an extraordinary technological achievement capable of imitating 
certain outputs associated with human intelligence, it operates by performing 
tasks, achieving goals, or making decisions based on quantitative data and 
computational logic. For example, with its analytical power, AI excels at 
integrating data from a variety of fields, modeling complex systems, and 
fostering interdisciplinary connections. In this way, it can help experts 
collaborate in solving complex problems that “cannot be dealt with from a single 
perspective or from a single set of interests.”<a name="_ftnref64" title="" href="#_ftn64">[64]</a></p>
<p>31. However, even as AI 
processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains 
fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes 
inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically 
throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of 
lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine 
learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the 
developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied 
experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, 
and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals 
within their personal history.<b></b>In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and 
learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and 
knowledge. </p>
<p>32. Consequently, although 
AI can simulate aspects of human reasoning and perform specific tasks with incredible speed and efficiency, its computational 
abilities represent only a fraction of the broader capacities of the human mind. 
For instance, AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to 
establish authentic relationships. Moreover, human intelligence is situated 
within a personally lived history of intellectual and moral formation that 
fundamentally shapes the individual’s perspective, encompassing the physical, emotional, social, moral, 
and spiritual dimensions of life. Since AI cannot offer this fullness of 
understanding, approaches that rely solely on this technology or treat it as the 
primary means of interpreting the world can lead to “a loss of appreciation for 
the whole, for the relationships between things, and for the broader horizon.”<a name="_ftnref65" title="" href="#_ftn65">[65]</a></p>
<p>33. Human intelligence is 
not primarily about completing functional tasks but about understanding and 
actively engaging with reality in all its dimensions; it is also capable of 
surprising insights. Since AI lacks the richness of corporeality, relationality, 
and the openness of the human heart to truth and goodness, its capacities—though 
seemingly limitless—are incomparable with the human ability to grasp reality. So 
much can be learned from an illness, an embrace of reconciliation, and even a 
simple sunset; indeed, many experiences we have as humans open new horizons and 
offer the possibility of attaining new wisdom. No device, working solely with 
data, can measure up to these and countless other experiences present in our 
lives.</p>
<p>34. Drawing an overly 
close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a 
functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can 
perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific 
skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on 
the person’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.<a name="_ftnref66" title="" href="#_ftn66">[66]</a> This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including 
for those unable 
to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious 
person, or an older person who is suffering.<a name="_ftnref67" title="" href="#_ftn67"> [67]</a> It 
also underpins the tradition of human rights (and, in particular, 
what are now called “neuro-rights”), which represent “an important point of 
convergence in the search for common ground”<a name="_ftnref68" title="" href="#_ftn68">[68]</a> and can, thus, serve as a fundamental ethical guide in discussions on the 
responsible development and use of AI.</p>
<p>35. Considering all these 
points, as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word ‘intelligence’” in 
connection with AI “can prove misleading”<a name="_ftnref69" title="" href="#_ftn69">[69]</a> and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person. In light 
of this, AI should not be seen as <i>an artificial form </i>of<i> </i>human 
intelligence but as<i> a product </i>of<i> </i>it.<a name="_ftnref70" title="" href="#_ftn70">[70]</a></p>
<p>IV. <b> <a name="The_Role_of_Ethics">The Role of Ethics</a> in Guiding the Development and Use of AI</b></p>
<p>36. Given these 
considerations, one can ask how AI can be understood within God’s plan. To answer this, it is important to recall that 
techno-scientific activity is not neutral in character but is a <i>human </i>
endeavor that engages the humanistic and cultural dimensions of human 
creativity.<a name="_ftnref71" title="" href="#_ftn71">[71]</a></p>
<p>37. Seen as a fruit of the 
potential inscribed within human intelligence,<a name="_ftnref72" title="" href="#_ftn72">[72]</a> scientific inquiry and the development of technical skills are part of the 
“collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.”<a name="_ftnref73" title="" href="#_ftn73">[73]</a> At the same time, all scientific and technological achievements are, 
ultimately, gifts from God.<a name="_ftnref74" title="" href="#_ftn74">[74]</a> Therefore, human beings must always use their abilities in view of the 
higher purpose for which God has granted them.<a name="_ftnref75" title="" href="#_ftn75">[75]</a></p>
<p>38. We can gratefully 
acknowledge how technology has “remedied countless evils which used to harm and 
limit human beings,”<a name="_ftnref76" title="" href="#_ftn76">[76]</a> a fact for which we should rejoice. Nevertheless, not all technological 
advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.<a name="_ftnref77" title="" href="#_ftn77">[77]</a> The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the 
sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.<a name="_ftnref78" title="" href="#_ftn78">[78]</a> Like any human endeavor, technological development must be directed to 
serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of “greater justice, more 
extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations,” which are 
“more valuable than advances in the technical field.”<a name="_ftnref79" title="" href="#_ftn79">[79]</a> Concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are 
shared not only within the Church but also among many scientists, technologists, 
and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to 
guide this development in a responsible way. </p>
<p>39. To address these 
challenges, it is essential to emphasize <i>the importance of moral 
responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person</i>. 
This guiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, 
the ethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who 
design systems and determine the purposes for which they are used.<a name="_ftnref80" title="" href="#_ftn80">[80]</a> Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral 
agent—a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her 
decisions and accepts their consequences.<a name="_ftnref81" title="" href="#_ftn81">[81]</a> It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship with truth and 
goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person “to love and to do 
what is good and to avoid evil,”<a name="_ftnref82" title="" href="#_ftn82">[82]</a> bearing witness to “the authority of truth in reference to the supreme 
Good to which the human person is drawn.”<a name="_ftnref83" title="" href="#_ftn83">[83]</a> Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be 
sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of 
conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in 
every situation.<a name="_ftnref84" title="" href="#_ftn84">[84]</a> In fact, all of this also belongs to the person’s exercise of 
intelligence.</p>
<p>40. Like any product of 
human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends.<a name="_ftnref85" title="" href="#_ftn85">[85]</a> When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of 
individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation.
Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make 
decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here. Where human freedom allows for 
the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this 
technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.</p>
<p>41. At the same time, it 
is not only the ends that are ethically significant but also the means employed 
to achieve them. Additionally, the overall vision and understanding of the human 
person embedded within these systems are important to consider as well. 
Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, 
and regulators,<a name="_ftnref86" title="" href="#_ftn86">[86]</a> and have the power to “shape the world and engage consciences on the level 
of values.”<a name="_ftnref87" title="" href="#_ftn87">[87]</a> On a societal level, some technological developments could also reinforce 
relationships and power dynamics that are inconsistent with a proper 
understanding of the human person and society. </p>
<p>42. Therefore, the ends 
and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision 
it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and 
promote the common good.<a name="_ftnref88" title="" href="#_ftn88">[88]</a> As Pope Francis has stated, “the intrinsic dignity of every man and every 
woman” must be “the key criterion in evaluating emerging technologies; these 
will prove ethically sound to the extent that they help respect that dignity and 
increase its expression at every level of human life,”<a name="_ftnref89" title="" href="#_ftn89">[89]</a> including in the social and economic spheres. In this sense, human 
intelligence plays a crucial role not only in designing and producing technology 
but also in directing its use in line with the authentic good of the human 
person.<a name="_ftnref90" title="" href="#_ftn90">[90]</a> The responsibility for managing this wisely pertains to every level of 
society, guided by the principle of subsidiarity and other principles of 
Catholic Social Teaching. </p>
<p><i><a name="Helping_Human">Helping Human</a> Freedom and Decision-Making</i></p>
<p>43. The commitment to 
ensuring that <i>AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the 
dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation</i> serves 
as a criterion of discernment for developers, owners, operators, and regulators 
of AI, as well as to its users. It remains valid for every application of the 
technology at every level of its use.</p>
<p>44. An evaluation of the 
implications of this guiding principle could begin by considering the importance 
of <i>moral responsibility. </i>Since full moral causality belongs only to <i>
personal</i> agents, not artificial ones, it is crucial to be able to identify 
and define who bears responsibility for the processes involved in AI, 
particularly those capable of learning, correction, and reprogramming. While 
bottom-up approaches and very deep neural networks enable AI to solve complex 
problems, they make it difficult to understand the processes that lead to the 
solutions they adopted. This complicates accountability since if an AI 
application produces undesired outcomes, determining who is responsible becomes 
difficult. To address this problem, attention needs to be given to the nature of
<i>accountability </i>processes in complex, highly automated settings, where 
results may only become evident in the medium to long term. For this, it is 
important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with 
the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at 
each stage of the decision-making process.<a name="_ftnref91" title="" href="#_ftn91">[91]</a></p>
<p>45. In addition to 
determining who is responsible, it is essential to identify the objectives 
given to AI systems. Although these systems may use unsupervised autonomous 
learning mechanisms and sometimes follow paths that humans cannot reconstruct, 
they ultimately pursue goals that humans have assigned to them and are governed 
by processes established by their designers and programmers. Yet, this presents 
a challenge because, as AI models become increasingly capable of independent 
learning, the ability to maintain control over them to ensure that such 
applications serve human purposes may effectively diminish. This raises the 
critical question of how to ensure that AI systems are ordered for the good of 
people and not against them. </p>
<p>46. While responsibility 
for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who develop, produce, 
manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who use them. As Pope 
Francis noted, the machine “makes a technical choice among several possibilities 
based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences. Human 
beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.”<a name="_ftnref92" title="" href="#_ftn92">[92]</a> Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results create a 
context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have 
delegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the 
algorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle 
inconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and 
unintended side effects.<a name="_ftnref93" title="" href="#_ftn93">[93]</a> Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities remain 
accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate 
safeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability.<a name="_ftnref94" title="" href="#_ftn94">[94]</a> Moreover, those using AI should be careful not to become overly dependent 
on it for their decision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society’s 
already high reliance on technology.</p>
<p>47. The Church’s moral and 
social teaching provides resources to help ensure that AI is used in a way that 
preserves human agency. Considerations about justice, for example, should also 
address issues such as fostering just social dynamics, upholding international 
security, and promoting peace. By exercising prudence, individuals and 
communities can discern ways to use AI to benefit humanity while avoiding 
applications that could degrade human dignity or harm the environment. In this 
context, the concept of responsibility should be understood not only in its most 
limited sense but as a “responsibility for the care for others, which is more 
than simply accounting for results achieved.”<a name="_ftnref95" title="" href="#_ftn95">[95]</a></p>
<p>48. Therefore, AI, like 
any technology, can be part of a conscious and responsible answer to humanity’s 
vocation to the good. However, as previously discussed, AI must be directed by 
human intelligence<i> </i>to align with this vocation, ensuring it respects the 
dignity of the human person. Recognizing this “exalted dignity,” the Second 
Vatican Council affirmed that “the social order and its development must 
invariably work to the benefit of the human person.”<a name="_ftnref96" title="" href="#_ftn96">[96]</a> In light of this, the use of AI, as Pope Francis said, must be 
“accompanied by an ethic inspired by a vision of the common good, an ethic of 
freedom, responsibility, and fraternity, capable of fostering the full 
development of people in relation to others and to the whole of creation.”<a name="_ftnref97" title="" href="#_ftn97">[97]</a></p>
<p>V. <b> <a name="Specific_Questions">Specific Questions</a></b></p>
<p>49. Within this general 
perspective, some observations follow below to illustrate how the preceding 
arguments can help provide an ethical orientation in practical situations, in 
line with the “wisdom of heart” that Pope Francis has proposed.<a name="_ftnref98" title="" href="#_ftn98">[98]</a> 
While not exhaustive, this discussion is offered in service of the dialogue that 
considers how AI can be used to uphold the dignity of the human person and 
promote the common good.<a name="_ftnref99" title="" href="#_ftn99">[99]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Society">AI and Society</a></i></p>
<p>50. As Pope Francis 
observed, “the inherent dignity of each human being and the fraternity that 
binds us together as members of the one human family must undergird the 
development of new technologies and serve as indisputable criteria for 
evaluating them before they are employed<a name="_Int_Zt1Jg2IN">.”</a><a name="_ftnref100" title="" href="#_ftn100">[100]</a></p>
<p>51. Viewed through this 
lens, AI could “introduce important innovations in agriculture, education and 
culture, an improved level of life for entire nations and peoples, and the 
growth of human fraternity and social friendship,” and thus be “used to promote 
integral human development.”<a name="_ftnref101" title="" href="#_ftn101">[101]</a> AI could also help organizations identify those in need and counter 
discrimination and marginalization. These and other similar applications of this 
technology could contribute to human development and the common good.<a name="_ftnref102" title="" href="#_ftn102">[102]</a></p>
<p>52. However, while AI 
holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even 
counter human development and the common good. Pope Francis has noted that 
“evidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality 
in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also 
significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence.”<a name="_ftnref103" title="" href="#_ftn103">[103]</a> In this sense, AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and 
discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the “digital divide,” and 
worsen existing social inequalities.<a name="_ftnref104" title="" href="#_ftn104">[104]</a></p>
<p>53. Moreover, the 
concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few 
powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns. Exacerbating this 
problem is the inherent nature of AI systems, where no single individual can 
exercise complete oversight over the vast and complex datasets used for 
computation. This lack of well-defined accountability creates the risk that AI 
could be manipulated for personal or corporate gain or to direct public opinion 
for the benefit of a specific industry. Such entities, motivated by their own 
interests, possess the capacity to exercise “forms of control as subtle as they 
are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the 
democratic process.”<a name="_ftnref105" title="" href="#_ftn105">[105]</a></p>
<p>54.  Furthermore, there is 
the risk of AI being used to promote what Pope Francis has called the 
“technocratic paradigm,” which perceives all the world’s problems as solvable 
through technological means alone.<a name="_ftnref106" title="" href="#_ftn106">[106]</a> In this paradigm, human dignity and fraternity are often set aside in the 
name of efficiency, “as if reality, goodness, and truth automatically flow from 
technological and economic power as such.”<a name="_ftnref107" title="" href="#_ftn107">[107]</a> Yet, human dignity and the common good must never be violated for the sake 
of efficiency,<a name="_ftnref108" title="" href="#_ftn108">[108]</a> for “technological developments that do not lead to an improvement in the 
quality of life of all humanity, but on the contrary, aggravate inequalities and 
conflicts, can never count as true progress.”<a name="_ftnref109" title="" href="#_ftn109">[109]</a> Instead, AI should be put “at the service of another type of progress, one 
which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.”<a name="_ftnref110" title="" href="#_ftn110">[110]</a></p>
<p>55. Achieving 
this objective requires a deeper reflection on the relationship between autonomy 
and responsibility. Greater autonomy heightens each person’s responsibility 
across various aspects of communal life. For Christians, the foundation of this 
responsibility lies in the recognition that all human capacities, including the 
person’s autonomy, come from God and are meant to be used in the service of 
others<a name="_Int_JUdzKSa4">.</a><a name="_ftnref111" title="" href="#_ftn111">[111]</a> Therefore, rather than merely pursuing economic or technological 
objectives, AI should serve “the common good of the entire human family,” which 
is “the sum total of social conditions that allow people, either as groups or as 
individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.”<a name="_ftnref112" title="" href="#_ftn112">[112]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Human_Relationships">AI and Human Relationships</a></i></p>
<p>56. The Second Vatican 
Council observed that “by his innermost nature man is a social being; and if he 
does not enter into relations with others, he can neither live nor develop his 
gifts.”<a name="_ftnref113" title="" href="#_ftn113">[113]</a> This conviction underscores that living in society is intrinsic to the 
nature and vocation of the human person.<a name="_ftnref114" title="" href="#_ftn114">[114]</a> As social beings, we seek relationships that involve mutual exchange and 
the pursuit of truth, in the course of which, people “share with each other the 
truth they have discovered, or think they have discovered, in such a way that 
they help one another in the search for truth.”<a name="_ftnref115" title="" href="#_ftn115">[115]</a></p>
<p>57.  Such a quest, along 
with other aspects of human communication, presupposes encounters and mutual 
exchange between individuals shaped by their unique histories, thoughts, 
convictions, and relationships. Nor can we forget that human intelligence is a 
diverse, multifaceted, and complex reality: individual and social, rational and 
affective, conceptual and symbolic. Pope Francis underscores this dynamic, 
noting that “together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed 
conversation or in passionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance; it 
entails moments of silence and suffering, yet it can patiently embrace the 
broader experience of individuals and peoples. […] The process of building 
fraternity, be it local or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are 
free and open to authentic encounters.”<a name="_ftnref116" title="" href="#_ftn116">[116]</a></p>
<p>58. It is in this context 
that one can consider the challenges AI poses to human relationships. Like other 
technological tools, AI has the potential to foster connections within the human 
family. However, it could also hinder a true encounter with reality and, 
ultimately, lead people to “a deep and melancholic dissatisfaction with 
interpersonal relations, or a harmful sense of isolation.”<a name="_ftnref117" title="" href="#_ftn117">[117]</a> Authentic human relationships require the richness of being with others in 
their pain, their pleas, and their joy.<a name="_ftnref118" title="" href="#_ftn118">[118]</a> Since human intelligence is expressed and enriched also in interpersonal 
and embodied ways, authentic and spontaneous encounters with others are 
indispensable for engaging with reality in its fullness.</p>
<p>59. Because “true wisdom 
demands an encounter with reality,”<a name="_ftnref119" title="" href="#_ftn119">[119]</a> the rise of AI introduces another challenge. Since AI can effectively 
imitate the products of human intelligence, the ability to know when one is 
interacting with a human or a machine can no longer be taken for granted. 
Generative AI can produce text, speech, images, and other advanced outputs that 
are usually associated with human beings. Yet, it must be understood for what it 
is: a tool, not a person.<a name="_ftnref120" title="" href="#_ftn120">[120]</a> This distinction is often obscured by the language used by practitioners, 
which tends to anthropomorphize AI and thus blurs the line between human and 
machine. </p>
<p>60. Anthropomorphizing AI 
also poses specific challenges for the development of children, potentially 
encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat human 
relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such 
habits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information 
rather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral 
growth. Genuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to 
the good of the other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full 
development of the human person. </p>
<p>61. In this context, it is 
important to clarify that, despite the use of anthropomorphic language, no AI 
application can genuinely experience empathy. Emotions cannot be reduced to 
facial expressions or phrases generated in response to prompts; they reflect the 
way a person, as a whole, relates to the world and to his or her own life, with 
the body playing a central role. True empathy requires the ability to listen, 
recognize another’s irreducible uniqueness, welcome their otherness, and grasp 
the meaning behind even their silences.<a name="_ftnref121" title="" href="#_ftn121">[121]</a> Unlike the realm of analytical judgment in which AI excels, true empathy 
belongs to the relational sphere. It involves intuiting and apprehending the 
lived experiences of another while maintaining the distinction between self and 
other.<a name="_ftnref122" title="" href="#_ftn122">[122]</a> While AI can simulate empathetic responses, it cannot replicate the 
eminently personal and relational nature of authentic empathy.<a name="_ftnref123" title="" href="#_ftn123">[123]</a></p>
<p>62. In light of the above, 
it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing 
so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social 
trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts—such as in education or 
in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality—is also to be 
considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain 
transparency, and ensure the dignity of all <a name="_Int_d05vIJmL">people.</a><a name="_ftnref124" title="" href="#_ftn124">[124]</a></p>
<p>63.  In an increasingly 
isolated world, some people have turned to AI in search of deep human 
relationships, simple companionship, or even emotional bonds. However, while 
human beings are meant to experience authentic relationships, AI can only 
simulate them. Nevertheless, such relationships with 
others are an integral part of how a person grows to become who he or she is 
meant to be. If AI is used to help people foster genuine connections 
between people, it can contribute positively to the full realization of the 
person. Conversely, if we replace relationships with God and with others with 
interactions with technology, we risk replacing authentic relationality with a 
lifeless image (cf. Ps. 106:20; Rom. 1:22-23). Instead of retreating into 
artificial worlds, we are called to engage in a committed and intentional way 
with reality, especially by identifying with the poor and suffering, consoling 
those in sorrow, and forging bonds of communion with all. </p>
<p><i><a name="AI,_the_Economy,_and_Labor">AI, the Economy, and Labor</a></i></p>
<p>64. Due to its 
interdisciplinary nature, AI is being increasingly integrated into economic and 
financial systems. Significant investments are currently being made not only in 
the technology sector but also in energy, finance, and media, particularly in 
the areas of marketing and sales, logistics, technological innovation, 
compliance, and risk management. At the same time, AI’s applications in these 
areas have also highlighted its ambivalent nature, as a source of tremendous 
opportunities but also profound risks. A first real critical point in this area 
concerns the possibility that—due to the concentration of AI applications in the 
hands of a few corporations—only those large companies would benefit from the 
value created by AI rather than the businesses that use it.</p>
<p>65. Other broader aspects 
of AI’s impact on the economic-financial sphere must also be carefully examined, 
particularly concerning the interaction between concrete reality and the digital 
world. One important consideration in this regard involves the coexistence of 
diverse and alternative forms of economic and financial institutions within a 
given context. This factor should be encouraged, as it can bring benefits in how 
it supports the real economy by fostering its development and stability, 
especially during times of crisis. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that 
digital realities, not restricted by any spatial bonds, tend to be more 
homogeneous and impersonal than communities rooted in a particular place and a 
specific history, with a common journey characterized by shared values and 
hopes, but also by inevitable disagreements and divergences. This diversity is 
an undeniable asset to a community’s economic life. Turning over the economy and 
finance entirely to digital technology would reduce this variety and richness. 
As a result, many solutions to economic problems that can be reached through 
natural dialogue between the involved parties may no longer be attainable in a 
world dominated by procedures and only the appearance of nearness.</p>
<p>66. Another area where AI 
is already having a profound impact is the world of work. As in many other 
fields, AI is driving fundamental transformations across many professions, with 
a range of effects. On the one hand, it has the potential to enhance expertise 
and productivity, create new jobs, enable workers to focus on more innovative 
tasks, and open new horizons for creativity and innovation. </p>
<p>67. However, while AI 
promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently 
forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than 
machines being designed to support those who work. As a result, contrary to the 
advertised benefits of AI, current approaches to the technology can 
paradoxically <i>deskill</i> workers, subject them to automated surveillance, 
and relegate them to rigid and repetitive tasks. The need to keep up with the 
pace of technology can erode workers’ sense of agency and stifle
the innovative abilities they are expected to bring to 
their work.<a name="_ftnref125" title="" href="#_ftn125">[125]</a> </p>
<p>68. AI is currently 
eliminating the need for some jobs that were once performed by humans. If AI is 
used to replace human workers rather than complement them, there is a 
“substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the 
impoverishment of many.”<a name="_ftnref126" title="" href="#_ftn126">[126]</a> 
Additionally, as AI becomes more powerful, there is an associated risk that 
human labor may lose its value in the economic realm. This is the logical 
consequence of the technocratic paradigm: a world of humanity enslaved to 
efficiency, where, ultimately, the cost of humanity 
must be cut. Yet, human lives are intrinsically valuable, independent of their 
economic output. Nevertheless, the “current model,” Pope Francis explains, “does 
not appear to favor an investment in efforts to help the slow, the weak, or the 
less talented to find opportunities in life.”<a name="_ftnref127" title="" href="#_ftn127">[127]</a> 
In light of this, “we cannot allow a tool as powerful and indispensable as 
Artificial Intelligence to reinforce such a paradigm, but rather, we must make 
Artificial Intelligence a bulwark against its expansion.”<a name="_ftnref128" title="" href="#_ftn128"> [128]</a></p>
<p>69. It is important to 
remember that “the order of things must be subordinate to the order of persons, 
and not the other way around.”<a name="_ftnref129" title="" href="#_ftn129">[129]</a> 
Human work must not only be at the service of profit but at “the service of the 
whole human person […] taking into account the person’s material needs and the 
requirements of his or her intellectual, moral, spiritual, and religious life.”<a name="_ftnref130" title="" href="#_ftn130">[130]</a> 
In this context, the Church recognizes that work is “not only a means of earning 
one’s daily bread” but is also “an essential dimension of social life” and “a 
means […] of personal growth, the building of healthy relationships, 
self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work gives us a sense of shared 
responsibility for the development of the world, and ultimately, for our life as 
a people.”<a name="_ftnref131" title="" href="#_ftn131">[131]</a></p>
<p>70.  Since work is a “part 
of the meaning of life on this earth, a path to growth, human development and 
personal fulfillment,” “the goal should not be that technological progress 
increasingly replaces human work, for this would be detrimental to humanity”<a name="_ftnref132" title="" href="#_ftn132">[132]</a>—rather, 
it should promote human labor. Seen in this light, AI should assist, not 
replace, human judgment. Similarly, it must never degrade creativity or reduce 
workers to mere “cogs in a machine.” Therefore, “respect for the dignity of 
laborers and the importance of employment for the economic well-being of 
individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages, ought to 
be a high priority for the international community as these forms of technology 
penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.”<a name="_ftnref133" title="" href="#_ftn133">[133]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Healthcare">AI and Healthcare</a></i></p>
<p>71. As participants in 
God’s healing work, healthcare professionals have the vocation and 
responsibility to be “guardians and servants of human life.”<a name="_ftnref134" title="" href="#_ftn134">[134]</a> 
Because of this, the healthcare profession carries an “intrinsic and undeniable 
ethical dimension,” recognized by the Hippocratic Oath, which obliges physicians 
and healthcare professionals to commit themselves to having “absolute respect 
for human life and its sacredness.”<a name="_ftnref135" title="" href="#_ftn135">[135]</a> 
Following the example of the Good Samaritan, this commitment is to be carried 
out by men and women “who reject the creation of a society of exclusion, and act 
instead as neighbors, lifting up and rehabilitating the fallen for the sake of 
the common good.”<a name="_ftnref136" title="" href="#_ftn136">[136]</a></p>
<p>72. Seen in this light, AI 
seems to hold immense potential in a variety of applications in the medical 
field, such as assisting the diagnostic work of healthcare providers, 
facilitating relationships between patients and medical staff, offering new 
treatments, and expanding access to quality care also for those who are isolated 
or marginalized. In these ways, the technology could enhance the “compassionate 
and loving closeness”<a name="_ftnref137" title="" href="#_ftn137">[137]</a> that 
healthcare providers are called to extend to the sick and suffering.</p>
<p>73. However, if AI is used 
not to enhance but to replace the relationship between patients and healthcare 
providers—leaving patients to interact with a machine rather than a human 
being—it would reduce a crucially important human relational structure to a 
centralized, impersonal, and unequal framework. Instead of encouraging 
solidarity with the sick and suffering, such applications of AI would risk 
worsening the loneliness that often accompanies illness, especially in the 
context of a culture where “persons are no longer seen as a paramount value to 
be cared for and respected.”<a name="_ftnref138" title="" href="#_ftn138">[138]</a> 
This misuse of AI would not align with respect for the dignity of the human 
person and solidarity with the suffering.</p>
<p>74. Responsibility for the 
well-being of patients and the decisions that touch upon their lives are at the 
heart of the healthcare profession. This accountability requires medical 
professionals to exercise all their skill and intelligence in making 
well-reasoned and ethically grounded choices regarding those entrusted to their 
care, always respecting the inviolable dignity of the patients and the need for 
informed consent. As a result, decisions regarding patient treatment and the 
weight of responsibility they entail must always remain with the human person 
and should never be delegated to AI.<a name="_ftnref139" title="" href="#_ftn139">[139]</a></p>
<p>75. In addition, using AI 
to determine who should receive treatment based predominantly on economic 
measures or metrics of efficiency represents a particularly problematic instance 
of the “technocratic paradigm” that must be rejected.<a name="_ftnref140" title="" href="#_ftn140">[140]</a> 
For, “optimizing resources means using them in an ethical and fraternal way, and 
not penalizing the most fragile.”<a name="_ftnref141" title="" href="#_ftn141">[141]</a> 
Additionally, AI tools in healthcare are “exposed to forms of bias and 
discrimination,” where “systemic errors can easily multiply, producing not only 
injustices in individual cases but also, due to the domino effect, real forms of 
social inequality.”<a name="_ftnref142" title="" href="#_ftn142">[142]</a></p>
<p>76. The integration of AI 
into healthcare also poses the risk of amplifying other existing disparities in 
access to medical care. As healthcare becomes increasingly oriented toward 
prevention and lifestyle-based approaches, AI-driven solutions may inadvertently 
favor more affluent populations who already enjoy better access to medical 
resources and quality nutrition. This trend risks reinforcing a “medicine for 
the rich” model, where those with financial means benefit from advanced 
preventative tools and personalized health information while others struggle to 
access even basic services. To prevent such inequities, equitable frameworks are 
needed to ensure that the use of AI in healthcare does not worsen existing 
healthcare inequalities but rather serves the common good. </p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Education">AI and Education</a></i></p>
<p>77. The words of the 
Second Vatican Council remain fully relevant today: “True education strives to 
form individuals with a view toward their final end and the good of the society 
to which they belong.”<a name="_ftnref143" title="" href="#_ftn143">[143]</a> As 
such, education is “never a mere process of passing on facts and intellectual 
skills: rather, its aim is to contribute to the person’s holistic formation in 
its various aspects (intellectual, cultural, spiritual, etc.), including, for 
example, community life and relations within the academic community,”<a name="_ftnref144" title="" href="#_ftn144">[144]</a> 
in keeping with the nature and dignity of the human person.</p>
<p>78. This approach involves 
a commitment to cultivating the mind, but always as a part of the integral 
development of the person: “We must break that idea of education which holds 
that educating means filling one’s head with ideas. That is the way we educate 
automatons, cerebral minds, not people. Educating is taking a risk in the 
tension between the mind, the heart, and the hands.”<a name="_ftnref145" title="" href="#_ftn145">[145]</a></p>
<p>79. At the center of this 
work of forming the whole human person is the indispensable relationship between 
teacher and student. Teachers do more than convey knowledge; they model 
essential human qualities and inspire the joy of discovery.<a name="_ftnref146" title="" href="#_ftn146">[146]</a> 
Their presence motivates students both through the content they teach and the 
care they demonstrate for their students. This bond fosters trust, mutual 
understanding, and the capacity to address each person’s unique dignity and 
potential. On the part of the student, this can generate a genuine desire to 
grow. The physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI 
cannot replicate, one that deepens engagement and nurtures the student’s 
integral development.</p>
<p>80. In this context, AI 
presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within 
the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the 
authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational resource by 
enhancing access to education, offering tailored support, and providing 
immediate feedback to students. These benefits could enhance the learning 
experience, especially in cases where individualized attention is needed, or 
educational resources are otherwise scarce. </p>
<p>81. Nevertheless, an 
essential part of education is forming “the intellect to reason well in all 
matters, to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it,”<a name="_ftnref147" title="" href="#_ftn147">[147]</a> 
while helping the “language of the head” to grow harmoniously with the “language 
of the heart” and the “language of the hands.”<a name="_ftnref148" title="" href="#_ftn148">[148]</a> 
This is all the more vital in an age marked by technology, in which “it is no 
longer merely a question of ‘using’ instruments of communication, but of living 
in a highly digitalized culture that has had a profound impact on […] our 
ability to communicate, learn, be informed and enter into relationship with 
others.”<a name="_ftnref149" title="" href="#_ftn149">[149]</a> However, instead of 
fostering “a cultivated intellect,” which “brings with it a power and a grace to 
every work and occupation that it undertakes,”<a name="_ftnref150" title="" href="#_ftn150">[150]</a> 
the extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students’ increased 
reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills 
independently and worsening their dependence on screens.<a name="_ftnref151" title="" href="#_ftn151">[151]</a> 
</p>
<p>82. Additionally, while 
some AI systems are designed to help people develop their critical thinking 
abilities and problem-solving skills, many others merely provide answers instead 
of prompting students to arrive at answers themselves or write text for 
themselves.<a name="_ftnref152" title="" href="#_ftn152">[152]</a> Instead of training young people how to amass information and generate 
quick responses, education should encourage “the responsible use of freedom to 
face issues with good sense and intelligence.”<a name="_ftnref153" title="" href="#_ftn153">[153]</a> Building on this, “education in the use of forms of artificial 
intelligence should aim above all at promoting critical thinking. Users of all 
ages, but especially the young, need to develop a discerning approach to the use 
of data and content collected on the web or produced by artificial intelligence 
systems. Schools, universities, and scientific societies are challenged to help 
students and professionals to grasp the social and ethical aspects of the 
development and uses of technology.”<a name="_ftnref154" title="" href="#_ftn154">[154]</a></p>
<p>83. As Saint John Paul II 
recalled, “in the world today, characterized by such rapid developments in 
science and technology, the tasks of a Catholic University assume an ever 
greater importance and urgency.”<a name="_ftnref155" title="" href="#_ftn155">[155]</a> In a particular way, Catholic universities are urged to be present as 
great laboratories of hope at this crossroads of history. In an 
inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary key, they are urged to engage “with 
wisdom and creativity”<a name="_ftnref156" title="" href="#_ftn156">[156]</a> in careful research on this phenomenon, helping to draw out the salutary 
potential within the various fields of science and reality, and guiding them 
always towards ethically sound applications that clearly serve the cohesion of 
our societies and the common good, reaching new frontiers in the dialogue 
between faith and reason. </p>
<p>84. Moreover, it should be noted that current AI 
programs have been known to provide biased or fabricated information, which can 
lead students to trust inaccurate content. This problem “not only runs the risk 
of legitimizing fake news and strengthening a dominant culture’s advantage, but, 
in short, it also undermines the educational process itself.”<a name="_ftnref157" title="" href="#_ftn157">[157]</a> With time, clearer distinctions may emerge between proper and improper 
uses of AI in education and research. Yet, a decisive guideline is that the use 
of AI should always be transparent and never misrepresented.</p>
<p><i><a name="AI,_Misinformation">AI, Misinformation</a>, Deepfakes, and Abuse</i></p>
<p>85. AI could be used as an 
aid to human dignity if it helps people understand complex concepts or directs 
them to sound resources that support their search for the truth.<a name="_ftnref158" title="" href="#_ftn158">[158]</a></p>
<p>86. However, AI also 
presents a serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, 
which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such 
misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI 
“hallucination,” where a generative AI system yields results that appear real 
but are not. Since generating content that mimics human artifacts is central to 
AI’s functionality, mitigating these risks proves challenging. Yet, the 
consequences of such aberrations and false information can be quite grave. For 
this reason, all those involved in producing and using AI systems should be 
committed to the truthfulness and accuracy of the information processed by such 
systems and disseminated to the public. </p>
<p>87. While AI has a latent 
potential to generate false information, an even more troubling problem lies in 
the deliberate misuse of AI for manipulation. This can occur when individuals or 
organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to 
deceive or cause harm, such as “deepfake” images, videos, and audio—referring to 
a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm. The 
danger of deepfakes is particularly evident when they are used to target or harm 
others. While the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they 
cause is real, leaving “deep scars in the hearts of those who suffer it” and 
“real wounds in their human dignity.”<a name="_ftnref159" title="" href="#_ftn159">[159]</a></p>
<p>88. On a broader scale, by 
distorting “our relationship with others and with reality,”<a name="_ftnref160" title="" href="#_ftn160">[160]</a> AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of 
society. This issue requires careful regulation, as misinformation—especially 
through AI-controlled or influenced media—can spread unintentionally, fueling 
political polarization and social unrest. When society becomes indifferent to 
the truth, various groups construct their own versions of “facts,” weakening the 
“reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies”<a name="_ftnref161" title="" href="#_ftn161">[161]</a> that underpin the fabric of social life. As deepfakes cause people to 
question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see 
and<b> </b>hear, polarization and conflict will only grow. Such widespread 
deception is no trivial matter; it strikes at the core of humanity, dismantling 
the foundational trust on which societies are built.<a name="_ftnref162" title="" href="#_ftn162">[162]</a></p>
<p>89. Countering AI-driven 
falsehoods is not only the work of industry experts—it requires the efforts of 
all people of goodwill. “If technology is to serve human dignity and not harm 
it, and if it is to promote peace rather than violence, then the human community 
must be proactive in addressing these trends with respect to human dignity and 
the promotion of the good.”<a name="_ftnref163" title="" href="#_ftn163">[163]</a> Those who produce and share AI-generated content should always exercise 
diligence in verifying the truth of what they disseminate and, in all cases, 
should “avoid the sharing of words and images that are degrading of human 
beings, that promote hatred and intolerance, that debase the goodness and 
intimacy of human sexuality or that exploit the weak and vulnerable.”<a name="_ftnref164" title="" href="#_ftn164">[164]</a> This calls for the ongoing prudence and careful discernment of all users 
regarding their activity online.<a name="_ftnref165" title="" href="#_ftn165">[165]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="AI,_Privacy">AI, Privacy</a>, and Surveillance</i></p>
<p>90.  Humans are inherently 
relational, and the data each person generates in the digital world can be seen 
as an objectified expression of this relational nature. Data conveys not only 
information but also personal and relational knowledge, which, in an 
increasingly digitized context, can amount to power over the individual. 
Moreover, while some types of data may pertain to public aspects of a person’s 
life, others may touch upon the individual’s interiority, perhaps even their 
conscience. Seen in this way, privacy plays an essential role in protecting the 
boundaries of a person’s inner life, preserving their freedom to relate to 
others, express themselves, and make decisions without undue control. This 
protection is also tied to the defense of religious freedom, as surveillance can 
also be misused to exert control over the lives of believers and how they 
express their faith.</p>
<p>91. It is appropriate, 
therefore, to address the issue of privacy from a concern for the legitimate 
freedom and inalienable dignity of the human person “in all circumstances.”<a name="_ftnref166" title="" href="#_ftn166">[166]</a> 
The Second Vatican Council included the right “to safeguard privacy” among the 
fundamental rights “necessary for living a genuinely human life,” a right that 
should be extended to all people on account of their “sublime dignity.”<a name="_ftnref167" title="" href="#_ftn167">[167]</a> 
Furthermore, the Church has also affirmed the right to the legitimate respect 
for a private life in the context of affirming the person’s right to a good 
reputation, defense of their physical and mental integrity, and freedom from 
harm or undue intrusion<a name="_ftnref168" title="" href="#_ftn168">[168]</a>—essential 
components of the due respect for the intrinsic dignity of the human person.<a name="_ftnref169" title="" href="#_ftn169">[169]</a></p>
<p>92. Advances in AI-powered 
data processing and analysis now make it possible to infer patterns in a 
person’s behavior and thinking from even a small amount of information, making 
the role of data privacy even more imperative as a safeguard for the dignity and 
relational nature of the human person. As Pope Francis observed, “while closed 
and intolerant attitudes towards others are on the rise, distances are otherwise 
shrinking or disappearing to the point that the right to privacy scarcely 
exists. Everything has become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected, 
and people’s lives are now under constant surveillance.”<a name="_ftnref170" title="" href="#_ftn170">[170]</a></p>
<p>93. While there can be 
legitimate and proper ways to use AI in keeping with human dignity and the 
common good, using it for surveillance aimed at exploiting, restricting others’ 
freedom, or benefitting a few at the expense of the many is unjustifiable. The 
risk of surveillance overreach must be monitored by appropriate regulators to 
ensure transparency and public accountability. Those responsible for 
surveillance should never exceed their authority, which must always favor the 
dignity and freedom of every person as the essential basis of a just and humane 
society.</p>
<p>94. Furthermore, 
“fundamental respect for human dignity demands that we refuse to allow the 
uniqueness of the person to be identified with a set of data.”<a name="_ftnref171" title="" href="#_ftn171">[171]</a> 
This especially applies when AI is used to evaluate individuals or groups based 
on their behavior, characteristics, or history—a practice known as “social 
scoring”: “In social and economic decision-making, we should be cautious about 
delegating judgments to algorithms that process data, often collected 
surreptitiously, on an individual’s makeup and prior behavior. Such data can be 
contaminated by societal prejudices and preconceptions. A person’s past behavior 
should not be used to deny him or her the opportunity to change, grow, and 
contribute to society. We cannot allow algorithms to limit or condition respect 
for human dignity, or to exclude compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and above all, 
the hope that people are able to change.”<a name="_ftnref172" title="" href="#_ftn172">[172]</a> 
</p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_the_Protection">AI and the Protection</a> of Our Common Home</i></p>
<p>95. AI has many promising 
applications for improving our relationship with our “common home,” such as 
creating models to forecast extreme climate events, proposing engineering 
solutions to reduce their impact, managing relief operations, and predicting 
population shifts.<a name="_ftnref173" title="" href="#_ftn173">[173]</a> 
Additionally, AI can support sustainable agriculture, optimize energy usage, and 
provide early warning systems for public health emergencies. These advancements 
have the potential to strengthen resilience against climate-related challenges 
and promote more sustainable development.</p>
<p>96. At the same time, 
current AI models and the hardware required to support them consume vast amounts 
of energy and water, significantly contributing to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 
straining resources. This reality is often obscured by the way this technology 
is presented in the popular imagination, where words such as “the cloud”<a name="_ftnref174" title="" href="#_ftn174"> [174]</a> can give the impression that data is stored and processed in an intangible 
realm, detached from the physical world. However, “the cloud” is not an ethereal 
domain separate from the physical world; as with all computing technologies, it 
relies on physical machines, cables, and energy. The same is true of the 
technology behind AI. As these systems grow in 
complexity, especially large language models (LLMs), they require ever-larger 
datasets, increased computational power, and greater storage infrastructure. 
Considering the heavy toll these technologies take on the environment, it is 
vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common 
home.</p>
<p>97.  Even then, as Pope 
Francis teaches, it is essential “that we look for solutions not only in 
technology but in a change of humanity.”<a name="_ftnref175" title="" href="#_ftn175">[175]</a> 
A complete and authentic understanding of creation recognizes that the value of 
all created things cannot be reduced to their mere utility. Therefore, a fully 
human approach to the stewardship of the earth rejects the distorted 
anthropocentrism of the technocratic paradigm, which seeks to “extract 
everything possible” from the world,<a name="_ftnref176" title="" href="#_ftn176"> [176]</a> 
and rejects the “myth of progress,” which assumes that “ecological problems will 
solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any 
need for ethical considerations or deep change.”<a name="_ftnref177" title="" href="#_ftn177">[177]</a> 
Such a mindset must give way to a more holistic approach that respects the order 
of creation and promotes the integral good of the human person while 
safeguarding our common home.<a name="_ftnref178" title="" href="#_ftn178"> [178]</a> 
</p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Warfare">AI and Warfare</a></i></p>
<p>98. The Second Vatican 
Council and the consistent teaching of the Popes since then have insisted that 
peace is not merely the absence of war and is not limited to maintaining a 
balance of powers between adversaries. Instead, in the words of Saint Augustine, 
peace is “the tranquility of order.”<a name="_ftnref179" title="" href="#_ftn179"> [179]</a> Indeed, peace cannot be attained without safeguarding the goods of 
persons, free communication, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and 
the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is the work of justice and the 
effect of charity and cannot be achieved through force alone; instead, it must 
be principally built through patient diplomacy, the active promotion of justice, 
solidarity, integral human development, and respect for the dignity of all 
people.<a name="_ftnref180" title="" href="#_ftn180">[180]</a> In this way, the tools used to maintain peace should never be allowed to 
justify injustice, violence, or oppression. Instead, they should always be 
governed by a “firm determination to respect other people and nations, along 
with their dignity, as well as the deliberate practice of fraternity.”<a name="_ftnref181" title="" href="#_ftn181">[181]</a></p>
<p>99. While AI’s analytical 
abilities could help nations seek peace and ensure security, the “weaponization 
of Artificial Intelligence” can also be highly problematic. Pope Francis has 
observed that “the ability to conduct military operations through remote control 
systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those 
weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an 
even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.”<a name="_ftnref182" title="" href="#_ftn182">[182]</a> Moreover, the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable 
militates against the principle of war as a last resort in legitimate 
self-defense,<a name="_ftnref183" title="" href="#_ftn183">[183]</a> potentially increasing the instruments of war well beyond the scope of 
human oversight and precipitating a destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic 
consequences for human rights.<a name="_ftnref184" title="" href="#_ftn184">[184]</a></p>
<p>100. In particular, Lethal Autonomous Weapon 
Systems, which are capable of identifying and striking targets without direct 
human intervention, are a “cause for grave ethical concern” because they lack 
the “unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making.”<a name="_ftnref185" title="" href="#_ftn185">[185]</a> For this reason, Pope Francis has urgently called for a reconsideration of 
the development of these weapons and a prohibition on their use, starting with 
“an effective and concrete commitment to introduce ever greater and proper human 
control. No machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being.”<a name="_ftnref186" title="" href="#_ftn186">[186]</a></p>
<p>101. Since it is a small step from machines that 
can kill autonomously with precision to those capable of large-scale 
destruction, some AI researchers have expressed concerns that such technology 
poses an “existential risk” by having the potential to act in ways that could 
threaten the survival of entire regions or even of humanity itself. This danger 
demands serious attention, reflecting the long-standing concern about 
technologies that grant war “an uncontrollable destructive power over great 
numbers of innocent civilians,”<a name="_ftnref187" title="" href="#_ftn187">[187]</a> without even sparing children. In this context, the call from <i>
<a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium et 
Spes</a></i> to “undertake an evaluation of war with an entirely new attitude”<a name="_ftnref188" title="" href="#_ftn188">[188]</a> is more urgent than ever.</p>
<p>102. At the same time, while the theoretical risks 
of AI deserve attention, the more immediate and pressing concern lies in how 
individuals with malicious intentions might misuse this technology.<a name="_ftnref189" title="" href="#_ftn189">[189]</a> Like any tool, AI is an extension of human power, and while its future 
capabilities are unpredictable, humanity’s past actions provide clear warnings. 
The atrocities committed throughout history are enough to raise deep concerns 
about the potential abuses of AI.</p>
<p>103. Saint John Paul II observed that “humanity 
now has instruments of unprecedented power: we can turn this world into a 
garden, or reduce it to a pile of rubble.”<a name="_ftnref190" title="" href="#_ftn190">[190]</a> Given this fact, the Church reminds us, in the words of Pope Francis, that 
“we are free to apply our intelligence towards things evolving positively,” or 
toward “decadence and mutual destruction.”<a name="_ftnref191" title="" href="#_ftn191">[191]</a> To prevent humanity from spiraling into self-destruction,<a name="_ftnref192" title="" href="#_ftn192">[192]</a> there must be a clear stand against all applications of technology that 
inherently threaten human life and dignity. This commitment requires careful 
discernment about the use of AI, particularly in military defense applications, 
to ensure that it always respects human dignity and serves the common good. The 
development and deployment of AI in armaments should be subject to the highest 
levels of ethical scrutiny, governed by a concern for human dignity and the 
sanctity of life.<a name="_ftnref193" title="" href="#_ftn193">[193]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="AI_and_Our">AI and Our</a> Relationship with God</i></p>
<p>104. Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee 
and develop the world’s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these 
resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is 
optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a 
hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring 
about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve 
superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a 
connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of 
meaning or fulfillment—longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion 
with God.<a name="_ftnref194" title="" href="#_ftn194">[194]</a></p>
<p>105. However, <i>the presumption of substituting 
God for an artifact of human making is idolatry</i>, a practice Scripture 
explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove 
even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that “have mouths 
but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear” (Ps. 115:5-6), AI 
can “speak,” or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, 
it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity—it is 
crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human 
input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the 
capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI 
as a perceived “Other” greater than itself, with which to share existence and 
responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is 
not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in 
this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.<a name="_ftnref195" title="" href="#_ftn195">[195]</a> 
</p>
<p>106. While AI has the potential to serve humanity 
and contribute to the common good, it remains a creation of human hands, bearing 
“the imprint of human art and ingenuity” (Acts 17:29). It must never be ascribed 
undue worth. As the Book of Wisdom affirms: “For a man made them, and one whose 
spirit is borrowed formed them; for no man can form a god which is like himself. 
He is mortal, and what he makes with lawless hands is dead, for he is better 
than the objects he worships since he has life, but they never have” (Wis. 
15:16-17). </p>
<p>107. In contrast, human beings, “by their interior 
life, transcend the entire material universe; they experience this deep 
interiority when they enter into their own heart, where God, who probes the 
heart, awaits them, and where they decide their own destiny in the sight of 
God.”<a name="_ftnref196" title="" href="#_ftn196">[196]</a> It is within the 
heart, as Pope Francis reminds us, that each individual discovers the 
“mysterious connection between self-knowledge and openness to others, between 
the encounter with one’s personal uniqueness and the willingness to give oneself 
to others.”<a name="_ftnref197" title="" href="#_ftn197">[197]</a> Therefore, it is 
the heart alone that is “capable of setting our other powers and passions, and 
our entire person, in a stance of reverence and loving obedience before the 
Lord,”<a name="_ftnref198" title="" href="#_ftn198">[198]</a> who “offers to treat 
each one of us as a ‘Thou,’ always and forever.”<a name="_ftnref199" title="" href="#_ftn199">[199]</a> 
</p>
<p>VI. <b> <a name="Concluding_Reflections">Concluding Reflections</a></b></p>
<p>108. Considering the various challenges posed by 
advances in technology, Pope Francis emphasized the need for growth in “human 
responsibility, values, and conscience,” proportionate to the growth in the 
potential that this technology brings<a name="_ftnref200" title="" href="#_ftn200">[200]</a>—recognizing that “with an increase in human power comes a broadening of 
responsibility on the part of individuals and communities.”<a name="_ftnref201" title="" href="#_ftn201">[201]</a></p>
<p>109. At the same time, the “essential and 
fundamental question” remains “whether in the context of this progress man, as 
man, is becoming truly better, that is to say, more mature spiritually, more 
aware of the dignity of his humanity, more responsible, more open to others, 
especially the neediest and the weakest, and readier to give and to aid all.”<a name="_ftnref202" title="" href="#_ftn202">[202]</a></p>
<p>110. As a result, it is crucial to know how to 
evaluate individual applications of AI in particular contexts to determine 
whether its use promotes human dignity, the vocation of the human person, and 
the common good. As with many technologies, the effects of the various uses of 
AI may not always be predictable from their inception. As these applications and 
their social impacts become clearer, appropriate responses should be made at all 
levels of society, following the principle of subsidiarity. Individual users, 
families, civil society, corporations, institutions, governments, and 
international organizations should work at their proper levels to ensure that AI 
is used for the good of all. </p>
<p>111. A significant challenge and opportunity for 
the common good today lies in considering AI within a framework of relational 
intelligence, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals and 
communities and highlights our shared responsibility for fostering the integral 
well-being of others. The twentieth-century philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev 
observed that people often blame machines for personal and social problems; 
however, “this only humiliates man and does not correspond to his dignity,” for 
“it is unworthy to transfer responsibility from man to a machine.”<a name="_ftnref203" title="" href="#_ftn203">[203]</a> 
Only the human person can be morally responsible, and the challenges of a 
technological society are ultimately <i>spiritual</i> in nature. Therefore, 
facing those challenges “demands an intensification of spirituality.”<a name="_ftnref204" title="" href="#_ftn204">[204]</a></p>
<p>112. A further point to consider is the call, 
prompted by the appearance of AI on the world stage, for a <i>renewed 
appreciation of all that is human</i>. Years ago, the 
French Catholic author Georges Bernanos warned that “the danger is not in the 
multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed 
from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.”<a name="_ftnref205" title="" href="#_ftn205">[205]</a> 
This challenge is as true today as it was then, as the rapid pace of 
digitization risks a “digital reductionism,” where non-quantifiable aspects of 
life are set aside and then forgotten or even deemed irrelevant because they 
cannot be computed in formal terms. AI should be used only as a tool to 
complement human intelligence rather than replace its richness.<a name="_ftnref206" title="" href="#_ftn206">[206]</a> Cultivating those aspects of human life that transcend computation is 
crucial for preserving “an authentic humanity” that “seems to dwell in the midst 
of our technological culture, almost unnoticed, like a mist seeping gently 
beneath a closed door.”<a name="_ftnref207" title="" href="#_ftn207">[207]</a></p>
<p><i><a name="True_Wisdom">True Wisdom</a></i></p>
<p>113. The vast expanse of the world’s knowledge is 
now accessible in ways that would have filled past generations with awe. 
However, to ensure that advancements in knowledge do not become humanly or 
spiritually barren, one must go beyond the mere accumulation of data and strive 
to achieve true wisdom.<a name="_ftnref208" title="" href="#_ftn208">[208]</a></p>
<p>114. This wisdom is the gift that humanity needs 
most to address the profound questions and ethical challenges posed by AI: “Only 
by adopting a spiritual way of viewing reality, only by recovering a wisdom of 
the heart, can we confront and interpret the newness of our time.”<a name="_ftnref209" title="" href="#_ftn209">[209]</a> Such “wisdom of the heart” is “the virtue that enables us to integrate the 
whole and its parts, our decisions and their consequences.” It “cannot be sought 
from machines,” but it “lets itself be found by those who seek it and be seen by 
those who love it; it anticipates those who desire it, and it goes in search of 
those who are worthy of it (cf. Wis 6:12-16).”<a name="_ftnref210" title="" href="#_ftn210">[210]</a></p>
<p>115. In a world marked by AI, we need the grace of 
the Holy Spirit, who “enables us to look at things with God’s eyes, to see 
connections, situations, events and to uncover their real meaning.”<a name="_ftnref211" title="" href="#_ftn211">[211]</a></p>
<p>116. Since a “person’s perfection is measured not 
by the information or knowledge they possess, but by the depth of their 
charity,”<a name="_ftnref212" title="" href="#_ftn212">[212]</a> how we incorporate AI “to include the least of our brothers and sisters, 
the vulnerable, and those most in need, will be the true measure of our 
humanity.”<a name="_ftnref213" title="" href="#_ftn213">[213]</a> The “wisdom of the heart” can illuminate and guide the human-centered use 
of this technology to help promote the common good, care for our “common home,” 
advance the search for the truth, foster integral human development, favor human 
solidarity and fraternity, and lead humanity to its ultimate goal: happiness and 
full communion with God.<a name="_ftnref214" title="" href="#_ftn214">[214]</a></p>
<p>117. From this perspective of wisdom, believers 
will be able to act as moral agents capable of using this technology to promote 
an authentic vision of the human person and society.<a name="_ftnref215" title="" href="#_ftn215">[215]</a> This should be done with the understanding that technological progress is 
part of God’s plan for creation—an activity that we are called to order toward 
the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ, in the continual search for the True and 
the Good.</p>

	<p><a name="_ftn9" title="" href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> Here, one can see the primary positions of the “transhumanists” and the 
“posthumanists.” <i>Transhumanists</i> argue that technological advancements 
will enable humans to overcome their biological limitations and enhance both 
their physical and cognitive abilities. <i>Posthumanists</i>, on the other hand, 
contend that such advances will ultimately alter human identity to the extent 
that humanity itself may no longer be considered truly “human.” Both views rest 
on a fundamentally negative perception of human corporality, which treats the 
body more as an obstacle than as an integral part of the person’s identity and 
call to full realization. Yet, this negative view of the body is inconsistent 
with a proper understanding of human dignity. While the Church supports genuine 
scientific progress, it affirms that human dignity is rooted in “the person as 
an inseparable unity of body and soul.” Thus, “dignity is also inherent in each 
person’s body, which participates in its own way in being <i>in</i> <i>imago Dei</i>” 
(Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, Declaration <i>

Infinita</a> </i>[8 April 2024], par. 18).</p>
	<p><a name="_ftn10" title="" href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> This approach reflects a functionalist perspective, which reduces the 
human mind to its functions and assumes that its functions can be entirely 
quantified in physical or mathematical terms. However, even if a future AGI were 
to appear truly intelligent, it would still remain functional in nature.</p>
	<p><a name="_ftn11" title="" href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Cf. A.M. Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” <i>Mind </i>59 
(1950) 443-460.</p>
	<p><a name="_ftn12" title="" href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> If “thinking” is attributed to machines, it must 
be clarified that this refers to calculative thinking rather than critical 
thinking. Similarly, if machines are said to operate using logical thinking, it 
must be specified that this is limited to computational logic. On the other 
hand, by its very nature, human thought is a creative process that eludes 
programming and transcends constraints.</p>

<i>Enarrationes in Psalmos </i>54, 3: PL 36, 629: “When considering all that 
they have, humans discover that they are most distinguished from animals 
precisely by the fact they possess intelligence.” This is also reiterated by 
Saint Thomas Aquinas, who states that “man is the most perfect of all earthly 
beings endowed with motion, and his proper and natural operation is 
intellection,” by which man abstracts from things and “receives in his mind 
things actually intelligible” (Thomas Aquinas, <i>Summa Contra Gentiles </i>II,

represents a form of order in social relations and an arrangement of power, thus 
enabling certain people to perform specific actions while preventing others from 
performing different ones. In a more or less explicit way, this constitutive 
power-dimension of technology always includes the worldview of those who 
invented and developed it.”</p>

research, UNESCO notes: “One of the key questions [of the use of generative AI 
(GenAI) in education and research] is whether humans can possibly cede basic 
levels of thinking and skill-acquisition processes to AI and rather concentrate 
on higher-order thinking skills based on the outputs provided by AI. Writing, 
for example, is often associated with the structuring of thinking. With GenAI 
[…], humans can now start with a well-structured outline provided by GenAI. Some 
experts have characterized the use of GenAI to generate text in this way as 
‘writing without thinking’” (UNESCO, <i>Guidance for Generative AI in Education 
and Research </i>[2023], 37-38). The German-American philosopher Hannah Arendt 
foresaw such a possibility in her 1959 book, <i>The Human Condition</i>, and 
cautioned: “If it should turn out to be true that knowledge (in the sense of 
know-how) and thought have parted company for good, then we would indeed become 
the helpless slaves, not so much of our machines as of our know-how” (Id., <i>
The Human Condition</i>, University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2018<sup>2</sup>, 
3). </p>
