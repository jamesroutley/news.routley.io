But the Supreme Court narrowly ruled that the district court could review the NIH’s guidelines used to make the grant terminations and left in place the lower court’s order that the guidelines are illegal and should not be used. The lower court <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01914-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01914-2" data-track-category="body text link">said in June</a> that the grant cuts made by the Trump administration in relation to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) amounted to racial discrimination.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court ruled partially in the researchers’ favour, some scientists say the decision amounts to a de-facto win by the Trump administration, because the time and cost of challenging their terminations in a different court will be prohibitive. And it could spell doom for other legal efforts, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/federal-judge-orders-agencies-restore-grants-university-california-scientists" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.science.org/content/article/federal-judge-orders-agencies-restore-grants-university-california-scientists" data-track-category="body text link">such as one by a group of University of California researchers</a>, to reinstate their funding from other agencies such as the US National Science Foundation.</p><p>“In a scientific sense, this is a total loss,” says Jenna Norton, a programme officer at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the NIH. “The trust and certainty that is so critical to successfully conduct research has been completely obliterated by this ruling.”</p><p>“What the court made clear yesterday is, if your grants get cut, you’re not going to be able to get any effective remedy for it,” says Samuel Bagenstos, who until December was the top lawyer for the NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Neither the NIH nor the researchers who led the lawsuit against the agency responded to <i>Nature</i>’s queries about the ruling.</p><h2>Legal challenges</h2><p>Early this year, the NIH began terminating thousands of research grants related to a plethora of topics disfavoured by the Trump administration, including DEI, HIV/AIDS and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00954-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00954-y" data-track-category="body text link">COVID-19</a>.

This loss of billions of dollars of funding has led dozens of research institutions, such as Stanford University in California, to lay off staff members.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01914-2" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02721-5/d41586-025-02721-5_51139664.jpg"/><p>Judge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory</p></a></article><p>Several US states, researchers and organizations that represent scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01192-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01192-y" data-track-category="body text link">filed lawsuits challenging the NIH’s cuts in early April</a>, arguing that the terminations were illegal because the agency — the largest funder of biomedical research in the world — did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for cancelling the grants.</p><p>In June, judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01914-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01914-2" data-track-category="body text link">ruled that the NIH guidelines</a> used to terminate the grants and about 800 of the terminations, including those related to DEI, were illegal. “I’ve been on the bench for 40 years — I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this,” Young said at a hearing announcing his decision.</p><p>The next month, a three-judge appeals-court panel unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to halt Young’s ruling, noting that the cuts would delay lifesaving research by years, if not decades. The government then filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court.</p><h2>A court divided</h2><p>The case divided the Supreme Court’s nine justices, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02747-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02747-x" data-track-category="body text link">three of whom were appointed by Trump</a>, leading to an unusually fractious 36-page emergency ruling.</p></div></div>
