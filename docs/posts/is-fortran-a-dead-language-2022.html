    <h1>Is Fortran “A Dead Language”? (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>A recent tweet contained the phrase “dead languages such as Fortran”, which (although perhaps intended in jest) seemed worth debunking, since it is important that people making funding decisions about investments in compilers do not ignore Fortran as “a legacy language”, or even, as above, a “dead language”, since in its home domain Fortran remains critically important.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this misconception:-</p><ul><li><p>Most programmers are never taught Fortran, and it is not a computer science or web language.</p></li><li><p><span>Fortran is only the 15th most popular language on the </span><a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="">Tiobe index</a><span> for September 2022, and is low down in </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022" rel="">IEEE’s language popularity estimates</a><span> as well. </span></p></li><li><p>It was released in 1957 (as, indeed, was I), so, since old people know nothing, and anything from the last century is technically suspect, it clearly must be dying.</p></li></ul><p>The issue here is really one of insularity. The web sites and teaching resources that people use depend on the jobs they have and the tasks they are trying to solve. So, one would not expect accountants to be experts in structural mechanics, or to know how to drive a fork-lift truck. We are taught the tools we need for the things we are expected to do, and are interested in. </p><p>Thus, people studying hard sciences such as physics and chemistry are taught to program in Fortran, whereas more general programmers (who, if the language popularity indices are to be believed will likely be developing web applications) are not, since Fortran is not used in that domain.</p><p><span>One particular group for whom this matters is the people writing the compilers. Since most compilers are now written in C or C++ (e.g. the </span><a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc" rel="">Gnu Compiler Collection</a><span> (GCC): 62.6% C++ or C, </span><a href="https://llvm.org/" rel="">LLVM</a><span>: 84% C++ or C </span><span>), those are the languages which the compiler writers use every day, so tend to consider as &#34;real&#34; languages. In particular, if they improve those compilers they experience the benefits themselves.</span></p><p><span>Also, since they are not interested in Fortran, many people do not track the status of current Fortran, (which continues to evolve through Fortran 2018, with Fortran 2023 expected next year), but are under the impression that nothing has happened since Fortran 77 (or, at the latest, Fortran 90). While it is still possible to compile code in fixed, punch-card, format, modern Fortran is a more friendly language with useful built-in features for high-performance computing [HPC] codes (such as operations on whole arrays without needing to write a loop, explicitly parallel loops [</span><code>do concurrent</code><span>], and support for Partitioned Global Address Space [PGAS] parallelism via </span><a href="https://www.nag.com/nagware/np/r62_doc/nag_f2008.html#AUTOTOC_3_3:~:text=3.3-,Coarrays,-Coarrays%20are%20variables" rel="">coarrays</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>It is certainly true that Fortran is low down on the programming popularity indices, but they are not measuring anything that gives us useful information about the importance of a language, but rather they tell us how many people ask questions about it (TIOBE</span><span>), or how many people are programming in it (</span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022#:~:text=we%20look%20at%20nine%20metrics%20that%20we%20think" rel="">IEEE </a><span>: “we look at nine metrics that we think are good proxies for measuring what languages people are programming in.”)</span></p><p>However, these measures of popularity miss the point that the number of people writing in a language is a completely separate issue from how important the code is, and how much compute resource it may consume. </p><p><span>Consider the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [</span><a href="https://www.vasp.at/" rel="">VASP</a><span>], which is the code that consumes the most resources on the UK’s largest HPC machine (</span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/" rel="">Archer2</a><span>), and which is written in Fortran. At the VASP site we can see </span><a href="https://www.vasp.at/info/team/" rel="">photos of the VASP team</a><span> which consists of  … 15 people. Clearly 15 people writing Fortran make no impact on the statistics measured by the popularity indices, yet, as we will see below, their code is hugely important. </span></p><p><span>For reasons I cannot understand, “legacy” has become an insult, despite most of our knowledge being a legacy from previous generations. (I don’t see physicists tearing up energy conservation because it wasn’t theorised in this generation, actors complaining about having to learn a part in a Shakespeare play, or musicians complaining about playing Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen" rel="">Hildegard of Bingen</a><span> who died in 1169!).</span></p><p>The fact that there are many well tested Fortran codes which are being used and maintained, rather than being thrown away to be replaced by expensive, new, untested code in the language du jour is a good thing, not a bad one.</p><p><span>While you might argue that the weather forecasts you get are bad, the forecasts save lives and many are written in Fortran (e.g. the US’ </span><a href="https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF" rel="">WRF</a><span>, the UK Meteorological Office’s Unified Model [UM], and ECMWF’s Integrated Forecast System [IFS]). </span></p><p>Although Fortran may not be useful to hard-core computer-science folk, it remains one of the most important languages for scientists who are looking for a well understood, performant, portable, language in which to write the codes they need to support their real objectives of advancing knowledge in their field. </p><p><span>As we all know, hardware continues to advance (despite the impact of the end of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="">Dennard scaling</a><span>),  but having a well understood tool that we can continue to use is important. If we buy a cross-head screwdriver we don’t throw away the straight, single slot, one we already owned, even though both are screwdrivers, rather we recognise that we need both in our toolbox. Similarly throwing away Fortran codes makes no sense. Fortran is also under </span><a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/" rel="">continuing development</a><span>, it’s just not visible to the people who make a lot of noise about the state of the C++ standard</span><span>!</span></p><p><span>With the addition of </span><a href="https://openmp.org" rel="">OpenMP</a><span>®, Fortran codes can be extended in a vendor neutral way to operate on machines with both CPUs and GPUs or other accelerators.</span></p><p><span>Many people (including some people writing code themselves, who, if they are logical won’t expect to be paid) think that software, and, in particular, compilers, should all be free. However, in the real world, someone has to pay the developers (</span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/us-c-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,14.htm?countryRedirect=true" rel="">glassdoor</a><span> reckons the mean C++ developer salary in the US is $94,466 /yr in September 2022, which means that the cost of employing a C++ developer is likely around $150k/yr after allowing for office space, machines, travel expenses, and so on). Of course that means that the people paying the developers must be able to see significant value in the code they produce even if it is given away, since we live in a capitalist economic system, and they want to make a profit. </span></p><p>The compilers used in High Performance Computing [HPC] are mostly written by the providers of the hardware, and, normally, that means the designers of the CPU (or GPU) chips. </p><p>There are good reasons for this:-</p><ul><li><p>To have compilers ready when a new chip comes out work has to start before the specifications are public, so an unrelated software company cannot do it.</p></li><li><p>If they are sane, the hardware architects should be worrying whether their wonderful new features can be used by compilers, so they need to be talking to compiler writers and accepting their feedback even before the specification of new instructions is finalised.</p></li><li><p>Since the price at which a CPU or GPU can be sold is related to its performance, having a compiler which improves the performance of whatever benchmark codes are used for this evaluation is valuable as it allows you to charge more for each machine you sell. Indeed, this may be a simpler, cheaper, way to achieve performance than using an improved process to make the chip, or having it run at a higher clock frequency (and thus consume more power).</p></li><li><p>Having an in-house compiler-team allows rapid fixes to be made if there are problems when running the benchmarks required for specific procurements.</p></li><li><p><span>To compete in a specific market the customers there must be able to run their codes on the machine you are trying to sell. In the HPC market that means having good Fortran support</span><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>That final reason should make it obvious why the number of programmers using a language is not the right metric for the people funding compiler development to use. Since they aren’t selling the compiler and charging people a license for each user, the number of people who will use the compiler is irrelevant. What matters is how much hardware is needed to run code that requires support for the language the compiler supports.</p><p><span>Luckily for us, the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (</span><a href="https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/" rel="">EPCC</a><span>) who run  </span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/" rel="">Archer2</a><span> (which is the largest centrally funded machine for scientific research here in the UK and is </span><a href="https://www.top500.org/system/180036/" rel="">25th in the June 2022 Top500</a><span> list of supercomputers) publish </span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html#:~:text=0.0-,Historical%20usage%20data,-Period" rel="">information on the applications</a><span> which are being run on the machine</span><span>.</span></p><p>Although they don’t currently publish information about the language in which each application is written, a morning on Google and a few emails to code authors let me fill in that information for most of the codes.  The EPCC statistics do have a large chunk of “Unidentified” codes; we’ll discuss how usefully to allocate these to a programming language below.</p><p>Looking at the statistics for the last six months (March-August 2022), there are 43 applications which use more than 0.1% of the machine;  those which use more than 1% of the machine (as identified by the program name in the statistics) are</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png" width="392" height="618" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:618,&#34;width&#34;:392,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:150071,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83d69675-f1b3-4d41-a17f-176d5fa66cb3_392x618.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Even at first glance, Fortran seems important, though there’s more to discuss.
