    <h1>Apple removed all VK and Mail.ru applications from the App Store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The VKontakte social network client and some other VK and Mail.ru applications have been removed from the Apple App Store. All these apps are still available on Google Play.</p>
<p>The local “sanctions”, the cause of which is currently unknown, concern the VKontakte client, VK Music, VK Calls, VK Clips, VK Messenger and Mail.ru applications. Representatives of the VK holding company confirmed the removal of the programs.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Apple has removed VK applications, the same happened in 2014, but after some time the applications were returned to the store.</p>
<p>We will remind you that the VKontakte social network is almost 100% controlled by the Federal Security Service of Russia and is used to incite war hysteria and spread fakes. According to the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine dated April 28, 2017, access to the VKontakte website was blocked on the territory of Ukraine from May 16, 2017.</p>
