    <h1>A Five-Week Experiment to Elaborate on FAIR-Enabling Services</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><time>August 19, 2022</time></p><div>
<p><a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/fair-enabling-services/">Yesterday</a>, I proposed that a strategy for
implementing the <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/FAIR">FAIR principles</a> for research data
management can focus on ensuring five FAIR-enabling <em>services</em>, which in turn will prompt tactical
choices of <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Enabling-Resource">FAIR-enabling resources</a> that
may satisfactorily address each <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question">question</a> and thereby
produce a comprehensive <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">implementation profile</a>. The
purpose of such care in design is to de-risk one’s investment in “going FAIR”, as the cost of
systems implementation and maintenance can easily exceed the cost of a design phase by an order of
magnitude.</p>
<p>These FAIR-enabling services are, again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying</li>
<li>Validating</li>
<li>Indexing</li>
<li>Translating</li>
<li>Tracing</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than cursory remarks, I am yet to elaborate in any detail the behavior I expect from these
services. I would like to remedy this over the next five weeks, one week per service, in the order
given above.</p>
<p>And there is a constraint I would like to impose on myself: each week will be a five-day progression
of notes that reflects the service sequence above. For example, during the first week (on
Identifying), I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Day 1: Identify the concepts, attributes, and relationships at play in Identifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 2: Assert and validate a set of statements, using elements that I identified the day
before, that should hold for Identifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 3: Demonstrate a process of Indexing the above in order to efficiently retrieve
assertions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 4: Assert relationships among schemes for Identifying, and attempt Translating from one to
another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 5: Demonstrate a process of Tracing revisions made to the metadata that Identifying
yields (i.e., what is returned when an identifier is resolved).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this five-week planned experiment ambitious? Yes? Is it <em>too</em> ambitious? Almost certainly yes.
Will I attempt it anyway? Yes.</p>
<p>Would I appreciate your day-to-day feedback for course correction? Yes. And I would enthusiastically
acknowledge your contribution when collecting and clarifying the sum of each week’s notes.</p>
