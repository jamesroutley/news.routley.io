    <h1>Judge dismisses majority of GitHub Copilot copyright claims</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Developer <a href="https://www.developer-tech.com/news/judge-dismisses-majority-github-copilot-copyright-claims/">reports</a>
that most (but not all) of the claims in the GitHub Copilot lawsuit have
been dismissed with prejudice by the judge.
</p><blockquote>
	Judge Jon Tigar&#39;s ruling, unsealed last week, leaves only two
	claims standing: one accusing the companies of an open-source
	license violation and another alleging breach of contract. This
	decision marks a substantial setback for the developers who argued
	that GitHub Copilot, which uses OpenAI&#39;s technology and is owned by
	Microsoft, unlawfully trained on their work.
