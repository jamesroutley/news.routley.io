Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the pact &#34;historic&#34;.</p><p>It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world&#39;s most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people.</p><p>The deal will see a number of huge tariff cuts across a range of goods and services, and a joint security partnership.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit.</p><p>The European Commission said  would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July.</p><p>India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.</p><p>Delhi said almost all of its exports would get &#34;preferential access&#34; into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs.</p><p>While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi &#34;has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities&#34;, it said.</p><p>Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term. </p><p>&#34;This is India&#39;s biggest free trade agreement,&#34; Modi said. &#34;It will make access to European markets easier for India&#39;s farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors. It will boost innovative partnerships.&#34;</p><p>The trade deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US. </p><p>Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still  dragging on.</p><p>Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland, before <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgezx40r7d7o">backing off</a>. </p><p>That larger geopolitical context was evident in statements made by leaders.</p><p>On Tuesday, von der Leyen said: &#34;This is the tale of two giants - the world&#39;s second and fourth largest economies. Two giants which chose partnership in a true win-win fashion. A strong message that co-operation is the best answer to global challenges.&#34;</p><p>A day before that Costa had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-trade-pact-to-be-very-important-geopolitical-stabiliser-antonio-costa-101769440061733.html">said</a>, without naming the US, that the trade deal would send an &#34;important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs&#34;.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Narendra Modi/X Leaders stand in a line on a decorated stage at an outdoor ceremony.
