                            <p>Assimilate is a Flood-It/Drench-style game where you work on filling the board with one solid color. You only get a certain number of moves to begin with, and each level will give you one less move. Every level is procedurally created at run-time to provide you with the most unique experience every time!</p>
                            <p>The game features 4 custom color palettes (and the ability to edit them) so that color-deficient individuals feel included. In the October 2021 Edition (v1.1.0), users can now create and save their own palettes!</p>
                            <p>Most recently (v1.2.0), the game was updated to include a splash screen as well as many quality of life improvements. You can now change the view mode to a square, which removes the color buttons. In any view mode, you can make a move by clicking on any of the squares on the board!</p>
                            <p>New gameplay is on the way! The next version will introduce new actions which can rotate the board or explode a little chunk when activated.</p>

                            <p>People still use OS9! It&#39;s me, I&#39;m people. I just like programming, I like this style of game, and I like giving myself a reason to turn on my iBook or iMac.</p>

                            <p>I do! Since 2012 or so, I&#39;ve wanted to play this game on practically every device. Now, when I learn to program in a new language or for a new target device, I first work on porting my Assimilate! code. The game&#39;s fun, it&#39;s free, and did I mention it&#39;s fun?!</p>
