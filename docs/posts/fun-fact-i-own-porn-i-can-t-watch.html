There’s obviously ways this can be implemented on streaming services, but it was tried at least twice in the optical disc era, but amusingly in two entirely different ways.</p><p>And it was backwards from how you might think. The older one seems like it should have come later!</p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4fb2f622596ec68e713b04b515b32d24/916f760cf43da8d3-ff/s1280x1920/374d1cbfbe792995733d2b7fc0d48f27f2cc5c3c.jpg" data-big-photo-height="576" data-big-photo-width="1024"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4fb2f622596ec68e713b04b515b32d24/916f760cf43da8d3-ff/s1280x1920/374d1cbfbe792995733d2b7fc0d48f27f2cc5c3c.jpg" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>So first was DIVX (the disc format: it’s unrelated to the Codec of the same name)</p><p>This came out in 1998, just as DVD was starting to catch on. They got a bunch of movie studios to sign on to only release their films on DIVX, not DVD, and tried to backdoor the format into acceptance: it was heavily pushed by Circuit City, then a major retailer. All DIVX players were also DVD players, so they would try to convince you to buy a DIVX player so you could play both.</p><p>How it worked is pretty simple: it is basically a DVD that’s been encrypted. To decrypt it, you need a license. The DIVX player can talk to the DIVX server and let you purchase a license to watch the film, and the license would be valid for 48 hours before deleting itself. So the idea was that you’d pick up a disc for very cheap, like a rental, but when you could hang onto it for later, and re-axtivate the license by just paying the license free (a couple dollars) again. And if you didn’t like the movie? No need to take the film back to blockbuster, you can just toss it in the garbage! (you could also pay a higher fee to get an unlimited license to the film, effectively converting it into a DVD) </p><p>But this was 1998, remember: very few people have always-on internet. How’s it talk to the DIVX server?</p><p>Simple. It’s got a modem. You plug your DIVX player into the phone line, and it dials up DVD HQ and talks to them over that connection. It’s a very 1990s solution.</p><p>Anyway it died. People interested in DVD universally hated the idea, especially the part where some studios were only going to release films as DIVX. People had had VHS tapes for a while now, and they were used to buying and owning their films. Going to a time-limited rental system seems like a big step back.</p><p>And of course, movie rental companies hated the idea too, as it basically would destroy them as a business (years before streaming destroyed them anyway). So they refused to entertain the idea. So it failed, and it took down Circuit City with it. The funniest part? Remember how it talks to a server? Well, guess what happened to that server when the format was discontinued!</p><p>Yep, all DIVX discs are unplayable now. They announced the discontinuation in 1999, and by 2001 the servers were turned off. All DIVX discs (even the ones upgraded to forever-playable) are just paperweights. (and btw: I’ve looked into the feasibility of hacking the encryption. They used 3DES, which is far from the best but is still pretty secure. Give me a million dollars and a year of computation time and I’ll be able to watch one film.)</p><p>So, with DIVX dying such a quick and painful death that it took out the major retailer that invented it, surely no one else would even consider this idea again, right?</p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b3937621c0802373d323c2e9e4c2b2b6/916f760cf43da8d3-d7/s1280x1920/360c1a33e223930050896e0b70f8849e8a91125d.jpg" data-big-photo-height="708" data-big-photo-width="582"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b3937621c0802373d323c2e9e4c2b2b6/916f760cf43da8d3-d7/s640x960/024287e966e6c4df3cc545fe29a512b218d52ac1.jpg" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>Welcome to FlexPlay. A 2003 format where you buy a DVD for cheap, and you can watch it for 24-48 hours. Even better than DIVX, because you don’t need a special player and you don’t even depend on talking to a server!</p><p>Wow. What weird technical tricks did they do to make this work? Is there a special program on the disc? Some kind of computer code? Special encryption? Can you only play it on a PC with some DRM software installed?</p><p>Nope! While DVDs have anti-copying DRM and DIVX added limited-playback DRM, FlexPlay goes completely the other route and has Analog Rights Management: the limited playback is enforced by CHEMISTRY.</p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f5ec71ebc9d0443783150f5e391b1632/916f760cf43da8d3-cb/s1280x1920/5e55ef5a7ca79bb81534da301e05ac0bb66cf92d.jpg" data-big-photo-height="541" data-big-photo-width="570"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f5ec71ebc9d0443783150f5e391b1632/916f760cf43da8d3-cb/s640x960/f36cfe6a08f3b1729d7c363312114c2d7dca9cbf.jpg" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>Yep. See, the way optical discs work is by shining a layer through the clear plastic and bouncing it off a mirrored layer of aluminium in the center of the disc. (Well, for pre-pressed discs. MO and CD-R/RW discs work differently)</p><p>But FlexPlay discs add a layer of dye between the aluminum and the plastic. This dye is initially transparent to the red laser used by DVD players (did you know that’s why blu-rays are called that? They use blue lasers instead of the red lasers used by DVD , and the infrared lasers used by CDs), so it can be read just fine.</p><p>But they made the dye react with oxygen. As soon as the airless bag the disc is stored in is opened, the dye starts darkening, eventually becoming unreadable. So once you have opened the disc, you better watch it soon, or it will be unreadable.</p><p>This format technically lived on until 2011 before being discontinued, but it doesn’t seem like it was terribly popular at any point. Part of this was probably that it couldn’t live up to the dream of selling a film on a disc you made for pennies, and making tons of profit. Making the discs was tricky, as you had to make them in special inert-atmosphere conditions to keep them from prematurely darkening.</p><p>Anyway the final joke of FlexPlay is that they haven’t been made since 2011, and while they were sold in air-tight packages, nothing is PERFECTLY airtight. So all the ones for sale have had the bags leak over the last 12+ years, and are prematurely unreadable. Whoops.</p><p>Anyway now that physical media is dead, movie companies finally have their time-limited rental they’ve always wanted. Streaming makes this trivial.</p><p>And two final notes:</p><p>1. There’s not really any lost-media risk with these two formats. All DIVX-only films were later released on DVD when the format ranked. And all FlexPlay films had already gotten DVD releases, so there was never any risk.</p><p>2. My buddy Technology Connections did a video in FlexPlay a while ago, if you want to learn more about it.</p><figure></figure></div>

To show off your technological skill and professionalism, make sure to bring at least two (2) copies of your resume with you, on both double-density 5¼&#34; and high-density PC-formatted 3.5&#34; floppy disks.

It won the Grand Prize at the Amsterdam Adult Film Festival, for the year 1970-1971! </p><p>BUT it&#39;s on Cartrivision. </p><p>Cartrivision was an early home videotape format announced in 1970, released in June 1972, and dead by July 1973. </p><p>It has some &#34;fun&#34; features, like not selling VCRs for it: you had to buy it build into a new console TV. Which were huge, because it was the 70s.</p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e6072efd9be88bdf58f8930512ff4b23/27d9fb35b0977821-1b/s1280x1920/84289b1702efcdc0e74d81ba7a1cdc10cd0b4459.png" data-big-photo-height="356" data-big-photo-width="596"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e6072efd9be88bdf58f8930512ff4b23/27d9fb35b0977821-1b/s640x960/3182a74a8be93a421ef8bd558151e3a50c13212b.png" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>There&#39;s also issue of <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b> (of which this is one!)</p><p>See, early on the movie industry hated the idea of home movies. They made all their money on movie tickets, right? People watching movies at home, that&#39;s gonna seriously cut into their market. This is why they later sued Sony for the introduction of Beta, arguing that it could be used to pirate movies by recording them off TV. (They lost)</p><p>So when Cartridge Television started selling Cartrivision in 1972, none of the movie studios really wanted to start selling their films on home tapes, that idea sounded scary. What if someone had a copy of all their favorite films and could watch them forever at home, and never went to the theaters ever again? The movie studios would go out of business! </p><p>So along with releasing a bunch of older B&amp;W movies (the only ones they could license), sporting events, and shows from PBS, Cartridge Television came up with a compromise that worked for the movie studios:</p><p><b><span>Red Tapes.</span></b></p><p>So, Cartrivision tapes came in two formats: Black Tapes and <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b>. Black tapes you&#39;d buy at the store like any other product, but for <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b> (which were relatively recent movies), you instead would go to the store and place an order from a catalog. The store would have it delivered by mail, then you&#39;d come back in and get the tape. You&#39;d take it home, watch it, and then return it back to the store. So... Video rental (like Blockbuster!), except they didn&#39;t have any stock on hand, and only got the tapes on-demand by mail? Seems annoying. </p><p>BUT OH NO: it&#39;s far more annoying than that. See... <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b> aren&#39;t mechanically like Black Tapes.</p><p><b>You can&#39;t rewind them. </b></p><p>You can play them and pause or stop them just like any other tape, but the rewind feature on your Cartrivison TV doesn&#39;t work.</p><p>So once you start watching a film, you can only go forward from that point. You want to rewatch it? Too bad. Go back to the store and pay for it again. </p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1630f7f1f8dc5ffda01fdd6b2fa3b430/27d9fb35b0977821-20/s1280x1920/d30e2dce9c2df9af0266b8b1ee1599b25dc4775e.jpg" data-big-photo-height="2543" data-big-photo-width="2449"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1630f7f1f8dc5ffda01fdd6b2fa3b430/27d9fb35b0977821-20/s1280x1920/d30e2dce9c2df9af0266b8b1ee1599b25dc4775e.jpg" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>Here&#39;s that tape again. Note that it&#39;s red: You can only watch this porn film once. Then you have to return it to the store... the stores that haven&#39;t been doing this since JULY OF 1973. </p><p>But there&#39;s another thing you can see on this picture (barely, because this is a blurry picture, thanks Past!Foone): The visible screws in the corners </p><p>So here&#39;s the thing: The tape labels for Cartrivision hide the screws. A regular tape will look like this:</p><div><div><figure><a data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d074909baebcf019c60aeeed21a82304/27d9fb35b0977821-86/s1280x1920/ec29907d9282a9004a9622ac3d797658df7bfecc.png" data-big-photo-height="954" data-big-photo-width="930"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d074909baebcf019c60aeeed21a82304/27d9fb35b0977821-86/s1280x1920/ec29907d9282a9004a9622ac3d797658df7bfecc.png" alt="image"/></a></figure></div></div><p>BUT when Cartrivision failed in July 1973, a bunch of stores sold off their unsold inventory, including watch-once <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b>. And people still had some of the players. But what&#39;s the point of having a tape you can&#39;t rewind? You&#39;ve basically destroyed the tape now, since it&#39;s stuck at the end and can&#39;t be rewound! </p><p>So people bought some of those <b><span>Red Tapes</span></b> (cheaply, I hope) and then took them home and opened them up with a screwdriver, damaging the labels. They figured out how the no-rewinding mechanism worked, and removed it. So basically every <b><span>Red Tape</span></b> you will find for sale on ebay has visible screws, because someone modded it in the past. </p><p>Anyway, the format has been dead so long that it&#39;s doubly-impossible to watch now. The players were only built into big heavy 1970s TVs, which were long ago thrown out. The tapes have gotten old and brittle. If you somehow DID have a player, and it somehow still worked after half a century, the tape will probably shatter as soon as you try to play it. </p><p>And the whole format only lasted 13 months, so there wasn&#39;t that much inventory sold in the first place, so there wasn&#39;t a huge number of these in existence anyway. </p><p>But a final fun fact: Someone HAS managed to get video off one of these tapes. And it was so hard that they made an award-winning documentary about it. </p><p>See, this was basically the first home video format for recording TV. The quality was terrible but it was better than nothing, and it turns out some fan with a Cartrivision recorded a copy of Game 5 of the  1973 NBA Finals game. ABC and both teams (LA Lakers &amp; NY Knicks) had video copies of that game... and ALL THREE OF THEM LOST IT. But the fan copy survived, in a format no one could play, on a tape that would shatter if you tried to play it.</p><p>So DuArt Media Services got to work trying to rescue the tape. They had to dry it out, bake it, freeze it, soak it in alcohol, and rebuild a broken Cartrivision unit, then do a lot of manual fixups on the digital files they&#39;d captured off the tape, but they finally managed to capture the recording of the game. </p><p>This was used for the MSG Network, who were doing a special on the 1973 championship, and had no footage of that pivotal game. With DuArt&#39;s work, they had something to show. </p><p>DuArt then made a documentary about this, called &#34;Lost and Found: The ’73 Knicks Championship Tape&#34;. It won an Emmy.</p><p>The punchline? That documentary seems to be lost. I have been looking for years, and have not found a copy, other than <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F107292358&amp;t=M2YyODhhYzRiZjY2NzI2YjEyZDQ1ZTYxMDllNGJkYThjYjhlOTJjOCxjWXJ5SkJTaw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AApoj1PKRUfmTctq64Q1Llg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffoone.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F708184349558947840%2Freblogging-because-i-want-to-be-sure-i-have-a&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1675401212">a short excerpt on Vimeo</a>.</p><p>So yeah. Cartrivision. I&#39;m slightly obsessed with it, even though I&#39;ve never actually been able to watch a single second of Cartrivison footage. Tapes occasionally show up on ebay, the odd technical manual or spare part, but players are rare, always broken, and probably would just shred the tapes even if they did somehow work. The tapes are just too old. &#39;</p><p>Cartrivision is just... dead and gone. Not yet forgotten, but it took media restoration experts a long time and a lot of work to even get a few minutes of footage off one tape. My chances of ever being able to play my Adultery for Fun &amp; Profit tape are basically negative zero. </p>
