Remarkably, this agrees with what is independently predicted from BAO-only or BAO+CMB analyses, though this fact has received little attention so far.&#34;</p><p>To further confirm their results, the Yonsei team are now carrying out an &#34;evolution-free test&#34;, which uses only supernovae from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. The first results already support their main conclusion.</p><div><p><a href="http://tinylogger.com/sites/default/files/2025-10/Vera%20C.%20Rubin%20Observatory.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://tinylogger.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_full_content/public/2025-10/Vera%20C.%20Rubin%20Observatory.jpeg?itok=Hj7lmmZk" width="850" height="567" alt="The Vera C.
