<li>hey!</li>
<li>wow sunday really crept up on me this week, as well as the bank holiday. every bank holiday this year i&#39;ve forgotten about until it was already upon me, terrible habit.</li>
<li>listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtq4NVC2Ivs">over the moon</a> by penelope scott on loop</li>
<li>the thing that&#39;s helped the most with writer&#39;s block this week is confronting my inner critic, my therapist is probably like &#34;duh&#34; if she reads these (i doubt she does very strongly). just thinking &#34;it doesn&#39;t actually matter if these words are rubbish or unusable in the final thing&#34; helps me get out of my way. that, youtube videos, loud music, and reminding myself it&#39;s hard for at least the first five minutes has helped immensely!</li>
<li>i tried to get back on <a href="http://750words.com/">750words.com</a> but i am very infrequent. i think i get bored of my inner landacape at times lol. i don&#39;t have many &#34;audible&#34; thoughts unless i purposely try to (we can tell olu! you cry. it&#39;s all vibes over here, i won&#39;t think about it anyway), and journalling is like kicking up all the sendiment in my brain and it feels very loud in there after. i am just doing freewriting though so maybe i should go in with a question every time.</li>
<li>i just came across these internet enabled typewriter things called freewriters, i want <a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/smart-typewriter-gen3-special-valentine-edition">the red one</a> so badly. not enough to pay £600+ right now though lol.</li>
<li>gone crawling back to todoist which is a strange feeling, i was like in the top 5% percent of users in terms of number of checked off and made items or something for a while, now i have chilled on the way it encourages you to plan, but i cannot deny the utility of not having to manually move all my todos over. i do interstitial journalling in <a href="https://workflowy.com/invite/77722f18.lnx">workflowy</a> and put anything i want to do later in todoiat. obsidian is wasted on me, i am sure i could do more of this in there but i am lazy to work it out, sorry.</li>
<li>gradually dawning on me that when you&#39;re not straight-sized and, tbh, not exactly the shape, height, etc of the fit model making clothes is actually hard(er, lots of people are telling me it&#39;s straightfoward once you get the hang of it!) and you can&#39;t just choose a size off the packet, sew it up and expect it to fit how you want. sad stuff, but increasing my wish to do some sewing courses soon!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating pistachio ice cream, chorizo and chickpea stew, and scones with clotted cream and jam. i&#39;ve been drinking lavender sleepy tea and peach fizzy drinks.</li>
<li>see you next week!</li>
