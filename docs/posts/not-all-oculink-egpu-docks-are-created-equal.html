    <h1>Not all OCuLink eGPU docks are created equal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently tried using the <a href="https://amzn.to/46Y65Wo">Minisforum DEG1 GPU Dock</a> with a Raspberry Pi 500+, using an M.2 to OCuLink adapter, and <a href="https://amzn.to/48CZlyl">this chenyang SFF-8611 Cable</a>.</p>

<p>After figuring out there&#39;s a power button on the DEG1 (which needs to be turned on), and after fiddling around with the switches on the PCB (hidden under the large metal plate on the bottom; TGX to OFF was the most important setting), I was able to get the Raspberry Pi&#39;s PCIe bus to at least tell the graphics card installed in the eGPU dock to spin up its fans and initialize.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#39;t able to get any output from the card (using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/discussions/756">this Linux kernel patch</a>), and <code>lspci</code> did not show it. (Nor were there any logs showing errors in <code>dmesg</code>).</p>

<p>I switched back to my <a href="https://amzn.to/3IBI3XY">JMT eGPU OCuLink dock</a> for the rest of my testing, and uploaded a <a href="https://youtu.be/Dv3RRAx7G6E?t=321">video detailing some of my struggles</a>, and a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/full-egpu-acceleration-on-pi-500-15-line-patch">blog post detailing the Pi 500+ eGPU testing</a>.</p>

<p>A few commenters mentioned they <em>too</em> had issues with the Minisforum DEG1. But a few of them looked closely at the <em>OCuLink cable</em> Minisforum included, and noted there were a couple extra colored wires going through the cable sleeve that <em>didn&#39;t</em> seem to be present on other cables—like the chenyang I was using! They suggested I try swapping cables.</p>

<p>So I did... and testing it with an RX 6500 XT worked!</p>

<p>Looking closely at the cables side by side, I can confirm what some of the commenters said: the cable that came with the DEG1 looks like it has additional colored wires going between the connectors.</p>

<p>Moral of the <em>this</em> portion of the story: not all OCuLink cables are created equal.</p>

<h2>Going Deeper</h2>

<p>But then I swapped back to my RX 7900 XT, the one that was previously unrecognized in the Miniforum dock... and it still wouldn&#39;t work.</p>

<pre><code>$ lspci
0002:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 30)
0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Raspberry Pi Ltd RP1 PCIe 2.0 South Bridge
</code></pre>

<p>I tried all three switches in different settings, I tried swapping OCuLink cables back and forth again... nothing. The RX 6500 XT was happy as can be, but the 7900? Nope.</p>

<p>I even popped in an Intel B580 card, and <em>it</em> worked too...</p>

<pre><code>$ lspci
0001:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 30)
0001:01:00.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2ff (rev 01)
0001:02:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2f0
0001:02:02.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device e2f1
0001:03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Battlemage G21 [Arc B580]
0001:04:00.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Device e2f7
0002:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 30)
0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Raspberry Pi Ltd RP1 PCIe 2.0 South Bridge
</code></pre>

<p>So now I&#39;m left scratching my head: <em>what&#39;s different about the RX 7900 XT?</em> And <em>why does my cheaper $50 eGPU dock seem to work with everything, but the $99 Minisforum DEG1 doesn&#39;t?</em></p>

<p>Searching through forum posts, I even found <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=387794">someone running a 7900 XT in the DEG1 on a Pi</a>, so maybe it&#39;s just a strange fluke with my setup?</p>

<p>Inconsistencies like these really bother me. And they usually eat up an entire afternoon, because I&#39;m always <em>certain</em> it&#39;s a PEBKAC, and I usually exhaust every route debugging before I&#39;d waste a vendor or a maintainer&#39;s time with a bug report!</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t yet torn down one of these cables to try to figure out which pins are perhaps missing on the chenyang cable (see <a href="https://jpc-pt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AMPH-OCUL4X-A-RA-XXX-Sent-Out_01.jpg">OCuLink Pinouts here</a>. The bigger issue there is, I can&#39;t find a source for the cable Minisforum includes separate from the DEG1 dock, and most online listings don&#39;t clearly show which kind of cable you&#39;ll get—with or without the extra wires!</p></div></div>
