    <h1>Ask HN: What was your most humbling learning moment?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve worked on large products for large and small companies and written tens of thousands of lines of code across my career, solving complex, abstract, challenging technical problems in a variety of languages on a variety of platforms, sometimes under difficult conditions. I have often been a resource for my friends and co-workers when they have programming or technical questions.</p><p>I only recently learned how to correctly raise and lower window blinds--I had been doing it wrong my entire life. It was maybe the dumbest I have ever felt, and was a humbling reminder of how much I don&#39;t know about how much I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Have you had similar experiences?</p></div></div></div>
