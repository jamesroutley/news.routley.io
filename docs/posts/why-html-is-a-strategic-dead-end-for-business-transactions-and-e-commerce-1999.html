<p>3270 is dead. The only question is how long will it take to bury the body – 
10 years, 15 years, more ? HTML, the new hot display technology, is immensely 
popular today. However, like its 3270 cousin, HTML is ultimately as 
strategically dead as 3270 is. HTML suffers from the same ultimate fatal 
weaknesses that doomed 3270 – it is principally a display technology, that 
treats intelligent devices like PCs and PDAs as dumbed down display devices. 
<br/></p>
<p>While HTML can be extended to do &#34;dynamic&#34; things like fancy drop-down lists, 
user input validation, animation of client screens objects, etc, this requires 
the use of outboard programming languages such as JavaScript or VB-Script 
running on the client. While this is a welcome relief from truly awful 
approaches such as HLLAPI, the net effect is that all this huffing and puffing 
and fancy programming still revolves around a dumb display model. The wave of 
the future, particularly in business-to-business, database to database, 
messaging system to messaging system, and other advanced forms of these such as 
E-commerce, is not well served by trying to promulgate data around the network 
using HTML (aka display) formats. Trying to make such systems inter-operate 
using HTML as a basis of interoperability will ultimately result in &#34;screen 
scraping phase II&#34;, only this time using HTML tags rather than 3270 attribute 
bytes. HTML provides a pretty face, but a lousy system-to-system transaction 
environment.</p>
<p>CICS has recently added HTML support to its bag of tricks. You can re-compile 
your 3270 BMS maps and have them generate HTML formats rather than 3270 formats. 
While this is technically interesting, it is a best a pyrrhic victory. It only 
underscores that CICS continues to be cursed by its 3270 legacy.</p>
<p>The world is moving increasingly toward intelligent applications consisting 
of: software components that communicate with each other, &#34;active databases&#34; 
that communicate with each other, objects that communicate with each other, 
messaging systems that communicate with each other, and so forth. In such a 
world, display based technologies such as HTML are increasingly dysfunctional. 
This is because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Intelligent system-to-system interaction requires information about the 
  data structure of the information sent. Using old-style &#34;application embedded 
  knowledge&#34; of the data (e.g. COBOL copy books of what the data &#34;should&#34; look 
  like), breaks down as hundreds of new component based and object based 
  applications come online. It becomes an N x N type of problem to make such old 
  application technologies work together. Not every bank or shipping company in 
  the world is going to be able to publish its display formats and program for 
  everyone else’s formats. The complexity becomes overwhelming. 
  </li><li>Automated translation of one data format into a different data format is 
  difficult, when only display format information is present. 
  </li><li>Trying to make screen-scraping techniques work with new applications has 
  proven to be a mess. 
  </li><li>Maintenance becomes a major problem. Even minor changes in display format 
  often causes existing screen scraper or logic that depends upon fixed 
  format/fixed position fields to fail.</li></ol>
<p>For E-commerce or other business-to-business data exchange to work, some form 
of any-to-any connectivity is a required fundamental building block. To make 
<u>any-to-any connectivity</u> work between companies, some form of 
<u>self-description of the data records/data objects/data messages</u> <u>being 
sent from one organization to another</u> becomes imperative. Simple, &#34;I can get 
TCP/IP to work between two companies&#34; level of wire connectivity is 
insufficient. Application level connectivity is required to make automated 
business-to-business transactions feasible. For any-to-any, plug-and-play 
application level connectivity to work, the data must be self-describing.</p>
<p>The wave of the future will be application designs that can exchange 
self-describing data and forms. There are several potential candidates, such as 
DRDA, IIOP, DCOM (on a good day), XML, and so forth. The most <u>ubiquitous and 
widely available cross-platform solution</u> is XML (Extended Markup Language). 
It provides a completely self-describing format of the data or message being 
sent or received. XML meta-data formats (DTDs) for a message can be either 
included in-line or centralized in a repository and referenced via a standard 
web URL.</p>
<p>E-commerce and Web applications using XML are just beginning to appear. A 
standardized programming interface to process XML documents/forms/records, 
called DOM (Document Object Model) has recently been approved. Microsoft’s 
Internet Explorer 5 (IE5) browser comes with XML and DOM support built in. 
Microsoft’s Web Server-based ASP technology can be used to easily generate XML 
output, and process incoming XML input. &#34;Open Source&#34; based solutions exist on 
the internet to process XML, and Apache Web Server based solutions such as JSP 
(Java Server Pages) can generate and process XML just as easily as Microsoft’s 
ASP.</p>
<p>Truly powerful applications can be built using combinations of JavaScript and 
XML. Not only can the data and its format (XML) be shipped to another system, 
but the associated processing logic to validate data entered into the record or 
form can be shipped along as JavaScript as well. XML can be used to mediate 
between Database row-based output, asynchronous message records, and other types 
of business forms and data. And because XML is self describing, applications are 
insulated from changes in the underlying record format. </p>
<p>Business-based TXP systems of the future will need to incorporate XML as part 
of their backbone services technology. The ability to read and understand an XML 
description of an incoming record or object, and the ability to easily generate 
XML to describe an outbound record or object, will be a major requirement for 
system-to-system, business-to-business transaction processing. Intelligent 
browsers will have XML built in, allowing XML to be used bi-directionally all 
the way up and down the business hierarchy: from PDAs to PCs to Web/App Servers 
to Transaction processors. Final output to human end-users will be achieved via 
XML to XSL or XML to CSS rendering engines, operating on the local PC or PDA. 
All system-to-system interactions will use the self-describing forms embodied in 
XML. As XML-enabled browsers (such as IE 5) proliferate, HTML will begin its 
long, slow descent into emulating the 3270’s legacy – another dead-end display 
only technology.</p>
