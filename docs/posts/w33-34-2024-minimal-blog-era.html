<h2 id="farewell-old-theme-hello-new-theme">Farewell old theme, hello new theme!</h2>
<p>I liked the theme prior to this (I somehow managed to stick with it for a year), but was craving for something simpler, one where I could focus on the writing rather than obsessing over the aesthetics of the site. The inspiration came mainly from two websites â€“ <a href="http://derekkedziora.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derek Kedziora&#39;s website</a> for the layout and <a href="https://kevincox.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Cox&#39;s website</a> for the color scheme.</p>
<p>This was also a good opportunity to simplify the structure of my site, since I started from scratch with a new directory and copied necessary files from the previous directory. I also got around to making some edits to older posts. Still have a combination of major and minor fixes to make, but I think I&#39;ve reached a point where I can take a break and focus on posting for sometime.</p>
<h2 id="progress-on-installing-linux-on-a-mac">Progress on installing Linux on a Mac</h2>
<p>After publishing <a href="https://pjg1.site/weeknotes-32-2024">the last weeknote</a>, a fellow Recurser reached out with links on how I could install the WiFi driver without requiring an Ethernet connection. Those links were a good starting point, and I finally found a solution that worked!</p>
<p>However, I&#39;ve had issues with WiFi again the next few times I ran the machine. I didn&#39;t come around to focusing on this much, so that&#39;s on my list for the coming week. Might make a post about this once I get it working.</p>
<h2 id="touching-grass">Touching grass</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve become a homebody since the last few years (thanks 2020), and I finally feel like I&#39;m taking efforts towards going outside more. In the last two weeks, I&#39;ve stepped out not once, not twice, but THRICE. Big achievement.</p>
<h2 id="linkers-are-tough-to-understand">Linkers are tough to understand</h2>
<p>I finally finished reading the chapter about Linkers from <a href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS:APP</a>, and oh my linkers are cool but hard to grasp. I like working on some sort of tiny project to solidify my learning, but I don&#39;t have a strong project idea for linkers. So I&#39;m just going to hope this knowledge comes to use when a linker error shows up.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also surprised how I didn&#39;t really read physical books much during my time at uni, but I&#39;m willingly reading one (and enjoying it) when there&#39;s no academic pressure. Oh, the joys of self-learning.</p>
<h2 id="learning-plan-is-evolving">Learning plan is evolving</h2>
<p>I spent this weekend identifying specific concepts I always wanted to learn, and tried looking for project ideas that will help me learn them. I also looked out for resources that could provide the foundational knowledge.</p>
<p>I&#39;m scared, but also excited.</p></div></div>
