      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I think this might actually be a few questions:<pre><code>  1. Has anybody noticed their own cognitive decline? I&#39;m 30 but am interested in experiences at all ages
  2. Does anybody have a good way of testing their intellect or problem-solving periodically? This would at least help me keep track going forward
  3. Has anybody found ways to improve their problem-solving skills? Or critical thinking?
</code></pre>
I feel like my ability to solve problems well - efficiently, cleverly, satisfactorily, completely - has reduced over time (past year, maybe multiple years? I&#39;m not really sure.) For example, I&#39;ll find that a programming solution didn&#39;t account for things I should&#39;ve considered or introduced a new bug; or a co-worker will suggest a different solution and it seems obviously better. I don&#39;t think this has always been the case; I used to be pretty school smart in subjects like math and comp sci. My theories:<pre><code>  - Maybe my intellect has diminished from using alcohol and weed at an early age?
  - Maybe that I&#39;ve been feeling a bit burnt out
  - Maybe I&#39;ve gotten lazy and rely too much on, e.g., stackoverflow
  - Maybe medicine I take for mental health?
  - Insufficient sleep? I&#39;ve been getting 6-7 recently but should probably be getting 7-9
  - Maybe I&#39;ve actually always been dumb and am only now realizing it!
</code></pre>
Any thoughts would be appreciated. If it&#39;s something I can change, that would be a huge relief.</td></tr>
