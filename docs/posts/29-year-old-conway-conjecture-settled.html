						<p><a href="https://users.utu.fi/iatorm/">Ilkka Törmä</a> and <a href="http://www.villesalo.com/">Ville Salo</a>, a pair of researchers at the University of Turku in Finland, have found a finite configuration in Conway’s Game of Life such that, if it occurs within a universe at time T, it must have existed in that same position at time T−1 (and therefore, by induction, at time 0). Here is the configuration of live and dead cells, surrounded by an infinite background of grey “don’t care” cells:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/torma-salo.png" alt="" width="560" height="464" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/torma-salo.png 560w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/torma-salo-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"/></p>
<p>The configuration was discovered by experimenting with finite patches of repeating ‘agar’ and using a SAT solver to check whether any of them possess this property. Similarly, one can use a SAT solver to verify that Törmä and Salo’s result is correct.</p>
<p>Since this configuration can be stabilised (by the addition of further live cells, shown in yellow) into a finite still-life, this demonstrates that not every still-life can be constructed by colliding gliders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cunningham.png" alt="" width="560" height="464" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cunningham.png 560w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cunningham-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"/></p>
<p>The first finite stabilisation was 374 cells, but this was promptly reduced to 334 cells by Danielle Conway and then to the 306-cell configuration above by Oscar Cunningham. Oscar moreover proved, again using SAT solvers, that this is the minimum-population stabilisation of the Törmä-Salo configuration.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have the following pair of bounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every strict still-life with ≤ 20 cells can be synthesised by gliders.</li>
<li>There exists a strict still-life with 306 cells that cannot be synthesised.</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, the Törmä-Salo result positively answers a question first posed by John Conway himself on 24th August 1992:</p>
<blockquote><p>The things buildable by gliders (an idea I think first popularized</p>
<p>This brings me to an interesting point – the false lessons experience</p>
<p>A non-constructible</p>
<p>Indeed, is there a Godlike still-life, one that can only have existed</p>
<p>Well, I’m going out to get a hot dog now, so will stop this. It was</p></blockquote>
<p>The construction also implies a solution to the <em>generalised grandfather problem</em>: a pattern which has an N-tick predecessor but not an (N+1)-tick predecessor. The diameter of such a pattern grows like Θ(sqrt(log(N))).</p>
<p>Previous results were known for small values of N (<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Garden_of_Eden#Explicit_examples">N=0 by Roger Banks</a>, and <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Grandfather_problem">N=1,2,3 by mtve</a>). Recently Törmä and Salo settled the problem for all positive integers, but the diameter of the pattern implied by their proof grows like Θ(N). A few days later they discovered the pattern in this post, which implies the stronger (and indeed optimal up to a constant factor) result above.</p>
<p>In other GoL-related news:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Raucci <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/44P38">discovered the first oscillator of period 38</a>. The remaining unsolved periods are 19, 34, and 41.</li>
<li>Darren Li has connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_Engine">Charity Engine</a> to <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/home">Catagolue</a>, providing approximately 2000 CPU cores of continuous effort and searching slightly more than 10^12 random initial configurations per day.</li>
<li>Nathaniel Johnston and Dave Greene have published <a href="https://conwaylife.com/book/">a book</a> on Conway’s Game of Life, featuring both the theoretical aspects and engineering that’s been accomplished in the half-century since its conception. Unfortunately it was released slightly too early to include the Törmä-Salo result or Raucci’s period-38 oscillator.</li>
