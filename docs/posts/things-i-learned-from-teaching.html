    <p>
      This spring, I taught an undergraduate class on chess engines. I probably learned more than
      any of my students.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a senior in college, I was the instructor, lecturer, grader, master of ceremonies, and
      grand poobah of COLL 110: <cite>Artificial Intelligence for Chess</cite>, 6-7 P.M. every
      Tuesday for the whole semester. In theory, I had a faculty advisor, but he was busy most of
      the time, so at the end of the day, it was my rodeo and I got to figure it all out on my own.
      I thought it was a great experience!
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m writing this post for a few reasons: first, I want to write down the things I wish that I
      had known before I started teaching, in the hopes that other soon-to-be teachers might take
      this to heart. The other reason is to compile my own thoughts on the matter, since I&#39;ll
      possibly revive this class in the future, and want to have some notes while it&#39;s fresh in my
      mind.
    </p>
    <h2>You&#39;re not even their second priority</h2>
    <p>
      If you&#39;re teaching a topic, you&#39;re probably really passionate about it (unless, of course, the
      department forced you to teach the class). At the very least, I am. Chess engines are cool.
      Lucky for me, students taking a COLL course get little in the way of credit for the class, so
      most of my pupils were also pretty stoked about it. At the end of the day, though, they&#39;re not
      getting a Ph.D. in this stuff, and they&#39;ve got half a dozen other classes on top of work,
      family, friends, and this weekend&#39;s party to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      To an instructor, this tends to manifest as an air of boredom with the whole topic. Often, the
      students aren&#39;t actually bored! They just don&#39;t have the time or energy for the topic that I
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fix, I think, is to meet students where they are. The hard (and rewarding) part of
      teaching a class is that I needed to digest reams of material into brief,
      easily-comprehensible components. I have the patience to trawl through uncommented C++ code
      and ancient forum posts to figure out how to build a good chess engine, but the students
      shouldn&#39;t need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m not a hundred percent certain of the exact mechanisms of <em>how</em>, yet. In my
      experience, I learn the most when I struggle; if a student can shortcut through all the hard
      parts on, for example, and assignment, they&#39;re not going to learn very much. On the flip side,
      when most students struggle, they just give up. Somehow I need to make assignments which
      thread the needle between being too hard to solve and too easy to learn anything.
    </p>
    <h2>Students have wildly varying backgrounds</h2>
    <p>
      Chess engines are a relatively niche topic in computer science, so I was quite surprised to
      see that my class section was completely full at the start of the semester. It seems as though
      most of the students had been clickbaited by my mention of AI in the title, which is more a
      callout for classical artificial intelligence than it is for the modern machine-learning
      approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a handful of students dropped the course, I was eventually left with about a dozen
      students whose experience and programming skill varied wildly. Some of my students had
      finished little more than an introductory computer science course, while others were more
      qualified than I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      This presents a fundamental problem: how do I come up with a curriculum which is complex
      enough to excite the experienced students without completely losing the less experienced ones?
      The cynical answer is &#34;you can&#39;t,&#34; but I did give it a fair attempt, and I think it turned out
      OK. Typically, I tried to integrate a mix of skill levels into my lectures; for instance, when
      discussing the representation of squares and directions, I spent a few minutes explaining how
      they could be modeled with torsors, but not so long that I would lose the students who neither
      knew nor cared about group theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assignment design is harder. I tried to give interesting challenges by leaving bonus tasks on
      every assignment, and for the final project, I gave a choose-your-own-adventure assignment
      which allowed students to pick a task that matched their skill level. However, I&#39;m not
      convinced that I perfected this approach, so I will need to think more deeply on how do design
      &#34;multi-level&#34; projects for a mixed student body.
    </p>
    <h2>Engagement falls off in the first ten minutes</h2>
    <p>
      COLL 110 was a standard lectures-and-assignments college class - I lectured during our
      scheduled meeting time, then students did their projects on their own. Having tried this, I
      think that this is just not the future of education. This mode of teaching is designed mostly
      for the lecturer&#39;s convenience, but it&#39;s a terrible way to foster student understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental reality is that it&#39;s impossible to listen actively for a long period of time.
      It was even worse in my case: I was teaching a blow-off class at the end of the day, so
      students were already tired and didn&#39;t feel any pressure to keep up. The net result was that
      only about half of my students were really paying attention at a time, which is pretty bad if
      you want them to actually learn anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m certain that I will need to use a different format for lessons in the future. Flipped
      classrooms are popular these days, so I might try that, but I also feel that pre-recorded
      lectures are a little soulless. I might try a hybrid approach, integrating lectures with
      assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of engagement, one of the best lectures I ever gave was the introduction to Rust.
      This was because I got people to pull up the
      <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">Rust Playground</a> on their laptops, so they were
      actively running and debugging code in class and I could work with them. Moving forward, I
      want to try stuff like this some more: fully-interactive in-class content which revolves
      around student experimentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easier said than done, though. Getting people to code in person is actually quite difficult,
      and if there&#39;s only one of me, I can&#39;t keep up with every student at once. COMP 140, the
      introductory CS class at Rice, manages this with a small army of TAs who can keep up with all
      the students, but I don&#39;t have any TAs to do that for me.
    </p>
    <h2>Nobody goes to office hours</h2>
    <p>
      On every assignment, one of my students would write something like this in the comments of
      their submission.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// This doesn&#39;t work and I don&#39;t know why. 
// I didn&#39;t have enough time to figure it out.</code></pre>
    <p>
      And, invariably, every <em>single</em> time, the problem with their work was something that I
      could have (and would have happily) explained to them at office hours or even in an email. It
      saddens me greatly to see these kinds of submissions, since it&#39;s evidence of a completely
      solvable problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really love getting to work with students one-on-one. It often reveals gaps in understanding
      that aren&#39;t obvious in lecture or in assignments, and also shows me where I&#39;m failing to cover
      material. One of my best experiences when holding office hours was when I got to explain how
      the function call stack works to an underclassman, and it was really fulfilling to see how it
      &#34;clicked&#34; for them. When students show up to office hours, it&#39;s extremely valuable for me and
      for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that there are a few reasons that students don&#39;t like to show up to office hours. The
      first, simplest reason, is simply availability. I think a lot of students start their projects
      far later than they really ought to, and so by the time that they get stuck, there aren&#39;t any
      office hours between then and the due date. The easiest fix is to make office hours available
      on the same day that assignments are due, so that I can be available when students are working
      on the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second issue is comfort: sometimes, students feel like they&#39;re imposing on their
      instructors&#39; time by showing up to office hours. This isn&#39;t helped by the fact that some
      professors can be downright <em>mean</em> to their students at office hours, which can leave a
      bad taste in students&#39; mouths, even for other classes. When I spoke to one of my instructional
      advisors about this, she recommended that I refer to office hours as &#34;student hours&#34; instead,
      in order to set the expectation that it&#39;s there for the students&#39; benefit.
    </p>
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      I didn&#39;t come away from teaching this class feeling like I had mastered the art of pedagogy,
      or even thinking that I was half decent. I suspect that the core challenges that I faced were
      much the same as with any other class, though perhaps exacerbated by COLL 110&#39;s status as an
      elective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, I think it was a great opportunity for me to learn and grow as a person, and has
      helped me a lot, especially in writing, public speaking, and professional communication. If
      you&#39;re on the fence about teaching, you should definitely give it a try, if only because
      interacting with students is such a rewarding experience.
