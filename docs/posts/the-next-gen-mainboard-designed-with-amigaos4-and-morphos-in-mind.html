<h3>First things first…</h3>



<p>Let’s take a moment to appreciate Trevor Dickinson and his incredible contributions to the Amiga world. His dedication and support have been instrumental in bringing us the next generation of Amiga computers, the ExecSG Kernel and the ongoing development of the Radeon Graphics drivers. Without having machines like the X1000, X5000 and A1222 this project would have never been born. <em><strong>Thank you Trevor, for keeping the Amiga spirit alive!</strong></em></p>



<h3>Rebooting The Next-Gen Amiga Dream</h3>



<p>The<strong> Amiga</strong>, a once-dominant force in the personal computer world, continues to hold a special place in the hearts of many. But with limited next-gen hardware available and dwindling AmigaOS4 support, the future of this beloved platform seemed uncertain. That is, until a few Dutch passionate individuals decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>



<p>Driven by a shared love for the Amiga and a desire to see it thrive, they embarked on an ambitious project: to create a new, low-cost next-gen Amiga mainboard.</p>

<p><strong>The Vision:</strong></p>



<p>The goal was clear: to create a mainboard that would breathe new life into the next-gen Amiga platform. A board that would be affordable for hobbyists and enthusiasts, while offering the power and performance to run all AmigaOS software and games.</p>



<p><strong>The Road Ahead:</strong></p>



<p>The journey is filled with challenges, from overcoming technical hurdles to navigating the complexities of cheap production and logistics as for getting the needed software components up and running. But Dave and Harald fueled by their passion and the unwavering support of the Amiga community, remain committed to their vision.</p>



<p><strong>A Testament to Community Spirit:</strong></p>



<p>The story of Dave and Harald, is a testament to the power of community. It demonstrates how a shared love for technology and a collective effort can bring about remarkable achievements.</p>



<p><strong>Stay Tuned:</strong></p>



<p>As the project progresses, we will continue to provide updates on the development of the new<strong> Mirari</strong> Amiga mainboard. The progress can be found on <a href="https://mirari.vitasys.nl/the-first-rebirth/" data-type="page" data-id="61">The First Rebirth</a> page.</p>



<p><strong>The Future of the Amiga is in Our Hands.</strong></p>
