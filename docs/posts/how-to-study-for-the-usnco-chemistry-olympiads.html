<hr/>

<p>In 2006 and 2007, I competed in the USNCO, making it to the Study
Camp in 2006 (my junior year in high school) and then to the IChO in
2007, winning a silver medal in Moscow, Russia. Afterwards, I majored in
Chemistry at MIT and mentored students at the Study Camp from 2010-2012.
In 2013-15, I wrote the majority of the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/woot-chem">ChemWOOT</a>
course, which I credit for the massive difficulty bump that happened in
2017 at the USNCO National level.</p>
<p>Here’s my take on preparing for the USNCO.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-usnco">What is the USNCO?</h2>
<p>The US National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) is a three-tier
competition run by the American Chemical Society (ACS) to select the top
high school students (4, plus alternates) to represent the United States
at the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO).</p>
<p>The first tier is the Local examination, which is a 60-question
multiple choice exam. Anybody is eligible to compete, and 10-20,000
students take the Local exams each year in March.</p>
<p>The second tier is the National examination, which has three parts: a
harder 60-question multiple choice section, an 8-question free response
section, and a hands-on experimental lab section. The top ~1000 students
across the U.S. are invited to take this exam, occuring late April.</p>
<p>The third tier is the USNCO Study Camp, a two-week intensive where
students spend all day learning advanced chemistry, running lab
experiments, and taking theoretical exams as difficult as the ones at
the IChO. The top-scoring 20 students from the National level are
invited to this camp, occuring in June.</p>
<p>The IChO is hosted by a different country every year and occurs in
July.</p>
<h2 id="how-hard-is-the-usnco">How hard is the USNCO?</h2>
<p>USNCO locals are roughly the level of the AP Chemistry test - if you
can get a 5 on the AP, you’ll do decently on this test. However, to make
the cut for nationals, you’ll need to score near-perfectly, especially
in competitive states like California.</p>
<p>Qualifying for the National level is a big accomplishment, placing
you in the top 1,000 out of approximately 10-20,000 students who take
the USNCO Local examination.</p>
<p>USNCO Nationals are at the level of a typical college introductory
course in General Chemistry. On top of the standard AP Chemistry topics,
the USNCO Nationals will expect you to be able to handle elaborate
calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>equilibrium: multiprotic acids/bases, buffers, zwitterions,
complexation, common-ion, solubility with interfering ions</li>
<li>kinetics: rate laws, pre-equilibrium approximation, steady-state
approximation, Michaelis-Menten equation, catalysts, Arrhenius rate
equation, and connection with equilibrium (e.g. Curtin-Hammett
principle)</li>
<li>thermodynamics: a thorough understanding of Delta G, Delta S, Delta
H, and non-equilibrium conditions</li>
<li>electrochemistry: batteries, reduction potential, and calculation of
potentials at non-standard conditions</li>
<li>“trivia”: flame test colors, advanced solubility rules, transition
metal ion colors, properties of unusual ions with niche uses (cyanide,
superoxides, carbides, peroxides, thiocyanates, azides, thiosulfate,
triiodide, fulminates).</li>
<li>organic chemistry: knowledge roughly equivalent to an introductory
class at the college level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Study Camp and IChO test your chemistry understanding at a level
comparable to a college junior majoring in Chemistry.</p>
<p>Compared to the other olympiads, the USNCO is more difficult than the
USABO (biology) exam, but less difficult than the USAPhO (Physics) exam.
The USAMO is by far the most difficult exam of the group.</p>
<h2 id="why-compete-in-the-usnco">Why compete in the USNCO?</h2>
<p>There are a variety of reasons, both short-term and long-term, that I
think it’s a good idea to compete in the USNCO (and really, any high
school math/science olympiad).</p>
<p>The crass: Qualifying for the Study Camp is a tremendous
accomplishment, and a ticket to most Ivy+ colleges. The ACS also
publishes a runner-up list of the next 50/150 students at the National
level - also strong signals for your college application.</p>
<p>The motivational: If you / your kid is talented and driven by
recognition, then it’ll be inevitable that they will saturate their
school’s ability to recognize and encourage their continued growth. My
personal take is that you are growing at your optimal rate when you are
at the ~75th percentile of your peer group. For the top 10% of students,
this means that you need to find a regional/state/national level of
competition to continue fostering growth.</p>
<p>The environmental: To understand issues on sustainability and climate
change, you need something beyond what AP Chemistry or arguably even a
college General Chemistry course can provide. I see people misunderstand
basic chemical issues all the time, even from people who are otherwise
well-educated. Preparing for the USNCO Nationals puts you at a level
that I consider “good enough” to actually understand chemistry
issues.</p>
<p>The foxy: (“Fox”, as in the idiom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">“a fox
knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing</a>) The chemistry
“rules” you learn at the AP chemistry level are misleadingly simple –
real chemistry is a volatile mix of heuristics and modeling approaches.
You <em>must</em> learn to think from multiple angles, to weigh
competing models, and decide which is the right approach. The AP
Chemistry curriculum does not teach at a rigorous enough level to
achieve this effect. <strong>For parents</strong>: I think this is the
strongest reason to encourage your kid(s) to try the Chemistry olympiad
in particular over the other subjects.</p>
<p>The multitasking: At the national/international level, the lab tasks
involve an impressive level of multitasking. Chemical reactions take
time to finish, and the lab exams are always set so that you must always
be interleaving the preparation of one reaction with the waiting on
another reaction’s completion.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-studying">Strategies for Studying</h2>
<p>To score well on the USNCO (local or national level), you’ll want to
know your material, and additionally, be able to apply it rapidly and
accurately under timed conditions. This implies a level of deliberate
practice that most students shy away from.</p>
<p>Step 1 is to practice the real thing by taking old exams under
realistic timed conditions. The ACS makes past years’ exams available
for free online - you can print out and take these exams with pen and
paper.</p>
<p>Step 2 is to review your results after taking the exam. Consider the
following questions: Did I get lucky? Am I missing a fundamental skill?
Did I have to spend several minutes remembering how to do a certain
calculation? Even if I didn’t know something, were there clever ways I
could have eliminated options and guessed at the final answer?</p>
<p>Step 3 is to fill in your knowledge gaps, and then systematically
practice problems in that area until the calculations are drilled into
your brain.</p>
<p>Finally, take another practice exam to see how you’ve improved -
rinse and repeat!</p>
<p>On the day of the test, the standard advice applies: get a good
night’s sleep, spend all the alloted time, carefully review each
problem, and don’t panic.</p>
<p>I have built my USNCO prep site, <a href="https://www.cartesiantutor.com">Cartesian Tutor</a> with this
approach in mind. Please give it a try: it lets you take practice exams
under timed conditions, to get AI hints and grading on your work, and to
get 1:1 AI tutoring on the difficult concepts appearing in the
USNCO.</p>
<h2 id="timelines-for-studying">Timelines for studying</h2>
<p>Because the USNCO Locals and National exams happen back-to-back in
March and April, there is very little time to study in between the two
exams. On top of that, you may not get your exam results back
immediately, meaning that you may have just a few short weeks in between
learning that you’ve qualified for the National exam and actually taking
the National exam.</p>
<p>The USNCO Local and National multiple choice exams are identical in
format and topic coverage, differing only in difficulty, so it’s a
no-brainer to study for both of these at the same time throughout the
school year. The multiple choice section is the exam to prepare for if
you’re doing the USNCO for the first time.</p>
<p>On a tactical note - the ACS uses the multiple-choice section to
winnow down to 150 students to save the effort of grading everybody’s
free response answers - so for now, it’s actually possible to make the
top 150 list with a blank free response section. (Caveat emptor: the
increasing availability of AI grading may make it feasible to do a rough
first pass on Free Response grading next year, obsoleting this tactic!)
To qualify for the top 50 or top 20, you’ll also have to do well on the
Free Response section.</p>
<p>You’ll want to switch to studying for the Free Response section
relatively early on – perhaps in November or December – while
occasionally continuing to take practice Multiple Choice sections to
keep that muscle memory fresh.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-study">Advanced study</h2>
<p>By the time you’ve done all the past USNCOs, you’re probably in
contention for the top 20 Study Camp invitees. At this point, I would
recommend Clayden’s Organic Chemistry textbook, and working through
IChOs and preparatory problems. The Prep Problems are a set of
longer-form questions, not intended to be taken in test conditions, but
instead as a teaching aid and teaser for the specific problems that will
appear on that year’s IChO. Not all countries are equal; some years’
prep problems and IChOs are drastically easier than others. If in doubt,
Soviet-bloc countries and East Asian countries tend to run on the harder
side, and Russia’s tests are the hardest by far. My friend Anugrah
compiled some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyZQdbKZoldMeD61Rrr7Q3HNwMUTs0XutyiODsY_zZk/edit?tab=t.0">notes
on the relative difficulty levels of past IChOs</a> that you may find
useful. I intend to add some flavor of this difficulty annotation to
Cartesian Tutor</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cartesiantutor.com">Cartesian Tutor</a> is my
implementation of these best practices for studying for the USNCO. It’s
under active development, but features should roll out in time for
anyone preparing for the 2026 USNCOs.</p>
<p>I’ll be building AI features that enable you to get carefully
calibrated hints, interactive lessons on advanced topics, and instant
feedback on your solutions, as well as non-AI features like difficulty
ratings, progress tracking and time management.</p>
