<p>As promised as a followup to my <a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/06/wasm-notes.html">beginner&#39;s notes on WebAssembly</a>, here
are some notes on WebAssembly specifically around C/C++.</p>
<p><strong>Emscripten.</strong> Clang has built-in support for generating Wasm code, but there&#39;s
a lot more to building code than just translating C++ into the appropriate
machine code. <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is the C++ to browser Wasm
toolchain that manages this, giving you an <code>emcc</code> compiler that goes from C
sources to <code>.wasm</code> outputs. For some examples, emscripten provides the linker
and the implementation of <code>malloc</code>, as well as support .js files needed for the
wasm to load, and it even goes as far as generating HTML files too.</p>
<p>The other big thing Emscripten manages is making existing C++ code work, doing
things like shimming C++ calls like <code>puts()</code> into calling JS <code>console.log()</code>.
For another example, when you write C++ GL code it shims that the C++ GL API
onto browser WebGL calls, and similarly for lots of other C++ APIs; see
<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/index.html">their docs section on Porting</a>.
But for how Figma uses C++ we haven&#39;t used much of this, since we&#39;re generally
writing the code from scratch to target browsers.</p>
<p>In all, Emscripten works fine but it&#39;s also pretty clunky. I don&#39;t mean to just
criticize it — as a hobbyist I know that
<a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2013/03/making.html">making things is so very hard</a>
— but rather to remark that there is a surprising amount of surface area in it,
such as
<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html">multiple APIs for interacting with JavaScript</a>
and compiler flags with names like <code>EMULATE_FUNCTION_POINTER_CASTS</code>. There&#39;s a
particular irony in how Emscripten is kind of a JS tool but its
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/preamble.js">JS libraries</a>
are structured as a bunch of globals.</p>
<p><strong>Null pointers are surprising.</strong> In typical C environments dereferencing a null
pointer crashes. In Wasm a null pointer just refers to <code>memory[0]</code> and it is a
legal address to read and write from. C code that reads/writes a null pointer is
something we generally try to avoid already, but in a Wasm environment null
pointers feel a bit like <code>On Error Resume Next</code>.</p>
<p>To this non-expert, I have idly wondered if you could restore the C semantics
around null pointer handling when compiling C to Wasm if you could instead make
null pointers refer to some memory address so high as to trap. For example, I
recall there are some language-lawyering rules around
<a href="http://c-faq.com/null/machnon0.html">whether C&#39;s NULL is actually 0</a>.
Alternatively, I wonder if you could codegen every memory reference to instead
refer to <code>theAddress-0x1000</code>, effectively shifting all memory down at runtime,
which would then cause null pointers to underflow to similarly illegal high
addresses. (I think it might not even cost too much — most of the
<a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html#memory-instructions">Wasm memory instructions</a>
take a constant offset parameter already...)</p>
<p><strong>Safety.</strong> On one hand, null pointers not crashing is pretty bad for running C.
But on the other, it&#39;s interesting to reflect upon how much support C gets from
modern hardware and operating systems. It&#39;s not just guard pages to make null
pointers crash, but also overcommit and W^X pages and ASLR and CFI etc. etc.,
all in some sense to mitigate flaws that are solved by compilers/runtimes
elsewhere. (For example, null handling in basically every non-C language doesn&#39;t
rely on help from the CPU!)</p>
<p>The Wasm environment doesn&#39;t really have that same support, which means
language-level safety can end up more important under Wasm. On the other hand,
Wasm&#39;s Harvard architecture also just excludes by construction a bunch of C&#39;s
problems such as ROP; the more I&#39;ve worked with it, the more it feels like it
would have been the &#34;right&#34; choice. And the consequences of bugs are potentially
lower too, because a buffer overflow doesn&#39;t directly lead to a Wasm sandbox
escape.
<a href="https://www.wingolog.org/archives/2020/10/15/on-binary-security-of-webassembly">Here&#39;s a nice analysis of a recent paper on the balance between these factors</a>
from one of my favorite blogs.</p>
<p>It seems likely to me that we&#39;ll see &#34;escape Wasm sandbox into browser eval&#34;
types of XSS bugs in the future, because that is how security works everywhere:
for whatever Wasm-specific security properties exist, that just means the bugs
will be at the boundaries between Wasm and the host system. Though Wasm-caused
XSS is a much different kind of compromise than attacking the browser itself,
Wasm-based XSS equivalents targeting nodejs easily escalate into arbitrary code
execution (see the above paper).</p>
<p><strong>Memory layout.</strong> Wasm memory is one big flat buffer. To map C to this,
emscripten puts the stack at some fixed offset and has it grow downwards, and
has the heap start at the same point and grow upwards. If you look at a
<a href="https://evmar.github.io/weave/?wasm/figma.wasm">C++ file in weave</a> you can see
the initial stack pointer defined in the &#34;global&#34; section. (The paper linked
from the blog post linked in the previous section goes into this more.)</p>
<p><strong>Virtuals.</strong> In <a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2022/06/wasm-notes.html">the other post</a> I mentioned traps, which are cases
where the Wasm machine stops your program. At Figma we encounter traps in an
interesting way related to virtual calls.</p>
<p>In C++, given some <code>struct Iface { void foo(); }</code>, if you call <code>ptr-&gt;foo()</code> when
<code>ptr</code> is null, nothing goes wrong immediately; it just invokes <code>foo</code> with
<code>this == nullptr</code>. And Dereferences like <code>this-&gt;someMember</code> just read low memory
addresses which are all legal in Wasm.</p>
<p>But if <code>foo</code> is a <em>virtual</em> method, things get more complex; look at
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/xsn6EvTr1">the generated output here</a>. Per the C++
semantics, a virtual call first looks up the vtable by dereferencing the
pointer, and then gets the address of the target function from that table. (You
can see this in the godbolt output by the pair of <code>i32.load</code> instructions.) If
there are any nulls involved here it&#39;s still no problem for Wasm because you
just get a garbage index back. Finally, there&#39;s a Wasm opcode <code>call_indirect</code>
which calls a function selected by a runtime-computed index.</p>
<p>If that index refers to a function outside of your program&#39;s declared function
array it traps. But what if after dereferencing some nulls you happen to
accidentally refer to some existing function? In the above output, note how the
<em>type</em> of the expected target function is included in the <code>call_indirect</code>
instruction.</p>
<p>The reason function types show up in the Wasm semantics is something about the
Wasm soundness properties, where as I understand it, it needs to know what value
types are on the stack at any point. But what it means in this case is that you
have a garbage function index, and if that garbage index refers to a function
with a type different than the one you expect, Wasm will trap.</p>
<p>To summarize this section: null pointers don&#39;t crash in general, but null
pointers to virtuals can, if they happen to accidentally refer to a function
with a different Wasm-level type. What&#39;s gruesome about this is you can have
some code involving null pointers happily scribble all over memory and keep
running and the only way you&#39;ll ever notice is if it eventually traps in a
virtual call.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect buffers.</strong> One interesting pattern we rely on at Figma is called
<a href="https://github.com/evanw/indirectbuffer">IndirectBuffer</a>. The basic idea is you
can allocate an array in JavaScript and still manipulate it from C++ by exposing
calls on it, even though the array&#39;s bytes itself never live in C++ memory. This
ends up important because Wasm memory is limited to ~4gb, but JS memory isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>In particular, Figma documents deal with a lot of images, so we try to keep the
image pixels in JS or GPU memory while still rendering the scene from C++. For
one example of this, one project I worked on at Figma was related to the &#34;save
current document as a file&#34; functionality, which needs to serialize all the
current document&#39;s contents (including image pixels) into one large buffer. The
loaded document itself is already eating most of your Wasm space, so we moved a
lot of serialization output into JS-level buffers, despite all the serialization
code still living in C++.</p>
<p>As a kid I got my programming start in the DOS days and I still remember segment
registers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_pointer">far pointers</a>. The
whole thing gives me fun memories of that time. But this problem is also
possibly fairly specific to Figma, which will happily eat all the RAM you can
give it.</p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s still early.</strong> Work is ongoing to hook DWARF debug info into the browser
devtools. It looks pretty promising, but the tools are still pretty early. It&#39;s
out of scope for this post but Figma has a pretty amazing/bonkers setup where we
can build and debug the app C++ portions using a native toolchain despite the
app being mostly written in HTML, which we keep alive mostly because the native
development experience is still a lot better.</p>
<p>That aside, if you have a C++ call stack that calls into JS and then calls
<code>new Error()</code>, the resulting object has C++ frames on it, and with enough
machinery you even get symbols. I mention debugging mostly to mention that it&#39;s
improving rapidly (it&#39;s pretty neat to single-step in a browser through a C++
stack!) and also to link you to
<a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/11/30/how-to-wasm-dwarf/">another really thorough blog post</a>.</p>
<p>For another example, in the emscripten toolchain the stack of tools used to link
is Wasm/emscripten-specific, which means they&#39;ve not seen the years of
refinement to both run quickly and produce tight code you get on other platforms
(particularly Linux).</p>
<p>One more &#34;it&#39;s early&#34; example, though I guess now that I&#39;m on the subject I
realize this has nothing in particular about C++:
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1761850">we recently hit a code generation bug in Firefox&#39;s Wasm optimizer</a>.
I am still kind of amazed that my coworkers were able to distill a runtime Figma
bug into such a small repro, and further impressed by how the Firefox engineers
were able to write a patch for it 90 minutes after the report(?!).</p>
<p>In all, developing C++ on Wasm feels like what I imagine developing C++ for
something like an embedded system might be like: it&#39;s definitely still C++ but
the tools are a bit weaker and different in random ways from the tools you&#39;re
familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>The fate of C++.</strong> As of this summer it&#39;s been 25 years since I had my first
programming job, writing C++ for a dotcom startup, and here I am today still
writing C++ for a dotcom startup. From that perspective, learning C++ was a wise
investment. But I think many people with similar C++ experience would agree with
me that it&#39;s pretty rare for it to actually be the right tool to use for
software these days.</p>
<p>In particular I think of C++ as an expert tool in a bad sense, where if you make
a mistake it fails maliciously: with either silent memory corruption or silently
bad performance due to accidental copying. Meanwhile, as the
<a href="https://zaplib.com/docs/blog_post_mortem.html">Zaplib post-mortem also found</a>,
it&#39;s not obvious a better performing language actually easily translates into a
performance win, and if not for performance there&#39;s even less reason to be
writing C++.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I see the future of C++ and Wasm to mostly be around
incorporating legacy C++ code, not writing new code. That is mostly just a
statement on how I feel about C++ in general, but Wasm in particular breathes
new life into being able to wedge old C++ code into new contexts. For example,
Mozilla shipped a
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/">pretty amazing hack</a>
that uses Wasm to sandbox C++ code used within Firefox itself: they compile
their C++ to Wasm and then link it back in to the larger C++ app, with a runtime
effect almost like running the C++ submodules within an emulator.</p>
