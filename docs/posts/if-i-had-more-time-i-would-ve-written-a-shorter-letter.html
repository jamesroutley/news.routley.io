    <h1>if i had more time i would&#39;ve written a shorter letter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A sentiment earliest echoed in 1656 by Blaise Pascal (yes, that Pascal) in his 16th letter of <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_Provinciales#LETTER_XVI:_TO_THE_REVEREND_FATHERS,_THE_JESUITS" target="_blank">Lettres provinciales</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#34;I have only made this letter longer because I have not had the time to make it shorter.&#34;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I absolutely adore it. It&#39;s been mirrored in some form many times over:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want me to give you a two-hour presentation, I am ready today. If you want only a five-minute speech, it will take me two weeks to prepare.” – Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;It is my ambition to say in ten sentences what everyone else says in a whole book - what everyone else does not say in a whole book.&#34; – Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The more you say, the less people remember. The fewer the words, the greater the profit&#34; – François Fénelon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll stop there with the quotes to keep it...concise (sorry, I just couldn&#39;t resist).</p>
<p>This blog endeavors towards this very ideal, whether in writing, coding, or speech. Where there is language, there is the pursuit of economy.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a quote I remember reading in the preface of <em>A Moveable Feast</em> by Ernest Hemingway on how the quality of one&#39;s writing can be judged by the excellence of the material eliminated. And I <em>love</em> that idea – that craft as we may, it is in fact the quality of what we choose to cut out that best deems the quality of our work.</p>
<p>The standard to measure by is <em>not</em> the number of lines of code, length of time talked, nor pages written – the Gettysburg Address was only 2 minutes long as 272 words .</p>
