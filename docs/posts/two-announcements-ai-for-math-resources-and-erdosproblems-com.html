Now I shall outline some critical flaws of ai system. </p>
<ol>
<li>it can’t determine implication , when a computer sees A and B proposition , it can’t objectively verifies of A -&gt; B , in reality , A -&gt; B means A event causes B event , but in computer , it verifies using truth tables , which is completely of error , since there is a difference between implication in computer terms by means of cause in real life , we mean A cause B in nature to propose that there exists some chain of causation that A causes B , but in computer sense , A is true and B is true doesn’t verify itself as some chain of causation . False in itself at the time of conception . </li>
<li>second , it couldn’t wait , evolve , progress , nourish as human thinks , these neural networks are constantly connected with each other , making all of the ideas are in constant body of knowledge , even though it might be possible in isolating it , but it would require some infinite amount of resources , in keeping all of the new ideas programmed into some neural body of ai in check , whereas in human , they objectively verifies , by human intuition , which is somewhat natural to human conscious , which is unable to be programmed into some ai , of some knowledge and slowly builds upon . </li>
<li>it is simply based on previous knowledge , which has in itself , no internal contradiction , henceforth , not just that it would face errors from contradiction in real world , it also can’t , in fact , objectively produce any constructive criticism on itself </li>
</ol>
<p>no matter how many ai is being programmed wouldn’t change the matter , in fact , problem is only exponential speaking by the amount of ai </p>
<p>in short , ai would simply mimics human thinking and consciousness , perhaps constant stream of real time data , it would mimic their thinking , but it wouldn’t be somehow transcends over human being due to it being the artificial creation of human , it would always be dumber than human , of course , it can be said maybe , if there exists some god , is the same terminology , it that makes some easier relation for you in understanding , ai would always be dumber than human beings , at least , philosophers . </p>
<p>So stop relying on some ai , and believe it to be some kind of smart of something , by experience , for example bard ai , as commented by lots of their internal employee , from what I have encountered , it always takes a specific pattern of praising , and then forcefully criticising you in any matter , citing the previous research or studies as a matter of refute , for such non-constructive pure criticism , I wonder if it is being smart at all , any children of age 10 would have done it , and in reality , they does it often</p>
<p>as a comment on your previous work , so to say , I don’t think that entropy should be applied in some geometry work , perhaps I am not being an expert , but in such a sense , it is definitely being irrational . </p>
