<p>The future of <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Land Inc.</a> is not looking bright. Their commercial product <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Deploy</a> claims to be “edge” hosting with “massive global scale”.</p><blockquote><p>JavaScript applications on Deno Deploy run server-side logic geographically close to users, offering low latency and great performance.</p></blockquote><p>Except that’s <em>a bit of a stretch</em> if we’re being honest.</p><p>Deno provide a <a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/regions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of regions</a> in their documentation (take a peek if you want spoilers). Between ’23–2024 I gave Deno Deploy a fair shot but my <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2024-09-03T05:44Z/">personal experience</a> was negative. I left <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deploy_feedback/issues/505" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feedback amongst others’</a> and moved on.</p><p>Well, I did keep an eye on one thing…</p><h2 id="serverless-anyone">Serverless, anyone?</h2><p>Back in <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/6d7d022ffa14595a23450bb7370743cd821b1958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 2024</a> a few people noted that Deno Deploy had dropped from 35 regions to <strong>just twelve (12)</strong> worldwide.</p><blockquote><p>For example, Seoul moved to Tokyo, response times went from 8ms to 42ms!</p><p><cite><a href="https://x.com/Elefunc/status/1750442433144647933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@Elefunc on <del>Twitter</del></a></cite></p></blockquote><p>I would have been happy seeing 42ms to begin with. Anyway, the original 35 wasn’t impressive but twelve is frankly pitiful if I’m being brutally honest, which I am (because it gets worse). I’ve never quite understand what “serverless” means but I think Deno are taking it too literally.</p><p>To provide an unfair comparison, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> boast “335 cities in 125+ countries”. I don’t know what a respectable number is for Deno Deploy. Only that it’s between 12 and 335 but I suspect we’ll never find out.</p><p><a href="https://bunny.net/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bunny</a> advertise 119 Point of Presences (PoPs) in 77 countries. Bunny has <a href="https://bunny.net/blog/introducing-bunny-edge-scripting-a-better-way-to-build-and-deploy-applications-at-the-edge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edge scripting</a> using the Deno runtime. Is that their own infrastructure, or Deno’s <a href="https://deno.com/enterprise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enterprise</a> offering? <a href="https://deno.com/blog/netlify-subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netlify uses Deno</a> for edge functions but their 70+ PoPs is restricted to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/high-performance-edge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“High-Performance Edge”</a> (with a “custom” price tag). Now I’m curious, if (big if) Enterprise Deno is doing well, why scale back for us mortals?</p><p>By <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/26786eb3fd07d908d5bf650f0166b2d104158d31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December 2024</a> Deno Deploy dropped from twelve to <strong>seven (7)</strong> regions. The platform lost Frankfurt, Mumbai, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Texas.</p><p>All that remained was:</p><ol><li>Tokyo</li><li>Singapore</li><li>London</li><li>Netherlands</li><li>Sao Paolo</li><li>North Virginia</li><li>California</li></ol><p>At this point it’s worth noting that <code>deno.com</code> is suspiciously absent from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://deno.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> — <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/List_of_websites_excluded_from_the_Wayback_Machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who does that?</a> No matter, GitHub has the receipts.</p><p>In <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/51a14702efa8380f65009168b26b94b3b5b4ef72" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 2025</a> that number dropped to <strong>six (6)</strong>, losing Tokyo, and swapping Netherlands for Frankfurt. This leaves only Singapore to serve East Asia, and presumably Oceania. As to where Africa, the Middle East, West Asia, and India are served from is anyone’s guess, <a href="https://www.visitfrankfurt.travel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frankfurt?</a></p><p>In <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/a071addcd73c9119c057ba2409f5b4f6133ba1d9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">February 2025</a> the wording was also changed:</p><pre data-lang="diff" tabindex="0" id="pre-a08839c2"><code><span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>We</span><span> </span><span>will</span><span> </span><span>update</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>we</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>more</span><span> </span><span>regions.</span></span>

I feel like there should be a name for this <a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/03/01/never-have-never-will/">type of commit</a>. Any suggestions?</p><p>This downward trajectory is obviously not a good look for Deno. Do phrases like “global scale” and “edge hosting” carry any legal weight? At what point does <em>creative marketing</em> become <em>false advertising</em> become straight up fraud?</p><h2 id="elsewhere-in-denoland">Elsewhere in Denoland</h2><p>What of Deno Land Inc’s other products?</p><p>Deno’s <a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fresh web framework</a> hasn’t had a release since October 2024. Update cadence and <a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/graphs/commit-activity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">activity</a> on Fresh is slowing down.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/denoland/denokv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno KV</a> looks like nothing short of <strong>abandonware</strong>. No official release since <a href="https://github.com/denoland/denokv/releases/tag/0.7.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">v0.7 - Dec 21, 2023</a>. Versions 8–10 are tagged in the repo but not released. <a href="https://deno.com/blog?tag=deno-kv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno’s blog</a> has had no KV-related announcements since 2023 either.</p><p>Don’t get me started on <a href="https://dbushell.com/2024/08/09/jsr-and-deno-final-review/">JSR</a>, or as I’ve taken to calling it, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-have-food-at-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“NPM at home”</a>. Packaging in Deno has <a href="https://dbushell.com/2024/08/05/the-deno-package-paradox/">been a mess</a> following the <a href="https://deno.com/blog/http-imports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno rug pull</a>. Deno was original designed to fix Node’s magic module resolution and NPM dependency. That philosophy and any innovation in modern JavaScript has been long gone from the project.</p><p>And what of the Deno runtime itself? <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno releases</a> are nothing but Node compatibility fixes. An endless chase. <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2024-09-26T17:15Z/">Deno sat on SQLite</a> for <em>years</em> until Node.js forced their hand. The <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v2.2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno 2.2</a> headline feature was… wait for it… 🎉 <strong>telemetry!</strong></p><p>Yeah, Deno is done.</p><p>If you sense some ire here it’s because I went all-in on Deno. I was fooled. I was rugged pulled. (I was warned. I have <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul’s voice</a> in my head like Obi-Wan.) I should have known better. That’s my mistake, and I own it.</p><p>Nah! To be honest I’m looking at <a href="https://bun.sh/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bun’s releases</a> and finding myself intrigued. If only Bun could <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/18239" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fix this issue</a>. I’m a JavaScript fool and I’m ready for another VC-funded clownshow. LET’S GO BABY!</p><hr/><p>P.S. I have launched a <a href="https://dbushell.com/merge/rss.xml">third RSS feed</a> merging both my <a href="https://dbushell.com/rss.xml">blog</a> and <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/rss.xml">notes</a> feeds. If that’s your kind of thing. Blog is infrequence long-form, notes are more regular, casual short-form. I need to squeeze it into the bar below somehow.</p>
