<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>

<p>So, you want to reduce your screentime, maybe embrace some digital minimalism, but you don‚Äôt want to go full-on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dumbphones">dumbphone</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, like most people, you need a smartphone to fully engage with society (like with QR menus, the bane of the dumbphone life!).</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can tweak your current iPhone to dumb it down and transform it from a dopamine-driven-slot-machine, into something a bit more tepid. It‚Äôs a great way to temper your screen time without requiring a new (dumb)phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero2.png" alt="An iPhone turned into a dumb phone with a few apps and settings"/> <em>Follow along with this article to dumb-down your iPhone.</em></p>

<p>This article will show you how to dumb down your iPhone, with tweaks like <a href="#minimal-homescreen-launcher">using a minimal homescreen launcher</a>, <a href="#plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">choosing a plain wallpaper that hides your dock</a>, <a href="#grayscale-only-display">enabling grayscale mode</a> and <a href="#disable-notifications">disabling notifications</a>. And of course, the final boss ‚Äî <a href="#bonus-delete-your-apps">deleting your apps</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The tweaks here might make your phone less appealing, but you‚Äôll still have access to social media, emails, the internet, etc. Dumbing down your iPhone is a great way to dip your toes into a more digitally minimal lifestyle, but it‚Äôs not a replacement for a more limited device.</p>

<p>I hope you‚Äôre excited to get started! Let‚Äôs dive in.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-homescreen-launcher">minimal homescreen launcher</h2>

<p>The first thing I recommend is a minimal homescreen launcher ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full-screen widget you place on your homescreen which displays a plain list of selected apps (which you can customize).</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dumbify/id6480082872">Dumbify</a> launcher and it works pretty well. There are a couple of similar launchers, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blank-spaces-app/id1570856853">Blank Spaces</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/on-point-minimal-home-screen/id6476465213">on point</a>, but both have freemium models with expensive ‚Äòpremium‚Äô upgrades. Dumbify costs $4.99 USD upfront, but has no in-app purchases; it‚Äôs what I use and it‚Äôs great.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/homescreen.png" alt="A minimal homescreen for my dumbed-down iPhone"/> <em>The homescreen on my dumbed-down iPhone, using Dumbify.</em></p>

<p>These homescreen launchers all behave the same ‚Äî they show a plain list of app names, rather than colorful app icons, which are (hopefully!) less engaging and less likely to distract you.</p>

<p>The freemium apps can be a good way to play around and see if this is something you want to commit to, if you‚Äôre uncertain. Just be warned that they‚Äôre much more expensive to purchase vs. buying Dumbify once their trials run out.</p>

<h2 id="plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">plain wallpapers (that hide your dock)</h2>

<p>A simple, plain wallpaper is another way to simplify your phone. This was a tough one for me! I love displaying pretty photos on my lockscreen, but I decided to go all-in on dumbing down my iPhone.</p>

<p>Dumbify includes two wallpapers you can use which match the colors of the iOS dock, and I‚Äôve included them below. By matching with the dock, you can remove all your apps from your dock for an extremely spartan homescreen (like in my screenshot above).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Dark</th>
      <th>Light</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/dark_bg.png" alt="dark background for iPhone dumb phone"/></td>
      <td><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/light_bg.png" alt="light background for iPhone dumb phone"/></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Just tap and hold these photos to save them, crop them to fit your phone screen, and set one as your wallpaper.</p>

<p>You should also make sure to disable automatic light/dark mode, since that adjusts the color of the dock. You can do that via <code>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Appearance/Automatic</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip: for a completely bare homescreen, you can also turn off the little ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù badge on your homescreen under <code>Settings &gt; Home Screen &amp; App Library &gt; Search/Show On Home Screen</code></p>

  <p>Note: I‚Äôve also written about <a href="https://dumbph.com/iphone-different-wallpapers-light-dark-mode">using different iPhone wallpapers for light and dark mode</a>, which is the finishing-touch on a great minimal homescreen setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="grayscale-only-display">grayscale-only display</h2>

<p>The first two suggestions in this article were neat, but not <em>that</em> drastic. This one is!</p>

<p>Using an Accessibility setting, you can completely gray-out your iPhone‚Äôs screen, which I‚Äôve found has made a noticeable difference to how engaging it is. Doomscrolling on Instagram or TikTok is much less appealing without all the flashy colors!</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero1.png" alt="my dumbed-down iPhone with a grayscale screen filter"/> <em>My iPhone with the grayscale filter enabled.</em></p>

<p>Under <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessability Shortcuts</code>, you can enable the <code>Color Filters</code> option. By default, this will let you enable grayscale mode by triple-clicking your iPhone‚Äôs power button. It also has the handy benefit of letting you switch back to color mode with another triple-click.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd prefer to set this directly (maybe you use the shortcut already), you can do that in <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Color Filters &gt; Grayscale</code>.</p>

<h2 id="disable-notifications">disable notifications</h2>

<p>I left this one until (nearly) last since I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Disabling (most) of my notifications was one of the best things I ever did ‚Äî it‚Äôs astounding how many nuisance notifications come through on a given day. Social media pings, random promotions, spam emails ‚Äî constant interruptions for irrelevant things. Disabling them was cathartic and a huge relief (not surprising, since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/history-of-notifications/#:~:text=More%20notably%2C%20Rosen%E2%80%99s%20research%20has%20consistently%20shown%20that%20notifications%20stress%20us%20out">notifications stress us out</a>).</p>

<p>I do allow a handful of notifications through ‚Äî phone calls and text messages, as well as my banking apps. Everything else though? üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Apple fortunately makes it straightforward to manage your notifications via <code>Settings &gt; Notifications</code> ‚Äî you can customize your notification preferences per-app, and if you‚Äôre on iOS 15 or later, you can also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/108781#:~:text=your%20notifications%20appear.-,Schedule%20a%20notification%20summary,-With%20iOS%2015">schedule a notification summary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-delete-your-apps">bonus: delete your apps</h2>

<p>The bonus tip, the elephant in the room - your apps. <strong>You can make all the tweaks to your iPhone that you like, adjust this-and-that, but if you keep your addictive apps around, what‚Äôs the point?</strong></p>

<p>Different people find different apps addictive ‚Äî social media is, of course, a huge one, but the internet (ie: your browser app) can be just as addictive, as can YouTube, Slack and more. Sometimes even <a href="https://strava.com">Strava</a> sucks me in!</p>

<p>Whatever apps you‚Äôre addicted to, just seeing their icons on your iPhone (or being able to search for them) can act as a <a href="https://www.weber.edu/academicpeercoaching/blog/forming-habits.html#:~:text=habits%20are%20created%20by%20putting%20together%20a%20cue%2C%20a%20routine%2C%20and%20a%20reward%2C%20and%20then%20cultivating%20a%20craving%20that%20drives%20the%20loop">cue, triggering a little dopamine-driven feedback loop</a> in your brain which sends you spiralling into another doomscrolling session. As effective as little tweaks can be, sometimes the best intervention to break a bad habit is going straight for the cue (the app, in this case).</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a handful of popular techniques you can try out ‚Äî from going cold-turkey and just deleting all your addictive apps, to trying out social-media-free weekends, to using the native <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphb0c7313c9/ios">iOS screen-time feature</a> or more advanced apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opal-screen-time-for-focus/id1497465230">Opal</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jomo-screen-time-blocker/id1609960918">Jomo</a> to regulate your usage of them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôve read this far, all the way to the end, then thank you.</p>

<p><strong>I have a challenge for you:</strong> Implement at least one of the things I‚Äôve covered in this article. Even just doing a little ‚Äúnotification audit‚Äù, where you go through your notification settings and disable them for unnecessary apps, can help you reduce interruptions. Likewise, social-media-free weekends can be a great way to cut back on addictive apps without having to completely give them up.</p>

<p>I think it‚Äôs important to note though ‚Äî dumbing down your iPhone is a <em>far cry</em> from a panacea for smartphone addiction. You can turn your iPhone into a ‚Äòdumphone‚Äô all you like, but unless you also delete some apps, you‚Äôll still have access to all your vices ‚Äî social media, games and more (even if they‚Äôre now grayscale). Even if you‚Äôre brutal and uninstall everything, you still have the app store and browser beckoning.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not to say that these tweaks aren‚Äôt beneficial ‚Äî I think they are; I think they‚Äôre a great set of tweaks to nudge you away from overuse and mindless scrolling ‚Äî but don‚Äôt expect an overnight transformation. For that, you might need to take more drastic measures.</p>
