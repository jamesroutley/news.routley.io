    <h1>Running an open source app: Usage, costs and community donations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I created Spliit a few years ago, but the version you can use today is only one year old. As a user <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit/issues/242">suggested on GitHub</a>, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to release some information about the project as a transparency exercise.</p><h2 id="how-many-people-use-it">How many people use it?</h2><p>In the last 12 months, Spliit received 152k visits, starting from ~200/week, and now regularly 5-6k/week. What is more interesting: the bounce rate is 33%, meaning that most people don‚Äôt just visit the home page; they <em>act</em> on the website, either by switching groups, creating expenses, or reading a blog post.</p><figure><img alt="Spliit&#39;s visitors in the last 12 months (stats by Plausible)" loading="lazy" width="2212" height="1008" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F1033ec0cdf78b62e0ac95134e78540bd%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.58.36.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F1033ec0cdf78b62e0ac95134e78540bd%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.58.36.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Spliit&#39;s visitors in the last 12 months (stats by Plausible)</figcaption></figure><p>Among these 152k visitors, at least 29k used a shared link. Which confirms that the normal use case scenario is for someone to create a group, then share it with the participants. But many visitors also come from Reddit, thanks to the many posts where someone asks for a viable alternative to Splitwise.</p><figure><img alt="Top sources and countries visitors came from in the last 12 months (stats by Plausible)" loading="lazy" width="2220" height="914" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F2786f808d5817352a196fac35ef5a1cb%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-19.03.45.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F2786f808d5817352a196fac35ef5a1cb%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-19.03.45.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Top sources and countries visitors came from in the last 12 months (stats by Plausible)</figcaption></figure><p>When looking where the visitors geographically come from, we can observe that countries where Spliit is the most popular are Germany, United States, and India.

As displayed on the home page, users created almost 15k groups at the time I‚Äôm writing this post, and a total of 162k expenses.</p><p>Since last January (I didn‚Äôt use to track it before), about 300 groups are created each week, and 2000 expenses.</p><figure><img alt="Number of group created in 2024, by week (stats by Plausible)" loading="lazy" width="2168" height="778" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F850141583a29c85d150da06bdecc3ac9%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-17.37.22.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F850141583a29c85d150da06bdecc3ac9%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-17.37.22.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Number of group created in 2024, by week (stats by Plausible)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Number of expenses created in 2024, by week (stats by Plausible)" loading="lazy" width="2168" height="778" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F22a7b5533b3cf312747eb0e42cc8054c%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-17.37.09.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2F22a7b5533b3cf312747eb0e42cc8054c%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-17.37.09.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Number of expenses created in 2024, by week (stats by Plausible)</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the repartition of groups by number of expenses.

I started many side projects in the past, and for most of them, I didn‚Äôt have to spend any cent. But when a project starts having hundreds of users, it‚Äôs hard to avoid some costs.</p><p>As you can see in the chart below, Spliit costs me about $115 each month, most of them being for the database hosting. <em>(Note: the amounts in this post are all in US dollars.)</em></p><figure><img alt="Spliit&#39;s costs in 2024 (in USD)" loading="lazy" width="1314" height="1074" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fb1d0eaf85e63a305d0035d497853319d%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.19.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fb1d0eaf85e63a305d0035d497853319d%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fb1d0eaf85e63a305d0035d497853319d%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Spliit&#39;s costs in 2024 (in USD)</figcaption></figure><p>The database is hosted on Vercel, and the price is calculated from the total time the database is read in the month (the writings cost almost nothing). As Spliit is used worldwide, it is used almost the full month‚Ä¶</p><p>It is the source of cost I‚Äôd really like to work on. There must be database providers that charge less for Spliit‚Äôs use case. If you have any good opportunity to tell me about, feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://scastiel.dev/contact">contact me</a> üòâ.</p><h2 id="how-much-does-spliit-earn">How much does Spliit earn?</h2><p>Since the beginning, Spliit‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù is clear to me: it is <a target="_blank" href="https://spliit.app/blog/we-need-an-open-source-alternative-to-splitwise">an open source project</a>, that will stay free to use forever. There might be some premium features in the future, but they will be only for advanced use cases, never to limit the normal usage of the application.</p><p>This makes it hard to find a way to finance the app, which is why currently the only way Spliit makes money is via donations, either by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/scastiel">GitHub sponsoring</a>, or with direct donations (via a <a target="_blank" href="https://donate.stripe.com/28o3eh96G7hH8k89Ba">Stripe link</a>).</p><figure><img alt="Spliit&#39;s donations in 2024 (in USD)" loading="lazy" width="1314" height="1020" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fd88429adfb5125b83ff1b7193f435a40%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.29.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fd88429adfb5125b83ff1b7193f435a40%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.29.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://spliit.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbasehub.earth%2F2277c7b3%2Fd88429adfb5125b83ff1b7193f435a40%2Fscreenshot-2024-10-13-at-18.36.29.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><figcaption>Spliit&#39;s donations in 2024 (in USD)</figcaption></figure><p>And I‚Äôll be honest: I didn‚Äôt expect to receive that much money for Spliit! On the first month, someone donated $70! Since then, some people donate $5, others $20‚Ä¶ I am amazed at people‚Äôs generosity.</p><p>A short disclaimer: I don‚Äôt <em>need</em> donations to make Spliit work. I am lucky enough to have a full-time job that pays me enough to live comfortably and I am happy to give some of the money I earn to the community. (Side note: as a developer, Spliit is also a pretty cool project to show in interview when I look for a job üòâ)</p><p>I added the ability to donate for two reasons:</p><ol><li><p>Several users like the project so much they <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit/issues/40">asked for a way to give back</a>.</p></li><li><p>If I decide someday to leave the project, I would love if the community could keep it alive without financial issues.</p></li></ol><p>You can see that the donations aren‚Äôt enough yet to cover all the project costs, but it‚Äôs close! üòä</p><h2 id="how-much-time-do-i-spend-working-on-spliit">How much time do I spend working on Spliit?</h2><p>Not as much as I would like! Something like 5 to 10 hours a month.
