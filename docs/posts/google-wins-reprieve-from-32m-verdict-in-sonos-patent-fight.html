Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision on Monday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The case is part of a sprawling intellectual property dispute between the former collaborators that includes other lawsuits in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Sonos also <a data-testid="Link" href="http://psykomal.com/markets/europe/sonos-wins-google-import-ban-ruling-us-patent-fight-2022-01-07/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">won</a> a limited import ban on some Google devices from the U.S. International Trade Commission last year based on different Sonos patents, which Google has appealed. Google has countered with its own patent lawsuits in California and at the ITC.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The companies previously worked together to integrate Mountain View, California-based Google&#39;s streaming music service into Sonos products. Sonos first sued Google in 2020, accusing the tech giant of copying its technology in wireless audio devices including Google Home and Chromecast Audio.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Sonos <a data-testid="Link" href="http://psykomal.com/legal/us-jury-says-google-owes-sonos-325-million-smart-speaker-patent-case-2023-05-26/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">won</a> $32.5 million in damages from Google in San Francisco in May after a federal jury found that Google&#39;s devices infringed one of the company&#39;s patents. Google asked Alsup to toss the verdict on several grounds, including that Sonos strategically held off on applying for the patents for more than a decade until the tech giant had introduced its allegedly infringing devices.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Alsup agreed with Google on Friday that Sonos had connected its 2019 patent applications to an application from 2006 to receive artificially early priority dates. Google began selling its competing devices in 2015, and the judge said Google&#39;s products &#34;anticipated&#34; the 2019 patents and made them invalid.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The case is Sonos Inc v.
