<h2>Where to Start: The 4 Pillars of Wine</h2>



<p>In simple terms, wine is derived from the fermentation of grapes. These aren’t your average grapes you’ll find in the grocery store either. Wine grapes are much sweeter, smaller, have different a skin texture, and contain seeds. </p>



<p>1. Where the grapes are grown (region)</p>




<p>Essentially, these 4 factors make up the difference between the fancy wines served at fine-dining restaurants… and the cheap wines you’ll find at your gas station.</p>



<p><strong><em>Are you a server or bartender?</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="wine-history">A Little History…</h2>



<p>Wine is the oldest alcoholic beverage ever produced. Dating back as far as 8,000 B.C., partakers of wine believed that drinking alcohol was a religious experience. Christians, Jews, and even the ancient Greeks associate wine consumption with spirituality. Dionysos was the Greek god of wine, and Jesus drank wine with his disciples during his Last Supper.</p>



<hr/>



<h2 id="wine-grape-types">Types of Wine Grapes</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of different types of grapes used in creating wine, most of them being variants of <em>red</em> and <em>white </em>(hence red and white wine).</p>



<p>If you want to broaden your wine knowledge and expertise, the first thing you should do is learn about the key differences in red and white grapes… whether it be their taste or the level of tannins contained within them. </p>



<h4>Red Grapes</h4>



<p>Red grapes are the most common form of grapes used in wine. The skins of these grapes don’t get removed during fermentation. Because of this, wine derived from red grapes is often drier in taste than white wine due to the tannins within their grape skins. Both red and white grapes provide great health benefits, but red grapes offer a bit more. Very dark red grapes (some even call them black grapes) are also used in red wines.</p>



<p><strong><em>Fun Fact</em>:</strong> Few people truly understand what <em>tannins</em> are. <strong>Tannins</strong> are naturally occurring compounds that come from the skins of grapes. They affect the taste of wine, with higher tannin levels creating a dry taste.</p>



<h4>White Grapes</h4>



<p>Before white grapes (which are really yellow-green in color) are fermented, their skins are removed. The removal of their skins prevent the tannins in the grape from affecting the wine. Leaving out the tannins creates wine of a lighter color. White wines are often sweeter than their red counterparts, and because of this are often used in cooking.</p>

<h2 id="wine-regions"><strong>The Top 10 Wine Regions</strong> in the World</h2>



<p>While wine is produced all over the world, this guide will only focus on the countries that make up the majority of wine production. The countries below are worlds leading wine producers:</p>



<ol><li>Italy</li><li>France</li><li>Spain</li><li>United States</li><li>Argentina</li><li>Australia</li><li>Germany</li><li>South Africa</li><li>Chile</li><li>Portugal</li></ol>



<p>Italy, France, and Spain have been the biggest producers of wine for centuries. Collectively, these three countries still produce close to half of all the wine in the world. The United States, however, is not too far behind.</p>



<p>Now you might have heard someone talk about the “character” of a particular wine. The <em>terroir </em>of a region is what makes up the wine’s character. <em>Terroir</em> is the culmination of the factors that can affect wine production, such as the type of soil used, climate conditions, and farming techniques.</p>



<h3>#1: Italy</h3>



<p>Italy is the largest producer of wine in the world, though the crown often switches between them and France. While vineyard production has been down over the last several decades due to Italians lessening desire to drink wine, there are still over a million vineyards currently cultivated in the country. Twenty different regions in the country produce wine in Italy, each with slightly different climates all leading to slightly different tastes.</p>



<h3>#2 France</h3>



<p>France is the second largest producer of wine in the world, and they too are cutting back on their vineyard production. Like the Italians, the French people drink less wine than in years past. Instead, they seem to be putting their money towards more expensive wines. There are many regions in France that produce wine, however these regions are less concise than in Italy. For the most part, the northern regions focus on white wine production and the southern parts focus on red wine. France’s wide range of climates have allowed for quite the diversity in wines produced.</p>



<h3>#3 Spain</h3>



<p>While Spain doesn’t produce as much wine as the neighboring countries of Italy and France, the Spanish do surpass them in another category. Spain has almost three million acres dedicated to vineyards – the most in the world. However, the regions yield fewer grapes than Italy and France, leading to overall less wine production. While most regions in Spain produce red wines, the northwest regions produce most of their white wines.</p>



<h3>#4 The United States of America</h3>



<p>Most of the wine produced in America comes from only a few states. California leads the charge, producing 84%. While there are vineyards all over the country, the west coast of the United States is where most of it is produced.</p>

<h2 id="making-wine-from-grapes"><strong>How To Make Wine From Grapes</strong></h2>



<p>Below is the wine production process, starting with grapes and ending up with bottled wine.</p>



<h4>Step 1: Harvesting Grapes</h4>



<p>Picking the grapes used in wine production is no easy task, and is normally done in two different ways…</p>



<ul><li><strong>Machine Harvesting</strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Manual Harvesting</strong></li></ul>



<h4>Step 2: <strong>Fermenting Grapes</strong></h4>



<p>Once the grapes are collected, the fermentation process begins….</p>



<p>Red wines need to ferment at much higher temperatures, usually between 80–90o F. White wines, on the other hand, ferment much cooler – around 50o F.</p>



<h4>Step 3: Storage</h4>



<p>From here, wine goes into a barrel, bottle, or even a storage tank. What happens next is something the French call “élevage.” This word describes what you’ll be having to do next – “wait around.”</p>



<p>This waiting around period can last for weeks or even years, depending on the producers preferences. There is some debate amongst the wine community about how long to wait, but studies have shown that after about five years the taste doesn’t change much.</p>



<hr/>



<h2 id="wine-types">The Different Types of Wine</h2>
