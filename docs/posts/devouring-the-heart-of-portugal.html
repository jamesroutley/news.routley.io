					<p>On the morning of Thursday, 04 December 1924, a tall and well-dressed Dutch trader named Karel Marang strolled along Great Winchester Street in the City of London, among the bustling crowds of bankers and brokers of the business district, unaware that the parcel he carried held the power to upend an entire nation. The nation in peril was not his home in the Netherlands, nor was it the Brits’ among whom he walked. Rather, it was a country some 700 miles to the south: Portugal.</p>
<p>When Marang reached his destination⁠⁠—an unassuming, four-story, yellow brick office building⁠⁠—he opened the door. Inside, an expansive ground-floor office space was filled with rows of desks, workers on telephones, and the soft buzz of white-collar commerce. Marang had come to meet Sir William Alfred Waterlow, Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire. Sir William was also the joint managing director of this place of business: Waterlow &amp; Sons Limited, engravers of fine currency, postage stamps, and other official documents. A gentleman seated at a small receptionist desk directed Marang to the staircase.</p>
<p>Marang ascended to find a spacious office occupied by Sir William⁠⁠—a towering specimen of British upper crust. Marang produced a bundle of documents: it included his calling card; a letter of introduction from an esteemed Dutch engraving firm; a diplomatic letter certifying that its carrier had power of attorney over the current dealings; and a wax-bound, notarized contract festooned with international consular stamps.</p>
<p>The contract was basic and boring⁠⁠—it authorized Waterlow &amp; Sons to print a run of banknotes for the Bank of Portugal, something the firm had done before. Of course Sir William was happy to do additional business with his Portuguese clients. Later, however, he would learn that in sitting down with this innocuous-looking Dutch trader, he was entangling himself and his firm in a heist of history-making proportions.

<p>The architect of this history-making heist was sitting in a private office 1,000 miles away in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. He was a bankrupt yet ambitious Portuguese businessman named Artur Virgílio Alves Reis. He was born in Lisbon in 1896, raised in borderline poverty due to his father’s poor investments. After graduating from secondary school, young Alves Reis attempted a course in engineering, but dropped out after just one year. In 1916, shortly after Portugal joined the Allies in the Great War, 20-year-old Alves Reis and his new wife Maria fled to the Portuguese colony of Angola on the west coast of Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Angola was not a very comfortable place to raise a family; it was a beautiful land of tropical beaches, sparkling rivers, and Sub-Saharan desert, but the African territory was impoverished due to plunder and neglect by faraway overlords. The Portuguese had used the land as a slave colony as early as the 1500s, but when Alves Reis arrived in 1916, human trafficking was gradually being replaced by exports of coffee, cotton, and tobacco. </p>
<p>Young Alves Reis was handsome, creative, and ambitious⁠⁠—and he could charm the spines off an Angolan girdled lizard. When he learned that Angola needed qualified engineers to help build its new agricultural infrastructure, he used a friend’s college degree as a template to forge a bachelor’s degree in his own name. Printed on fine bond paper, it stated that he had graduated from Oxford University’s Polytechnic School of Engineering, listing specialties in a huge range of disciplines, including geology, physics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and mathematics. He adorned it with official-looking seals and forged signatures. He then carried the fabrication to the very pinnacle of legitimacy-lending institutions: The local notary. This particular notary was not as rigorous as some, and Alves Reis seemed like an upstanding gentleman. So the public official helpfully stamped and signed the document, thereby certifying its authenticity⁠⁠—nevermind that Oxford University had no “Polytechnic School of Engineering”.</p>
<p>With these manufactured credentials and his superhuman charm, Alves Reis soon secured a high ranking position in the Angolan capital Luanda, overseeing plans for buildings and sewers for the Department of Public Works. This desk job proved rather tedious, so he used his <i>mala fides</i> to secure an additional part-time job as a supervising engineer at a railroad repair shop. He quickly earned the respect of his fellow railroad workers⁠⁠—unlike other supervisors, who kept their distance from the greasy and sooty railroad engines, he was willing to get his hands dirty in the railyard, climbing around to help diagnose mechanical problems. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated a surprising proficiency for troubleshooting the hulking machines.</p>

<p>Alves Reis also came to be known for his grandiose demonstrations. On one occasion, he butted heads with railway inspectors after he ordered some modern steam engines from the U.S. These exceeded the safe weight capacity of Angolan railway bridges, the inspectors warned. Lacking any actual data to support his rebuttal, Alves Reis challenged the inspectors’ assertion, and he invited the public to observe as he boarded one of these American engines with his wife and newborn son for a journey across Angola. Luckily for him, none of the bridges collapsed on this journey, and neither did his reputation. In fact, he was soon promoted to Acting Chief Engineer. On another occasion, when a friend’s tobacco crop was failing due to drought, Alves Reis identified a nearby river that could be used as a water source, the only obstacle being a substantial hill between the two sites. Alves Reis somehow persuaded around 50 locals to take up their picks and shovels to help dig an irrigation canal straight through the hill. The water saved the crop, and Alves Reis was again hailed a hero.</p>
<p>Alves Reis was a professional success, but he found that public service and railroad work didn’t pay as well as he had hoped. So he quit his legitimate jobs to embark on a series of grift-oriented business ventures. He put out advertisements for bags made of jute, a strong fiber popular among Angolans, but the bags he delivered were just made of thick paper. He repaired and repainted some old German tractors and sold them as brand new. He purchased entire harvests from farms throughout Angola, then asked his old friends in the rail business to prioritize his shipments over his competitors’. These ethically diverse enterprises proved much more profitable than honest work. By 1922, after the war was over, he was ready to return to the comforts of Portugal with his wife, two young sons, and a small fortune. The unit of currency in Portugal and Angola at the time was the <i>escudo</i>, and Alves Reis had amassed more than 600,000 escudos (worth roughly $500,000 adjusted for US dollars in 2022). In preparation for his return to Lisbon, he moved his funds to Portuguese banks. This retreat was timely⁠⁠—within the year Portugal declared the Angolan escudo to be a separate currency managed by a separate central bank. Severed from the stability of the Bank of Portugal, Angola sunk into further economic despair as its castaway currency went into hyperinflation.</p>
