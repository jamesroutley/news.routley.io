    <p>Lately I‚Äôve been spending quite a bit of time learning Rust, and as any sane person would do, after writing a few 100 lines programs I‚Äôve decided to take on something <em>a little bit</em> more ambitious: I have written a Java Virtual Machine in Rust. üéâ With a lot of originality, I have called it <code>rjvm</code>. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I want to stress that this is a toy JVM, built for learning purposes and not a serious implementation. In particular, it does not support:</p>
<ul>
<li>generics</li>
<li>threads</li>
<li>reflection</li>
<li>annotations</li>
<li>I/O</li>
<li>just in time compiler</li>
<li>string interning</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are quite a few non-trivial things implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>control flow statements (<code>if, for, ...</code>)</li>
<li>primitive and object creations</li>
<li>virtual and static method invocation</li>
<li>exceptions</li>
<li>garbage collection</li>
<li>class resolution from a <code>jar</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following is part of the test suite:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>StackTracePrinting</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span>String<span>[]</span> args<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        Throwable ex <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Exception<span>();</span>
        StackTraceElement<span>[]</span> stackTrace <span>=</span> ex<span>.</span><span>getStackTrace</span><span>();</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>(</span>StackTraceElement element <span>:</span> stackTrace<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            tempPrint<span>(</span>
                    element<span>.</span><span>getClassName</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&#34;::&#34;</span> <span>+</span> element<span>.</span><span>getMethodName</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&#34; - &#34;</span> <span>+</span>
                            element<span>.</span><span>getFileName</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&#34;:&#34;</span> <span>+</span> element<span>.</span><span>getLineNumber</span><span>());</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// We use this in place of System.out.println because we don&#39;t have real I/O
</span><span></span>    <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>native</span> <span>void</span> <span>tempPrint</span><span>(</span>String value<span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It uses the real <code>rt.jar</code> containing the classes from the <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk7/">OpenJDK 7</a> - thus, in the example above, the <code>java.lang.StackTraceElement</code> class comes from a real JDK!</p>
<p>I am very happy with what I have learned, about Rust and about how to implement a virtual machine. In particular, I am <em>super</em> happy about having implemented a real, working, garbage collector. It‚Äôs quite mediocre, but it‚Äôs mine and I love it. üíò Given that I have achieved what I set out to do originally, I have decided to stop the project here. I know there are bugs, but I do not plan to fix them.</p>

<p>In this post, I will give you an overview of how my JVM works. In further articles, I will go into more detail about some of the aspects discussed here.</p>
<h2 id="code-organization">

</h2>
<p>The code is a standard Rust project. I have split it into three crates (i.e. packages):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>reader</code>, which is able to read <code>.class</code> files and contains various types that model their content;</li>
<li><code>vm</code>, which contains the virtual machine that can execute the code as a library;</li>
<li><code>vm_cli</code>, which contains a very simple command-line launcher to run the VM, in the spirit of the <code>java</code> executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm considering extracting the <code>reader</code> crate in a separate repository and publishing it on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, since it could actually be useful to someone else.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-a-class-file">
  Parsing a <code>.class</code> file
  <a href="#parsing-a-class-file">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>As you know, Java is a compiled language - the <code>javac</code> compiler takes your <code>.java</code> source files and produces various <code>.class</code> files, generally distributed in a <code>.jar</code> file - which is just a <code>zip</code>. Thus, the first thing to do to execute some Java code is to load a <code>.class</code> file, containing the bytecode generated by the compiler. A class file contains various things:</p>
<ul>
<li>metadata about the class, such as its name or the source file name</li>
<li>the superclass name</li>
<li>the implemented interfaces</li>
<li>the fields, along with their types and annotations</li>
<li>and the methods with:
<ul>
<li>their descriptor, which is a string representing the type of each parameter and the method‚Äôs return type</li>
<li>metadata such as the <code>throws</code> clause, annotation, generics information</li>
<li>and the bytecode, along with some extra metadata such as the exception handler table and the line numbers table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, for <code>rjvm</code> I have created a separate crate, named <code>reader</code>, which can parse a class file and return a <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/reader/src/class_file.rs">Rust struct</a> that models a class and all its content.</p>
<h2 id="executing-methods">
  Executing methods
  <a href="#executing-methods">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The main API of the <code>vm</code> crate is <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/vm.rs#L164"><code>Vm::invoke</code></a>, which is used to execute a method. It takes a <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/call_stack.rs"><code>CallStack</code></a>, which will contain the various <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/call_frame.rs#L58"><code>CallFrame</code></a>, one for each method being executed. For executing <code>main</code>, the call stack will initially be empty, and a new frame will be created to run it. Then, each function invocation will add a new frame to the call stack. When a method‚Äôs execution completes, its corresponding frame will be dropped and removed from the call stack.</p>
<p>Most methods will be implemented in Java, and thus their bytecode will be executed. However, <code>rjvm</code> also supports <em>native</em> methods, i.e. methods that are implemented directly by the JVM and not in the Java bytecode. There are quite a few of them in the ‚Äúlower parts‚Äù of the Java API, where interaction with the operating system (for example, to do I/O) or the support runtime is necessary. Some examples of the latter you might have seen include <code>System::currentTimeMillis</code>, <code>System::arraycopy</code>, or <code>Throwable::fillInStackTrace</code>. In <code>rjvm</code>, these are implemented by <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/native_methods_impl.rs">Rust functions</a>.</p>
<p>The JVM is a <a href="https://andreabergia.com/blog/2015/03/stack-based-virtual-machines-1/">stack-based virtual machine</a>, i.e. the bytecode instructions operate mainly on a value stack. There is also a set of local variables, identified by an index, that can be used to store values and pass arguments to methods. These are associated with each call frame in <code>rjvm</code>.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-values-and-objects">
  Modeling values and objects
  <a href="#modeling-values-and-objects">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The type <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/value.rs"><code>Value</code></a> models a possible value of a local variable, stack element, or object‚Äôs field, and is implemented as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// Models a generic value that can be stored in a local variable or on the stack.
</span><span></span><span>#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, PartialEq)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Value</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    <span>/// An unitialized element. Should never be on the stack,
</span><span></span>    <span>/// but it is the default state for local variables.
</span><span></span>    <span>#[default]</span>
    Uninitialized,

    <span>/// Models all the 32-or-lower-bits types in the jvm: `boolean`,
</span><span></span>    <span>/// `byte`, `char`, `short`, and `int`.
</span><span></span>    Int(<span>i32</span>),

    <span>/// Models a `long` value.
</span><span></span>    Long(<span>i64</span>),

    <span>/// Models a `float` value.
</span><span></span>    Float(<span>f32</span>),

    <span>/// Models a `double` value.
</span><span></span>    Double(<span>f64</span>),

    <span>/// Models an object value
</span><span></span>    Object(AbstractObject<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>),

    <span>/// Models a null object
</span><span></span>    Null,
}
</code></pre></div><p>As an aside, this is one place where a sum type, such as Rust‚Äôs <code>enum</code>, is a wonderful abstraction - it is great for expressing the fact that a value might be of multiple different types.</p>
<p>For storing objects and their values, I initially used a simple struct called <code>Object</code> containing a reference to the class (to model the object‚Äôs type) and a <code>Vec&lt;Value&gt;</code> for storing fields&#39; values. However, when I implemented the garbage collector, I modified this to use a lower-level implementation, with a ton of pointers and casts - quite C style! In the current implementation, an <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/abstract_object.rs"><code>AbstractObject</code></a> (which models a ‚Äúreal‚Äù object, or an array) is simply a pointer to an array of bytes, which contain a couple of header words and then the fields&#39; values.</p>
<h2 id="executing-instructions">
  Executing instructions
  <a href="#executing-instructions">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Executing a method means executing its bytecode instructions, one at a time. The JVM has a wide list of instructions (over two hundred!), encoded by one byte in the bytecode. Many instructions are followed by arguments, and some have a variable length. This is modeled in the code by the type <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/reader/src/instruction.rs"><code>Instruction</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// Represents a Java bytecode instruction.
</span><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>Instruction</span> {
    Aaload,
    Aastore,
    Aconst_null,
    Aload(<span>u8</span>),
    <span>// ...
</span></code></pre></div><p>The execution of a method will keep, as mentioned above, a stack and an array of local variables, referred by the instructions via their index. It will also initialize the program counter to zero - that is, the address of the next instruction to execute. The instruction will be processed and the program counter updated - generally advanced by one, but various jump instructions can move it to a different location. These are used to implement all flow control statements, such as <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, or <code>while</code>.</p>
<p>A special family of instruction is made of those that can invoke another method. There are various ways of resolving <em>which</em> method should be invoked: virtual or static lookup are the main ones, but there are others. After resolving the correct instruction, <code>rjvm</code> will add a new frame to the call stack and start the method‚Äôs execution. The method‚Äôs return value will be pushed to the stack unless it is <code>void</code>, and execution will resume.</p>
<p>The Java bytecode format is quite interesting and I plan to dedicate a post to the various kind of instructions.</p>
<h2 id="exceptions">
  Exceptions
  <a href="#exceptions">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Exceptions are quite a complex beast to implement since they break the normal control flow, and might return early from a method (and propagate on the call stack!). I am pretty happy with the way I have implemented them, though, and I am going to show you some of the relevant code.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that any <code>catch</code> block corresponds to an entry of a method‚Äôs exception table - each entry contains the range of covered program counters, the address for the first instruction in the catch block, and the exception‚Äôs class name which the block catches.</p>
<p>Next, the signature of <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/call_frame.rs#L349"><code>CallFrame::execute_instruction</code></a> is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>execute_instruction</span>(
    <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self,
    vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Vm<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    call_stack: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> CallStack<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    instruction: <span>Instruction</span>,
) -&gt; Result<span>&lt;</span>InstructionCompleted<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>, MethodCallFailed<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Where the types are:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// Possible execution result of an instruction
</span><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>InstructionCompleted</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    <span>/// Indicates that the instruction executed was one of the return family. The caller
</span><span></span>    <span>/// should stop the method execution and return the value.
</span><span></span>    ReturnFromMethod(Option<span>&lt;</span>Value<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>),

    <span>/// Indicates that the instruction was not a return, and thus the execution should
</span><span></span>    <span>/// resume from the instruction at the program counter.
</span><span></span>    ContinueMethodExecution,
}

<span>/// Models the fact that a method execution has failed
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>MethodCallFailed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    InternalError(VmError),
    ExceptionThrown(JavaException<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>),
}
</code></pre></div><p>and the standard Rust <code>Result</code> type is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>T, E<span>&gt;</span> {
   Ok(T),
   Err(E),
}
</code></pre></div><p>Thus, executing an instruction can result in four possible states:</p>
<ul>
<li>the instruction was executed successfully, and the execution of the current method can continue (the standard case);</li>
<li>the instruction was executed successfully, and it was a return instruction, thus the current method should return with (optionally) a return value;</li>
<li>the instruction could not be executed, because some internal VM error happened;</li>
<li>or the instruction could not be executed, because a standard Java exception was thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code that <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/call_frame.rs#L298">executes a method</a> is thus as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// Executes the whole method

        <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self,
        vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Vm<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>,
        call_stack: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> CallStack<span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    ) -&gt; <span>MethodCallResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&#39;a</span><span>&gt;</span> {

</code></pre></div><p>I know that there are quite a few implementation details in this code, but I hope it gives an idea of how using Rust‚Äôs <code>Result</code> and pattern matching maps really well to the description of the behavior above. I have to say I am rather proud of this code. üòä</p>
<h2 id="garbage-collection">
  Garbage collection
  <a href="#garbage-collection">
    <i aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The final milestone in <code>rjvm</code> has been the implementation of the garbage collector. The algorithm I have chosen is a stop-the-world (which trivially follows from not having threads!) semispace copying collector. I have <a href="https://github.com/andreabergia/rjvm/blob/main/vm/src/gc.rs">implemented</a> a (poorer) variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheney%27s_algorithm">Cheney‚Äôs algorithm</a> - but I really should go and implement the real thing‚Ä¶ üòÖ</p>
<p>The idea is to split the available memory into two parts, called semispaces: one will be active and used to allocate objects, and the other will be unused. When full, a garbage collection will be triggered and all alive objects will be copied to the other semispace. Then, all references to objects will be updated, so that they point to the new copies. Finally, the role of the two will be swapped - similar to how <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment">blue-green</a> deployment works.</p>
<p><img src="https://boinkor.net/images/2023/07/gc1.png" alt=""/>

<img src="https://boinkor.net/images/2023/07/gc4.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This algorithm has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>obviously, it wastes a lot of memory (half of the possible max memory!);</li>
<li>allocations are super fast (bumping a pointer);</li>
<li>copying and compacting objects means that it does not have to deal with memory fragmentation;</li>
<li>compacting objects can improve performances, due to better cache line utilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real Java VMs use far more sophisticated algorithms, generally <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-jvm-memory-model-memory-management-in-java">generational garbage collectors</a>, such as G1 or the parallel GC, which use evolutions of the copying strategy.</p>

<p>In writing <code>rjvm</code>, I learned <strong>a lot</strong> and I had a lot of fun. Can‚Äôt ask for more from a side project‚Ä¶ but maybe next time I will pick something <em>a bit</em> less ambitious to learn a new programming language! ü§≠</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to say that I had a lot of fun with Rust. I think it is a great language, <a href="https://andreabergia.com/blog/2022/11/languages-opinion-part-two-rust/">as I have written before</a>, and I have really enjoyed using it for implementing my JVM!</p>
<p>If you are interested in further details on how <code>rjvm</code> is implemented (and on how the JVM actually works), stay tuned for the upcoming posts!</p>
