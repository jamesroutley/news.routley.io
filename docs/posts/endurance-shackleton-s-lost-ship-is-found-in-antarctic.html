    <h1>Endurance: Shackleton&#39;s lost ship is found in Antarctic</h1>

We have achieved what many people said was impossible.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>FMHT and National Geographic</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Agulhas had favourable ice conditions in what was still a hostile environment</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Where-was-the-ship-found"><span role="text">Where was the ship found?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Endurance was spotted in the Weddell Sea at a depth of 3,008m. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For over two weeks, the subs had combed a predefined search area, investigating various interesting targets, before finally uncovering the wreck site on Saturday - the 100th anniversary of Shackleton&#39;s funeral. The days since the discovery have been spent making a detailed photographic record of the timbers and surrounding debris field. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The wreck itself is a designated monument under the international Antarctic Treaty and must not be disturbed in any way. No physical artefacts have therefore been brought to the surface.</p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Mensun Bound: &#34;She&#39;s sitting upright&#34; on the seafloor</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="What-could-the-subs-see"><span role="text">What could the subs see?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The ship looks much the same as when photographed for the last time by Shackleton&#39;s filmmaker, Frank Hurley, in 1915. The masts are down, the rigging is in a tangle, but the hull is broadly coherent. Some damage is evident at the bow, presumably where the descending ship hit the seabed. The anchors are present. The subs even spied some boots and crockery.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You can even see the ship&#39;s name - E N D U R A N C E - arced across its stern directly below the taffrail (a hand rail near the stern). And beneath, as bold as brass, is Polaris, the five-pointed star, after which the ship was originally named,&#34; said Mensun Bound.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I tell you, you would have to be made of stone not to feel a bit squishy at the sight of that star and the name above,&#34; he added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You can see a porthole that is Shackleton&#39;s cabin. At that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back of your neck.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>FMHT/National Geographic</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Filter feeders have colonised the wreck but there are no wood-eating worms</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="What-life-had-attached-to-the-ship"><span role="text">What life had attached to the ship?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Interestingly, the wreck has been colonised by an abundance of life - but not of the type that would consume it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It would appear that there is little wood deterioration, inferring that the wood-munching animals found in other areas of our ocean are, perhaps unsurprisingly, not in the forest-free Antarctic region,&#34; commented deep-sea polar biologist Dr Michelle Taylor from Essex University.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The Endurance, looking like a ghost ship, is sprinkled with an impressive diversity of deep-sea marine life - stalked sea squirts, anemones, sponges of various forms, brittlestars, and crinoids (related to urchins and sea stars), all filter feeding nutrition from the cool deep waters of the Weddell Sea.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>SPRI/Uni of Cambridge</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Shackleton (L) looks over the broken remains of his ship just before it went to the deep</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Why-was-this-ship-so-prized"><span role="text">Why was this ship so prized?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Two reasons. The first is the story of Shackleton&#39;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It set out to make the first land crossing of Antarctica, but had to abandon the quest when the expedition ship, the Endurance, was trapped and then holed by sea-ice. From then on it was all about survival. Shackleton somehow managed to get his men to safety, an escape that saw the Anglo-Irish explorer himself take a small lifeboat across ferocious seas to get help. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The other reason was the challenge itself of finding the ship. The Weddell Sea is pretty much permanently covered in thick sea-ice, the same sea-ice that ruptured the hull of Endurance. Getting near the presumed sinking location is hard enough, never mind being able to conduct a search. But herein also lies part of the success of the FMHT project. This past month has seen the lowest extent of Antarctic sea-ice ever recorded during the satellite era, which stretches back to the 1970s. The conditions were unexpectedly favourable. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>FMHT/National Geographic</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>One of the submersibles returns to the surface after another dive to the Weddell Sea floor</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Historian Dan Snow describes the excitement when the Endurance was found</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Agulhas wrapped up the survey of the wreck and departed the search site on Tuesday. The icebreaker is heading for its home port of Cape Town. But the intention is to call into the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia where Shackleton is buried. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We will pay our respects to &#39;The Boss&#39;,&#34; said Dr Shears, using the nickname the Endurance crew had for their leader.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Boss is buried at Grytviken Whaling Station on South Georgia</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>As the stern of Endurance looked in dry dock in 1914 before departure to Antarctica</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i>All wreck imagery is courtesy of the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust and National Geographic</i></p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
