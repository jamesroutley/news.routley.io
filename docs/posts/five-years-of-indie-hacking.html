Therefore, I wanted to take time to share the three biggest things I&#39;ve learned so far, as well as reflect on my progress.</p><h2 id="lessons-learned"><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h2><h3 id="passion-is-a-double-edged-sword"><strong>Passion is a Double-Edged Sword</strong></h3><p>My original foray into indie hacking was the result of my passion project, <a href="https://fantasycongress.com">Fantasy Congress</a>. Without my strong love for this idea, I would have never taken the jump to pursue entrepreneurship.</p><p>Alas, in many ways, I feel my passion for this project also prevented it from being more successful.</p><p>Passion is an <em>internal</em> experience. But building a successful business relies heavily on <em>external</em> stimuli, like customer feedback. If you&#39;re consumed by passion, you will inoculate yourself to the feedback and needs of the outside world.</p><p>Like a mad scientist, I was committed to <em>my vision</em> for Fantasy Congress in the beginning. I had a one track mind, and this prevented me from course correcting or honestly reflecting on my circumstances.</p><p>I spent a whole year building the wrong product. Eventually I realized if I wanted to see this idea succeed, my vision and desires had to be set aside.</p><p>This changed some things. Most of all my motivation. I lost some of my gusto for the project, and eventually burned out.</p><p>This isn&#39;t to say passion is bad. On the contrary, you need <em>some</em> amount of passion or delusion to motivate you to start a business. It&#39;s fucking hard! <em>Especially</em> without funding or co-founders.</p><p>But passion alone won&#39;t sustain you.</p><p>Moreover, intense passion is probably more of a hindrance than an asset.</p><p>In my opinion, the indie projects most likely to succeed are the ones where founders <em>aren&#39;t</em> wildly passionate about the product or its subject matter (aka, &#34;boring businesses&#34;). It helps them maintain objectivity and flexibility as their problem, product, and market evolve.</p><h3 id="you-cant-get-away-from-people"><strong>You Can&#39;t Get Away From People</strong></h3><p>Many are drawn to bootstrapping as a way to &#34;maximize&#34; their freedom. In my particular case, I was looking to free myself from others.</p><p>After a few years working in the corporate world, I longed for hyper-independence.</p><p>The illusion of meritocracy had faded. I realized water-cooler politics had a bigger effect on my day-to-day tasks and overall career than I expected. There was so much more to work than<em> just doing the work</em>. And I hated it.</p><p>I thought the fix would be working by myself, for myself. And this is where my interest in bootstrapping came from.</p><p>Using my skills, if I had enough time and money to support myself, couldn&#39;t I just build a successful product all on my own? I imagined solitary days happily chipping away at features and bugs, free from the pressure and politics of corporate culture.</p><p>But I soon realized that building a business harbors its own form of social pressures. In many ways, you become <em>more</em> involved with people when you work for yourself.</p><p>Much of this comes in the form of relationships. Relationships with customers, vendors, contractors, industry influencers, competitors, and if you&#39;re lucky, eventually employees.</p><p>Starting out, I thought bootstrapping meant freedom from the messy complications of building and maintaining relationships. Turns out, it&#39;s just the opposite.</p><p>One of the biggest struggles I faced on my journey was &#34;you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know.&#34; That is to say, you might <em>know</em> you&#39;re missing a piece to the puzzle, but you <em>don&#39;t know</em> what that piece looks like yet.</p><p>As a true beginner, I didn&#39;t know where or how to gather information on building a business. I had Google, but I didn&#39;t know what to search, or which information was trustworthy.</p><p>There&#39;s an iconic scene from HBO&#39;s Silicon Valley where the main character is trying to learn how to write a business plan, and the camera pans to him staring blankly at the Wikipedia page for &#34;Business Plan.&#34; I snickered at that scene initially. Then, I lived it. ðŸ’€</p><p>The turning point occurred when I stumbled upon some Twitter users who were also trying to build self-funded businesses (or &#34;bootstrapping&#34; as they called it).</p><p>Following these people introduced me to relevant podcasts, influential books, and a host of other credible creators to follow. Finally, I started to learn the lingo and concepts of business building. But most importantly, I learned <em>why</em> many of my initial choices were mistakes.</p><p>Surrounding myself with people doing the thing I wanted to do, helped me learn even when I wasn&#39;t trying.</p><p>Just listening to someone&#39;s story or general banter about their project, might expose me to a new marketing tactic, or a better on-boarding strategy, or a tool to help speed up my development workflow. It also gave me a wider breadth of experience to draw on when I faced new problems.</p><p>For a long time, I thought the benefits of &#34;community&#34; were purely social. The past five years taught me that a community is actually a valuable learning resource. Sometimes, your peers are the best teachers.</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it"><strong>Was it worth it?</strong></h2><p>Though I&#39;ve spent five years working on my own businesses, they still don&#39;t make a substantial income.</p><p>With the launch of my second business last July (a programmatic SEO tool called <a href="https://pagefactory.app">PageFactory</a>), I <em>finally</em> started generating enough consistent revenue to pay myself a meager salary. After five long years, I now make $1k/month. </p><p>And this realization is...disappointing.</p><p>My brain knows that starting a business is not a linear journey. That 99% percent of people are not overnight successes. And that most people take many years, and many failed ventures, to eventually build a sustainable, profitable business.</p><p>But my heart is...a little crushed. Five years is a long time! I gave up a lot in my life to keep pursuing the indie hacker dream, and so far the monetary results <em>have not</em> been worth it! ðŸ˜†</p><p>And yet, am I ready to give up?</p><p>No.</p><p>There&#39;s definitely a lot of things I wish I&#39;d done differently. For instance, I wouldn&#39;t encourage anyone to quit their job until they&#39;ve made at least <em>one dollar</em> selling a product or service online. Alas, hindsight is 20/20 right?</p><p>More than anything though, I&#39;m so thankful I had the courage, and privilege, to take a swing at this.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll stay on this path forever, but I can&#39;t imagine doing anything else. Maybe I&#39;m not where I <em>thought </em>I&#39;d be in five years, but Iâ€™m content with where I landed.</p>
