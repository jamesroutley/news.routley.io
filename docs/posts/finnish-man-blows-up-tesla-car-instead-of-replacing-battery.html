Well, not really, but <!-- -->Finnish man Tuomas Katainen sure did.<!-- --> <!-- -->Katainen is<!-- --> a 2013 Tesla Model S owner who was told he would have to pay more than $22,600 to replace the battery on his car.

He sent his car to a Tesla dealer’s repair shop, where it remained for about a month, and was told they couldn’t do anything for his car. His only option would be to replace the entire battery, which would cost more than $22,600, and he would have to ask Tesla permission to carry out the repair.</p><p>To put this in perspective, $22,600 would go a long way to buying another used 2013 Model S in Finland, which appear to sell for <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.ooyyo.com/finland/used-tesla-for-sale/c=CDA31D7114D3854F111B806FBA8C3544CDB81D5016/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.ooyyo.com/finland/used-tesla-for-sale/c=CDA31D7114D3854F111B806FBA8C3544CDB81D5016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than $42,900</a></span>. But Katainen decides that’s not for him, proving that there is indeed a thin line between logic, rage, and insanity.</p><p>“So I told them I’m coming to pick up the Tesla,” he said in the video. “Now I’m going to explode the whole car away.”<!-- --> </p><p>To carry out his master plan, Katainen enlisted the help of YouTuber <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/Pommij%C3%A4tk%C3%A4t/about&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Pommij%C3%A4tk%C3%A4t/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pommijätkät</a></span>, which roughly translates to “Bomb Dudes,” according to Google Translate. (Whether that’s an accurate translation or not, it seems appropriate considering Pommijätkät likes to make things explode).<!-- --> </p><div><div data-inset-url="https://lifehacker.com/make-anywhere-feel-like-home-this-holiday-season-with-e-1848122410" data-inset-category="CommerceInsetMobile"><p>G/O Media may get a commission</p></div></div><p>While blowing up a car with dynamite may sound fun, it’s not an easy task. Katainen and Pommijätkät set up the operation in a quarry at Jaala, a small rural town in Southern Finland. The group had to consider factors like the explosive’<!-- -->s huge pressure wave and the direction the blast would go in order to ensure safety.</p><p>In the fascinating video, which features a dummy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk that’s dropped from a helicopter and ends with the very big explosion of Katainen’s Model S, Pommijätkät asks Katainen what is better: a working <!-- -->Tesla or exploding the car with 66 pounds of dynamite?</p><p>“Sort of both,” he said. “Maybe more explosion.”</p></div></div>
