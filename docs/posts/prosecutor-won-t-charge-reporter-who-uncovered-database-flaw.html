        <div><p>ST. LOUIS â€” A Missouri prosecutor will not charge a St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist who exposed a state database flaw that allowed public access to thousands of teachers&#39; Social Security numbers.</p><p>Cole County Prosecutor Locke Thompson released a statement Friday saying there is an argument to be made that there was a violation of law, and that the issues at the heart of the investigation have been resolved through non-legal means, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch <u><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/prosecutor-declines-to-charge-post-dispatch-reporter-targeted-by-gov-parson/article_6a615894-d6e2-5fdf-980d-9e00ccd00a95.html*tracking-source=most-popular-homepage__;Iw!!FJkDyvWmnr4!P8oIeQfoBVMOy2qQ2y-d1DZPq7QWkJEHHGZZ8FAUgIJS49btYNOu7YVJs9oD2Q$">reported</a>.</u></p><p>&#34;As such, it is not in the best interest of Cole County citizens to utilize the significant resources and taxpayer dollars that would be necessary to pursue misdemeanor criminal charges in this case,&#34; Thompson said.</p><p>Republican Gov. Mike Parson announced the investigation in October after a Post-Dispatch reporter informed the state of <u><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/apnews.com/article/technology-education-hacking-missouri-newspapers-6f730cb3ac61ad4cf120e7702a789d6b__;!!FJkDyvWmnr4!P8oIeQfoBVMOy2qQ2y-d1DZPq7QWkJEHHGZZ8FAUgIJS49btYNOu7YX_xJQNlg$">a significant data issue</a></u> that left the teachers&#39; data vulnerable to public disclosure. The newspaper held off publishing a story about the flaw until the state fixed it.</p><p>&#34;We are pleased the prosecutor recognized there was no legitimate basis for any charges against the St. Louis Post-Dispatch or our reporter,&#34; Post-Dispatch Publisher Ian Caso said in a statement. &#34;While an investigation of how the state allowed this information to be accessible was appropriate, the accusations against our reporter were unfounded and made to deflect embarrassment for the state&#39;s failures and for political purposes.&#34;</p><p>The Post-Dispatch obtained records through an open records request showing that the state education commissioner initially planned to thank the newspaper for finding the problem. But the state instead issued a news release calling the <u><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/apnews.com/article/technology-journalists-missouri-newspapers-65b8c46cd0a74a56a5097c4591d864de__;!!FJkDyvWmnr4!P8oIeQfoBVMOy2qQ2y-d1DZPq7QWkJEHHGZZ8FAUgIJS49btYNOu7YVdl6R1uA$">reporter a &#34;hacker.&#34;</a></u></p><p>Parson issued a statement saying Thompson&#39;s office believed the decision &#34;was properly addressed.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The state did its part by investigating and presenting its findings to the Cole County prosecutor, who has elected not to press charges, as is his prerogative,&#34; spokeswoman Kelli Jones said.</p></div>
