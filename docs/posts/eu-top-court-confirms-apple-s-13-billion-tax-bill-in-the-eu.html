    <h1>EU top court confirms Apple&#39;s €13 billion tax bill in the EU</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Tuesday that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/google/t-17454571">Google</a> had violated antitrust laws and that <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/apple/t-17365431">Apple</a> needed to pay the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/european-union-eu/t-17440066">European Union</a> €13 billion ($14.3 billion) in back taxes. Both cases are seen as an effort by Brussels to close tax loopholes exploited by the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-imposes-stricter-rules-on-gatekeeper-tech-giants/a-66733910">US tech giants</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid, which Ireland is required to recover,&#34; ECJ judges said, referring to the company&#39;s deal with Dublin over taxes.</p>

<p>The case against Google dates back to 2017, when the EU accused Google of prioritizing its own Google Shopping links in searches. The bloc has argued this violates <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-strikes-deal-to-tame-internet-giants-google-facebook/a-61567575">its antitrust regulations</a>.</p>

<p>Google was fined €2.4 billion, but had appealed to the ECJ, which has now upheld the fine.</p>

<p>&#34;In the light of the characteristics of the market and the specific circumstances of the case, Google&#39;s conduct was discriminatory and did not fall within the scope of competition on the merits,&#34; judges said.</p>

<p>In a response, Google said that they had already made changes back in 2017 to comply with EU regulations.</p>

<h2>Apple&#39;s long bitter feud with the EU</h2>

<p>Europe&#39;s case against Apple began in 2016, over allegations it received a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/apple-ireland-tax-avoidance/a-54274213">sweetheart tax deal with authorities in Ireland</a>, the location of the company&#39;s European headquarters.</p>

<p>The EU has long demanded that Apple pay back billions of taxes for two Irish subsidies that the company argues are primarily taxable in the United States. Arguing that they were being subjected to double taxation, and that the situation did not preclude state aid from Dublin, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/apple-ireland-tax-eu/a-54182473">Apple initially won a ruling against the European Commission</a> to annul the payment order.</p>

<p>The Commission first appealed that decision in 2020, prompting four more years of legal wrangling before today&#39;s ECJ verdict in their favor.</p>

<p>Both the judgments against Google and Apple are final and cannot be overturned.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Big Tech struggling from China to Silicon Valley"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Big Tech struggling from China to Silicon Valley</h2><video id="video-64148288" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="64148288" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/61689017_605.webp" data-duration="20:06"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2022/beng221216_bb_bigtech_s__01s_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"/><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2022/beng221216_bb_bigtech_s__01s_AVC_512x288.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/68770727" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH" default=""/><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>
