    <p>The cocktail <em>piña colada</em> is first seen in English as a loanword from Spanish in 1920. The modern piña colada is actually more recent than that, created in Puerto Rico in 1954. Before that, it referred to a traditional mixed drink with pineapple and rum, only occasionally including coconut.</p>

<p>Literally translated, <em>piña colada</em> means “strained pineapple”. <em>Piña</em> descends from Classical Latin pīnea, meaning “pine”. As in English, the word was co-opted to describe pineapples after their introduction to the Old World in the 1500s. <em>Colada</em> descends from Classical Latin cōlāre, meaning “sifted”.</p>

<p>While popular enough to be declared Puerto Rico’s official drink in 1978, the cocktail remained relatively unknown. Its lucky break was when British-American singer-songwriter Rupert Holmes wrote the song Escape in 1979. Shortly before its release, Holmes had second thoughts about its refrain, “If you like <a href="http://approximateknowledge.net/etym/2025/08/23/bogart.html">Humphrey Bogart</a> and getting caught in the rain”, and replaced the actor’s name with an tropical cocktail that still fit the rhythm. The modified song was a smash hit and propelled the cocktail to ubiquity. Piña coladas were added to the IBA’s official cocktail recipes in 1987.</p>
