<p dir="auto">It feels sometimes like programmers and normal people speak a totally different language and use computers in totally different ways. Something that you can discuss with more-or-less any competent programmer or sysadmin is completely foreign to people outside of our world.
Here are a handful of examples I&#39;ve come across.</p>

I just want to install a program&#34;</h2>
<p dir="auto">I come across this oftentimes when I&#39;m trying to get someone to use a fancy program that solves their problem exactly.
I tell them to execute the simple and easy step of running <code>$PACKAGE_MANAGER install $PROGRAM</code>, and they don&#39;t want to do it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;It&#39;s easy!&#34;</em> I say.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;All you need to do is open the terminal... oh yeah, you probably need to know how to do that... Anyway, once it&#39;s open all you need to do us run... Oh yeah, well you need to install the package manager&#34;</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;Well after you install the package manager, you just need to... oh yeah, They just updated it, and you need to change your path to...&#34;</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;Alright. Just go to https://$SOFTWARE, and then you can install it from there&#34;</em></p>

<p dir="auto">I love markdown and write more-or-less all of my written word in it.
It&#39;s great.
You can easily add links and tables, headings, and put in whatever you want with a few HTML tags if you&#39;re feeling saucy.
Not only that, but you can render it out into pretty much any way people are used to viewing documents using something like <a href="https://pandoc.org" rel="nofollow">Pandoc</a>.
The problem comes when I wish to share the document.
Non-technical people I know don&#39;t know what to do with some <code>notes.md</code> file once they get it.
Their OS just gives them a &#34;How do I open this&#34; dialogue that lists off some unrelated programs.
If I give them a compiled document, they just send me back their edits of the compiled document, so I now have to open up word or adobe or whatever and copy/paste it back into my original markdown file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;But Alas&#34;</em> you say, <em>&#34;All they need to do is edit it in any text editor&#34;</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I send them a link to <a href="https://markdownguide.org" rel="nofollow">Markdown Guide</a> and tell them to edit it in Microsoft Word, and I receive the same three questions every time.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;Why do you want me to learn a programming language?&#34;</em>, <em>&#34;Is Microsoft Word what you mean by a text editor&#34;</em>, and <em>&#34;Why couldn&#39;t you just do this in something simple like Word?&#34;</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I try and try to explain that this arcane system of monochrome text and rendering steps is <strong>ACTUALLY</strong> easier than editing in Microsoft Word, but my pleas fall on deaf ears.</p>

It&#39;s way easier using $Program&#34;</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are a bunch of little things that come up that I will mention off-hand, and have someone question me about it.
I explain how simple it is to just <code>convert -density 300 input.pdf -resize 50% output.png</code>, and I&#39;m met with a blank stare</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;But I&#39;m not a hacker&#34;</em>, they plead.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>&#34;This should be a simple program&#34;</em></p>
<p dir="auto">And of course it <strong>is</strong> a simple program, but whenever the first step is opeing a terminal, it is no longer simple</p>

<p dir="auto">I don&#39;t know.
Sometimes I&#39;m frustrated by these things and I become disappointed that I cannot come up with a way to convince people that the world works the way I think it does.
Other times, I think the solution lies in our hands.
Maybe with enough programming and user-interface design, we can make the tools that make our lives easier good enough to be used by the general public and make our ways known.
Sometimes I think that the public computing education should be completely overhauled to support workflows like mine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe I just need to have a little more empathy (or is it sympathy?) for normal people.</p>
