<p>I&#39;ve stumbled across a technique for drawing holograms directly upon a
plastic plate by hand.
It sounds impossible, but I&#39;ve been sitting on the
livingroom sofa making holographic images of floating polyhedra, words, 3D
starfields, opaque objects, etc.  No laser, no isolation table, no
darkroom, no expensive film plates.  This takes nothing more than a
compass and some scraps of plexiglas.  Too cool, if I say so myself! 
<br/></p>

<p>
There&#39;s an interesting story behind this technique, but first, the instructions. 
<br/></p>




<p>
Obtain a small piece of acrylic plastic and a good, non-wobbly set of
&#34;dividers&#34; (a compass with two points.)  I used a $10 compass from an art
supply store and replaced the pencil lead with the supplied metal point. 
The compass must be the type with an adjusting screw to set the spacing of
the points.  Or, you can use a 4-in. piece of wood with a couple of
finishing nails driven through it to form a pair of points.  For the 
plastic, a CDROM &#39;jewel case&#39; works fine.
<br/></p>

<p>
Next, use a marker to draw a simple pattern such as the letter &#34;V&#34; near
the lower edge of the plate.  This will be the image that we&#39;ll encode
onto the surface.  Draw your &#34;V&#34; less than 1 in. tall (2cm).  Set the 
spacing of the compass points to a couple of inches.  Place one point on 
the tip
of the small &#34;V&#34; at the bottom of the plate, and *gently* drag the other
point lightly across the plastic so you make an arc-shaped scratch that
looks something like the figure below.
This is your first scratch.  It helps to tilt the compass so the point
trails across the surface and does not dig in or chatter.  The scratch
should be easily visible, but not extremely deep.  The scratch should be 
dark and

polished, not white and dusty.  It should 
show a small highlight when viewed in sunlight or under a pointsource
illuminator such as a small, clear light bulb. Now, while keeping the
dividers at exactly the same spacing, place the point at a different place
on the little &#34;V&#34; and use the other point to make a single circular
scratch as before.  Do this again and again, ten times or more, each time
placing the point on a different

spot on the little &#34;V&#34;.  
When completed,
the overlapping arc-shaped scratches should look like you&#39;ve swept a bit
of sandpaper across the top of the plastic plate.  The little letter &#34;V&#34;
should be full of holes made by the other point of the compass.</p>

<p>
To view the resulting hologram image, observe the scratches in sunlight. 
If your plate is transparent it helps to place something black behind it,
or to paint the rear surface dark for contrast.  While holding the plate
chest-high with the little &#34;V&#34; towards your body, rotate yourself around
so you face the sun, tilt the plate up and down, and look at the
scratches.  At a certain angle you will see a moving highlight in the
scratches.  It will look like a collection of little stars, a mini-
constellation in the shape of the letter &#34;V&#34;.  That&#39;s the hologram.  If
you go back and add more and more scratches in between the ones you
already made, eventually your letter &#34;V&#34; hologram will look like solid
white lines rather than rows of stars.
<br/></p>

<p>
When viewed with both eyes open, the &#34;V&#34; seems to float deep within the
plastic.  Its virtual depth is determined by the compass: if the spacing
of the points was set to 1 in., the image appears 1 in. below the plastic
surface.  You can also hold the plate upside down, with the scratches at
the edge of the plate towards your body, and the holographic image will
float in space above the plate.
