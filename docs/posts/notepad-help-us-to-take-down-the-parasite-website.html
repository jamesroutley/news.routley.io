<p>I’ve received numerous complaints via email, social media, and forums regarding a website that poses a significant threat to our community. The site in question is <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> which appears prominently when users google for “download Notepad++”.</p>

<p><img src="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/assets/images/downloadNppGoogling.png"/></p>

<p>Some users have mistakenly believed that <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> is the official Notepad++ website. This confusion has led to frustration and potential security risks.</p>

<p>Despite declaring itself an “<em>unofficial fan website created for general information/educational purposes only</em>”, this site harbors a hidden agenda. It is riddled with malicious advertisements on every page. These advertisements aim to deceive unsuspecting Notepad++ users into clicking on them, generating profits for the site owners.</p>

<p>The true purpose of <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> becomes evident when we recognize that it seeks to divert traffic away from the legitimate Notepad++ website, notepad-plus-plus.org. By doing so, it compromises user safety and undermines the integrity of our community.</p>
