    <h1>An Unreasonable Amount of Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A method for magic.</p><div>
<p>Years ago, Teller performed a magic trick.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>First, he’d have you pick a card. He would attempt to produce the card, but fail, indicating the card may have travelled elsewhere. He’d then lead you on a short walk to a nearby park, and then be inspired to dig a hole. Buried there, beneath undisturbed grass, was a box. When opened, the box would, somehow, contain the card you’d chosen. An impossible trick.</p>

<p>To create this magical moment, he had to do something you wouldn’t expect: he’d gone out into the park and buried a number of boxes, corresponding to potential cards one might choose. Then, he waited months – until the grass had grown over. Only then could he perform the trick.</p>

<p>Deducing what card you’ve picked is a well-known sleight. But performing a trick where your card is seamlessly buried requires so much advance preparation that it seems impossible.</p>

<p>Teller describes the underlying principle <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6641527-sometimes-magic-is-just-someone-spending-more-time-on-something">like so</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>This is true of tricks, and also of crafts.</p>

<p>The pianist whose fingers seem supernaturally nimble, the presenter whose message seems viscerally compelling, and the artist whose paintings seem impossibly realistic all wield the same magic: they’ve invested more time than you’d expect.</p>

<p>It can be difficult, psychologically, to commit yourself to spend an extreme amount of time and attention towards a goal, no matter how worthwhile. Doing impossible things feels, well, impossible.</p>

<p>That’s why, generally, the approach is to start small, then increment. <a href="https://allenpike.com/2023/do-something-so-we-can-change-it">Do something, so you can change it.</a> Get your reps in. Evolve your complex system from a simple one that works.</p>

<p>Eventually, years in, this will culminate in overnight success. You’ll have achieved something that seems magical – impossible, even.</p>

<p>It just takes some time.</p>
