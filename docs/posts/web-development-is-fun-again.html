    <h1>Web development is fun again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>I remember when PHP 4 was a thing. jQuery was new and shiny. Sites were built with tables, not divs. Dreamweaver felt like a life hack. Designs were sliced in Photoshop. Databases lived in phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>It probably didn’t feel like it at the time, but looking back, those were simpler days. The entire <em>concept</em> of the development cycle could fit in my head. There was complexity in building web applications, but it was all <em>manageable</em>. If you had an idea, you could probably build it.</p>
<p>As a solo developer, you could manage <em>everything</em>. From idea to execution. Or at least, it <em>felt</em> that way.</p>
<p>I’m probably romanticizing the past, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Today, it’s hard to do web development <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>On the frontend, you have build pipelines, bundlers, CSS frameworks with their own toolchains, progressive web apps, Core Web Vitals, SEO, layout shifts, srcset/responsive images… I remember when the biggest challenge was IE6 compatibility.</p>
<p>On the backend, there are design patterns, unit tests, code coverage, APIs, performance concerns, dependency management, infrastructure, monitoring, log tracing, observability…</p>
<p>Each area of expertise has grown up - probably for the better - but it also demands deeper <em>domain knowledge</em>. I chose to specialize in backend and server infrastructure. I had to step back from frontend work because I couldn’t keep up with its tooling <em>while</em> developing my backend skills.</p>
<p>As a solo developer, it’s now <em>a lot</em> harder to manage <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>They’re far from perfect, but <code>claude</code> and <code>codex</code> gave me the leverage I desperately needed. They’ve brought me back to levels of productivity I haven’t felt in years. I feel like I can manage the entire stack again - with confidence.</p>
<p>I can go from idea to execution in days.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the complexity of each domain matters a lot less.</p>

<p>Oh no, you’re vibe coding - bet it’s all slop and code noise!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past two decades, I’ve worked with <em>a lot</em> of talented people: backend developers, frontend developers, marketers, leaders, and more. I can lean on those experiences, fall back on how <em>they</em> did things, and implement <em>their methods</em> with AI.</p>
<p>I can reliably reproduce <em>their</em> coding standards, tone of voice, tactics, and processes. Starting a new project once felt insurmountable. Now, it feels realistic again.</p>
<p>When AI generates code, I know when it’s good and when it’s not. I’ve seen the good and the bad, and I can iterate from there. Even with refinement and back-and-forth prompting, I’m easily 10x more productive with AI than without it.</p>
<p>The goal hasn’t changed: build quality software that meets modern standards. The goalpost is still far out. But now I have a rocket-powered soccer ball - and I can finally reach it again.</p>
<h2 id="room-for-creativity">Room for creativity<a href="#room-for-creativity" aria-label="Link to this section">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There’s mental space for creativity in building software again.</p>
<p>My head isn’t constantly full of build pipelines, testability concerns, code patterns, unfixed bugs… I’m confident I can cover that with help from AI. It still needs to be done, but it’s done so much faster - and it no longer feels overwhelming.</p>
<p>That leaves room to experiment with UI and UX, to try ideas and throw them away. To add small quality-of-life improvements I couldn’t justify before, because there was always something more urgent.</p>
<p>It’s also not the <em>typing</em> of code that I really enjoy, nor is it the syntax or structure or boilerplate that’s required to build anything. It’s the fact you get to build <em>something</em> out of <em>nothing</em>, writing code was just how you got there. And with today’s tooling, that saves <em>a ton</em> of time.</p>
<p>AI really has made web development fun again.</p>
