    <h1>Toll signs on 101 report your transponder setting</h1>
    
    
<p>
Here's a little bit of Silicon Valley local flavor for a change.  We 
have this freeway that runs from San Jose to San Francisco called US 
101, or around here, just "101".  (Southern California has it too, but 
they call it "the" 101.  That's how we detect invaders.)  Anyway, this 
thing is usually eight or more lanes up and down the peninsula, and it's 
had a "diamond" or car pool lane on the #1 (innermost/"fast") lane for 
many years.  You had to have a certain number of people in the car (or 
some other conditions met) during certain hours (AM and PM rush, 
weekdays), or you'd be in for a hefty ticket.
</p><p>
This started changing recently, and now parts of the corridor have 
turned it into a toll lane all day on weekdays.  This is a deal where 
you can drive in the lane and pay for the privilege if you're by 
yourself, pay a discounted fee if you have one other person with you, 
or it's free if at least two other people are riding along (plus a 
bunch of other variations I won't get into here - motorcycles, clean 
air vehicles, you name it).
</p><p>
How does the system know what to charge you?  Well, you either have an 
old-style toll transponder that always bills you as a solo driver, or 
you have a new-style transponder with a 1/2/3+ switch that tells the 
road how to handle you.
</p><p>
Yes, the billing is entirely a function of whether you have that thing 
in your car, and how you configured it for that particular driving 
session.  You could totally lie to it and set it to "2" for a discount 
or "3+" for the complete freebie ride.  But, then you have to worry 
about getting caught and getting a ticket.
</p><p>
Think about what this does to enforcement.  Now, instead of just "is 
there a vehicle in the lane", "is it the right time during a weekday", 
and "how many people are in the car", now it's also a matter of "do they 
have their transponder set properly".
</p><p>
How do you suppose they're going to tell what position you had that 
thing set to when your car rolled under the reader?  The answer turns 
out to be relatively simple: they put a sign over each lane, and it just 
flashes up a "2" or a "3" depending on what it heard from your 
transponder's response.

This is a scene from Mountain View where a car just passed underneath a 
reader and the "2" lit up a second or two later.  If there's nobody else 
in that car,

could roll up on them and give them a ticket.
