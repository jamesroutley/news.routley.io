    <h1>Folk (Browser) Interfaces</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
For the past couple of years I&#39;ve found myself returning to vanilla Javascript
to build a variety of media interfaces. Ignoring the networked potential of the
internet, I&#39;ve felt liberated to simply point at local files and enjoy the
multi-media power of the browser as rendering engine.
</p>


<div>
    
    <p><i>Interfaces for deep compositing and T-SNE&#39;d faces</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
In this modality, one composes interfaces through browsers primitives—images,
video, and text—interacted with primarily through event handlers. If one can
consider this programming, it&#39;s primarily because one is still writing code.
However, it deviates from traditional notions of programming: abstraction,
composition, security, extensibility, or performance. The goal is not to
produce a system that runs forever as has historically been the aim of
software for the government and, subsequently, large tech behemoths.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it re-centers programming around designing powerful media
interactions. This kind of interface design is intimately connected to the
materiality of media and, consequently, banks on domain knowledge in, e.g.,
computer graphics.  It&#39;s akin to building a one-off Photoshop or Blender
interface, built on robust web APIs (canvas, audio, WebGL) and libraries
(Three, p5, tf.js). Exceptionally, these libraries are focused a giving you
handles into media, rather than supporting an industrial mode of production.
The tradition in question can be drawn back through tools for artists such as
Processing, Blender, Max/MSP, Quartz Composer, and TouchDesigner.

    </p>
</div>
 
<p>
I think of these as <i>folk interfaces</i>, akin to the jigs one makes
in wood-working. Divorced from grandiose ambitions of building comprehensive
systems, it leads the programmer to directly engage with data.  I hope this mode can
paint the picture of software, not as a teleological instrument careening
towards automation and ease, but as a medium for intimacy with the matter of
our time (images, audio, video), yielding a sense of agency with what, to most,
feels like an indelible substrate.
</p>

<h3>
Seeing what&#39;s happening
</h3>

<p>
This realization began with me making small visualizers for a variety of ML
projects, before I had any theses on tool-making. The browser was a natural
platform: thousands of lifetimes spent inside the techno-empires have made it
very robust for media display. I also had prior experience with web development.
</p>

<p>
One system in question was a 
<a href="https://runwayml.com/green-screen/">human-in-the-loop rotoscoping tool</a>.
Central to the design was legibility of the outputs to the user so that they
could then be refined by hand. My goal was to gain intimacy with the
inputs and outputs that the systems I was designing expected and produced, an
intimacy that&#39;s impossible to reach without swimming in the data and absent
when simply flicking through results in a file browser <a href="#fn1" id="fn1ref">[1]</a>.
</p>

<div>
    
    <p><i>Facial movements, optical flow, and voicings</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
I was elated at the ease of inserting a &lt;video&gt; tag and having a
scrubbable interface with a programmable API to attach my model predictions to.
Beyond simple inspection, I went on to build mock versions of the full
interaction flows.  These visualizers were instrumental to validating that the
machine learning outputs, more than automate an existing workflow, could
function as primitives at a new level of abstraction. The interface functions
as a &#34;minimal proof of interaction&#34; asking: can I wield this the way a
Photoshop expert can wield images?
</p>

<p>
From a technical perspective, all of these interfaces are single HTML pages
with interaction logic stuck inside &lt;script&gt; tags, forgoing any &#34;best
principles&#34; regarding separating HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I slowly build up
the pages, at first just &lt;img src=&#34;local-path&#34;&gt;, then some click handlers,
then some inline styling. It&#39;s the ethos of <a href="https://html.energy">html-energy</a>, combining the minimalism of <a href="https://htmldom.dev">htmldom.dev</a> programming with quick feedback
loops, centered around <i>seeing</i> what a change does. No boilerplate, no
frameworks, no server. Just an HTML file opened directly in the browser.
</p>

<h3>
Swimming in one&#39;s filesystem
</h3>

<p>
A surplus of hand-curated media files live on our file-systems. These are
artifacts we care about enough to screenshot, save as PDF, or jot down in
notes. Nonetheless, it&#39;s as if we&#39;ve put them in deep-storage: it&#39;s hard to do
anything with them, and even rarer to mix different artifacts into a collage.
One is forced to embed images and text into inextricable word documents and
slides, or use an infinite canvas like Figma, at which point the files are
no longer individuated, instead mere parts of a single new file.  The browser
as media viewer can circumvent this. 
</p>

<p>
Here&#39;s a trivial example, two dozen lines of code to bring a static library of
PDFs to life, replicating the well-known feeling of splaying all of one&#39;s papers
out on a desk in preparation for writing. It brings the digital filesystem
closer to the feeling of entering a physical library. Let me <i>see</i> their
covers, <i>peruse</i> the collection, <i>leaf</i> through the pages!
</p>

<div>
    
    <p><i>A digital library, made a little more visceral</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
This reconsiders the files on one&#39;s computer, not as static assets with fixed
ways of viewing, but as raw material to build with: archive bricolage. I use
&lt;embed&gt; tags to render the PDFs and lower the activation energy by
forgoing a server. The interface relies on the `drop` operation to grant the
browser permission to read files. To share, just send over the `.html` or zip
  up a directory with the files. Best practices be damned. This is a <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/"> home-cooked
    meal</a>.

<h3>
An infinite canvas for your filesystem
</h3>

<p>
Compelled by the idea of archive bricolage, and having seen some demos of the
Muse iPad app, and thought to make a pared down version in this raw HTML,
vanilla JS style. Wrapping everything into an absolute positioned &lt;div&gt;
with some mouse handlers gave me an <a href="https://cristobal.space/infinite.html">infinite canvas</a>. Expanding
it with the drag-and-drop security loop-hole of the pdf-viewer, I got the demo
below. Video, audio, text, image, and PDF co-existing in one space.
</p>

<div>
    
    <p><i>An initial prototype for an infinite canvas</i>
    </p>
</div>


<p>
Since, I&#39;ve been tweaking the affordances into a system I&#39;ve nicknamed
<i>CS_Store</i>. I was inspired by Omar&#39;s tweet on <i>DS_Store</i>, the
infamous file ignored in everyone&#39;s Git. It was a little bit of metadata stored
right there in the file-system, right next to the content it was describing.
Each DS_Store holds information about the spatial layout of files in Finder.
This felt like the epitome of local-first development hidden in plain sight.
</p>

<blockquote data-lang="en" data-dnt="true">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        the fact that everyone sees .DS_Store files as nuisances and not as
        precious, irreplaceable information (it&#39;s the file that remembers
        how I got my folder laid out just right!) shows how much Finder has
        failed to make graphical file management into a serious prospect

<p>
<i>CS_Store</i> is an infinite canvas for your file-system, providing the
two-dimensional, visual presence of the Desktop for any directory. The
information about the layout is stored in a `.CS_Store`, this time in a
human-readable JSON blob pointing to files in the same directory. Here&#39;s the
<a href="https://github.com/tobyshooters/CS_Store">source</a>.
</p>

<div>
    
    <p><i>A demo of the some of the kooky interactions below</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
Having this system as a playground lets me try out some kooky interactions:
</p><ol>
    <li>
        Directory as scope: A CS_Store canvas corresponds to a single
        directory. Linking to other canvases is done by visually representing
        sub-directories and the parent directory, and allowing navigation like
        a file browser. Interestingly, this means that all data needed to view
        the canvas elsewhere can be packaged with a single .zip operation at
        the desired root.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sound regions: Audio files are automatically played whenever they are
        visible in the viewport. As you navigate the virtual landscape, they
        function as a soundtrack, setting the mood for what is to be seen or read.
    </li>
    <li>
        Viewport as context: When an element is added to the canvas, it&#39;s a fixed
        size relative to the viewport. To add a header, zoom out to the region
        that matters. To add a small comment, zoom in next to the image. The
        hunch is that one can establish an isomorphism between viewport and the
        context needed for interpreting an artifact.
    </li>
</ol>
The key here is not that these interaction decisions are good, but that I can
try them out and see how they function in practice. This is only possible when
the computer is a system which can be wielded, when one can reach down into the
ladder of abstraction, without contortion.


<p>
Of course, the browser has clear failings: I could not easily e.g. make a PDF
scroll sideways. The ladder of abstraction is not evenly spaced. Some steps
require terrifying leaps into the Chromium codebase and, in fact, these
interface boundaries have massive implications on the space of possible
artifacts a system can produce. Beyond technical feasibility, a poorly designed
API forecloses the imagination of the user to just a few steps beyond the
starter code.  What role do tools have in expanding that imagination?

    <i>How to build your own media environments</i>
</h3>

<p>
Since reading through Ken Isaacs&#39; <i>How to Build Your Own Living
    Environments</i> and adapting his designs for a few desks at <a href="https://reduct.video">Reduct&#39;s</a> space in Soft Surplus, I&#39;ve been
sold on the emancipatory power of DIY.  I&#39;ve always been motivated to make,
however articulating the motivation through a sense of agency was revelatory.
There&#39;s a subtle, yet political, transformation in which domains of the world
cease to seem immutable. This sentiment has been reinforced as I&#39;ve read Ivan
Illich&#39;s works, who writes about convivial tooling: &#34;[Tools] which give each
person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with
the fruits of his or her vision.&#34; <a href="#fn2" id="fn2ref">[2]</a>
</p>

<div>
    <p><img src="https://cristobal.space/refs/CS_Store/illich-scribes.png" width="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p><i>Software engineers are today&#39;s scribe. Their pen must be taken away.</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
I&#39;ve used the browser to exemplify the kinds of artifacts that should be simple
to make, however the web is not HyperCard; you can&#39;t really make a home-cooked
meal. Just thinking about explaining to a layman the client-server model, HTTP,
CORS, URLs pointing to disk, JS syntax in an unstructured editor, &amp;c,
makes my head hurt. To make convivial tools in the current landscape of
software is, as Rob Ochshorn put it, to be a parasite, clinging on to the
&#34;platform capitalism&#34; of search, social media, and SaaS.  We, the programmers,
are the scribes of this world, who can misappropriate the platforms for our own
ends. Our pen must be taken away.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis on materiality leads to a pedagogical aside. By focusing on an
empirical ground truth, e.g.  the state of an image on the screen, a student
can grasp that declarative frameworks, drawing abstractions (`drawCircle`), or
imperative access on arrays of data are simply paradigms to provide
<i>ergonomic</i> access to something beneath. This insight implicitly teaches
what a &#34;good&#34; abstraction is: it allows you to do work. This is in contrast to
the approach I encountered at school, of function decomposition, or avoiding
repeated work, which make the design of computer software seem like a neurotic
chore.
</p>

<p>
For the layman to build their own <i>Folk Interfaces</i>, jigs to wield the
media they care about, we must offer simple primitives. A designer in Blender
thinks in terms of lighting, camera movements, and materials. An editor in
Premiere, in sequences, transitions, titles, and colors. Critically, this is
different from automating existing patterns, e.g. making it easy to create a
website, simulate the visuals of film photography, or 3D-scan one&#39;s room.
Instead, it&#39;s about building a playground in which those novel computational
artifacts can be tinkered with and composed, via a grammar native to their own
domain, to produce the fruits of the users&#39; own vision.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the computational tool-maker then is not to teach the layman about
recursion, abstraction, or composition, but to provide meaningful primitives
(i.e. a system) with which the user can do real work. End-user
<i>programming</i> is a red herring: We need to focus on materiality, what some
disparage as mere &#34;side effects.&#34;

The goal is to enable others to feel the agency and power that comes
when the world ceases to be immutable.
