Or rather, Taipei. They apparently don&#39;t have the resources to cover multiple cities.</span></p><p><span>They film across Asia, sometimes tackling difficult subjects such as the Myanmar coup or the Hong Kong protests, and sometimes doing softball man-on-the-street interviews along the lines of <i>what does the ideal Chinese man look like</i> or <i>what’s fashionable in Taiwan right now</i>. They also do occasional sit-down interviews of specific people of interest to viewers: a model from Myanmar, an American porn star in Japan, the inventor of bubble tea in Taiwan, a defected North Korean spy and more.</span></p><p><span><span>Other than the Hong Kong interview, their videos in China come across as far &#39;softer&#39; than their work anywhere else -- it&#39;s all very surface-level, and can kind of feel like folksy Propaganda Lite. </span>If you want to know what&#39;s happening in Uyghur detention camps, Asian Boss is not the place to look. </span></p><p><span>It&#39;s important, I suppose, to humanize people who have to live under a dehumanizing regime, but it sure does make the CCP look better than it is, especially when it comes to mass surveillance. Chances are that if they really went for meaty stories, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to film there at all.</span></p><p><span>This was the third time they&#39;ve come to Taiwan that I could find: the other two were the bubble tea and fashion videos -- nothing hard-hitting.</span></p><p><span>I’m not here to body-slam Asian Boss or chase them out of the country. I don&#39;t know what their intentions were. However, a few things seemed off to me as I watched. Then, something I consider a bombshell — a huge problem that undermines the credibility of this particular video and Asian Boss’s reporting model in general. </span></p><p><span>The short of it? They planted an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%E6%9F%B4Sean%E4%BD%A0%E8%AA%AASeanandShiba/videos">a fairly well-known deep blue Youtuber</a> and presented it as a “vox pop” interview, just someone they approached on the street. </span></p><p><span>The video starts out saying that this video takes “the accurate pulse of the public” with the voices of &#34;ordinary people&#34;. This can&#39;t possibly be true, as they&#39;re gathering anecdotes -- fluffy human interest stuff. It&#39;s not data. It&#39;s not bad in and of itself,  but it&#39;s not an accurate pulse of anything. <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7800&amp;id=6961">We have actual research for that</a>.</span></p><p><span><span>I wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed that one interviewee stood out. Something was just <i>off</i> about him -- he had extreme views but that wasn&#39;t it. His interview seemed...different. Guess which one? </span></span></p><p><span>This man had views that are far outside the mainstream in Taiwan. Of course, there are people who agree with him, but might be quiet about their views because they know they’re not popular. However, his comments about Taiwan being a “province under the Republic of China”, Xi Jinping being a “calm man” can only be described as deep blue, if not fringe. He&#39;s also wrong about a lot of things, but that could be a post in itself.<br/></span></p><p><span>I originally assumed the best. I figured that this is someone they happened to approach in that time and place, he happened to be well-spoken and ready to expound on his views, and he happened to be the living embodiment of a deep-blue eyeroll. Okay. Some people do feel that way. It’s possible. I think he&#39;s ridiculous but he has the right to his opinion. </span></p><p><span>Then, someone I know did a simple thing: he typed “Asian Boss Taiwan” into Facebook search, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Seanandchubby/posts/322577779878818">and guess what came up?</a></span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhu3FfsmKn3tapCftHVN8tyjgJ4P6iwV1NpC5q8vTHgjo3LpXg1U-uYSscsK1ivPG-RTekPZAnHxoXLAGkqgqpOAz3m459OVC8A6riprsUkFUzH-H-wHLE74Nx6WuSNGu7yPY9vE0SZ4FQIstBq4si0G5At3Xhp7K4goI4yqiaKnNbcQiP1I0Gwh9d7QA=s496"><span><img data-original-height="434" data-original-width="496" height="560" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhu3FfsmKn3tapCftHVN8tyjgJ4P6iwV1NpC5q8vTHgjo3LpXg1U-uYSscsK1ivPG-RTekPZAnHxoXLAGkqgqpOAz3m459OVC8A6riprsUkFUzH-H-wHLE74Nx6WuSNGu7yPY9vE0SZ4FQIstBq4si0G5At3Xhp7K4goI4yqiaKnNbcQiP1I0Gwh9d7QA=w640-h560" width="640"/></span></a></p><p><span>The guy in the tan jacket, posting on Facebook about his interview. He’s a modestly successful YouTuber named Sean (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%E6%9F%B4Sean%E4%BD%A0%E8%AA%AASeanandShiba">柴Sean你說</a>) with over 110,000 subscribers, with lovely content like “if Taiwanese want independence, why don’t they join the military?”, “Taiwanese now identify differently because of the way they are educated under the DPP” and “let’s not trash on Yen Ching-piao’s son, the bad stuff is all his father’s doing”. From the comments, he appears to have a lot of viewers in China. Someone on the side is commenting in Simplified Chinese that Mainland viewers don&#39;t care about the abuse of DPP legislator Kao Chia-yu:</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6PlY7UbypmVEuJFWusyBKOxyQY12AJU7DEfYFY9z_DhEH8_-bQsaWRBGBBTlqpBy0iMGTizNcdZGn5iXvravunemDUw_65-JZwKy3XIPazcM3_I11vnIJ_k1LSp-KQdBCHeiNsl8jvShRuGcJYSRYlX54JfM-INzl88TOMujoI9ed4WEKXv-ZN3L-Ww=s2224"><span><img data-original-height="1668" data-original-width="2224" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6PlY7UbypmVEuJFWusyBKOxyQY12AJU7DEfYFY9z_DhEH8_-bQsaWRBGBBTlqpBy0iMGTizNcdZGn5iXvravunemDUw_65-JZwKy3XIPazcM3_I11vnIJ_k1LSp-KQdBCHeiNsl8jvShRuGcJYSRYlX54JfM-INzl88TOMujoI9ed4WEKXv-ZN3L-Ww=w640-h480" width="640"/></span></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjI9LcX-T4Y_4t1i8yd0BYK3xpmyCkSJ2VZZBvkYUiJwRGdOsEb9PNG9wY10sNttuM5KxjnNYG0V0GVeu9De4cEqd8xX8c-hGIVgEoML_eTuNhSuZWHdIWtluGzR1sS-SL3bkKjoA6lAu0sx7ckjEGypN12TQj_HQ5a3PWB73a4DmsbGtFVetRYiKmv9g=s503"><span><img data-original-height="474" data-original-width="503" height="604" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjI9LcX-T4Y_4t1i8yd0BYK3xpmyCkSJ2VZZBvkYUiJwRGdOsEb9PNG9wY10sNttuM5KxjnNYG0V0GVeu9De4cEqd8xX8c-hGIVgEoML_eTuNhSuZWHdIWtluGzR1sS-SL3bkKjoA6lAu0sx7ckjEGypN12TQj_HQ5a3PWB73a4DmsbGtFVetRYiKmv9g=w640-h604" width="640"/></span></a></p><div><div><p><span><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgn8ZYqFl0iPMdIJezJUJ2kda_vEpnLI_-lcliqjMG0Lph2-fQc0vwNIoxdBlk4e8q7fA3unmoYdAljdzAWXwHws379W_soXfnHnxNcDMfTeEai6B574oA-paryBb8s15gq1A6C5jtcGnfi0DB-NbWWSNgtfmrHb_Ctiyyy0TeedxpUL-uS8zauLaD1Tw=s971"><img data-original-height="489" data-original-width="971" height="322" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgn8ZYqFl0iPMdIJezJUJ2kda_vEpnLI_-lcliqjMG0Lph2-fQc0vwNIoxdBlk4e8q7fA3unmoYdAljdzAWXwHws379W_soXfnHnxNcDMfTeEai6B574oA-paryBb8s15gq1A6C5jtcGnfi0DB-NbWWSNgtfmrHb_Ctiyyy0TeedxpUL-uS8zauLaD1Tw=w640-h322" width="640"/></a></p></span></p><p><span>On his Facebook post, Sean said he thought it was going to be in English but they ended up doing it in Chinese — that’s interesting, as it implies they think using Asian languages makes the interviews more authentic. (It can, if interviewees are more comfortable in those languages, but it’s not a stand-in for authenticity). Then he himself asked if it was truly okay to interview him and pretend he was just someone off the street — no links to his YouTube channel, no introduction of who he was. </span></p><p><span><i>Can they really do that? </i>He mused. </span></p><p><span>To be honest, from an ethical perspective, they can’t — or at least, they shouldn’t. If you say you are doing &#34;man on the street&#34; interviews, the only proper way forward is to stick to that -- you can&#39;t plant people and pretend you found them randomly.</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s amusing, though, that Sean, a comparatively small-time Youtuber, was handed a platform that reaches millions, including lots of Westerners. He had a golden opportunity to construct a narrative where his voice is closer to the center, represents the views of many Taiwanese, or is otherwise not a fringe perspective. All he had to do was not post about the fact that this interview was obviously set up, and I doubt we ever would have found him. Either he didn&#39;t think about that, or he did but figured he&#39;d never be caught by anyone who mattered. </span></p><p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhsgsl_5TM_zi14GsqsTQYw7Bj1_bDAFe2AmSYQovxMhHEF5NoErxa6zcNgIBxyLRhqwrgLskzPQnGwu1EwNKX-_t9l3hpvYHTNQXeyBCvnfDBxeeX5QUx67Z9B2VduBD7Y3vrM-DJPXxPo-1xao5P_YNGVuAa94bjSoIL8wMotHCCM534H_7KWpwYO0g=s275"><img data-original-height="206" data-original-width="275" height="479" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhsgsl_5TM_zi14GsqsTQYw7Bj1_bDAFe2AmSYQovxMhHEF5NoErxa6zcNgIBxyLRhqwrgLskzPQnGwu1EwNKX-_t9l3hpvYHTNQXeyBCvnfDBxeeX5QUx67Z9B2VduBD7Y3vrM-DJPXxPo-1xao5P_YNGVuAa94bjSoIL8wMotHCCM534H_7KWpwYO0g=w640-h479" width="640"/></a></span></p><p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1snAo6h1AZZFXRUYlWjC-AaNfNAR6WwQZh4IP-fQ_bgMe2si9iDzeMfLj18nxE3rXtJkUHXR29Dk3zMYMq4JdAkqFFAautGb-1GH-_KP5ZgVLkjPzbrYikMsnDaelc3Wl4bCrqDfJimekkFlepi4MiXcq0HWOcNin7Y4ExeRGCi4wYYBpuPf_LHSEfA=s275"><img data-original-height="206" data-original-width="275" height="479" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1snAo6h1AZZFXRUYlWjC-AaNfNAR6WwQZh4IP-fQ_bgMe2si9iDzeMfLj18nxE3rXtJkUHXR29Dk3zMYMq4JdAkqFFAautGb-1GH-_KP5ZgVLkjPzbrYikMsnDaelc3Wl4bCrqDfJimekkFlepi4MiXcq0HWOcNin7Y4ExeRGCi4wYYBpuPf_LHSEfA=w640-h479" width="640"/></a></span></p><p><i><span>It seemed like he got more airtime than the others, too, but I&#39;d have to go back and count the seconds -- perhaps it just seemed that way because this is so painful to watch.</span></i></p><p><span>That’s a propaganda tactic. A lie. It’s what you do when you want to push a certain narrative, but want it to seem grassroots. It’s unacceptable. </span></p><p><span>I reached out to Asian Boss on Twitter and via their website to see if they’d answer a few questions about this, but received no response. </span></p><p><span>As I see it, if you want to interview someone like this, you can, but there’s only one appropriate path: move away from the “ordinary people on the street” interview setup and state plainly that you’ve gathered representatives from all segments of the Taiwanese political spectrum. You have to actually do that, though: in addition to moderate voices, you have to find someone as far-out deep green as Sean is deep blue. The closest person in this video was the young man in glasses, and frankly, his views aren&#39;t fringe. They&#39;re pretty normal.</span></p><p><span>Then you show that video without subterfuge: <i>we gathered these people because they represent specific things. We did not find them randomly. </i></span></p><p><span>Doing it as they did not only sells a lie to the audience about how they find these views, but how common each view is in the wild. The fact is, you won’t find many people like Sean on the street, because his views are fairly rare. Presenting him as someone you ran into at the park makes it seem like there are a lot more Seans out there than there really are. Filming him mask less, in fantastic light with great angles and backdrops furthers the lie that he is an authoritative voice for what many Taiwanese think. </span></p><p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg9I2SoI7nS0XoqCun8p6hmElxz0ogwVpCjAko1GEIhfj2AprS-P6aATqYdo9rx20K5739lbRlXPq5b1oJLKk9clfmyGNBqnjNN4x-JcrwCW-ewceLG118QG6W7WbnPStbbk1o53eElP6elp-b9WG55_IG8CovMjv4K0ZT71jiDkXvUHjwEbbpNLFdwlg=s275"><img data-original-height="206" data-original-width="275" height="479" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg9I2SoI7nS0XoqCun8p6hmElxz0ogwVpCjAko1GEIhfj2AprS-P6aATqYdo9rx20K5739lbRlXPq5b1oJLKk9clfmyGNBqnjNN4x-JcrwCW-ewceLG118QG6W7WbnPStbbk1o53eElP6elp-b9WG55_IG8CovMjv4K0ZT71jiDkXvUHjwEbbpNLFdwlg=w640-h479" width="640"/></a></span></p><p><i><span>Wrong. Everyone knows that. The thing is, they don&#39;t care, and you can&#39;t force them to.</span></i></p><p><span>It also skews where the “center” of Taiwanese views on China truly is. If you interview a deep blue YouTuber but have no deep green balance, the “middle” seems more blue than it really is. The actual center is closer to “we don’t want to be part of the PRC and don’t want a war&#34; -- it&#39;s not &#34;in fact Taiwanese are Chinese&#34;.

But if the people do choose that one day, it will probably be because they can do so without the threat of war from &#34;calm&#34; Xi Jinping!</span></i></p><p><span>I have other questions, too. Why do two videos on anti-feminism in South Korea, but no videos (that I can find) talking to Korean feminists? Why present yourself as a “startup” when you’ve been around for almost a decade? Why delete many of your older videos? (Some of the older ones are pretty bad, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0ry-Qs2NqQ">such as this drawn-out, unfunny prank asking white people their opinions about untrue facts about Asia</a>. Maybe that’s why they deleted others -- dump the low-quality stuff as you grow your brand.) </span></p><p><span>They do try to do good as well, however, and seem to get involved in local or personal causes beyond just reporting on them. </span></p><p><span>It would be great if Asian Boss could take a look at how they’re producing content now, with an eye toward any ethical issues that could cause them to lose credibility. Be clear about what you’re doing and what it can accomplish. That you are offering anecdotes, not data. If you are interviewing personalities, you need to say so. You can’t present them as people you found on the street. </span></p><p><span>At that point, I would welcome more videos from them about Taiwan.
