    <h1>THE GLOBAL CAPSLOCK KEY</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I MADE A GLOBAL CAPS LOCK KEY. THIS WAY WE CAN ALL AGREE ON WHEN TO USE CAPS LOCK.</p>
<div><video controls="" playsinline="" poster="/images/the-global-capslock-key/global-capslock-firstframe.png" width="1072" height="604" preload="metadata" alt="globalcapslock.com. A button with CAPS LOCK IS ON is visible. It is bright yellow. It switches to caps lock is off and turns grey."><p>Loading...</p></video><p>finally i&#39;ve made something useful</p></div>
<p>It’s a small cross-platform client - it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux (although it requires <code>xdotool</code> on Linux, so YMMV there. Send me a pull request!)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/global-capslock">set up the client here</a> or <a href="https://globalcapslock.com/">see the current caps lock state here</a>.</p>

<p>Well, some people get annoyed when you use caps lock.</p>
<div><p><img alt="A quote from bash.org. Full text: &lt;Khassaki&gt; HI EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!
&lt;Judge-Mental&gt; try pressing the the Caps Lock key
&lt;Khassaki&gt; O THANKS!!! ITS SO MUCH EASIER TO WRITE NOW!!!!!!!

<p>I figure the problem is that we can’t agree on when to use it - but if everyone switches to this tool, the democratic process should do its thing.</p>
<h2 id="toc:how-does-this-work">HOW DOES THIS WORK</h2>
<p>It’s pretty simple. <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/global-capslock/blob/main/client.py">The client</a> implements platform-specific ways of detecting and toggling caps lock state, and then has a platform-independent loop that compares your current caps lock state with the global state, and toggles things as necessary.</p>
<p>It’s a little harder than I expected to toggle caps lock - my first attempts on my macbook got me into a state where caps lock was on, I couldn’t turn it off, and I also couldn’t hold shift to type lowercase!</p>
<p>But I…think I fixed those bugs. You can probably use this.</p>
<h2 id="toc:should-i-use-this">SHOULD I USE THIS</h2>
<p>tbh - if you’re asking that question, probably not!</p>
<h2 id="toc:thanks-this-solves-a-major-problem-in-my-life">THANKS, THIS SOLVES A MAJOR PROBLEM IN MY LIFE</h2>
<p>enjoy :)</p></article></div>
