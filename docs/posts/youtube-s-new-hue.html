    <h1>YouTube&#39;s New Hue</h1>

Color ranked in the top three, so we knew that evolving our palette would make an immediate and significant impact. It was a big step forward but not a leap! We wanted an evolution, not a revolution. Red, core to YouTube’s identity, demanded a delicate touch. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we aimed to refine it.</p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> We change the product constantly — we’re talking over 1,700 updates per year! — but users don’t notice incremental changes. We found that if you bundle valuable features with visual design changes, people notice that the product has evolved.</p>
<p>There was a great opportunity here not just to revisit color, but also to think about how color is used in our product to create a cohesive experience. We could leverage color to support the iconic moments in our product, such as the “smash the like” button and the “subscribe to my channel” button.</p>
<p><strong>Robyn:</strong> We’ve had many reds during 20 years of YouTube’s existence. The most recent change happened in 2017 and it was pure red in the RGB system, which we knew had problems. For instance, it’s perceived to be too loud when implemented in key UI moments. It rendered orange on certain screens. It caused burn-in issues on TVs, which is when the screen becomes permanently discolored because pure colors create more burden over time. Those technical issues were easy targets.</p>
<p><strong>Jessie:</strong> By adjusting to a slightly cooler shade, we resolved the technical issues and added an approachable, vibrant personality. We wanted to honor YouTube’s legacy while modernizing it.</p>
<p><strong>Linda:</strong> We want YouTube to be a welcoming space for our broad user base regardless of demographic, so we stayed away from colors that felt domineering, cold, or corporate.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> For better or worse, red is a very strong color that has been synonymous with a lot of different movements throughout history, and it has different meanings in different societies.</p>
<p>In order to develop our new color, we had to ask ourselves: Does this still reflect our brand? To answer that, we started with YouTube’s mission to “Give everyone a voice and show them the world.” Next, to help us evaluate the color, the new red had to embody our creative principles: welcoming, engaging, dynamic, and unified.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
