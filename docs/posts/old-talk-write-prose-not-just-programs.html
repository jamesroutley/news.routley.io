    <h1>Old Talk: Write Prose, Not Just Programs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve recently signed up for the <a href="https://indiauncut.com/clear-writing/">Art of Clear Writing</a> course by Amit Verma. It
is still early days and I can’t comment on the course itself.  But, the
discussion after the first class reminded me of a talk I had given a couple of
years ago – Write Prose, Not Just Programs.</p>
<p>A friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/vivekv">Vivek</a>, had nudged me to do a talk on “Writing for Developers” and I
ended up talking to his team about a week later. The PyCon India CFP was open a
couple of months later, where I submitted this talk and it was accepted.</p>
<p>Even if a couple of years late, I thought it might be helpful to leave links to
the talk video and slides on my blog. So, here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://punchagan.github.io/talks/pycon-2020-writing/writing-for-devs.html">Slides</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TucAxOO68c">Video</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PS: Ironically, my blog hasn’t seen much activity after giving that talk due to
various reasons.  I’ve been meaning and trying to change that off-late, though.</p>
