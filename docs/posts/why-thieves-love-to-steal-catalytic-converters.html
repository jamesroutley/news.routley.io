<p>In the mass of pipes and steel under your car, there’s something called a <strong>catalytic converter</strong>.</p>
<p>Situated between the engine and exhaust, these little contraptions break up noxious gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide into less harmful compounds.</p>
<p>Since being introduced in the 1970s, they’ve helped reduce certain emissions by 80%+. </p>
<p><strong>They’re also extremely appealing to thieves.</strong></p>
<p>Catalytic converter theft has always been a problem. But in the past few years, reported incidents have skyrocketed by more than <strong>11x</strong>.</p>
<p>Auto repair shops that used to see 2-3 of these thefts every month are now seeing as many as <strong>6-8 per day</strong>.  </p>
<p>In 2020, several huge busts made headlines:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Elk Grove, CA</strong>: Authorities seized 2k converters along with $300k in cash.</li><li><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>: 19 people were arrested in connection to $750k worth of stolen converters.</li><li><strong>Kent, WA</strong>: A crime ring was caught with 800 converters and $40k in cash.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What’s driving this trend?</strong></p>
<p>Inside most converters, there’s a ceramic “honeycomb” that contains trace amounts of 3 precious metals: <strong>platinum, palladium, and rhodium</strong>.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the going rate for these metals has shot up to the moon.</p>

<p>Rhodium, which went for ~$2k/oz. 3 years ago, hit nearly <strong>$30k/oz. </strong>in the spring of 2021 — more than the cost of many new cars, and <strong>15x the price of gold</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the same period, palladium also saw a<strong> 3x</strong> bump.</p>
<p><strong>A few factors are to blame for this.</strong></p>
<p>Rhodium and palladium are byproducts of platinum mining, the bulk of which occurs in South Africa.</p>
<p>For the past decade, there has been a surplus of platinum. Mine operators haven’t felt a need to ratchet up production — and as a result, rhodium and palladium have been in shorter supply.</p>
<p>Last year, COVID forced many platinum mines to shut down altogether for 8 months, compounding the problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand for these metals has increased.</p>
<p>The catalytic converter market, which accounts for 80% of all rhodium and palladium consumption, is poised to grow by <strong>8% per year</strong> as countries in Asia and Europe push for stricter emissions standards.</p>
<p>As a result, the auto industry has had to rely more on recycled precious metals.</p>
<p><strong>For thieves, this spells out a promising opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>Equipped with an electric saw, a skilled thief can steal your converter in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>At scrapyards, used catalytic converters go for between <strong>$25 and $1k+</strong> depending on make and model.</p>
<p>Converters found in Priuses and large Ford trucks tend to contain more metals and command far higher sums, making them particularly prone to these thefts.</p>
<p>But many scrapyards now require sellers to show proof of ID when selling used converters — and thieves have had to create new sales channels.</p>
<p>Here’s what generally happens to your converter in the  criminal underworld after it’s stolen:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>thief</strong> sells it to a well-connected middleman for ~$200 on average.</li><li>The <strong>middleman</strong> amasses 10-20 converters and flips them in bulk to an underground decanner.</li><li>The <strong>decanner</strong> cuts open the converters and removes the ceramic honeycomb.</li><li>This honeycomb is sent to an<strong> illegal smelter</strong>, where the precious metals are extracted, distilled, and sold to manufacturers.</li></ul>
<p><strong>How much are the metals in these things worth?</strong></p>
<p>The amount of precious metals in a catalytic converter varies widely, but a standard part might contain:</p>
<p>At current market value, that’s an average of <strong>$595 to $1,420</strong> worth of precious metals. (And remember: some converters contain significantly more than this).</p>
<p>Everyone benefits from this shady economy — except, of course, people who get their converters jacked.  </p>
<p>Victims often have to shell out <strong>$500 to $3k+</strong> to fix the damage. Worse yet, certain parts are currently taking 2+ months to fulfill, thanks to ongoing supply chain issues in the auto industry. </p>
<p>A thriving market has emerged for anti-theft devices. MillerCAT, a California-based firm that sells <strong>$160</strong> converter shields, says its sales have doubled in the past year.</p>
<p>Still, authorities in many hard-hit areas say converter thefts have only gotten worse in 2021.</p>
<p>And as long as precious metals like rhodium and palladium are going for more than gold, we’ll likely see many more thefts.</p>
