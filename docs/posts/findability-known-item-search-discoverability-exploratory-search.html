    <h1>Findability → Known-Item Search, Discoverability → Exploratory Search?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><time>June 28, 2022</time></p><div>
<p>I keep confusing findability and discoverability. It seems that findability is often equated to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-item_search">known-item search</a>, and discoverability to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_search">exploratory search</a>.</p>
<p>Known-item search is compatible with “instant search”, aka search-as-you-type interfaces.
Exploratory search is compatible with “autocomplete” (incl. re-spelling, infix matching, synonym
substitution, etc.) interfaces.</p>
<p>Recommendation can be a part of exploratory search, i.e. bundled in response to a user’s pulling for
relevant information. It can also be pushed independently of deliberately registered search intent
– via notifications, email digests, etc.</p>
<p>Does the latter activity – the pushy one – “count” for discoverability? I can imagine such
activity being framed as periodic re-running of an exploratory-search query on behalf of a user,
with query-independent factors for retrieval and ranking being varied over time.</p>
