<p>The bedroom of the place I’m staying is on the ground level facing the street, meaning I can hear the footsteps of those who pass by. This morning there was a certain crunch of somebody’s steps in the snow that told me immediately it was a sub-freezing day. Anybody who grew up in a place with cold winters will know what I mean.</p>

<p>I love that crunch sound.</p>
