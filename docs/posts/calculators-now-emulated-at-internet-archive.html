    <h1>Calculators now emulated at Internet Archive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>It’s time to add another family of emulated older technology to the Internet Archive.</p>



<p>While we have an excellent family of emulators assisting MAME in making programs work in the browser, the vast majority of the items in our <a href="https://archive.org/details/internetarcade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Arcade</a> (and <a href="https://archive.org/details/internetarcadeturbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turbo Edition</a>), <a href="https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Console Living Room</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/handheldhistory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Handheld History</a> collections mostly have MAME to thank.</p>



<p>And now another can as well: <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/calculatordrawer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Calculator Drawer</a></strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png"><img width="1024" height="667" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x667.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x667.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-300x195.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-768x500.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-624x406.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></a></figure>



<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/calculatordrawer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a> is smaller than these other collections, but they possess a hearty collection of graphing and simple Calculators, emulated in MAME and with an additional layer of presenting the calculator itself, as a clickable graphical object, which you can then do math and graphing on. (You also need to turn many of them on, so look for the “ON” button to get things going.)</p>



<p><strong>If Graphing Calculators were not a part of your childhood or previous life, they may be a bit of a steep climb to get to understand. If you still want to mess around with them, a stash of <a href="https://archive.org/details/calculatorstash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> manuals for most of the models</a> in the collection has been provided.</strong></p>



<p>So, go forth and literally multiply.</p>



<p>However, if you wish to stick around a little bit longer…</p>

<p>…and here’s what you’ll see when you boot it up in the MAME system:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chessmstdm-1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="725" height="500" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chessmstdm-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chessmstdm-1.png 725w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chessmstdm-1-300x207.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chessmstdm-1-624x430.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px"/></a></figure>







<p>And while it’s very nice this option exists, there’s something compelling about a photograph of an original item being shown on-screen along with interactivity, and the best part is how it doesn’t require a deep lore of programming.</p>



<p>There are some amazing efforts that have been done to make these “layout” files for items emulated by MAME, with the best clearinghouse for seeing this work at <a href="https://mrdo.mameworld.info/mame_artwork.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Do’s Arcade</a>. By leafing through the <a href="https://mrdo.mameworld.info/mame_artwork_ingame.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collection of artwork made so far</a>, you can see how much better the interface is with a graphical addition. There’s over 1,400 different systems that have gotten the Artwork Treatment, a major success.</p>



<p>But that’s still a tiny percentage of the systems that need to time, focus, and skills of volunteers to make them come alive in this way.</p>



<p>People are often inspired to want to help emulation efforts, since they’re the future of software’s history, but it can be daunting to find a place in, to ramp up to the mass of intricacies and standards of a decades-long project. But perhaps, out there, is someone, <em>maybe even you</em>, who would find it a delight to help acquire excellent photographs of vintage hardware, and collaborate on designing the layout files for them. </p>
