    <h1>FreeBSD-rustdate, a reimplementation of FreeBSD-update</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>This is <code>freebsd-rustdate</code>
, a reimplementation of <code>freebsd-update</code>
.  It’s primarily
written because of <a href="https://elijer.github.io/faq.html#slow">how slow <code>freebsd-update</code>
 is</a>, and
is <a href="https://elijer.github.io/faq.html#rust">written in rust</a> because I felt like it.</p>
<p>In usage, it’s expected to be <strong>similar, but not identical</strong> to
<code>freebsd-update</code>
.  There are probably a number of minor edge-case differences I
don’t even know about, but there are a number of larger ones that are
intentional too.</p>
<p><strong>This is currently an early, experimental version.</strong>  It seems to work
OK, and hasn’t blown up any of the systems I’ve used it on.  But
upgrading your OS is a serious task, and a dangerous one to mess up.
Don’t consider this a first-line production tool yet.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://elijer.github.io/download.html">downloads page</a> for download links and quickstart
instructions.</p>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h2>
<p>As with <code>freebsd-update</code>
, the basic usage of <code>freebsd-rustdate</code>
 mostly falls into the
“fetch” (update current release to new patches) and “upgrade” (update
current release to new release) paths.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># freebsd-rustdate fetch
  [ lotsa output ]
# freebsd-rustdate install
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code># freebsd-rustdate upgrade -r 13.8-RELEASE
  [ even more lotsa output ]
  [ run `freebsd-rustdate resolve-merges` if you have conflicts]
# freebsd-rustdate install
  [ reboot new kernel ]
# freebsd-rustdate install
  [ rebuild packages with new world ]
# freebsd-rustdate install
</code></pre><p>The basic configuration is read out of the same <code>freebsd-update.conf</code> as
<code>freebsd-update</code>
 uses.  The subset that <code>freebsd-rustdate</code>
 can use, it does.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h2 id="are-you-sure-it-works">Are you sure it works?</h2>
<p>The server this site is running on was upgraded with it.  Are you able to
load this page?</p>
<p>Now, is it as well tested and widely used as <code>freebsd-update</code>
?  <strong>Absolutely
not</strong>.  It’s had basic development and a little use by one guy.  Use at
your own risk, and it’s probably a somewhat elevated risk.  I <em>strongly
recommend</em> you don’t try it for the first time on a system you’d have
trouble recovering if it broke.  Or the second time.</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>Certainly not.  Any current behavior is definitely a feature.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>To Colin for writing the original <code>freebsd-update</code>
 and making at all work.
Nothing said here should be taken as a slight to him or the work he did
to get this up and running.  For what I’ve done standing on his
shoulders, I can only apologize.</p>
