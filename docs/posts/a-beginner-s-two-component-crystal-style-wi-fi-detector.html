    <h1>A Beginner&#39;s Two-Component Crystal-Style Wi-Fi Detector</h1>

<p>Crystal radios are famous for doing something almost magical: picking up broadcast signals with nothing more than a diode, an antenna, and a pair of headphones. They’re the simplest RF receivers you can build — and a brilliant way to learn how radio waves become electrical signals.</p>



<p>In this post, I’m taking that idea into the modern world. Using just <strong>two components</strong> — a high-speed Schottky diode and an LED — you can build a tiny “crystal detector” that responds to <strong>2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even microwave oven leakage</strong>. Unlike classic crystal radios, it doesn’t rely on a nearby AM transmitter, long wire antenna, or earth ground. Just the diode, the LED, and a small piece of metal for an antenna.</p>



<p>Despite the simplicity, it’s surprisingly effective. Bring it near a phone, router, laptop, or microwave oven and you’ll see packets and bursts appear as quick flashes of light. It’s easy to demonstrate in a classroom, easy to experiment with, and a great hands-on way to show how rectification and RF envelope detection work at microwave frequencies.</p>



<p>This circuit has a very minimal bill of materials, and does not require any soldering to complete, making it a great fit for a class-room activity.</p>



<h2>Parts you’ll need</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>1× <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c35QtwL7">1N5711 Schottky diode</a></strong> (<a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c35QtwL7">AliExpress</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/49gg6hE">Amazon</a>)</li>



<li><strong>1× <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3pVp2NP">Red LED</a></strong> (<a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3pVp2NP">AliExpress</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/44Sa5q8">Amazon</a>)</li>
</ul>



<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bend the LED legs</strong> so they extend horizontally in opposite directions. These form the antenna.</li>



<li><strong>Place the diode alongside the LED</strong>, with its legs parallel to the LED legs. <strong>Make sure the diode’s cathode is next to the LED’s anode</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Twist the diode legs tightly around the LED legs.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s it. You’re done.</p>

<p>You’ve now built a two-component detector for 2.4 GHz microwaves.</p>



<p>Hold it near a Wi-Fi router, smartphone, Bluetooth device, or even the front of a running microwave oven, and you should see the LED flicker or glow in bursts:</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>



<p>This detector converts invisible RF energy into tiny flashes of light:</p>



<ul>
<li>As RF waves hit the LEDs legs, which act as a simple <strong>antenna</strong>, the diode allows charges accelerated by the radio waves to flow in <strong>only one direction</strong>.</li>



<li>Positive charges gradually accumulate on the leg connected to the diode’s cathode.</li>



<li>When enough charge builds up, the <strong>LED briefly lights</strong>, discharging the stored energy as a visible flash.</li>



<li>Each RF burst repeats this process, so the LED flickers in sync with nearby 2.4 GHz signals.</li>
</ul>



<p>Even with just a diode and LED, this demonstrates the same principle as a crystal radio: <strong>rectifying alternating currents and accumulating charge to drive a visible output</strong>.</p>



<h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>



<h3>Ensure the Diode and LED Are Oriented Correctly</h3>



<p>For the detector to work, the <strong>LED and 1N5711 diode must be connected the right way around</strong>:</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>LED:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>anode</strong> is usually the longer leg.</li>



<li>Inside the LED, the anode connects to the smaller internal element, while the cathode connects to the larger one.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>1N5711 Diode:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>cathode</strong> is marked by a black ring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>When assembling connect the LED’s <strong>anode (longer leg)</strong> to the diode’s <strong>cathode (marked with a ring)</strong>.</p>



<p>Getting this orientation correct is essential — if it’s reversed, the LED will not flash. Refer to the diagram for a visual guide.</p>

<h3>Works at 2.4 GHz Only</h3>



<p>The 1N5711 is fast, but not quite fast enough for most 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals.</p>



<h3>Don’t Touch the Legs</h3>



<p>If your fingers touch the antenna legs, the LED may stop flashing.</p>



<h3>Try Different Angles</h3>



<p>The LED legs act as a <strong>dipole antenna</strong>, which is polarized.</p>



<h3>Component Selection Matters</h3>



<p>This project <strong>won’t work with just any diode</strong> — it needs a very fast <strong>RF-capable Schottky diode</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ve tested this circuit with the <strong>1N5711</strong>, and it consistently works.</p>



<p>For the LED: <strong>use a red LED</strong>.</p>
