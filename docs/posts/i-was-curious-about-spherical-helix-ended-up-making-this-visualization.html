<p>MOVING OBJECTS IN 3D SPACE</p><p>tap/click the right side of the screen to go forward →</p><h3>Have you ever wondered how to move objects along a spherical helix path?</h3><p>Okay… probably not, right?</p><p>But one morning, this question popped into my head.</p><p>It stuck with me long enough that I ended up diving into a few articles about it.</p><p>From there, it spiraled into lots of explorations, trying to figure out how to move objects in 3D space.</p><p>From a simple circle...</p><p>...to a spiral...</p><p>...to this complex, chaotic path.</p><p>All these explorations made me want to share what I learned with you.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.</p><p>Let’s start!</p><p>A helix is a shape that loops around and around, like a spring.</p><h3>In a spherical helix, it loops around a sphere.</h3><h3>To move an object along a spherical helix path, we need to define its 3D coordinates to follow a helical pattern around a sphere.</h3><p>How do we do this?</p><p>We&#39;ll get there! But first, let’s see how to position and move objects in 3D space.</p><p>In 3D space, we position objects by setting its coordinates along three axes: x,y, and z.</p><p>The x-axis typically represents horizontal movement—left or right.</p><p>The y-axis typically represents vertical movement—up or down.</p><p>The z-axis typically represents depth—forward or backward</p><p>To move an object in 3D space, we can use mathematical functions to set its position over time.</p><p>For example, this cube&#39;s x position is set to 10 * cos(πt/2), where t is time (in seconds).</p><p>x-label</p><p>The result? It oscillates from 10 to -10 along the x-axis every 2 seconds, following a cosine wave.</p><p>x-label</p><p>Similarly, setting the y position to 10 * cos(πt/2) makes the cube oscillates vertically, from 10 to -10 every 2 seconds.</p><p>y-label</p><p>We can create a two-dimensional path by setting the x and y positions to different functions.</p><p>For example, a circle.</p><p>For this circle, the x position is set to 10 * cos(πt/2).</p><p>The cube starts at x = 10, moves to -10 in 2 seconds, then back to 10, and so on.</p><p>x-label</p><p>Meanwhile, the y position is set to 10 * sin(πt/2).</p><p>y-label</p><p>The movement for x and y may look similar, but they are actually out of phase.</p><p>When x = 10, y = 0; when x = 0, y = 10; and so on.</p><p>x-label</p><p>y-label</p><p>Together, these two functions create a circular path for the cube.</p><p>x-label</p><p>y-label</p><p>Now we can get creative with functions to create even more complex paths.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s multiply the x function by 0.03 * t.</p><p>It would make the cube oscillates farther on the x-axis over time.</p><p>x-label</p><p>Do the same for y...</p><p>y-label</p><p>..and we will have a circular path whose radius grows over time.</p><p>A spiral!</p><p>x-label</p><p>y-label</p><h3>Okay, now it&#39;s time to talk about the spherical helix (finally!)</h3><h3>The spherical helix path is similar to the spiral we just made, but with some differences.</h3><h3>First, a spherical helix is three-dimensional.</h3><p>It has a z component that changes over time.</p><p>This cube&#39;s z position is set as 10 * cos(0.02 * πt).</p><p>It will start from z = 10 then slowly move to -10.</p><p>z-label</p><p>Second, unlike the previous spiral, the x and y positions don’t grow indefinitely.</p><p>They grow at first, then shrink halfway through.</p><p>This is because the x function is multiplied by another sine function: sin(0.02 * πt)</p><p>which makes the radius larger in the middle and smaller at the ends.</p><p>x-label</p><p>The same is also done to the y function.</p><p>y-label</p><h3>Together, these functions create a spherical helix.</h3><h3>By updating the cube’s position with these functions, it moves along a spherical helix path.</h3><p>x-label</p><p>y-label</p><p>z-label</p><p>That&#39;s all!</p><p>In summary, we can move objects in 3D space by defining their x, y, z coordinates as functions of time.</p><p>These functions, which express x, y, z coordinates as a function of another variable (in this case, time), are called parametric equations.</p><p>Check out the Wikipedia article for more on parametric equations.</p><p>Now that we know this, we can get creative and move objects along any path we want!</p><p>From a simple circle...</p><p>...to a spiral...</p><p>...to this complex, chaotic path...</p><p>...which we know now isn&#39;t actually chaotic.</p><p>It&#39;s just a path defined by mathematical functions.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me, I hope you enjoyed it!</p><p>__________________</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this, please consider following me on Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I&#39;m planning to write more articles like this, so stay tuned!</p><p>https://twitter.com/damarberlari</p><p>_blank</p>
