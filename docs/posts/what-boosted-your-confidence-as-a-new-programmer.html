    <h1>Ask HN: What boosted your confidence as a new programmer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When anyone starts out in a new craft, even after grasping the fundamentals of the tools they are quite shaky and low on confidence until they have a significant experience in doing something that ultimately ramps up their confidence in their craftsmanship.</p><p>Similar things happen with novice programmers when they start out.</p><p>Then they read a beautiful codebase which they can fully understand and replicate, or build a project from scratch, or read a book or take a class on a subject. And their confidence is tremendously boosted thereafter.</p><p>What was it for you? How did you gain this confidence to take the first step from being a tinkerer to being a skilled craftman?</p></div></div></div>
