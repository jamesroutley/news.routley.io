    <h1>FCC Chair Brendan Carr is letting ISPs merge–as long as they end DEI programs</h1>

<p>Verizon&#39;s letter said that because of the &#34;changing landscape,&#34; the firm &#34;has been evaluating its DEI-related programs, HR processes, supplier programs, training programs and materials, and other initiatives.&#34; Among other changes, Verizon said it &#34;will no longer have a team or any individual roles focused on DEI&#34; and will reassign DEI-focused employees to &#34;HR talent objectives.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Verizon recognizes that some DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination,&#34; the letter said.</p>
<p>T-Mobile sent a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1032785606628/1">similar letter</a> to Carr on March 27, saying it &#34;is fully committed to identifying and rooting out any policies and practices that enable such discrimination, whether in fulfillment of DEI or any other purpose,&#34; and is thus &#34;conducting a comprehensive review of its DEI policies, programs, and activities.&#34; One day later, the FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-283A1.pdf">approved</a> a T-Mobile joint venture to <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-eqt-close-lumos-fiber-jv">acquire fiber provider Lumos</a>.</p>
<p>With the Verizon and T-Mobile deals approved, Carr has another opportunity to make demands on a major telecom company. On Friday, Charter announced a <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/charter-communications-and-cox-communications-announce-definitive-agreement-to-combine-companies">$34.5 billion merger with Cox</a> that would make it the largest home Internet provider in the US, passing Comcast. Several <a href="https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/what-charter-cox-deal-means-broadband-workers">Charter and Cox programs</a> could be on the chopping block because of Carr&#39;s animosity toward diversity initiatives.</p>

<h2>Verizon criticized as “cowardly”</h2>
<p>Media advocacy group Free Press criticized Verizon for agreeing to Carr&#39;s demands.</p>
<p>&#34;Verizon&#39;s cowardly decision to modify or kill its diversity, equity and inclusion practices is the latest shameful episode in a litany of surrenders to appease our authoritarian president,&#34; Free Press Vice President of Policy Matt Wood <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/verizon-cowardly-capitulates-trump-and-carrs-racist-bullying">said</a>. &#34;The government alleges no specific instances of unlawful employment discrimination, and Verizon admits none. Yet to win a merger approval and the prospect of a few extra dollars, the company meekly suggests that some of its &#39;DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination&#39;—lawyer-speak for we&#39;ve done nothing wrong, but we can see which way the political winds are blowing.&#34;</p>
<p>Wood said that Carr &#34;once defended his agency&#39;s independence from the White House when a Democrat was in charge&#34; but is &#34;now gleefully carrying out the president&#39;s orders to roll back civil-rights protections and equal-opportunity gains at all costs.&#34;</p>
