					<p>Sometimes financial decisions that are seemingly rational on their face can precipitate mass exodus of your best engineers.</p>
<p><strong>We Hired the CFO</strong></p>
<p>Then the new CFO got up to give her presentation – all kind of expected; Sarbanes Oxley compliance, a new accounting system, beef up IT and security, Section 409A (valuation) compliance, etc. Then she dropped the other shoe.</p>
<p>“Do you know how much our company is spending on free sodas and snacks?”  And to answer her own question she presented the spreadsheet totaling it all up.</p>
<p>There were some experienced VC’s in the room and I was waiting for them to “educate” her about startup culture. But my jaw dropped when the board agreed that the “free stuff” had to go.</p>
<p>“We’re too big for that now” was the shared opinion. But we’ll sell them soda “cheap.”</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences</strong></p>
<p>This company had grown from the founders, who hired an early team of superstars, many now managing their own teams. All these engineers were still heads-down, working their tails off, just as they had been doing since the first few months of the company. Too busy working, most were oblivious to the changes that success and growth had brought to the company.</p>
<p><strong>The Elves Leave Middle Earth – Sodas Are No Longer Free</strong></p>
<p>But the damage had been done. The most talented and senior engineers looked up from their desks and noticed the company was no longer the one they loved. It had changed. And not in a way they were happy with.</p>
<p>The best engineers quietly put the word out that they were available, and in less than month the best and the brightest began to <a href="http://www.lotr-elves.com/downloads/wallpapers/leaving-wp_1024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drift away</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What Happened?</strong></p>
<p>Humans seem to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">hard-wired for numbers</a> of social relationships. These same numbers also define boundaries in growing an organization – get bigger than a certain size and you need a different management system. The military has recognized this for thousands of years as they <a href="http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/oud/">built command and control hierarchies</a> that matched these numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Wake Up Call</strong></p>
<p><em>The sodas were just the wake-up call.</em></p>
<p>As startups scale into a company, founders and the board need to realize that the most important transitions are not about systems, buildings or hardware. It’s about the company’s most valuable asset – its employees.</p>
<p>Great companies do this well.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be careful of unintended consequences when you grow</li>
<li>Recognize the transition boundaries in company size</li>
<li>Preserve and manage an Innovation Culture</li>
</ul>
