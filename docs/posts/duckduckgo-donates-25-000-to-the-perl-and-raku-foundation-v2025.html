                <p>For the second consecutive year, The Perl and Raku Foundation (TPRF) is
overjoyed to announce a donation of USD 25,000 from DuckDuckGo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DuckDuckGo has demonstrated how Perl and its ecosystem can deliver power and
scale to drive the DuckDuckGo core systems, plug-in framework and Instant
Answers. The Foundation is grateful that DuckDuckGo recognises the importance
of Perl, and for their generous funding support for a second year through
their charitable donations programme.</p></blockquote>
<p>– Stuart J Mackintosh, President of The Perl and Raku Foundation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.perl.com/article/duckduckgo-donates-25-000-to-the-perl-and-raku-foundation/">Last year’s donation of USD 25,000 from
DuckDuckGo</a>
was instrumental in helping to fund the foundation’s Core Perl Maintenance Fund
and this year’s donation will help to fund more of the same crucial work that
keeps the Perl language moving forward.</p>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS">Paul “LeoNerd” Evans</a> is one of the
developers who gets regular funding from the Perl Core Maintenance Fund. Here
is a short list of just some of the many contributions which Paul has made to
core Perl as part of the maintenance fund work:</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/builtin">builtin</a> module (5.36), making
available many new useful language-level utilities that were previously
loaded from modules like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util">Scalar::Util</a></li>
<li>The complete <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/feature#The-&#39;class&#39;-feature">feature
‘class’</a> system
(5.38), adding proper object-orientation syntax and abilities</li>
<li>Lexical method support (5.42), adding <code>my method</code> and
the <code>$obj-&gt;&amp;method</code> invocation syntax for better object encapsulation</li>
<li>Stabilising some of the recent experiments - signatures (5.36),
try/catch (5.40), foreach on multiple vars (5.40)</li>
<li>Ability to use the //= and ||= operators in signatures (5.38),
performance improvements and named parameters (upcoming in next
release)</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/any">any</a> and
<a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/all">all</a> keywords (5.42)</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>We look forward to many more innovative contributions from Paul over the coming
year.</p>
<p>While TPRF never takes continued support for granted, when it does arrive, it
allows the foundation to plan for the future with much greater confidence.
Multi-year partnerships with our sponsors allow us to continue to prioritize
important work, knowing that we will have the runway that we need to fund the
work which helps to sustain the Perl Language and its associated communities.</p>
