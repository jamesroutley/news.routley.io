	<p>I had no choice but to start into an unfiltered, no-holds-barred rant about chatbot
			interfaces.</p></div></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately for the countless hapless people I&#39;ve talked to in the past few months, this was
	inexorable. Ever since ChatGPT exploded in popularity, my inner designer has been bursting
	at the seams.
</p>
<p>To save future acquaintances, I come to you today: because you&#39;ve volunteered to be here with me,
	can we please discuss a few reasons chatbots are not the future of interfaces.
</p>



<div><h2><div><svg width="0" height="0" fill="#E4EBF5" xfill="url(#Bubble-1)" style="shape-rendering: crispEdges; "><defs><filter id="blur" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="20"></feGaussianBlur></filter></defs><g><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="-5" y="-5" width="-15" height="-15" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#fff"></rect><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="25" y="25" width="-20" height="-12" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#96aec977"></rect><path style="transform: rotate(4.3485245140848825deg) scaleX(1); transform-origin: left center;" d="M 60 -10 q -12.5 18 -25 20 q 32.5 2 50 -20 h 0"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z" fill="#E9EFF5" stroke="#DFE9F5" stroke-width="1"></path></g></svg>

	<p>Text inputs have no affordances</p></div></h2>
	<p>When I go up the mountain to ask the ChatGPT oracle a question, I am met with a blank face. What
		does this oracle know? How should I ask my question? And when it responds, it is endlessly
		confident. I can&#39;t tell whether or not it actually understand my question or where this
		information came from.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Good tools make it clear how they should be used.</strong> And more importantly, how
		they should <i>not</i> be used. If we think about a good pair of gloves, it&#39;s immediately obvious
		how we should use them. They&#39;re hand-shaped! We put them on our hands. And the specific material
		tells us more: metal mesh gloves are for preventing physical harm, rubber gloves are for preventing
		chemical harm, and leather gloves are for looking cool on a motorcycle.
	</p>
	<p>Compare that to looking at a typical chat interface. The only clue we receive is that we should
		type characters into the textbox. The interface looks the same as a Google search box, a login
		form, and a credit card field.
	</p>

	<p>Of course, users can learn over time what prompts work well and which don&#39;t, but the burden to
		learn what works still lies with every single user. When it could instead be baked into the
		interface.
	</p></div>

	<p>Prompts are just a pile of context</p></div></h2>
	<p>LLMs make it too easy: we send them text and they send back text. The easy solution is to slap a
		shallow wrapper on top and call it a day. But pretty soon, we&#39;re going to get sick of typing all
		the time. If you think about it, <strong>everything you put in a prompt is a piece of context</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>Let&#39;s look at a simple example from <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome ChatGPT Prompts</a>:
	</p>
	<p><span><p>Who are you?</p>
	I want you to act as a dream interpreter</span>. <span><p>How should you respond?</p>
	I will give you descriptions of my dreams, and you will provide interpretations based on the
			symbols and themes present in the dream</span>. <span><p>How should you not respond?</p>
	Do not provide personal opinions or assumptions about the dreamer</span>. <span><p>What type of information do I want?</p>
	Provide only factual interpretations based on the information given</span>. <span><p>How should we start?</p>
	My first dream is about being chased by a giant spider</span>.
	</p>
	<p>How can we make it easier for users to provide all of this context?</p>
	<p>I&#39;m exploring an AI writing interface focused on making you a better writer. Mimicking a good
		writing tutor, it suggests improvements to your content. &#34;Try smoothing out this transition&#34; or
		&#34;add tangible examples here&#34;.
	</p>
	<p>But not all writers have the same goals! Not does all content have the same audience or tone. To
		better tailor the responses, I added a few controls for the user to specify their use case: <i>What type of writing is this, who are they, what should it feel like, who are their
			inspirations?</i></p>

	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/chatbots/ai-writing.png" alt="PenPal interface"/></p><p>Even if we&#39;re determined to stick with a chat interface, we can make things easier for users.
		Recently, my team shipped a prototype named <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/" target="_blank" rel="nooepener noreferrer">Copilot for Docs</a>, exploring ways to make technical documentation easier for developers to use.
	</p>
	<p>I think of it in two parts: <i>finding the most relevant information to a user&#39;s question</i>
		and
		<i>synthesizing an answer using that information</i>. When we synthesize an answer, we have a
		chance to tailor the response to the specific question-asker. As a rough first exploration with
		this idea, we added a few sliders:
	</p>

	<p><img src="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/chatbots/docs.png" alt="Copilot for docs interface"/></p><p>A new developer doesn&#39;t want the same responses as an experienced one, or someone who&#39;s new to
		the library, or someone who&#39;s in a rush. (Get ready for a future rant: static text is dead.) As
		the creators of <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs/" target="_blank" rel="nooepener noreferrer">Copilot for Docs</a>, we have a good idea of what the tool is best at and what kinds of information will lead to
		the most helpful responses. Let&#39;s take the time to bake as much information into the interface
		as possible instead of making users hack it into each of their questions.
	</p></div>

<div><h2></h2>
	<p>Natural language is great at rough direction: teleport me to the right neighborhood. But once
		ChatGPT has responded, how do I get it to take me to the right house?
	</p>
	<p>Say you ask ChatGPT to help improve your writing. Let&#39;s use this paragrap from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walden</a> as an example:
	</p>

	<div><svg width="0" height="0" fill="#E4EBF5" xfill="url(#Bubble-1)" style="shape-rendering: crispEdges; "><defs><filter id="blur" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="20"></feGaussianBlur></filter></defs><g><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="-5" y="-5" width="-15" height="-15" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#fff"></rect><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="25" y="25" width="-20" height="-12" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#96aec977"></rect><path style="transform: rotate(-1.244673033209227deg) scaleX(1); transform-origin: left center;" d="M 60 -10 q -12.5 18 -25 20 q 32.5 2 50 -20 h 0"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z" fill="#E9EFF5" stroke="#DFE9F5" stroke-width="1"></path></g></svg>

	<p>I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not solely on account of the
		railroad and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may not be good policy to divulge; it
		is a good port and a good foundation. No Neva marshes to be filled; though you must every where
		build on piles of your own driving. It is said that a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice
		in the Neva, would sweep St. Petersburg from the face of the earth.
	</p></div>

	<p>We ask ChatGPT to &#34;make this text better&#34;. It responds:</p>

	<div><svg width="0" height="0" fill="#E4EBF5" xfill="url(#Bubble-2)" style="shape-rendering: crispEdges; "><defs><filter id="blur" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="20"></feGaussianBlur></filter></defs><g><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="-5" y="-5" width="-15" height="-15" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#fff"></rect><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="25" y="25" width="-20" height="-12" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#96aec977"></rect><path style="transform: rotate(2.8152100943009795deg) scaleX(-1); transform-origin: 91% center;" d="M -60 -10 q -12.5 18 -25 20 q 32.5 2 50 -20 h 0"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z" fill="#E9EFF5" stroke="#DFE9F5" stroke-width="1"></path></g></svg>

	<p>I believe that Walden Pond presents a promising opportunity for business, not just because of
		its proximity to the railroad and the ice trade, but also due to other undisclosed advantages.
		It boasts excellent port facilities and a solid foundation, without the need to undertake
		extensive marsh filling like the Neva marshes. However, one should exercise caution in divulging
		all the unique benefits it offers. Furthermore, it is worth noting that St. Petersburg faces the
		risk of being devastated by a flood-tide, coupled with a westerly wind and ice in the Neva.
	</p></div>

	<p>Next, we ask it to &#34;rewrite this text with more active language&#34;. It responds:</p>

	<div><svg width="0" height="0" fill="#E4EBF5" xfill="url(#Bubble-2)" style="shape-rendering: crispEdges; "><defs><filter id="blur" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="20"></feGaussianBlur></filter></defs><g><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="-5" y="-5" width="-15" height="-15" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#fff"></rect><rect filter="url(#blur)" x="25" y="25" width="-20" height="-12" rx="60" ry="60" fill="#96aec977"></rect><path style="transform: rotate(4.4976515316968735deg) scaleX(-1); transform-origin: 91% center;" d="M -60 -10 q -12.5 18 -25 20 q 32.5 2 50 -20 h 0"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z"></path><path d="M 60 0 L -60 0 Q 0 0 0 60 L 0 -60 Q 0 0 -60 0 L 60 0 Q 0 0 0 -60 L 0 60 Q 0 0 60 0 Z" fill="#E9EFF5" stroke="#DFE9F5" stroke-width="1"></path></g></svg>

	<p>I envision Walden Pond as an exceptional business destination, not solely due to the railroad
		and ice trade, but for its undisclosed advantages. It boasts a superb port and a solid
		foundation, eliminating the need for extensive marsh filling like the Neva marshes. However, one
		must exercise discretion in revealing its unique benefits. Additionally, it&#39;s crucial to
		acknowledge the peril St. Petersburg faces: a flood-tide, a westerly wind, and ice in the Neva
		could obliterate the city from existence.
	</p></div>

	<p>Even with this fairly short example, it&#39;s laborious to figure out what concretely has changed.
		We&#39;re forced to scroll back and forth between responses, reading them line by line.
	</p>

	

	<p>As someone who is always thinking about how AI can help edit code or prose, I can&#39;t help but see
		the inability to have a &#34;working buffer&#34; as a complete non-starter.
	</p></div>

	<p>The implementation—evaluation loop</p></div></h2>
	<p>When a painter is working, there are two distinct actions: up close, smooshing paint around on
		the canvas and stepping back to evaluate and plan. These two modes (implementing and evaluating)
		are present in any craft: programming, writing, you name it.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Good tools let the user choose when to switch between implementation and evaluation.</strong> When I work with a chatbot, I&#39;m forced to frequently switch between the two modes. I ask a question
		(implement) and then I read a response (evaluate). There is no &#34;flow&#34; state if I&#39;m stopping every
		few seconds to read a response. The wait for a response is also a negative factor here. As a developer,
		when I have a lengthy compile loop, I have to wait long enough to lose the thread of what I was doing.
		The same is true for chatbots.
	</p></div>

<div><h2></h2>
	<p>There&#39;s an ongoing trend pushing towards continuous consumption of shorter, mind-melting
		content. Have a few minutes? Stare at people putting on makeup on TikTok. Winding down for
		sleep? A perfect time to doomscroll 180-character hot takes on Twitter. Most of the products
		I&#39;ve seen built with LLMs push us further down this road: why write words when an AI can write
		that article for you? Why think when AI can write your code?
	</p>
	<p>When I try these new products, I find myself transported into WALL-E. My brain turns off and I
		press the magic 🪄 button or mash the Tab key. And when I&#39;m eventually jolted out of my zombie
		mode, I don&#39;t even really like what&#39;s been created.
	</p>
	<p>The way I see it, there&#39;s a spectrum of <strong>how much human input is required for a task</strong>:
	</p>

	

	<p><span>When a task requires mostly human input, the human is in control.</span> They are the one making the key decisions and it&#39;s clear that they&#39;re ultimately responsible for
		the outcome.
	</p>
	<p><span>But once we offload the majority of the work to a machine, the human is no longer in control.</span>
		There&#39;s a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_man%27s_land" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No man&#39;s land</a> where the human is still required to make decisions, but they&#39;re not in control of the outcome.
		At the far end of the spectrum, users feel like machine operators: they&#39;re just pressing buttons
		and the machine is doing the work. There isn&#39;t much craft in operating a machine.
	</p>
	<p>Automating tasks is going to be amazing for rote, straightforward work that requires no human
		input. But if those tasks can only be partially automated, the interface is going to be crucial.
	</p>
	<p>I want to see more tools and fewer operated machines - we should be embracing our humanity
		instead of blindly improving efficiency. And that involves using our new AI technology in more
		deft ways than generating more content for humans to evaluate. I believe the real game changers
		are going to have very little to do with plain content generation. Let&#39;s build tools that offer
