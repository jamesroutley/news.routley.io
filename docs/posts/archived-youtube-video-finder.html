<summary>How do I use this?</summary>
<p>This is a website that will help you find a private or deleted YouTube video if you have the link.</p>
<p><b>If you don&#39;t have the link, this site won&#39;t help you.</b></p>
<p>Copy the link and paste it into the box above. Then click &#34;Search for Captures&#34;.
Some of the services this website queries are slow, so be patient.</p>
<p>
Once all the services have been queried, the results will appear. The results section
shows the name of each service, and whether the service has the video or not.
A link to the archived material will be provided if there is one. If there isn&#39;t,
there should be some extra text provided that sheds some light on how to retrieve it.
</p>
<p><b>Metadata</b> is information about the video. This includes the title and description.</p>
<p>Metadata can be useful for searching further. It&#39;s always possible there&#39;s a reupload
of the video that this website simply didn&#39;t find, and knowing the title and description
can be a big help in finding one.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need further help, contact me! I can be reached by email at
thetechrobo@proton.me, on IRC with the username TheTechRobo (I&#39;m on Libera.chat,
hackint, and OFTC), and on Discord with the username thetechrobo.
