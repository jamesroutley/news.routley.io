|                        KISS                           |
|                                                       |
| * An independent Linux(R) distribution with a focus   |
|   on simplicity and the concept of less is more.      |
|                                                       |
| * The distribution targets only the x86-64<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200528200318/https://k1ss.org/ports">**</a>          |
|   architecture and the English language.              |
|                                                       |
|                                                       |

+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                       |
|                      OVERVIEW                         |
|                                                       |
| * Uses a plain-text package system which is           |
|   language agnostic and parseable with basic UNIX     |
|   utilities.                                          |
|                                                       |
| * Uses a package manager written in less than 1000    |
|   lines of POSIX sh (excluding blank lines and        |
|   comments).                                          |
|                                                       |
| * Based on musl libc and the Linux kernel.            |
|                                                       |
| * Choice! The shell, coreutils, init, device manager, |
|   compiler, shell and * can be replaced. There&#39;s no   |
|   lock-in to specific software (excluding musl and    |
|   the kernel of course).                              |
|                                                       |
| * Every installation of the distribution contains the |
|   full sources (of the distribution) with git history |
|   attached.                                           |
|                                                       |
| * Is simple and small enough to be maintainable in    |
|   its entirety by a single person with little effort. |
|                                                       |
| * There is no &#34;backend&#34;. This distribution is merely  |
|   a few git repositories.                             |
|                                                       |
| * Has a &#34;Bus factor&#34; of N/A (0?) thanks to the above  |
|   points. Full power to the users and the community.  |
|                                                       |
| * All shell code is linted by and passes shellcheck   |
|   (including each and every repository package).      |
|                                                       |
| * All packages are compiled from source by the        |
|   package manager which automatically handles         |
|   dependencies, patches, etc.                         |
|                                                       |
| * Explicitly excludes the following software:         |
|                                                       |
|     dbus, systemd, polkit, gettext, intltool,         |
|     pulseaudio, pam, wayland, logind, ConsoleKit2     |
|     and all Desktop Environments.                     |
|                                                       |
|                                                       |
| * Rootless Xorg environment without any additional    |
|   software.                                           |
|                                                       |
| * Repository signing through git and gnupg,           |
|   based on signed commits and built into git itself.  |
|                                                       |
