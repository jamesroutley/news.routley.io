    <h1>Reanimate: Build declarative animations with SVG and Haskell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2><span>Reanimate</span> is:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>An animation library:</b>
          Animations are written as code.
        </li>
        <li><b>Written in Haskell:</b> High-level, purely functional, expressive.</li>
        <li><b>Based on SVG:</b> Powerful and introspective.</li>
        <li><b>Cross-platform:</b> Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Reanimate</b> aims to be a batteries-included way of creating
        animations and illustrations. It builds on two core ideas:
        (1) graphics (both still and animated) should be expressed
        as code, and (2) reactive programming is the best paradigm
        for animating data that changes over time. Reactive programming
        has been popularized by <b>D3.js</b> and <b>React.js</b>, and
        familiarity with either of those two libraries makes reanimate
        easier to understand.

        Installation instructions are available on github. If you run into
        any trouble, by far the quickest way to get help is to ask in our
        discord server.
