The acceleration topped the initial 4.9% reading and was better than the 5% forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones.</p><p>Primarily, the upward revision came from increases in nonresidential fixed investment, which includes structures, equipment and intellectual property. The category showed a rise of 1.3%, which still marked a sharp downward shift from previous quarters.</p><p>Government spending also helped boost the Q3 estimate, rising 5.5% for the July-through-September period.</p><p>However, consumer spending saw a downward revision, now rising just 3.6%, compared with 4% in the initial estimate.</p><p>There was some mixed news on the inflation front. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge the Federal Reserve follows closely, increased 2.8% for the period, a 0.1 percentage point downward revision. However, the chain-weighted price index increased 3.6%, a 0.1 percentage point upward move.</p><p>Corporate profits accelerated 4.3% during the period, up sharply from the 0.8% gain in the second quarter.</p><p><em><strong>Don&#39;t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:</strong></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/21/the-sp-500-is-starting-to-form-a-cup-and-handle-pattern-how-to-watch-for-the-potential-breakout-ahead.html"><em>The S&amp;P 500 is starting to form a &#39;cup and handle&#39; pattern.
