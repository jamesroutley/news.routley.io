<li>wow the passage of time!! it really is passing!!</li>
<li>i have <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/oluonline/weaknotes">beeminder</a> watching my RSS feed so i usually remember on friday that i haven&#39;t been posting. however since i&#39;ve posted two more <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> posts i have messed up my rhythm. I guess i could crank it up so it&#39;s expecting two posts a week but that feels ludicrous for some reason? I might do (and change the goal a little) but I&#39;m annoyed about it.</li>
<li>been reading <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/456705/meditations-for-mortals-by-burkeman-oliver/9781847927613">meditations for mortals</a> and am coming up to the final week! My main takeaway has been &#34;don&#39;t struggle, bro&#34; and <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/dailyish">do things dailyish</a>.</li>
<li>enjoying thinking about planning things in terms of domains cos of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/RachaelStephen">Rachael Stephen&#39;s</a> constellation system.</li>
<li>enjoyed messing around with fonts and things for this site, it is no longer unreadable swathes of monospaced font. I think my next thing is to set up some simple search and a light mode. sorry to the light mode fans for neglecting you.</li>
<li>constantly thinking about handbuilding a website despite knowing that anything where I can configure it too much is a danger zone for me lol. I used to love Obsidian, a note-taking app, until I realised I was fiddling with it more than I ever actually wrote anything. I do still use it for my <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes site</a>, but it&#39;s too much of a time suck for anything else.</li>
<li>this a short one, i think i&#39;m just sticking to habits (and writing and writing and writing) to hopefully get some videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@oluOnline">on Youtube</a> and <a href="https://2024.ffconf.org/">a talk</a> finished.</li>
<li>wait i forgot to talk about the talk before now?</li>
<li>i&#39;m really excited for the talk! please come along.</li>
<li>my word for the quarter is &#34;persist&#34; which felt less grim when i wrote it down, but yes, i&#39;m persisting.</li>
