      <p>My name is D. Sculley.  I lead several teams at Google in
      Cambridge doing research in various aspects of machine learning.
      I&#39;m involved in this course because many of our current projects involve
      the use of machine learning for design or fabrication problems of
      one form or another, including in the biology space and the chemistry
      space.  I&#39;m interested in learning more about other forms of fabrication
      and seeing if there are interesting cross-domain opportunities to
      think about.

        Here is my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=l_O64B8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">
            Google Scholar page</a>, if you&#39;re interested in ML papers.
      </p>
      <p>As background, I started working in ML in about 2003.  Before that,
      I spent several years in education working as a teacher, and before that
      I was a V.E.S. (&#34;art&#34;) major in undergrad.</p>
      <p>I&#39;ll be working on class projects each week, and am planning on making
      plenty of mistakes. Always happy to talk about machine learning if that&#39;s of interest.</p>
