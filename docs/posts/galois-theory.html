<h3>Galois Theory</h3>

<p>I’ve just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07499">arXived</a> my notes for
Edinburgh’s undergraduate Galois theory course, which I taught from 2021 to
2023.</p>

<p>I first shared the notes on my website some time ago. But it took me a
while to arXiv them, because I wanted to simultaneously make public most
of the other course materials. I now have, which means <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/galois">the following are
now available to all</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Notes forming a complete, self-contained account of the part of Galois
theory that we covered.</p></li>
<li><p>About 40 short explanatory videos.</p></li>
<li><p>A large collection of problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly 500 multiple choice questions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a little bemused by the popularity of the Galois theory notes. I’ve
made quite a few sets of course notes public before, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/fa/fa_notes.pdf">Fourier analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/topology/topology_notes.pdf">General topology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/aa/aa.pdf">Linear algebra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/bct">Category theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But the Galois theory notes seem to have caught on in a way that none of
the others have (except category theory — but that one, I made into a
book). </p>

<p>It’s true that I probably took a bit of extra care on them: I first taught
the course during full Covid lockdown, and I felt the students would
need more guidance than usual, given that they were deprived of all
opportunities for face-to-face interaction. But I wonder whether the real
reason is that the Galois theory notes simply <em>look</em> nicer, with colour and
little icons and so on. </p>

<p>In any case, I hope the <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/galois">notes, videos and
questions</a> bring people joy.</p>
