<hr/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All, </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>I’m confident that I speak for all of us when I say that the still unfolding war in Ukraine is heartbreaking. As a company, we stand in unity with everyone affected by the violence and condemn the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine. We add our voices to those calling for peace and will continue to work to enable the safety of our impacted associates and their families in any way we can. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The safety, security, and well-being of our associates remain our top priority. The cross-functional team we established several weeks ago has connected directly with every Red Hatter in Ukraine and Russia and will continue to ensure they have the support and resources they need. We have helped Red Hatters in Ukraine and their families (including spouses, children and family members) move safely to nearby countries and continue to help those who remain in the country in any way possible. In the last few days alone, Red Hat-organized buses have safely transported several dozen of our Ukrainian associates’ family members across the border to Poland. We are also supporting our associates in Russia. And for any Red Hatter that needs them, no matter where you are located, we have </span>additional well-being resources available.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The ongoing support Red Hat is providing is only one part of our response. Red Hatters worldwide have been helping their colleagues in so many ways—big, small and heroic—over the last few days and weeks. I’ve heard remarkable anecdotes about these actions, including an associate in Poland who drove several hours each direction to pick up a fellow associate’s wife and child at the Ukraine border and has opened his own home to them. This spirit of unity and caring for one another doesn’t surprise me — I’ve seen it at Red Hat many times over. It’s what makes Red Hatters so special and what makes me proud every day. Thank you all.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>As a reminder, the Red Hat Cares team has curated a </span>list of suggested charities for Red Hatters who would like to make a donation. All of the organizations on this list are now also available as charitable donation options to Red Hatters in Reward Zone, and Red Hat offers a matching gifts program for full-time associates in many countries. And, as we shared previously, Red Hat Cares is making additional contributions to charities that support the victims in Ukraine.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>While relevant sanctions must guide many of our actions, we’ve taken additional measures as a company. Effective immediately, Red Hat is discontinuing sales and services in Russia and Belarus (for both organizations located in or headquartered in Russia or Belarus). This includes discontinuing partner relationships with organizations based in or headquartered in Russia or Belarus. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The situation continues to evolve rapidly. Thank you for showing compassion and concern for your colleagues, and for your patience and understanding as we work through this together. We’ve created </span>a space on The Source with FAQs, ways you can help, well-being resources, and more, so please stay posted there.</p>
