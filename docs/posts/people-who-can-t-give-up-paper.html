<p>This is an attempt to collect all the things I’ve learned, worked on, and experienced during my time at RC.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introductions and onboarding</li>
<li>Met a lot of passionate, kind, and wonderful people. Everyone had exciting backgrounds and projects they were going to work on.</li>
<li>As expected, there were many Rustaceans and wannabes.</li>
<li>Russell Webb’s Neural Network with Rust caught my eye and I will spend some time understanding it and learning Rust and NN in the process.</li>
<li>For now, I have decided to spend my first week at RC meeting people, exploring different arenas, getting started with pair programming, and going with the flow.</li>
<li>I have to also make a more concrete plan for learning Rust and diving into Databases.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to attending the Rust, System Design, and DDIA study groups.</li>
<li>Overall, this was a great start and I have high hopes for the coming weeks. Let’s go!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paired with Anatol Liu as a part of pair programming workshop. We created a simple cmd line mastermind game and a solver in Python.</li>
<li>A few people reached out to me from my blog which kind of made my day</li>
<li>Watched Zero to Hero first video by Karpathy, which explained backpropagation clearly. His teaching is truly amazing (something to learn from)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coffee chats with few recursers. Discussed Databases, Distributed Systems, Rust, the projects they are working on and advice for me</li>
<li>Started working on micrograd using Rust - <a href="https://github.com/psykomal/micrograd-rs">https://github.com/psykomal/micrograd-rs</a></li>
<li>At this point in time I am just focused on completing as many small projects in Rust to have the concepts sync in quickly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paired with Russ on his Neural Network project in Rust. Although some of the ML stuff went over my head, I got a view into coding with Rust</li>
<li>Attended the DDIA study group and discussed Ch 3: Storage and Retrieval. There was an interesting discussion on modeling SQL on top of key-value store. I realized why study groups work better sync in the concepts in the brain</li>
<li>The presentation event was amazing with some truly out-of-the-world content. The moldable dev concept was new to me. There was this out-of-the-world alien presentation to me which was truly mind-blowing - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrU5jPUYO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrU5jPUYO4</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-5">Day 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pair progrogrammed on a Columnar DB with Rust. I realized the struggle Rust puts you in, on your early days.</li>
<li>Cleared some of my confusion on Rust’s smart pointers - Box, Rc, RefCell</li>
<li>Reanalyzed my priorities in the volitional muscles workshop and became a bit more self-aware on my FOMO toward ML. That doesn’t mean I am putting it off. It will be another tool in my toolbox and I do plan to open up the layers of abstraction some other time. For now, all focus is on Databases.</li>
</ul>
