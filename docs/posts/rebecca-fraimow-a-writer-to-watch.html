<p><a href="https://rebeccafraimow.com/published-works/">Rebecca Fraimow</a> is a scifi/fantasy author whose work I appreciate.</p><p>I&#39;m not alone. In <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-Hugos-Nominations-Report.pdf">the Hugo Award nominations for Best Short Story published in 2020</a>, Fraimow&#39;s &#34;This Is New Gehesran Calling&#34; was ranked 14th. That may not seem like a big deal, but note that this was the highest-ranked story that was not available to read for free online in a web magazine -- it was only available in <a href="http://www.generalist.org.uk/iona/consolation-songs/">the anthology <i>Consolation Songs</i></a>. Given how much easier it is for a free online read to gain buzz and get read via recommendations, this is reasonably noteworthy.</p><p>Want a time-dilation-type story of merchant skills, personal connection, and change? <a href="http://thefantasistmag.com/suradanna-and-the-sea/">“Suradanna and the Sea”</a>. Want Jewish humor and dealings with the supernatural? Read or listen to the Yudah Cohen stories. And for diaspora memories and reconnections and a shoestring media project, &#34;This Is New Gehesran Calling&#34; is itself worth the price of the anthology. Many of her stories foreground queer characters and relationships. She often portrays characters reckoning with a realistically lived-in world, reacting to the consequences of their own and others&#39; actions. Fraimow is an archivist at her day job, which comes through in particular in the intertextual plots of &#34;Romeo, Revisited&#34; and in &#34;This Is New Gehesran Calling.&#34; She gently attends to how we preserve, revisit, and make meaning from art and historical records.</p><p>She&#39;s been publishing short fiction for a decade and I look forward to what she&#39;ll write in the next decade.</p>
