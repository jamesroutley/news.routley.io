        <h2 id="are-you-sure-debugging-with-git">Are you sure? Debugging with Git?</h2>

<p>What are the tools that comes on your mind when someone say “debug”? Let me
guess:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a memory leak detector (e.g. Valgrind);</li>
  <li>a profiler (e.g. GNU gprof);</li>
  <li>a function that stops your program and gives you a REPL (e.g. Python’s breakpoint
and Ruby’s byebug);</li>
  <li>something that we call a “debugger” (like GDB, or something
similar embedded on the IDEs);</li>
  <li>or even our old friend, the print function.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in this text I’ll try to convince you to add Git to your debug toolbelt.</p>

<p>When you are versioning some code with Git, the repository is a precious source
of information. A lot of people only think of it as the command that they use to
<code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code> and finally <code>git push</code> their work the same way as they
upload a file to Google Drive or post a photo on Instagram. However, as Git
keeps the whole history of commits since the oldest one, it is perhaps the tool
that knows the most of the code. Every version of every file is stored in the
repository (in this text I’m referring the local repository as “repository”, not
the GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc repository), and it’s a work of archaeology
to find useful information in there.</p>

<p>So, I’ll show here some useful concepts and tools to extract everything you
need from there!</p>

<h2 id="git-basics-recap">Git basics recap</h2>

<p>Before we go on, let’s first recap the Git basics.</p>

<p><strong>Commits</strong> are the “versions” of a repository. They are <strong>snapshots</strong>, not
<strong>deltas</strong>, that means that a commit doesn’t know what has changed. Instead, a
commit <strong>stores the content of every file</strong>. When you run <code>git show</code>, you are
not showing the content of a commit, you are showing a patch, the change in
relation to its parent. That storage, however, is done in a clever way in
order to save space.</p>

<p><strong>Commits</strong> have references to their parent commits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one parent in a normal commit;</li>
  <li>two parents in a merge commit;</li>
  <li>two or more parents in a octopus merge commit;</li>
  <li>no parents if it’s a initial commit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commits also stores <strong>when</strong> and <strong>who</strong> created them!</p>

<p><strong>Branches</strong> are only references to commits. In fact, a branch is only a file
containing a hash of a commit.</p>

<p>The <strong>commit history</strong> is not a linear timeline! Actually, it is a DAG, a
directed acyclic graph, in other words, it is set of different timelines that
may have a common past between them (a fork point) and that may have a state
where both timelines join (a merge commit), but without any loops!</p>

<p>The <strong>staging area</strong>, formerly called cache (still used sometimes…) and
internally called <strong>index</strong> is the place where a commit is prepared (in other
words, the place where you send you file when you <code>git add</code> it). The content of
the staging area is the content of your last commit with the changes that you
made and added using <code>git add</code> (the ones that are shown in green in <code>git
status</code>).</p>

<p>The <strong>working directory</strong> is the directory where you files are in you disk. From
the perspective of view of who is writing and running code, this may look as the
main area of Git (compared to the commit history and the staging area). However,
from the perspective of view of Git, this is the <strong>least important</strong>, as
everything here can be modified, deleted, created and Git won’t track it,
unless, of course, you explicitly tell Git to do that (using <code>git add</code>, for
example).</p>

<p>If you didn’t know something from this section, I strongly recommend you to read
the section <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F">1.3 from the Pro Git book</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pathspec-and-git-ls-files">Pathspec and <code>git ls-files</code></h2>

<p>So, let’s go to our first concept here: the <strong>pathspec</strong> (as a non-native
English speaker, I struggle to say that word…). A <strong>Pathspec</strong> is a string
that can be passed as argument to several Git commands to specify files.</p>

<p>A nice way to see the pathspecs in action is using <code>git ls-files</code>. That command
lists all the files in the staging area, but if you pass a pathspec as an
argument for it, it will list all the files in the staging area that matches the
pathspec.</p>

<p>The most trivial pathspec is the path of a file. If you have a file called
<code>README.md</code>, then <code>README.md</code> will be a pathspec that represent it, and if it is
inside a directory called <code>src</code>, a pathspec for it is <code>src/README.md</code>. Note
that, by default, pathspecs are relative to the current directory.</p>

<h3><code>*</code></h3>

<p>The first superpower of the pathspec that I’ll show you is <code>*</code>. That character
matches any characters. For example, this command lists <strong>every file that ends
in .c in the staging area</strong> that are in the <strong>current directory</strong> or in its
<strong>subdirectories</strong>, recursively:</p>



<p>You may be thinking: “nothing new here, it is just a shell star
expansion”. Well, no. Note that <code>&#39;*.c&#39;</code> is between quotation marks, this means
that it’s a string, and the shell is not expanding it. Instead, Git is expanding
it.</p>

<p>What’s the difference? Remember that I said “in the current directory or in its
subdirectories”? This is the difference between the pathspec <code>*</code> and the shell
<code>*</code>: in this situation, the shell <code>*</code> will only match files in the current
directory, while the pathspec <code>*</code> will match files that are in the current
directory or in a subdirectory of it. So, if we run:</p>



<p>the shell will replace <code>*.c</code> by all the files that end in <code>.c</code> in the current
directory, so <code>git ls-files</code> will only list them.</p>

<h3 id="--magic-words"><code>:</code> + magic words</h3>

<p><code>:</code> is a special character in pathspecs, that is followed by a magic word. I’m
not going to deep dive into it, but there are two cases of it that I find very
useful.</p>

<p>The first one is <code>:/</code>. This means the root of the repository. So, if you are in
a subdirectory and want to match something by its absolute path (that is,
relative to the repository root), you need to use <code>:/</code>. For example, <code>:/*.c</code>
will match <strong>all the files that end in .c</strong> in the repository, no matter where
they are located.</p>

<p>The second one is <code>:!</code>. If we put a <code>:!</code> in the beginning of a pathspec, then
the pathspec will match all the files that doesn’t match the rest pathspec. For
example:</p>



<p>That command will list all files in the staging area that <strong>don’t end in .c</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="more-about-pathspecs-and-git-ls-files">More about pathspecs and git ls-files</h3>

<p>Pathspecs are really useful to select files to pass as arguments to Git. You can
learn more about them on the Git glossary (<code>man gitglossary</code>), searching by
“pathspec”.</p>

<p><code>git ls-files</code>, that I used as an example for pathspecs, is also a good tool to
find files in the repository. It can replace the command <code>find</code>, as it has a
cleaner syntax than the latter.</p>

<h2 id="git-grep">Git Grep</h2>

<p><code>git grep</code>, as the name says, is a <code>grep</code> powered by Git.</p>

<p>So, what does it mean? Well, remember that I said the Git is perhaps the tool
that knows the most about your code? <code>git grep</code> takes advantage of it to make a
better <code>grep</code>!</p>

<p>The syntax of <code>git grep</code> is, basically, the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git <span>grep</span> <span>[</span>&lt;flags&gt;] <span>[</span>&lt;pattern&gt;] <span>[</span>&lt;commit&gt;] <span>--</span> <span>[</span>&lt;pathspec&gt;]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use several flags of <code>grep</code> in <code>git grep</code>, for example, <code>-E</code>, <code>-P</code> or
<code>-i</code>. The pathspec and the commit are optional. The <code>--</code> is optional in most of
the cases, however, it is recommended to use it to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>If you provide a commit, than Git Grep will search for the pattern on that
commit. However, Git grep won’t search on other commits.</p>

<p>If you don’t provide the pathspec, it will search for a pattern on all files in
the current directory or its subdirectories. It is <strong>really faster</strong> than GNU
Grep or BSD Grep. You can see that in the following image, I’m searching
<code>#include</code> on the Git source code using BSD Grep, GNU Grep and Git Grep:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/grep-time.png"/>
    <figcaption>Git grep vs BSD grep and GNU grep, on a Macbook Air M1</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Nice, but what more Git grep can do? Well, take a look at the flags <code>--heading</code>
and <code>--break</code>. <code>--heading</code> groups the output by the file where each line is, and
<code>--break</code> only inserts a line break between the groups. This is very useful for
searching, for example, the files that call a function or that use a constant.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/grep-heading.png"/>
    <figcaption>Git grep with <code>--heading</code> and <code>--break</code>, searching for <code>looks_like</code> on every C file.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>A very cool feature of Git Grep is the flag <code>-W</code> (or <code>--show-function</code>). When
using it, Git grep will not only show the line that contains what you are
searching, but it will also show the <strong>entire function</strong> where it is
located. So, let’s check the same command the I’ve shown in the last picture,
however, adding the flag <code>-W</code> ( <code>git grep --heading --break -W &#39;looks_like&#39; --
&#39;*.c&#39;</code>):</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/grep-w.png"/>
    <figcaption>Git grep with <code>-W</code> showing the entire function that contains <code>looks_like</code></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Git Grep is an amazing tool to find code. Ok, but you may be thinking “nice, but
I can do something like that using the code navigation of my IDE, jumping to
definitions and usages”. That is true for several cases. However, Git Grep is
still very useful when you want to search only in <strong>certain files</strong> (using the
pathspec as a restriction), when you want to search for a generic <strong>regex</strong>
instead of a name of variable or function, when you want to search in <strong>another
commit</strong> or when you just don’t want to open an IDE and want to search
<strong>directly from the terminal</strong>. It’s not a tool that is replacing another, but a
tool to complement the other.</p>

<h2 id="git-blame">Git Blame</h2>

<p>If you ever used <code>git blame</code>, there’s a good chance that you are expecting me to
say something about it and how it is wonderful. If it is the case, please, don’t
skip this section because I have something very important to tell you.</p>

<p>If it’s not the case and you never heard or never used <code>git blame</code>, it is a tool
that shows for every line who was the <strong>last person</strong> that <strong>changed that line</strong>, the
<strong>commit</strong> where it was done, and the <strong>timestamp</strong> of it. Look at the following
picture. I’m running <code>git blame Main.hs</code>, where <code>Main.hs</code> is a file that I wrote:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/git-blame.png"/>
    <figcaption>Git blame. The first column show the first characters of the
  hash of the last commit that changed the line, Main.hs is the file, Lucas
  Oshiro (also known as me) is the last person that changed those lines. You can
  also see the timestamp of the last change.
  </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>That’s cool, so, does this show evidences so I can curse the code of my
colleague? Well, in most of cases, yes, however, remember: <code>git blame</code> shows
only who made <strong>the last change</strong>. Maybe that person only changed the name of a
variable, applied a codestyle change, moved a function declaration to another
file or many other things that the change was almost irrelevant to the code
behavior. Many times the person doesn’t even know what the code does (for
example, that person only ran a tool that formats code, without even reading
it).</p>

<p>This also applies to the other information: the <strong>timestamp</strong> that is shown is only
the last time that the line was <strong>changed</strong>, and it doesn’t tell us when it was
<strong>created</strong>. Same for the <strong>commit</strong>: the commit that is shown is the last
commit that changed something on that line, not that last commit that changed
something <strong>useful</strong> or the commit that introduced that line.</p>

<p>Git Blame (and tools based on it, like Annotate on JetBrains IDEs, magit-blame
on Emacs or GitLens on VSCode) is of course very useful, however, it is not the
source of the truth. If you need to find something more than know about the last
change of a line, then you’ll need something more powerful…</p>



<p><code>git log</code> is one of the most famous commands of Git. It is the command that you
run to look the <strong>commit history</strong>, nothing new here. However, it has some lesser
known features that I consider the next step when Git Blame is not enough for
your needs.</p>

<h3 id="passing-a-pathspec-as-an-argument-to-git-log">Passing a pathspec as an argument to Git log</h3>

<p>You can <strong>restrict</strong> the <code>git log</code> output by passing a pathspec as the last
argument, like this: <code>git log -- &lt;pathspec&gt;</code>. Again, the <code>--</code> can be omitted in
most of the cases, however, it is good practice to keep it to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>When you do that, the output will contain only the commits that <strong>introduced a
change</strong> to the files that match the pathspec in relation to their parents
commits. Look at this example:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/git-log-path.png"/>
    <figcaption>Commit history of a file.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>If you want to know when something was introduced, you can inspect those
commits. When you find it, you will know <strong>who</strong> and <strong>when</strong> introduced the
commit. If the commit message is well-written and if the change was atomic, you
can even know <strong>why</strong> the commit was created (and why its code exists). If you
are using GitHub, you can also copy the hash of that commit and search the PR
that contained it, and its even more information, given that you can read the
discussion and the code review!</p>

<p>This feature of Git Log saved my life several times. If I found a piece of code
that was hard to understand its purpose, instead of only trying to read it, I
used Git Log to find the commit that introduced and check what the person that
wrote it was trying to do, what was the context of its creation, what was the
problem it was aiming to solve, and so on. Just try it!</p>

<h3 id="the--p-flag">The -p flag</h3>

<p>So, it may be boring to inspect every commit manually. You can use <code>-p</code> to show
the patch of every commit. In other words, it is like running <code>git show</code> for
every commit in the log.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/git-log-p.png"/>
    <figcaption>The same as the last picture, but using the -p flag</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<h3 id="the--s-flag">The <code>-S</code> flag</h3>

<p>The <code>-S</code> flag is a hidden gem in Git log. With it, you can see all the commits
that increased or decreased the number of occurrences of a string. This works
almost as Git Blame killer for me: even if someone moved a piece of code to
another place or another file, <code>git log -S</code> will find the introduction of it.</p>

<p>In the following picture, I’m using <code>git log -S</code> to find the first introduction
of a string contained in the file <code>hardcoded_values.h</code> (as you can see in the
output of the first <code>git grep</code>). Then, note that the introduction of that string
wasn’t in that file (as you can see in the output of the second <code>git
grep</code>). Firstly, it was part of <code>state_machine.c</code>, then it was moved into the
other file. This solves the problem of Git Blame blaming the person that moved
the line, instead of the one that created it.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/git-log-s.png"/>
    <figcaption>Sorry, Git Blame...</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>You can also use <code>-G</code> instead of <code>-S</code>. This allows you to use a regular
expression instead of string.</p>

<h2 id="git-bisect">Git Bisect</h2>

<p><code>git blame</code> tell us the last change of a line and <code>git log -S</code> tell us when a
when string was introduced or removed. However, they only work over text. For
many cases this is enough, however, sometimes you don’t want to look for changes
in a text, but you want to look for changes in the behavior of the program, like
bugs or anything that is not working as expected.</p>

<p>In those cases, <code>git blame</code> or <code>git log -S</code> won’t be enough, because you don’t
know what code caused that change of behavior, and you don’t know exactly
what to search. In complex projects, maybe that change is in a place that you
would never expect, for example, a class or function that you thought it wasn’t
related to the one that is broken.</p>

<p>And how can Git can help us to find that change?</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a honour to present you my favorite Git command:
<strong>Git Bisect</strong>! It allows us to <strong>find the commit that broke
something</strong>. Given a “good” commit (a commit that is not broken, created before
the introduction of the bug), and a “bad” commit (a commit that certainly is
broken), Git will perform a <strong>binary search</strong> until the broken commit is found.</p>

<p>After bisecting, you can take a look at the commit that created the bug, and
find all the information that we discussed previously.</p>

<p>Git Bisect can be used in two ways: a <strong>manual</strong> one, where it guides you until
you find the commit that introduced the bug, and an <strong>automatic</strong> one, where Git
find that commit for you.</p>

<h3 id="a-practical-exercise">A practical exercise</h3>

<p>I’ll demonstrate Git Bisect using this repository:
<a href="https://github.com/lucasoshiro/bisect_demo">https://github.com/lucasoshiro/bisect_demo</a>.
It is very simple, it contains only one Python script, with a really weird and
hard to understand code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span>
<span>from</span> <span>sys</span> <span>import</span> <span>argv</span>
<span>from</span> <span>math</span> <span>import</span> <span>log</span>

        <span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>to_bytes</span><span>((</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>ops</span><span>,</span> <span>16</span><span>))</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>//</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>&#39;big&#39;</span><span>).</span><span>decode</span><span>())</span>


<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span>:</span>
    <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>:])</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And what does it do? Well, it takes two numbers as arguments, and it performs
some operations using them:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/calc-py.png"/>
    <figcaption><code>calc.py</code> running</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>This works for mostly any numbers, except if the second one is 0. As one
operation is division and we’re not handling division by zero error, this input
breaks the script:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/div-zero.png"/>
    <figcaption>Oh no</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>As you can see, we know where the code is breaking, however, we can’t see a
division in there. If we want to fix this code, we need to find what causes that
division, and it’s not clear here.</p>

<p>Of course we can use <code>git log</code> here and try to find a commit that may inserted
the bug. However, even running <code>git log -p -- calc.py</code> can’t help us, look:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/bisect-log.png"/>
    <figcaption>Nothing useful here. The commit messages says nothing about the
  code (they are name of fruits in Portuguese...) and the only change between
  one commit and another is a hex value.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Git Bisect to the rescue!</p>

<h3 id="running-git-bisect-manually">Running Git Bisect manually</h3>

<p>The first thing that you need to do is to start to bisect. You do this by running
<code>git bisect start</code>. If you run <code>git status</code>, it will tell you that you are
bisecting. Some shells that shows Git info on the prompt also shows tells you
that you are bisecting. If you are done with bisecting, then you should run <code>git
bisect reset</code> to end the bisection.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/bisect-status.png"/>
    <figcaption>Bisect start</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>I said that in order to bisect you need a “bad commit” and a “good commit”. In
this case, we know that the last commit is a bad one, as it breaks when
providing 0 as the second parameter.</p>

<p>In a real scenario, you’ll probably would know what is a “good commit”, it is
any commit that you know that contains a code that works, for example, a commit
of the last release that is not broken. In this case, I’m telling you that the
initial commit is not buggy. Just checkout to it and try to run <code>calc.py</code>
passing 0 as the second argument:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/initial-commit.png"/>
    <figcaption>It does nothing, however, at least it is not diving by zero</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>So, now we know the bad and the good commit, our current situation is that (the first
one is the first commit):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>8959689 Início     &lt;- GOOD!
f1a445e banana
e516236 goiaba
0acc414 Laranja
18c911e Toranja
0f3d5c7 Limão
7e27a60 Framboesa
f16e5e7 Morango
c3eb7db Carambola  &lt;- BAD!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we need to tell Git Bisect about it. We run <code>git bisect good 8959689</code> to
tell it that the initial commit is the good one. As the current commit is a bad
one, we can just run <code>git bisect bad</code> to tell it, but you could also run <code>git
bisect bad c3eb7db</code> or any other commit that you know that is bad.</p>

<p>After running that, Git Bisect will automatically checkout to the commit in the
middle of the history between the good and the bad commits, that is, <code>18c911e</code>
(<code>Toranja</code>). Now, we run <code>./calc.py &lt;something&gt; 0</code> to find if this commit is a
good or a bad one.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/bisect-first.png"/>
    <figcaption>Turns out that this commit is a bad one...</figcaption>

<p>Ok, now our situation is that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>8959689 Início     &lt;- GOOD!
f1a445e banana
e516236 goiaba
0acc414 Laranja
18c911e Toranja    &lt;- BAD!
0f3d5c7 Limão
7e27a60 Framboesa
f16e5e7 Morango
c3eb7db Carambola  &lt;- BAD!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we need tell Git Bisect that this commit is a bad one. So, we run
<code>git bisect bad</code>. As you might suspect, now Git Bisect will checkout to the
commit in the middle between <code>8959689</code> (<code>Início</code>) and <code>18c911e</code>
(<code>Toranja</code>). That commit is <code>e516236</code> (<code>goiaba</code>).</p>

<p>Ok, now we do the same thing: run <code>./calc.py &lt;something&gt; 0</code>, check whether it
breaks or not, if so run <code>git bisect bad</code>, otherwise run <code>git bisect good</code>, until it
ends the binary search and finds the buggy commit. We’re doing it here:</p>

    <figcaption>Running <code> git bisect bad</code> and <code>git bisect
  good</code> until the end of the binary search</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>Then we found the commit that introduced the bug: <code>0acc414</code> (<code>Laranja</code>). Now you
exit bisecting with <code>git bisect reset</code>, then it will checkout to the same commit
where you were when you ran <code>git bisect start</code>. If you are curious about why
that change breaks the code, here’s a clue: 0x2F is the hex value of the ASCII
number for <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>Git Bisect is cool, but running it manually like this (checking if the commit is
a good or a bad one and running <code>git bisect bad</code> or <code>git bisect good</code>) can be
very boring. Depending on the situation, you can do that automatically using
<code>git bisect run</code>!</p>

<h3 id="running-git-bisect-automatically">Running Git Bisect automatically</h3>

<p>If there is a <strong>command that can tell you if the commit is good or bad</strong>, then
Git Bisect can perform the binary search automatically! That command can be
anything, like a shellscript, a Python script, an executable, a test, and so
on. The only requirement about it is its status code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the commit is good, then the command should return 0;</li>
  <li>If the commit is bad, then the command should return anything between 1 and
127, inclusive, except 125;</li>
  <li>If it is not possible to tell if this commit is good or bad, then it need to
be ignored, and the command should return 125.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example, we are checking if the code raises an exception. By default,
when a code exits with an exception in Python, its status code is 1, and it is 0
when everything is ok. Then, just running <code>./calc.py &lt;someting&gt; 0</code> is enough, as it
will return 0 when it is ok and 1 when the bug happens. However, keep in mind
that is not always the case, and maybe you’ll need to write a test script.</p>

<p>We start the bisect just like before:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git bisect start
git bisect good &lt;<span>hash </span>of the good commit&gt;
git bisect bad
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, as we want to do perform the bisection automatically using as criterion
<code>./calc.py 14 0</code>, we run <code>git bisect run ./calc.py 14 0</code>. It works like magic:</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://lucasoshiro.github.io/assets/images/posts/2023-02-13-git-debug/bisect-run.png"/>
    <figcaption>Yes, my friends: this is command that finds the bug for you!</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>After this, you also need to run <code>git bisect reset</code> to end bisection. That’s it. Isn’t it cool?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These commands helped a lot when I needed to navigate on large codebases and
find the causes of a bug. But not only that, they can help you to understand the
code, as they are, essentially, search tools. Simple and flexible, but
incredibly powerful.</p>
