The affected employees were data scientists, it said.</p><p><span></span><span><p>The document also noted that some of the affected employees had been transferred from the Bard team to the Assistant team last Friday and received an invite to a meeting about their role just hours later.</p><p>The document is compiled by employees and collates information posted internally and externally about job cuts.</p><p>&#34;1 of the affected is on Maternity leave, and another has cancer,&#34; the document noted.</p><p>Affected employees have 60 days to find a new role within the company or they will have to leave.</p><p>&#34;In order to optimize our team structures around our highest priorities, we&#39;ve reorganized our team to best support our strategic business objectives,&#34; a Google spokesperson told Insider in a statement.</p><p>Google previously announced its plans to overhaul its Assistant with features powered by generative AI, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-assistant-with-bard-new-app-chatbot-ai-voice-text-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">some of which have begun rolling out</a>. In August, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/31/google-assistant-artificial-intelligence-news" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">the company said</a> it would eliminate &#34;a small number&#34; of roles as part of the renewed focus. It&#39;s unclear if these recent cuts are related to that announcement.</p><p>Google began the year by laying off 12,000 employees and has since been making smaller strategic cuts across the company in areas <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-job-cuts-targeted-director-decapitations-report-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">such as Google News</a> and its health division Verily.</p><p><em>Are you a Google employee with more to share?
