  exhibits patterns of structure or interconnectedness which are not necessarily
  very regular and which may change over time. Project Xanadu, the informal
  group that became <a href="http://aus.xanadu.com/people.html#XOC" id="2b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="2b4a">XOC</span></a>, has developed a family of data structures which in
  combination appear to meet the requirements of such a system. A working
  prototype exists implementing the rudiments of the design.
  Since its computational complexity and storage overhead are
  essentially logarithmic with the volume of stored information,
  it should be able to efficiently handle very
  large amounts of material.</p>

</h2>
  <p id="3b"><a href="#3b">3b</a>The Xanadu Hypertext System manages the storage, retrieval and
  manipulation of character strings and <em id="3b1">orgls</em>.
  <span id="termdef-orgl">An <span id="3b2a">orgl</span> is a structure which
  represents the organization of a collection of
  <span id="termdef-V-spaces"><span id="termdef-V-spaces">address spaces
  (called <em id="3b2b1a">virtual spaces</em> or <span id="3b2b1b">V-spaces</span> for short)</span>,
  each containing an editable stream of <em id="3b2b2">atoms</em>.
  This stream is referred to as the <em id="3b2b3">virtual stream</em> or
  the <em id="3b2b4">variant stream</em> (or <span id="3b2b5">V-stream</span> for short).</span></span></p>
  <p id="3c"><a href="#3c">3c</a><span id="termdef-atom">An <span id="3c1a">atom</span> is the primitive element
  that the Xanadu System deals with.</span>
  There are two types of atoms in the present system: orgls, representing
  structural and organizational information, and characters (8-bit bytes),
  representing actual data.
  Other types of atoms are conceivable, such as
  videodisk frames or other kinds of (non-orgl) organizational structures,
  but these are not present in the current design.</p>
  <p id="3d"><a href="#3d">3d</a>Any atom contained in the system may be referenced by specifying its
  virtual stream address. This is recursively defined as the virtual stream
  address of the orgl containing the atom, combined with the number of the
  V-space which holds the atom within that orgl and the position of the atom
  itself within that V-space. Orgls that are not contained within other orgls
  are addressed by a special sort of V-stream address called an invariant orgl
  identifier, terminating the recursion. Thus, a virtual stream address
  contains a variant part and an invariant part which are syntactically
  separable.</p>
  <p id="3e"><a href="#3e">3e</a>The contents of the V-spaces within an orgl may be edited. This in turn
  means that the V-stream addresses of atoms within an orgl may change, as
  implied by the adjective “variant”. The contents of an orgl may be added to
  or deleted from at any point in a V-space.
  In addition, sections of a V-space
  may be rearranged (i.e., a section may be moved or two sections transposed).
  These operations — insert, delete and rearrange — can cause
  the position and relative ordering, the V-stream order,
  of atoms to shift,
  thus altering those atoms’ V-stream addresses as well.</p>
  <p id="3f"><a href="#3f">3f</a><span id="termdef-I-stream">Atoms are stored internally in an
  invariant stream (or <span id="3f1a">I-stream</span> for short).</span>
  They appear, and are addressed, in I-stream order. As the adjective
  “invariant” suggests, the I-stream address of an atom never changes. The
  function performed by an orgl is the mapping back and forth between I-stream
  addresses and V-stream addresses. When the contents of a V-space are edited,
  the orgl mapping that V-space is changed,
  and thus so are the virtual positions of the atoms.</p>
  <p id="3g"><a href="#3g">3g</a>The I-stream addresses of atoms are not generally visible externally. The
  only exceptions are invariant orgl identifiers
  which are in fact the I-stream
  addresses of “top level” orgls.</p>
  <p id="3h"><a href="#3h">3h</a>The above discussion refers to mappings to and from particular I-stream
  and V-stream addresses.
  In practice, we work with spans rather than point addresses.
  <span id="termdef-span">A <span id="3h1a">span</span> is an abbreviated way of referring to
  a group of contiguous addresses. A span consists of a starting address
  together with a length.</span>
  <span id="termdef-V-span">A <span id="3h2a">V-span</span> is a span of V-stream addresses,
  and <span id="termdef-I-span">an <span id="3h2b1">I-span</span> is similarly a span on
  the I-stream</span>.</span>
  An orgl maps from one V-span to a set of I-spans, and from an
  I-span to a set of sets of V-spans.</p>
  <p id="3i"><a href="#3i">3i</a>The actual atoms located in a particular I-span may be found using another
  structure called the <em id="3i1">grandmap</em>.
  <span id="termdef-grandmap">The <span id="3i2a">grandmap</span> is a tree of pointers to all the
  atoms currently stored in the system, indexed by I-stream address.</span>
  The grandmap provides a mapping between I-stream addresses
  and the locations of the actual underlying physical storage
  used to hold the atoms.</p>
  <p id="3j"><a href="#3j">3j</a>There are thus three levels of addressing used in this system:</p>
  <ul id="3k">
    <li id="3k1"><p id="3k1a"><a href="#3k1a">3k1a</a>V-stream addresses identify atoms to the outside world.
    The V-stream address of an atom may change and,
    as will be explained below,
    an atom may have more than one V-stream address.</p></li>
    <li id="3k2"><p id="3k2a"><a href="#3k2a">3k2a</a>I-stream addresses identify atoms internally
    in a consistent and implementation independent fashion.
    The I-stream address of an atom in the Xanadu system
    is analogous to the accession number of a document in a library.
    An atom has but one I-stream address and this address never changes.</p></li>
    <li id="3k3"><p id="3k3a"><a href="#3k3a">3k3a</a>Physical storage addresses identify the locations
    of the actual bits and bytes of atoms themselves.
    An atom’s physical address is both variable
    and highly implementation dependent.
    For example, it may change
    due to reorganization of the underlying storage
    for purposes of efficiency or convenience,
    or due to changes in the types of storage devices used.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p id="3l"><a href="#3l">3l</a>To retrieve the atom located at a particular V-stream address Vq,
  the invariant part of Vq’s V-stream address specification is extracted.
  This will be an invariant orgl identifier for the orgl which maps Vq
  to some I-stream address.
  Since this invariant orgl identifier is itself an I-stream address,
  it may be (and is) used as an index into the grandmap
  to retrieve the relevant orgl.
  Vq (the full V-stream address, not just the variant part)
  is then mapped through this orgl to its corresponding I-stream address.
  This second I-stream address in turn
  is used for a second lookup in the grandmap
  to acquire the atom which Vq addresses.
  The following diagram illustrates the data flow:
  </p>
  <p id="3m"><a href="#3m">3m</a>An important consequence of the V-stream to I-stream mapping is that
  several V-stream addresses may all map to the same I-stream address.
  This means that an orgl may contain multiple <em id="3m1">virtual copies</em>
  of a given set of material.
  Although the I-stream address of an atom is related to the orgl in
  which it originally was inserted, the V-stream address(es) of that atom
  are under no such constraint.
  Therefore, virtual copies of material originating in
  one orgl may appear in other orgls.</p>
  <p id="3n"><a href="#3n">3n</a>Another consequence of this structure is that multiple orgls may be used
  to represent alternate <em id="3n1">V-to-I</em> mappings for the same set of atoms, yielding
  alternative <em id="3n2">versions</em> of a given collection of material.
  In practice, the data structures used to realize such orgls
  can share their underlying components in those places
  where the V-to-I mappings are similar and need only differ
  in their structure where the versions are actually different.
  (See the accompanying paper on the implementation
  of the Xanadu internal data structures
  for a detailed description of how this mechanism works).</p>
  <p id="3o"><a href="#3o">3o</a><span id="termdef-phylum">The orgls which represent multiple versions of
  the same family of material
  are collectively called a <span id="3o1a">phylum</span>.</span>
  All of the orgls in a phylum are “descended” from a single original orgl,
  in the sense that they were created by applying some edit operations
  to that orgl or to one of its later descendents.</p>
  <p id="3p"><a href="#3p">3p</a><span id="termdef-historical_trace">Xanadu provides a facility called <span id="3p1a">historical trace</span>.
  <span id="termdef-historical_trace_tree">The sequence of
  edit operations that have been applied to the orgls of a phylum
  can be seen to form an <span id="3p1b1">historical trace tree</span>.</span></span>
  This tree branches wherever a different version was created.
  Such versions result when two or more processes modify
  the same orgl through different berts or when a process backs an orgl
  up to an earlier state and then makes edits.</p>
  <p id="3q"><a href="#3q">3q</a>Since each of the editing primitives which the system supports is a
  reversible operation upon an orgl, the state of an orgl at any point
  in its history conceivably might be obtained
  by inverting each of the edits in an edit log.
  However, a data structure is constructed which represents the edit
  history of a phylum at varying levels of detail.
  This data structure is a tree which at the bottom level represents
  individual edit operations and at the higher level represents
  compositions of these lower level edits —
  “superedits” that are single transformations
  that represent the end result of a series of more primitive operations.
  This tree is indexed by position in the
  phylum’s historical trace tree (note that there are two trees here: the
  historical trace tree, representing the sequence of operations forming the
  phylum’s history, and the data structure erected over this tree,
  representing the operations themselves).
  The end result of a retrieval operation on this
  data structure is not a series of edit operations
  but the actual V-to-I mapping that existed at the indicated point
  in the phylum’s history.
  The details of how this is accomplished are given
  in the accompanying paper which describes the data structures themselves.</p>
  <p id="3r"><a href="#3r">3r</a>The system can retrieve any atom stored within it, given the atom’s
  V-stream address.
  In the case of a character atom, the retrieval operation
  returns the character itself.
  In the case of an orgl atom, an entity called a
  <em id="3r1">bert</em> is returned.
  <span id="termdef-bert">A <span id="3r2a">bert</span> is an identifier for an orgl pointing to a
  current access, as opposed to an established V-stream address.</span>
  It grants the <em id="3r3">process</em> to which the bert is given
  exclusive access to a particular V-to-I mapping.</p>
  <p id="3s"><a href="#3s">3s</a><span id="termdef-process">A <span id="3s1a">process</span>, in the Xanadu System,
  means a particular external connection to the system
  which may request the retrieval, creation and editing
  of orgls and characters.</span>
  An arbitrary (i.e., implementation dependent)
  number of processes may access the system concurrently.</p>
  <p id="3t"><a href="#3t">3t</a>Separate processes which request the retrieval of the same orgl at the
  same time are each given different berts which reter to the orgl.
  Associated with each orgl is a count of the number of berts
  which currently refer to it.
  If one of these processes then makes an edit change to the orgl,
  a new orgl will be created.
  The process’s bert will be made to refer to the new orgl and
  the old orglls reference count will be decremented.
  By this means, the other processes will not “see” the change,
  and their berts will still refer to the same V to I mapping as previously.
  Any information about the orgl’s state
  which the other processes might have been keeping externally
  will not be invalidated by the one process’s edit operation.</p>
  <p id="3u"><a href="#3u">3u</a><span id="termdef-spanmap">A structure called the <span id="3u1a">spanmap</span> implements two mappings.
  The first of these is from the I-stream addresses of atoms in general
  to the I-stream addresses of orgls.
  The second mapping is from the same original I-stream addresses
  to berts.</span>
  The spanmap is designed to answer querys about
  which orgls reference which I-spans.
  It quickly identifies the orgl or orgls that map some
  V-stream address(es) onto a particular I-stream address.
  This is the inverse of the set of mappings implemented
  by the full collection of orgls stored in the system.</p>
  <p id="3v"><a href="#3v">3v</a>The spanmap, as its name suggests,
  is fundamentally designed to deal with spans.
  It enables the system to answer queries about which orgls refer to
  particular pieces of material, given the V-stream addresses
  of the atoms of interest.
  The general form of such a query takes the form of the question,
  “what are the V-stream addresses of all the orgls which refer to this
  particular V-span?”
  The V-span of interest is mapped to a set of I-spans
  (call this set Q, for “query”),
  using the procedure described above in the discussion of
  the operation of orgls.
  This I-span set, Q, is then used to initiate a lookup in
  the spanmap which results in a set of one or more I-stream
  addresses corresponding to the orgls which reference Q
  (along with berts identifying orgls that reference Q but
  may not yet have I-stream addresses).
  These I-stream addresses are then looked up in the grandmap,
  yielding the orgls themselves.
  These orgls are in turn used to map Q to a set of V-spans
  (keep in mind that the mapping implemented by an orgl is bidirectional)
  which are then returned as the answer to the process
  which initiated the query.</p>
  <p id="3w"><a href="#3w">3w</a>Since the number of orgls which might refer to a particular I-span is
  potentially very large, the spanmap enables restricted retrievals.
  A retrieval may be restricted to return only orgls from a particular set,
  for example those which reference a particular I-span
  in addition to the one of interest.
  This is important, among other reasons,
  because queries are generally expressed in terms of V-spans,
  and a single V-span may map to a number of I-spans.
  It one wishes to determine the set of orgls which reference
  a particular V-span, what is desired is the intersection of
  the sets of orgls that reference the I-spans that the
  V-span of interest maps to.</p>
  <p id="3x"><a href="#3x">3x</a>The spanmap also enables queries that may be expressed in terms of the
  overlap of spans, rather than simple reference.
  Thus one may ask which orgls contain I-spans that
  begin inside a particular span and end outside of it, for example.
  The reader is again referred to the companion paper on the
  implementation of the various data structures.</p>

</h2>
  <p id="4b"><a href="#4b">4b</a>The underlying data abstraction of the Xanadu System is the <em id="4b1">enfilade</em>.
  The grandmap, spanmap and orgls are all implemented using different types of
  enfilades. We shall first discuss enfilades generally and then show how the
  theory is adapted to specific implementation.</p>
  <section id="enfilade-definitions"><a href="#enfilade-definitions">enfilade-definitions</a>

    <p id="4c2"><span id="termdef-enfilade">An <span id="4c2a1">enfilade</span> is a data structure
    in which the positions of data items in index space
    (i.e., the retrieval keys associated with those data items)
    are stored indirectly, as local positions relative to
    the data items’ neighborhoods in the data structure,
    rather than being stored directly, as absolute positions.</span></p>
    <p id="4c3"><a href="#4c3">4c3</a><span id="termdef-crum">Enfilades have traditionally been implemented as trees.
    Each node of the tree is called a <span id="4c3a1">crum</span></span>
    (in order to disambiguate the term “node” — see footnote
    <a href="#note-4" title="In the Xanadu nomenclature, the term node refers to
    a computer system which...">4</a>).
    Each crum contains, either explicitly or implicitly,
    two components of indexing information, called the wid and the disp.
    In addition, a crum may contain other structural information,
    such as pointers to descendent or sibling crums.</p>
<div><div id="note-4" data-folded="folded">
<p><a name="note-4">4. </a></p><p id="4c3b1"><a href="#4c3b1">4c3b1</a>In the Xanadu nomenclature, the term node refers to
    a computer system which is a member of a distributed data storage
    and communications network.
    The term crum is preferred for reference to a node in an enfiladic
    data structure. The extra term is introduced to avoid confusion,
    since the full-scale Xanadu design involves both enfilades and
    computer networks.</p>
</div></div>
    <p id="4c4"><a href="#4c4">4c4</a><span id="termdef-disp">A <span id="4c4a1">disp</span> represents the relative offset, in index space,
    of its crum from its crum’s parent.</span>
    The “sum” of a crum’s disp with those of all of its ancestors
    determines the crum’s absolute position in index space.
    A change in a crum’s disp therefore causes a corresponding change
    not only in the crum’s absolute position but
    in those of all of its descendents.</p>
    <p id="4c5"><a href="#4c5">4c5</a><span id="termdef-wid">A <span id="4c5a1">wid</span> represents the extent, in index space,
    of its crum’s collective descendants,
    relative to its crum’s position
    (which is in turn derived from its crum’s disp).</span>
    A change in a crum’s wid may result if the wid or disp of one of
    the crum’s children changes.</p>
    <p id="4c6"><a href="#4c6">4c6</a>An enfilade’s disps are interpreted in a top-down fashion, telling the
    relationship of crums to their ancestors,
    while the wids are interpreted from the bottom-up,
    indicating the relationship of crums to their descendents.</p>
    <p id="4c7"><span id="termdef-loaf">A group of sibling crums, all descended from the same parent crum,
    is collectively referred to as a <span id="4c7a1">loaf</span> or crum-block.</span>
    <span id="termdef-fulcrum">The single crum which forms the root of the tree and
    from which all other crums are descended is called the <span id="4c7b1">fulcrum</span>.</span>
    The disp of the fulcrum is offset relative to the origin
    of the index space.
    <span id="termdef-bottom_crums">The crums which form the leaves of the tree are called
    <span id="4c7c1">bottom crums</span>.</span>
    The tree is maintained at a constant depth, so all bottom
    crums
    are the same number of levels below the fulcrum.
    Bottom crums may contain actual data in addition to structural and
    indexing information and
    therefore may have a different structure or
    form than their ancestors do.
    <span id="termdef-upper_crums">Non-bottom crums are referred to as <span id="4c7d1">upper crums</span>.</span>
    When enumerating the levels of an enfilade,
    it is conventional to number from the bottom up so that
    the level number of a crum will not change
    as the enfilade grows or shrinks
    (levels are added or deleted at the top).</p>
    <p id="4c8"><a href="#4c8">4c8</a>An index space may be multi-dimensional, and not all dimensions need
    participate in enfiladic operations, as described below.</p>
    <p id="4c9"><a href="#4c9">4c9</a>An enfilade is similar in many ways to a conventional
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" id="4c9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-tree</a>.
    This is especially so when considering the
    set of primitive operations that are defined.
    However, an <em id="4c9b">enfilade is not a B-tree</em>.
    Enfilades possess two properties that distinguish them from B-trees
    (properties that were, in fact,
    the motivation for the invention of the first enfilades).
    These properties are rearrangability and the capacity for sub-tree sharing.
    These derive from the nature of wids and disps as local abstractions
    independent of the overall frame of reference of the full data structure.</p>
    <p id="4c10"><a href="#4c10">4c10</a>While enfilades have traditionally been implemented as trees, we do not
    feel that this is essential.
    Generalization of the theory of enfilades to
    other types of data structures, for example hash tables,
    has been considered but not yet examined in depth.</p>

    <h3 id="4d1">OPERATIONS<a href="#4d1">4d1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="4d2"><a href="#4d2">4d2</a>The fundamental operations on an enfilade are
    retrieve, rearrange and append.
    These are augmented by the useful, though not strictly necessary,
    operations insert and delete.
    All of these are supported by the “housekeeping” operations
    cut, recombine, level push and level pop.</p>
    <p id="4d3"><a href="#4d3">4d3</a><span id="termdef-retrieve">The <span id="4d3a1">retrieve</span> operation obtains a data item associated
    with a particular location in index space.</span>
    Such a data item may be stored in an enfilade
    either directly, by actually storing it in the bottom crum
    associated with the desired position in index space,
    or indirectly, as a function of the wids and disps of the crums
    traversed while descending the tree to that bottom crum.
    The latter alternative is fairly unusual and deserves elaboration.
    For example, enfilades in index spaces with
    multiple independent dimensions could
    store data by indexing with some dimensions and
    not others and then return the
    positions of bottom crums along the other dimensions.
    A single enfilade may contain several collections of data at once,
    some stored one way and some another.</p>
    <p id="4d4"><a href="#4d4">4d4</a>The general algorithm for retrieve is:
    </p><div id="algorithm-retrieve">
<pre><code>retrieve (indexSpacePosition)
  <em id="4d4a1a">result</em> ← recursiveRetrieve (indexSpacePosition, fulcrum, .O.)

<p><a href="#algorithm-retrieve">algorithm-retrieve</a>
</p></div>
    <p id="4d5"><a href="#4d5">4d5</a>where <span id="4d5a">disp(crum)</span> extracts a crum’s disp, <span id="4d5b">wid(crum)</span> extracts its wid, and
    <span id="4d5c">data(crum)</span> extracts the datum from a bottom crum.
    The symbols <span id="4d5d">.==.</span>, <span id="4d5e">.&lt;.</span> and <span id="4d5f">.&lt;=.</span> represent
    comparison operators in index space.
    The symbol <span id="4d5g">.+.</span> represents “addition” in index space.
    The symbol <span id="4d5h">.O.</span> represents the origin of the index space.
    If less than the full number of possible dimensions is
    being used for indexing, the index space operators must be specified to take
    this into account.
    The symbol <span id="4d5i">←</span> is an assignment operator.
    <span id="4d5j">result</span> is assigned to return a value.
    The control constructs are what they appear to be.</p>
    <p id="4d6"><a href="#4d6">4d6</a>Note that this algorithm retrieves exactly one data item stored directly
    in a bottom crum.
    If data are stored indirectly in the wids and disps, as
    described above, the algorithm must be modified accordingly.
    To implement the case described previously
    (where some dimensions are used for indexing and
    others for indirect data storage),
    the operators <span id="4d6a">.==.</span>, <span id="4d6b">.&lt;.</span>, and <span id="4d6c">.&lt;=.</span>
    should be defined only to compare along the indexing dimensions,
    while <span id="4d6d">.+.</span>
    should be defined on all dimensions.
    The result returned should not be the
    extraction of data from the bottom crum but the
    extraction of the data dimension components of <span id="4d6e">cumulativeIndex</span>.</p>
    <span id="termdef-multiple_hit_retrievals">Also note that it is possible for a single index space position
    to map to more than one data item, although this algorithm would
    only return the last of these.
    The possibility of such <span id="4d7a">multiple hit retrievals</span> is a general property
    of enfilades, although specific types of enfilades may by their nature
    exclude it (multiple hit retrievals may occur, for example,
    in the case of a multi-dimensional index space when data are retrieved
    using indices with less than the full number of dimensions).
    The obvious generalization of collecting aultiple data items into a set
    was omitted for the sake of clarity.</span>
    <p id="4d8"><a href="#4d8">4d8</a>This algorithm also does not take into account the possibility that the
    desired data item might not be present at all.
    Once again, the generalization of collecting the results in a set
    would correct this (the result in such a case would be an empty set)
    and the omission is for clarity.</p>
    <p id="4d9"><a href="#4d9">4d9</a>In cases where multiple hits are excluded, retrieval time is logarithmic
    with the number of data items stored. Where multiple hits are permitted,
    non-logarithmic elements are introduced and the analysis is not so
    straightforward, but depends upon the specific nature of the enfilade in
    question.
    In the case of multi-dimensional index spaces, retrieval times
    depend on the splitting and regrouping algorithms used to balance the tree.
    There are tradeoffs that depend on the number of dimensions that are typically
    to be used to retrieve with and the performance in atypical retrievals.
    If the enfilade is totally optimized along one dimension,
    retrievals will be of logarithmic order along that dimension and
    linear along the others.
    If it is optimized along <span id="4d9a"><span id="4d9a1">D</span></span> dimensions collectively and
    retrievals are performed along <span id="4d9b"><span id="4d9b1">K</span></span> of those dimensions,
    the retrieval time will be on the order of
    <span id="4d9c"><span id="4d9c1">N<sup id="4d9c1a">(D-K)/D</sup>·log(N)</span></span>, <span id="4d9d"><span id="4d9d1">K≤D</span></span>,
    where <span id="4d9e"><span id="4d9e1">N</span></span> is the number of data items stored in the enfilade.</p>
    <p id="4d10"><a href="#4d10">4d10</a><span id="termdef-rearrange">The <span id="4d10a1">rearrange</span> operation alters the index space
    positions of clusters of
    data items by selective alteration or transposition
    of disps.</span>
    Rearrangability is one of the two essential properties of enfilades
    which distinguish them from other sorts of data structures
    (the other, sub-tree sharability, is discussed below).
    Rearrange changes the relative ordering of crums in index space.</p>
    <p id="4d11"><a href="#4d11">4d11</a>Rearrange operations are specified in terms of cuts.
    There are two “flavors” of rearrange,
    called three-cut rearrange and four-cut rearrange.
    A cut delineates a boundary for the rearrange operation.
    A cut is a separation between two regions of interest,
    defined by a position in index space, <span id="4d11a"><span id="4d11a1">C</span></span>,
    such that there exists a pair of sibling crums

    that of <span id="4d11f"><span id="4d11f1">A1</span></span> and <span id="4d11g"><span id="4d11g1">A2</span></span>:

    (cuts are often made along less than the full number of dimensions).
    <p id="4d12"><a href="#4d12">4d12</a>Cuts are generally used in groups
    (in the case of rearrange, in groups of three or four).

    differ between bottom loaves and upper loaves.

    Insert is not a strictly necessary operation, since it is
    functionally equivalent to an append operation followed by a rearrange
    operation.
    The append adds the new item to the data structure and then the
    rearrange relocates it to the desired location.
    In practice, insert is often implemented as a separate operation,
    for reasons of efficiency or convenience.
    An insertion is accomplished by making a cut at the
    desired insertion point,
    extending this cut upwards to a crum whose wid is large enough
    to encompass the data to be inserted,
    and then plugging the new material in.
    The disps of crums .&gt;. the new material at this level are then
    incremented accordingly.
    The algorithm to accomplish this is left as an exercise for the reader
    in order not to overly extend this paper.
    <span id="termdef-delete">The <span id="4d22b1">delete</span> operation removes things from an enfilade.</span>
    Delete, like insert, is also not strictly necessary,
    since undesired material can be relocated to any arbitrary “purgatory”
    by the rearrange operation.
    In actual use, however, it often desirable to actually delete things
    in order to be able to reclaim the storage that they occupy.
    The delete operation is quite simple:
    two cuts are made on the boundaries of the unwanted region
    of index space and propagated up to a common ancestor.
    The child crums of this ancestor which lie between the
    cuts are then disowned and
    the disps of greater siblings reduced accordingly.
    The disowned crums and all of their descendants may then
    be deallocated or left for garbage collection.</p>
    <p id="4d23"><a href="#4d23">4d23</a>Deletes and rearranges can result in an enfilade that is a badly
    fragmented, unbalanced tree and in which many crums have fewer than the
    optimum number of children.
    This in turn can result in a tree which has more levels than necessary,

    around the enfiladic tree and selectively applying the above operation
    in order to perform some general housecleaning.
    Such a process may also include cut operations to
    split up recombined crums which have too many children, perhaps
    interleaving cuts with primitiveRecombines in order to “shuffle”
    crums around in the tree.
    The methods for doing this are heuristic rather than algorithmic,
    and depend both on the nature of the particular enfilade
    in question and the data with which it is being used.
    Certain applications may not, in fact,
    require any recombines to be performed at all.
    A recombine may also invoke a level pop operation to remove an
    excess level from the tree.

</h3>
    <p id="4e2"><a href="#4e2">4e2</a>The use of wids and disps means that each crum in an enfilade is located
    relative to its parent rather than to any absolute coordinate space.
    This in turn means that enfilades may engage in sub-tree sharing.
    Multiple crums on a given level of one or more enfilades
    may point to a single lower crum as one of their children.
    This has the effect of making virtual copies of the
    sub-tree represented by that crum and all of its descendents.
    The index space position of the bottom crums of such a sub-tree
    depends upon the particular parent crum through which they are accessed.
    Sub-tree sharability and rearrangability, both the result of
    the localizing action of wids and disps,
    are the two properties which most significantly distinguish enfilades
    from other sorts of data structures.</p>
    <p id="4e3"><a href="#4e3">4e3</a>One of the problems with multi-dimensional data is that,
    unlike one dimensional data, there is, in general,
    no single well-defined ordering of the data.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree" id="4e3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K-ary trees</a>
     solve this problem using projection
    onto a single dimension.
    Enfilades use the locality of wids and disps to
    eliminate the need for ordering.</p>
    <p id="4e4"><a href="#4e4">4e4</a>One of the many useful applications of sub-tree sharing is versioning
    — the creation enfilades which represent alternate organizations of
    a given body of data.
    Often, alternate versions of some set of material will have
    significant portions in common
    (insert reference on Reps’ subtree sharing here)
    (this, in fact, may be what we mean when we say two things are
    “versions” of each other, rather than saying that
    they are separate things).
    Common portions of two data sets can be represented by a
    single enfiladic sub-tree.
    Separate data structure is only required where they actually differ.
    If the differences between two versions are small relative to the
    total volume of data, the storage savings can be significant.
    In addition, alterations to the shared portions may also be shared,
    thus changing one data set can change the other correspondingly,
    if this is desired.</p>
    <p id="4e5"><a href="#4e5">4e5</a>The recombine operation must be reconsidered
    in the light of sub-tree sharing.
    Recombination is not always desirable,
    even when an enfilade is badly balanced,
    since it would be an error to recombine a shared crum
    with an unshared one.
    The recombine operation must be carefully constructed,
    if used at all, in applications where sub-tree sharing is expected.</p>
    <p id="4e6"><a href="#4e6">4e6</a>Another interesting (and pleasing) property of enfilades is that
    they naturally and automatically tend to adapt themselves to
    take advantage of any clustering of the data in index space.
    This is because crums are grouped together into loaves
    according to the volume of material stored,
    rather than according to the material’s indices.
    In addition, it is often the case that
    cuts will tend to occur in the less dense regions of the data structure.
    Over a period of time, the various manipulations performed will tend to
    bring about a helpful measure of correlation between patterns of
    sub-tree grouping in the enfilade and patterns of clumping in the
    data that it stores.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="4f2"><a href="#4f2">4f2</a>An enfilade is a tree structure in which the nodes, called crums,
    do not directly store the indexing key, but rather a pair of
    localized abstractions of the key called the wid and the disp.
    These represent the extent and position relative to a parent in
    index space.
    Manipulation of an enfilade is supported by the operations
    retrieve, append, rearrange, insert, delete, recombine, cut,
    level push and level pop.

  <p id="5d"><a href="#5d">5d</a>A fourth data structure, called the <em id="5d1">historical trace enfilade</em>,
  used to realize the historical trace facility,
  has been designed but not yet implemented.
  In addition, alternate designs for the spanmap and the orgl,
  called the <em id="5d2">drexfilade</em> and the <em id="5d3">DIV poom</em> respectively, are anticipated.
  All of these data structures are described in this document.
  This document also describes another important aspect of the
  Xanadu implementation: the numbering system, tumblers,
  used to address entities in the system and the
  compressed number representation, humbers, that allows tumblers to be
  stored to arbitrary precision with reasonable efficiency.</p>

    <h3 id="5e1">TUMBLERS AND HUMBERS<a href="#5e1">5e1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="5e2"><a href="#5e2">5e2</a>A form of transfinitesimal number called a tumbler is used frequently
    throughout the system. Tumblers are like the numbers used to identify
    chapters, sections, sub-sections, pages, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs
    in many technical manuals.
    They are represented externally as a sequence of integer
    fields separated by periods (“.”) and internally as a string of integers.
    For example, <span id="5e2a">3.2</span> and <span id="5e2b">47.23.137.0.5</span> are tumblers
    (the period is a delimiter for the human reader and is
    not essential to the fundamental notion of what tumblers are).</p>
    <p id="5e3"><a href="#5e3">5e3</a>A non-commutative arithmetic operation called tumbler addition is
    defined. For example:</p>
    <div id="5e4"><table>
<tbody><tr id="5e4a">
<td id="5e4a1"></td>
<td id="5e4a2"><span id="5e4a2a">3. 5.10. 6</span></td>
</tr>
<tr id="5e4b">
<td id="5e4b1">+</td>
<td id="5e4b2"><span id="5e4b2a">2.16. 3</span></td>

<tr id="5e4c">
<td id="5e4c1"></td>
<td id="5e4c2"><span id="5e4c2a">5.16. 3</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div>
    <p id="5e5"><a href="#5e5">5e5</a>This arithmetic gives different roles to the two tumblers:
    the first specifies a position — where something is — and
    the second specifies an offset — a distance to move forward.
    In this example, only the first field of the
    original position matters. A couple more examples are:</p>

    <p id="5e7"><a href="#5e7">5e7</a>The following rules describe the procedure for tumbler addition:</p>
    <ol id="5e8">
      <li id="5e8a"><p id="5e8a1"><a href="#5e8a1">5e8a1</a>Evaluating from the most to the least significant fields
      (i.e., from left to right),

      <li id="5e8b"><p id="5e8b1"><a href="#5e8b1">5e8b1</a>The first non-zero offset field is added to the

      remaining fields of the offset.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p id="5e9"><a href="#5e9">5e9</a>Since tumbler addition is non-commutative,
    there are two possible forms of tumbler subtraction.
    We call these strong tumbler subtraction and weak tumbler subtraction.
    The Xanadu system makes use of a generalized tumbler
    difference operator defined as follows:
    when taking the difference of two tumblers <span id="5e9a"><span id="5e9a1">A</span></span> and <span id="5e9b"><span id="5e9b1">B</span></span>,
    if <span id="5e9c"><span id="5e9c1">A</span></span> is greater than <span id="5e9d"><span id="5e9d1">B</span></span> then the
    result is obtained by strongly subtracting <span id="5e9e"><span id="5e9e1">B</span></span> from <span id="5e9f"><span id="5e9f1">A</span></span>:
    otherwise the result is obtained by weakly subtracting <span id="5e9g"><span id="5e9g1">A</span></span> from <span id="5e9h"><span id="5e9h1">B</span></span>.
    As a result, no subtraction operation is ever performed
    that results in a negative tumbler.
    Like tumbler addition, tumbler subtraction involves
    two operands with different roles: a position and a negative offset.
    The difference between the two forms of tumbler subtraction is that
    strong subtraction results in a tumbler which may be added to the
    negative offset to get back to the original position,
    whereas weak subtraction involves simply applying the same
    essential procedure as tumbler addition with
    field subtraction substituted for field addition.</p>

    <p id="5e20"><a href="#5e20">5e20</a>Tumblers are used in the Xanadu system because of their
    accordion-like extensibility.
    They have the property that, like both real and rational numbers,
    between any two numbers are infinitely many more.
    Tumbler-space has a porosity that allows any amount of new material
    to be inserted at any point.</p>
    <p id="5e21"><a href="#5e21">5e21</a>Tumblers are stored internally using Humbers.
    <span id="termdef-Humber">“<span id="5e21a1">Humber</span>“ is short for ”Huffman encoded number“ or ”huge number”.
    A humber is a form of infinite
    precision integer used to represent the fields of tumblers.</span>
    Use of infinite precision integers prevents constraints on the size of
    a tumbler’s field due to a restriction to, for example, 32-bit numbers.</p>
    <p id="5e22"><a href="#5e22">5e22</a>Humbers are constructed out of 8-bit bytes.
    If the high-order bit of the first byte is 0,
    then the remaining 7 bits encode the number itself,
    with possible values ranging from 0 to 127.
    It the aforementioned bit is 1, then the remaining 7 bits encode
    the number of bytes in the number, and that many
    bytes then follow which contain it.
    Should more than 127 bytes be required to represent the number,
    the length zero
    (i.e., a high order bit of 1, followed by seven 0’s)
    indicates that what follows is a humber
    (applying this definitio recursively)
    that encodes the length,
    followed by the indicated number of bytes encoding the number.</p>
    <p id="5e23"><a href="#5e23">5e23</a>This representation never runs out of precision and can represent any
    non-negative integer whatsoever
    (and, in fact can represent negatives with minor modification).
    In addition, most tumbler fields in the Xanadu system are small
    (i.e., less than 127) and thus can be encoded in a single byte.
    Tumblers are represented in a floating-point like format, with a mantissa
    consisting of a field count humber followed by the indicated number of field
    humbers, and an exponent humber indicating the number of leading 0 fields
    (leading since tumblers are transfinitesimals).</p>
    <p id="5e24"><a href="#5e24">5e24</a>Tumblers are used in the Xanadu system as both V-stream addresses and
    I-stream addresses. We perform some tricks with these addresses by encoding
    some information about the thing addressed in parts of the tumbler itself.
    In particular we use fields with the value “<span id="5e24a">0</span>” as a delimiter to separate
    one part of a tumbler from another.
    For example, the “<span id="5e24b">0</span>” in <span id="5e24c">4.3.7.0.19.1</span> separates the tumbler into the
    two pieces <span id="5e24d">4.3.7</span> and <span id="5e24e">19.1</span>.
    Of course, the pieces have to be constrained to
    not contain any “<span id="5e24f">0</span>”s themselves.
    Note also that the pieces are themselves tumblers.</p>
    <p id="5e25"><a href="#5e25">5e25</a>Using the <span id="5e25a">0</span>-field-as-delimiter scheme,
    an invariant orgl identifier is represented as a tumbler of the form:</p>
    <p id="5e26a"><a href="#5e26a">5e26a</a>〈node〉.0.〈account〉.0.〈orgl〉</p>
    <p id="5e27"><a href="#5e27">5e27</a>where 〈node〉, 〈account〉 and 〈orgl〉 are
    tumblers that don’t contain “<span id="5e27a">0</span>” as one of their constituent fields.
    The 〈node〉 component is there in anticipation of
    future implementations which store orgls in a distributed network, and
    represents the particular node of that network with which the orgl is
    associated.
    〈account〉 similarly anticipates future multi-user systems, and
    represents the particular user or account
    (i.e., user associated with node number 〈node〉)
    which owns the orgl.
    〈orgl〉 indicates which particular one of that user’s orgls is desired.
    For example, <span id="5e27b">5.0.3.2.0.17</span> indicates the <span id="5e27c">17</span>th
    orgl belonging to the <span id="5e27d">3.2</span>nd user on the <span id="5e27e">5</span>th node.
    In the present single-node single-user system,
    addresses all resemble <span id="5e27f">0.0.</span>〈orgl〉 with the 〈node〉 and
    〈account〉 components being empty.
    Both V-stream and I-stream addresses are tumblers of the form:
    <span id="5e27g">〈invariant orgl id〉.0.〈v-space〉.〈position〉</span>
    where 〈invariant orgl id〉 is the tumbler representing an invariant orgl
    identifier of the form described above and 〈v-space〉 and 〈position〉 are
    inteqer fields.
    〈v-space〉 specifies which virtual space of the orgl in question is desired,
    and 〈position〉 indicates a particular atom within that v-space.
    Thus <span id="5e27h">5.0.3.2.0.17.0.47.23</span> denotes the <span id="5e27i">23</span>rd atom of the <span id="5e27j">47</span>th v-space
    of the orgl specified in the previous example.</p>
    <p id="5e28"><a href="#5e28">5e28</a>Use of the “<span id="5e28a">0</span>” field as a delimiter to concatenate the various components
    of addressing information into a single tumbler allows a single
    tumbler-space to contain all possible V-stream or I-stream addresses.
    This in turn simplifies the construction of data structures that use
    V-stream or I-stream space as their index space by eliminating
    any need for dealing with the various components separately.</p>
    <p id="5e29"><a href="#5e29">5e29</a>Future plans may include support for an extended indirect V-stream address
    of the form:</p>
    <p id="5e30a"><a href="#5e30a">5e30a</a>〈v-stream address〉.〈v-space〉.〈virtual position〉</p>
    <p id="5e31"><a href="#5e31">5e31</a>where 〈v-stream address〉 is a V-stream address of either this form or the
    previous one.
    This notation allows the immediate specification of atoms via
    orgls which are themselves within other orgls.
    For example, <span id="5e31a">5.0.3.2.0.17.0.47.23.2.1</span> would indicate the <span id="5e31b">1</span>st atom of
    the <span id="5e31c">2</span>nd v-space of the orgl addressed in the previous example
    (assuming, of course, that it was in fact an orgl and not a character atom).</p>
    <p id="5e32"><a href="#5e32">5e32</a>The porosity of tumbler space enables new addresses to be created easily
    without conflict with previously created ones.
    For example, node <span id="5e32a">5</span> from the past few examples could create a new
    node <span id="5e32b">5.1</span> without requiring knowledge of
    whether, say, node <span id="5e32c">6</span> existed or not.
    Orgl ids for new versions of previously existing orgls are created this way.
    For example, the first new version of
    orgl <span id="5e32d">1.0.2.0.3</span> would be <span id="5e32e">1.0.2.0.3.1</span> and the next would be <span id="5e32f">1.0.2.0.3.2</span>.
    Physical storage locations are not, in general, represented using tumblers.
    Instead they have a form which is entirely dependent upon the
    nature and quantity of the underlying storage hardware and the
    dictates of the operating system software which
    interfaces with that hardware.</p>

  <section id="granfilade"><a href="#granfilade">granfilade</a>
    <h3 id="5f1">THE GRANFILADE<a href="#5f1">5f1</a>
</h3>
    <span id="termdef-granfilade">The <span id="5f2a">granfilade</span> is one of the three major data structures
    inside the Xanadu system, and probably the simplest.
    It is used to implement the
    grandmap, providing a means of looking up atoms by their I-stream addresses.
    As its name suggests, the granfilade is an enfilade.</span>
    <p id="5f3"><a href="#5f3">5f3</a>The index space used by the granfilade is I-stream tumbler space.
    The wid of a granfilade crum is a tumbler specifying the span of
    I-space beneath the crum
    (i.e., the distance, in tumbler space, from the first to the last bottom
    crum descended from it).
    The widdative function is tumbler addition, therefore
    a crum’s wid is simply the tumbler sum of its children’s wids.
    Bottom crums have an implicit wid of <span id="5f3a">0.0.0.0.1</span>
    (i.e., spanning no nodes, no accounts, no orgls, no V-spaces and
    spanning a single atom).
    Granfilade disps are tumbler offsets in I-space from the parent crum.</p>
    <p id="5f4"><a href="#5f4">5f4</a>Bottom crums in the granfilade represent atoms.
    Atoms come in two varieties: characters and orgls.
    Character bottom crums are stored as spans of characters,
    rather than individual bytes.
    These consist of a pointer to a block of physical storage,
    either in core or on disk, containing the bytes
    themselves, and an (integer) length, telling the number of bytes in
    the block.
    Since each of these bytes has an implicit wid of <span id="5f4a">0.0.0.0.1</span>,
    the character span has a wid of
    <span id="5f4b">0.0.0.0.〈number of characters in the span〉</span>.
    Orgl bottom crums are stored in a similar fashion, but
    instead of literal data bytes,
    pointers to the fulcrums of orgls (poomfilades) are stored.</p>
    <p id="5f5"><a href="#5f5">5f5</a>To obtain the atom associated with a particular I-stream address, an
    enfilade retrieve operation is performed (see accompanying paper on enfilade
    theory). Starting with the fulcrum, the wid is subtracted from the desired
    I-stream address, and the child crum is selected whose disp comes
    closest to the modified I-stream address without going over it.
    The process is then repeated with this child crum and the modified
    I-stream address as the target.
    At the bottom, the (by now much reduced) target address is used as an index
    into the appropriate character or orgl span to select the desired atom.
    It is quite possible to find that there is no bottom crum associated with
    a given I-stream address, since tumbler space is porous
    (i.e., between any two tumblers are infinitely more tumblers).</p>
    <p id="5f6"><a href="#5f6">5f6</a>Although the grandmap is said to simply map from
    I-stream addresses to physical storage locations,
    a retrieval operation on the grandmap may involve looking up the
    disk locations of the atoms in the granfilade, bringing the
    atoms themselves from those locations into core, and then returning the
    core addresses. This is something more than a simple lookup operation.</p>
    <p id="5f7"><a href="#5f7">5f7</a>In practice, retrieves are performed upon a whole span at once, returning
    a number of atoms (which is specified in the retrieve request) starting at
    the given index space location.
    The length of the span to be retrieved is also a tumbler, due to the
    porosity of tumbler space.</p>
    <p id="5f8"><a href="#5f8">5f8</a>The only operations performed upon the granfilade are retrieve and append,
    although there are an infinite number of potential places to append to
    (one such place for each possible V-space or each
    possible invariant orgl id).
    The granfilade is never cut, deleted from or rearranged.
    It simply accretes data monotonically, and then allows it to be
    quickly regurgitated.
    For this reason, it is quite reasonable to store the
    bottom and interior crums of the granfilade on an unchangeable medium,
    such as write-once optical disks.</p>

    <h3 id="5g1">THE POOMFILADE<a href="#5g1">5g1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="5g2"><a href="#5g2">5g2</a>The second major data structure inside the system is the poomfilade.
    <span id="termdef-poomfilade">The <span id="5g2a1">poomfilade</span> is used to implement orgls.
    POOM stands for Permutations On Ordering Matrix.
    The poomfilade represents something functionally similar,
    though not identical, to a permutation matrix: a sparse binary matrix in
    tumbler space, one axis of which represents the V-stream and the other the
    I-stream.</span>
    A “<span id="5g2b"><span id="5g2b1">1</span></span>” at a given coordinate indicates that the orgl realized by the
    matrix maps that coordinate’s V-stream axis location
    to and from its I-stream axis location.
    A “<span id="5g2c"><span id="5g2c1">0</span></span>” indicates that no such mapping exists.
    This would be a permutation matrix but for virtual copies,
    which result in a mapping between a single I-stream location and a
    number of V-stream locations, allowing a given I-stream “column” of
    this matrix to have more than one “<span id="5g2d"><span id="5g2d1">1</span></span>” entry.
    In addition, the previously mentioned porosity of tumbler space results in
    an infinite number of “rows” and “columns” which are all “<span id="5g2e"><span id="5g2e1">0</span></span>”s.</p>
    <p id="5g3"><a href="#5g3">5g3</a>The index space used in the poomfilade is two-dimensional cartesian
    tumbler space. The disps and wids of poomfilade crums are ordered pairs of
    tumblers representing the positions and extents, respectively, of
    rectangles in this space.
    The positions (disps) draw their origin relative to the parent crum.
    The widdative function is
    <em id="5g3a">construction of the minimum enclosing rectangle</em>
    of the rectangles represented by all the children in a loaf.</p>
    <p id="5g4"><a href="#5g4">5g4</a>Bottom crums in the poomfilade are identity matrices,
    representing V-spans that map without internal alteration onto I-spans.
    These are stored as a position (disp) along with a single value for
    extent (since identity matrices are, by definition, square).
    It is not necessary to actually store the “<span id="5g4a"><span id="5g4a1">1</span></span>”s and “<span id="5g4b"><span id="5g4b1">0</span></span>”s themselves.</p>
    <p id="5g5"><a href="#5g5">5g5</a>Retrievals are performed on the poomfilade using one axis as the
    indexing axis and the other as the data axis.
    Extracting information consists of recursively delving into the
    boxes represented by the rectangles crossing the rows or
    columns of interest. A rearrange performed along the V-stream axis
    implements the corresponding primitive orgl edit operation
    (see the accompanying paper on the <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="5g5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="5g5a1">Xanadu</span></a> system architecture)
    on the V-stream order of the orgl that the poomfilade represents.
    The other edit operations are implemented by manipulating the poomfilade
    in a similar fashion.
    Virtual copies are implemented using sub-tree sharing.</p>

    is planned but not yet implemented.</span>
    The DIV poom is similar to the poom, but adds a
    third dimension to enable the determination of the orgl of origin
    of material that has been virtually copied.
    The third dimension is orgl
    (or “document”, for historical reasons, hence the “D”)
    of origin of the I-span.
    Bottom crums are still planar identity matrices, but
    associated with each is a position on the I-stream corresponding to
    orgl of origin for the span represented.
    Upper crums represent three-dimensional bounding rectangular prisms,
    although the enfilade is otherwise the same as the basic poomfilade.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="5i2"><a href="#5i2">5i2</a>The Xanadu system’s third major data structure is the spanfilade.
    <span id="termdef-spanfilade">The <span id="5i2a1">spanfilade</span> is used to implement the spanmap,
    a mapping from the I-stream to the <span id="termdef-O-stream"><span id="5i2a2a">O-stream</span>
    (the subset of the I-stream whose atoms are orgls).</span></span></p>
    <p id="5i3"><a href="#5i3">5i3</a>The spanfilade is similar to the poomfilade in its higher level structure
    — crums represent recursively nested boxes, and the widdative function is
    still the minimum enclosing rectangle.
    The bottom crums are different, however,
    as is the interpretation of the axes.</p>
    <p id="5i4"><a href="#5i4">5i4</a>The two axes represent the I-stream and the O-stream.
    In addition, the data structure is partitioned along the O-stream axis
    into independent segments, each of which spans the entire O-stream but
    represents the spans referenced from a particular V-space
    (this partioning is like having a set of
    parallel spanfilades, one for each V-space).
    Such a partitioning enables retrievals to be readily restricted to orgls
    from particular V-spaces.</p>
    <p id="5i5"><a href="#5i5">5i5</a>Bottom crums represent I-spans referenced by a particular orgl in a
    particular V-space. A Bottom crum contains an O-stream position
    (relative to its parent crum),
    representing the I-stream address of a referencing orgl, an
    I-stream position (also relative to the parent crum),
    representing the start of an I-span, and an I-span length.
    The first two of these together constitute
    the bottom crum’s disp, while the third is the crum’s wid.</p>
    <p id="5i6"><a href="#5i6">5i6</a>Retrievals are performed on the spanfilade using I-spans as the indexing
    elements. The result of such a retrieval is a set of I-stream addresses
    corresponding to the orgls which map some segment of the V-stream onto the
    I-span used as the key.</p>

    <p id="5j2"><a href="#5j2">5j2</a><span id="termdef-drexfilade">The <span id="5j2a1">drexfilade</span> is a much improved design for the
    spanmap which will replace the current one as soon as possible.
    The drexfilade is also similar in flavor to the spanfilade,
    the poomfilade and the DIV poom
    (in fact, these are all part of a family which we call
    <em id="5j2a2"><span id="5j2a2a"><span id="5j2a2a1">N</span></span>-dimensional enfilades</em>, where, in this case, <span id="5j2a3"><span id="5j2a3a">N</span></span> is <span id="5j2a4"><span id="5j2a4a">2</span></span> or <span id="5j2a5"><span id="5j2a5a">3</span></span>).
    It is a three dimensional binary matrix, with the three
    dimensions representing the O-stream and the starting and ending I-stream
    addresses of I-spans.</span>
    Bottom crums are single points (the “<span id="5j2b"><span id="5j2b1">1</span></span>”s of the matrix).
    The interpretation of this matrix is as follows;
    a point is “<span id="5j2c"><span id="5j2c1">1</span></span>” (i.e., present in the data structure) if and only if
    the I-span it denotes on the two I-stream axes is present in
    (i.e., mapped to in full by) the orgl denoted by its O-stream axis position.</p>
    <p id="5j3"><a href="#5j3">5j3</a>The drexfilade avoids some unfortunate combinatorial problems with the
    spanfilade.
    It also allows queries about arbitrary patterns of overlap between
    particular I-spans and the spans mapped to by the orgls,
    in addition to queries about simple enclosures.</p>

    <h3 id="5k1">THE HISTORICAL TRACE ENFILADE<a href="#5k1">5k1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="5k2"><a href="#5k2">5k2</a>The historical trace enfilade is certainly the most complex
    Xanadu data structure.
    Implementation has therefore been deferred until the more basic
    portions of the system are fully functional.</p>
    <p id="5k3"><a href="#5k3">5k3</a>The underlying representation of an orgl is a sparse binary mapping
    matrix. Each of the primitive editing operations which the system supports
    rearrange, append, insert and delete — is expressed as a
    transformation matrix that the poom is multiplied by to obtain the new,
    edited orgl.
    Note that the initial state of an orgl is a single identity matrix.
    When an edit operation is applied to this identity matrix,
    the resulting orgl is the transformation matrix for that edit itself.
    From this it may be seen that each edit transformation matrix
    is in some sense an orgl itself,
    mapping from the old V-stream order of the orgl to the new V-stream order.</p>
    <p id="5k4"><a href="#5k4">5k4</a>The matrix product of several of these transformation matrices is itself
    a transformation matrix for a single transformation that is
    equivalent to the constituent transformations applied individually.
    The product of all the transformations in the history of an orgl
    (not including alternate versions)
    is in fact the orgl itself.</p>
    <p id="5k5"><a href="#5k5">5k5</a>The history of a phylum consists of the sequence of changes which
    have been made to its orgls over time.
    In the case of a phylum for which no versioning has taken place,
    this is a linear series or operations.
    Whenever a new version is introduced, the sequence of changes
    branches and becomes a tree.
    One way of visualizing this is as a wire frame tree with
    beads strung along the wires.
    Each bead represents a single primitive change to an orgl.
    It is this tree which forms the index space of the
    historical trace enfilade.
    There are thus two trees to keep in mind:
    the enfiladic tree — the data structure itself
    and the tree-shaped index space in which the enfilade resides.</p>
    <p id="5k6"><a href="#5k6">5k6</a>Locations in the index space — points in the history of a the phylum —
    are expressed as a path through the history tree. The tree is structured so
    that there are only binary branches. A path can be represented by distances
    (in units of single edit operations) interspersed with direction changes.
    If, with a binary tree, we follow the convention of always taking, say,
    the right branch unless otherwise directed,
    a path can be represented as a series of distances,
    between which are implicit left turns.</p>
    <p id="5k7"><a href="#5k7">5k7</a>An enfilade is constructed in this space by grouping crums over regions of
    the tree (see the attached diagram). Each of these regions has a single
    entrance and zero or more exits.
    <span id="termdef-index_wid"><span id="termdef-index_wid">A crum’s <span id="5k7a1a">index wid</span> is the set of paths
    through it to farther siblings.</span>
    Its <span id="5k7a2">index disp</span> is the path to its entrance
    relative to the entrance to its parent.</span>
    <span id="termdef-index_widdative_function">The <span id="5k7b1">index widdative function</span> is path concatenation.</span></p>
    <p id="5k8"><a href="#5k8">5k8</a>The bottom crums of the historical trace enfilade are transformation
    matrices for the individual edit operations. These are quite simple.
    The index wid of a bottom crum is a single step along the historical trace.</p>
    <p id="5k9"><a href="#5k9">5k9</a>In addition to its index wid, each crum also has a data wid.
    In the case of a bottom crum, this is the
    primitive transformation matrix that it stores.
    In the case of an upper crum, the data wid is the matrix product of
    the data wids of its children.
    The data wid of a crum is thus the full transformation achieved by
    traversing the segment of the tree which it covers.
    This is in turn a poomfilade, constructed using sub-trees which are
    shared with the historical trace crum’s children’s data wids.
    The historical trace is thus an enfilade constructed from enfilades!
    Note that, because of branching in the historical trace tree,
    a crum may have a number of matrices in its data wid —
    one for each path across the it.
    There is a one-to-one correspondence between the matrices in the data wid
    and the paths in the index wid.
    The data disp of an historical trace crum is implicitly the matrix product
    of the data wids of the crum’s siblings along the path between the
    crum and the entrance to its parent.</p>
    <p id="5k10"><a href="#5k10">5k10</a>A retrieval on the historical trace is accomplished by multiplying
    together the data disps of the crums descended through on the way to the
    bottom crum located at a particular point on the history tree.
    The result is a poom for the orgl that existed at that point in the
    phylum’s history.
    In practice it is not necessary to actually multiply whole matrices
    together, since the object of interest is not the final matrix itself
    but the mapping which it represents.
    It is sufficient to simply map whatever V-spans are desired
    through each of the disp matrices. This is equivalent to multiplying the
    matrices, but only requires dealing with the particular spans of interest,
    rather than the whole product orgl.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="6c2"><a href="#6c2">6c2</a>The system currently operates in a dedicated single-user mode.
    Support for multiple users/processes is anticipated
    as soon as funding permits.
    Multi-user Xanadu will be implemented as a transaction based system.</p>
    <p id="6c3"><a href="#6c3">6c3</a>The present system supports an older interface paradigm in which orgls are
    separated into two classes called documents and links.
    Support for orgls in the sense that they are described in these
    documents will entail a change to the interface layer
    but not to the system proper.</p>
    <p id="6c4"><a href="#6c4">6c4</a>The present implementation uses the older spanfilade and poomfilade
    designs (described above) rather than the newer drexfilade and DIV poom.
    In addition, as was mentioned earlier, historical trace has not yet been

    <p id="6c5"><a href="#6c5">6c5</a>Tumblers are currently stored internally using a fixed-size structure,

    <h3 id="6d1">THE FRONTEND/BACKEND INTERFACE<a href="#6d1">6d1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="6d2"><a href="#6d2">6d2</a>The Xanadu system makes a strong distinction between the data storage,
    retrieval and organizational functions and tbe user interface,
    display management and data formating functions.
    The latter are the responsibility of a separate frontend.
    The frontend is a program that runs as a separate process,
    possibly on a separate computer, and accesses the capabilities of the
    backend via some sort of data communications line or I/O channel.
    The backend implements the functions described in this set of documents
    in as application independent a fashion as possible.</p>
    <p id="6d3"><a href="#6d3">6d3</a><span id="termdef-Phoebe">The backend and the frontend interact via an
    interface language called <span id="6d3a1">Phoebe</span>.
    This language allows programs to express requests to the backend to
    perform any of the functions described in these documents.</span>
    The backend then responds with the requested data,
    or by performing the requested manipulation and returning an
    indication of whether or not it was able to do what was asked.
    The full interface language specification is not yet complete since our
    conception of the virtuality of the system has recently changed and the
    interface is being redesigned to take advantage of this.
    The interface protocol for the older virtuality is the one
    recognized by the current implementation.
    This protocol is described in one of the attached documents.

    <h3 id="6e1">THE CORE/DISK MEMORY MODEL<a href="#6e1">6e1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="6e2"><a href="#6e2">6e2</a>The present design assumes a two-level memory model:
    <span id="termdef-core"><span id="termdef-core">the hardware upon which the system is running has a
    limited quantity of high speed, random access memory which is
    immediately accessible, which we call <span id="6e2a1a">core</span></span>, and a much
    larger quantity of slower,
    less immediately accessible memory, called <span id="6e2a2">disk</span>.</span>
    The terms “core” and “disk” are chosen for convenience,
    and do not necessarily reflect the technology used to realize them.</p>
    <p id="6e3"><a href="#6e3">6e3</a>Core is assumed to be a limited resource, restricted to a relatively small
    amount (e.g., a few megabytes per active process).
    Disk is not so constrained, and the model assumes that the amount of disk
    storage available is effectively unlimited.
    This is not to say that the system requires an infinite amount of
    disk space, but merely enough to contain all of the data that it is
    being asked to manage.</p>
    <p id="6e4"><a href="#6e4">6e4</a>The contents of all of the system’s data structures are stored permanently
    on disk. As used, they are also moved into core. All reading into core and
    writing out to disk is under the system’s direct control.
    Swapping occurs at the data structure level,
    therefore use of a traditional demand-paged virtual
    memory system is not advantageous.
    The general rules for managing core storage are</p>
    <ol id="6e5">
      <li id="6e5a"><p id="6e5a1"><a href="#6e5a1">6e5a1</a>all alterations to data structures must be performed in core,</p></li>
      <li id="6e5b"><p id="6e5b1"><a href="#6e5b1">6e5b1</a>if a crum is in core, then all of its ancestors must also be there,</p></li>
      <li id="6e5c"><p id="6e5c1"><a href="#6e5c1">6e5c1</a>within the above two constraints, try to keep as much material in
      core as possible.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p id="6e6"><a href="#6e6">6e6</a>Core is assumed to be less than totally reliable, in the sense that a
    system crash may cause any information stored there to be lost.
    Disk is assumed to be more reliable, and care is taken to ensure that
    the sequencing of transfers between core and disk preserves the
    integrity of data stored on disk.
    This in turn helps ensure that system failures leave the disk in a
    consistent state so that recovery is possible.
    The procedure for changing data stored on disk is:
    first, bring the data into core;
    second, perform the actual change;
    third, write a new copy out to disk;
    and finally, after verifying that what was written to disk was correct,
    write out to disk some indication that the new copy is now the active one.</p>
    <p id="6e7"><a href="#6e7">6e7</a>The optimum procedure for managing core use in an environment that already
    has an underlying virtual memory mechanism is unclear.
    We feel that the Xanadu system itself can anticipate its own
    storage requirements and decide what to swap and when to swap it
    better than the algorithms used in typical demand-paged
    virtual memory systems.
    In some systems, however, it may not be practical to “turn off” the
    virtual memory.
    The best course in such a case is a matter for further study.</p>

</h2>
  <p id="7b"><a href="#7b">7b</a>This document describes the Xanadu Hypertext virtuality — the way it
  appears to outside users and the conventions we have established to make it
  appear that way.</p>
  <p id="7c"><a href="#7c">7c</a>The Xanadu virtuality is based on two primitive organizational structures:
  documents and links.
  A document represents some set of data, while a link represents a
  meaningful connection between some data in some documents.</p>
  <p id="7d"><a href="#7d">7d</a>A document consists of an ordered collection of characters together with
  an ordered collection of links.
  This is represented by an orgl.
  A document orgl’s first V-space, called the text space,
  contains (only) characters.
  Its second V-space, called the link space, contains (only) links
  (described below).
  It does not have any other V-spaces.</p>
  <p id="7e"><a href="#7e">7e</a><span id="7e1"><span id="7e1a"><span id="7e1a1">A link consists of three ordered sets of spans of
  characters and links inside documents.
  These sets are called {end-sets}.</span>
  The first of these three end-sets is called the {from-set}</span>
  and the second is called the {to-set}.</span>
  The link represents a directional connection from the material in the
  from-set to the material in the to-set.
  <span id="7e2">The third end-set is called the {three-set} and
  designates material pertaining to the nature of the link itself
  (i.e., what type of link it is or why it is there).</span>
  Like a document, a link is represented by an orgl.
  A link orgl has three V-spaces, one for each end-set.
  These V-spaces are unconstrained as to what type of
  atoms they should contain.
  It is conventional, however, to structure link retrieval requests to ask the
  V-stream addresses of the contents of the end-sets, rather than asking for the
  atoms themselves. This is because a link represents a connection from one
  place (or set of places) to another, in addition to representing a connection
  from one set of atoms to another.</p>
  <p id="7f"><a href="#7f">7f</a>By convention, the first thing in a link’s three-set
  represents a link type.
  Link types are represented by standardized, conventionally agreed upon
  V-stream addresses. The number of possible link types is unlimited, but a few
  standard types are defined by convention for the purposes of storing and
  organizing literary information.
  For example:</p>
  <ul id="7g">
    <li id="7g1"><p id="7g1a"><a href="#7g1a">7g1a</a>Jump link — represents a simple connection from one place to
    another. A jump link indicates that such a connection exists. The major use
    of a jump link, as its name suggests, is to designate a

    <li id="7g2"><p id="7g2a"><a href="#7g2a">7g2a</a>Quote link — represents a quotation. The material in the to-set is
    embedded at the location defined by the first element in the from-set. This

    fragments.</p></li>
    <li id="7g3"><p id="7g3a"><a href="#7g3a">7g3a</a>Footnote link — represents a footnote.
    The material in the to-set
    represents footnote-like commentary on the material in the from-set.
    The frontend may choose to display the to-set like a printed
    footnote by showing the text in the to-set at the bottom of the screen.
    The footnote link is intended to be used by the authors of documents

    A marginal note link is similar to a footnote link, but is
    intended to be used by the readers of a document to point at
    reader created commentary on the material linked from.
    It may be desirable for frontends to display marginal
    notes differently, as well.
    Also, it may be desirable to restrict retrieval of
    marginal note links to those with specific authors,
    whereas one probably wishes
    to retrieve footnote links in a less restricted manner.</p></li>

  <p id="7h"><a href="#7h">7h</a>Other useful link types are certainly possible, and what these should be is a
  matter to be settled between the designers of frontends and the users of
  system. Various kinds of semantic intent could be indicated by link types, in
  addition to regulating display and retrieval functions
  (e.g., by allowing the link type to indicate a perceived contradiction
  or agreement between the contents of the from-set and the to-set).
  Additional link types may also be
  desirable in order to support non-text or non-literary applications.</p>

  <p id="8b"><a href="#8b">8b</a>This document describes future work to be done on the system to bring it
  from its current state as a fragile, partially functional single-user, single
  processor prototype to a robust, full-fledged, multi-user distributed system.
  Some of the tasks described here are necessary before the system will be
  minimally usable. Other tasks lead to more advanced functionality.
  The tasks are listed roughly in order of priority, but the actual order of
  implementation may vary depending on funding and customer priorities.
  Each task includes a description, a justification and a very rough
  estimate of the level of effort required to complete it, given the
  present type of development environment
  (programming in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="8b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8b1a">C</span></a> under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" id="8b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8b2a">Unix</span></a> operating system).</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8c2"><a href="#8c2">8c2</a>There are a few things that are just plain wrong and need to be corrected.
    In particular:
    links currently do not follow through to versions;
    there are some garbage collection glitches,
    especially when things get complicated;
    there used to be a persistent off-by-one error deep inside the code
    which was fixed and several places that worked by compensating for it
    themselves are now broken.
    At this time, none of these bugs are serious, in the sense that they
    interfere with the current capabilities of our demonstration system.
    They will become more important as work on the system proceeds.
    We estimate that these will be fixed in the course of debugging the
    system as a whole.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8d2"><a href="#8d2">8d2</a>The current fixed-size representation requires 40 bytes for each and
    every tumbler used in the system.
    Conversion to variable length will reduce this considerably.
    Most tumblers are quite small and in the variable-length
    format will require as few as 3 bytes.
    This will tremendously increase disk and memory efficiency.
    It will also speed things up because the amount of processing that may be
    performed in-core without swapping to disk will be increased.
    Also, any given operation on the data structures will have fewer
    bytes to shuffle.
    We have devised a plan for making the transition to variable-length tumblers
    in several independent steps. The first step involves modification of the
    low-level tumbler routines to handle tumblers in either format.
    Next, the various higher-level routines get converted one-by-one to
    use the variable-length format. Once the correctness of these modifications
    is verified, the fixed-length capabilities are finally removed from the
    low-level tumbler routines.
    This is a fairly involved process and may take a couple of man-months.</p>

    <p id="8e2"><a href="#8e2">8e2</a>These improved data structures are needed to permit realization of the

    can also be used with little or no modification for the drexfilade and
    DIV poom.
    The lower level routines, which deal with bottom crums, and the
    routines which actually use the data structures to respond to requests
    will, of course, need to be modified.
    Conversion will be a two step process.
    The first step involves installing the new data structures and getting the
    system to work as it did with the old data structures.
    The second step involves adding the functionality which the new data
    structures provide that the old did not.
    These two steps together will probably require several man-months.</p>

    <h3 id="8f1">Specify and implement the new frontend/backend
    interface protocol (“Phoebe”):<a href="#8f1">8f1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="8f2"><a href="#8f2">8f2</a>A new protocol is required to reflect recent important changes in the
    system virtuality.
    Before the beginning of this year the notions of document
    and link were deeply embedded in the system design.
    In particular, the current frontend/backend interface protocol reflects the
    restricted functionality provided by documents and links rather than the
    more generalized functionality provided by unconstralned use of orgls.
    The recent generalization to orgls somewhat reduces the range of possible
    requests that the frontend can give to the backend, but the remaining
    requests become much more complex.
    In addition, the conversion from the spanfilade to the drexfilade greatly
    increases the number of different kinds of restrictions that may be
    applied to retrieval operations.</p>
    <p id="8f3"><a href="#8f3">8f3</a>Specification of a new protocol will involve an in-depth examination of
    the capabilities of the new virtuality in order to determine a set of
    requests that provides access to all of the system’s capabilities
    without undue complication.
    Once the request set is determined, the format of the requests themselves
    and the grammar for the interface language will have to be designed.</p>
    <p id="8f4"><a href="#8f4">8f4</a>Implementation of the new protocol will involve the construction of a new
    input parser for the backend and a nearly complete rewrite of those
    high-level routines directly responsible for fielding requests.</p>
    <p id="8f5"><a href="#8f5">8f5</a>Both the specification and the implementation will be fairly large
    undertakings. We estimate a month for specification: a week to get the ideas
    sorted out, a week to figure out the request set, a week to design the
    grammar and a week to write it all down.
    Specification of the interface is a necessary
    precursor to much frontend work.
    Implementation will take somewhat longer:
    a few weeks to code and debug the parser and a month or more to rewrite the
    request handling routines.
    Implementation of the new protocol need not follow
    immediately upon completion of specification.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8g2"><a href="#8g2">8g2</a>The system was implemented with a greater emphasis placed on things that
    could be readily made to work with the proper algorithmic efficiency,
    rather than on things that were efficient at a low level.
    As a consequence there are some pieces of code that are clear, correct
    and understandable and horribly slow.
    Some performance studies need to be done in order to find out where the
    real bottlenecks are.
    We have been hampered in conducting such studies by the state of the
    current release of Unix on our computers, in which the performance
    analysis and profiling tools do not work correctly.
    Performance studies have therefore been deferred until a newer release of
    the operating system software becomes available.
    The actual work of streamlining our system is an ongoing task.
    As with any complex system, there is a bottomless list of things that
    can be done to speed it up.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8h2"><a href="#8h2">8h2</a>Historical trace is a separable piece of the system, in the sense that
    the system will work without it.
    Implementation was therefore deferred until
    the rest of the system worked. Historical trace can be accomplished in two
    stages. In the first stage we build the historical trace tree with the
    individual reversible edit changes at the bottom of the data structure but
    without the higher level aggregate matrices.
    This results in a simple branching edit log allowing retrieval of any
    version by tracing the individual edits in sequence from the current orgl.
    This works, albeit very slowly.
    In the second stage we erect the higher level data structure and speed
    things up, at the price of greater complication.
    The first stage, called slow historical trace, is relatively
    straightforward and can probably be accomplished in a month or two.
    The second stage, fast historical trace, is a major project and may
    require several months. Once slow historical trace is in place and the
    interface protocol is designed to use it, implementation of fast historical
    trace will be transparent to the user
    (except that it will be faster, of course).
    It is likely, however, to be somewhat challenging to implement.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8i2"><a href="#8i2">8i2</a>Material stored in the xanadu system accretes monotonically.
    Mechanisms must be developed to identify unreferenced or little used
    material and reuse the space it occupies while archiving it in
    some sort of low-cost long-term storage.
    Mechanisms to allow material to be permanently discarded may
    also be desirable.
    In addition, storage and time inefficiencies are introduced by orgl
    fragmentation as a result of Substantial numbers of edit changes.
    One way of dealing with such fragmentation ist make a “clean copy” of the
    material in the orgl at some time “t” and then provide an orgl mapping
    from <span id="8i2a"><span id="8i2a1">V</span></span> to <span id="8i2b"><span id="8i2b1">V(t)</span></span> (the V-stream order at time “<span id="8i2c"><span id="8i2c1">t</span></span>”) in addition to the

    The major unresolved issue is the mechanism for deciding when a
    “clean copy” of some orgl should be made.
    Facilities such as these need to be both designed and implemented.
    For the first pass, we estimate a month to analyze the underlying
    problems and design solutions. The length of time required to
    realize the resulting design is unclear, but we guess that it would be
    on the order of a few months.</p>

</h3>
    <p id="8k2"><a href="#8k2">8k2</a>This is essential. It is also the biggest single task in the list of
    tasks so far.
    The implementation of multi-user <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8k2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8k2a1">Xanadu</span></a> will involve a greater
    degree of operating system dependence than is found in the present system.
    Our present notions of how to proceed are based upon <a href="http://gunkies.org/wiki/4.2_BSD" id="8k2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8k2b1">4.2BSD Unix</span></a> as the
    anticipated host operating system.
    Current plans call for multi-user <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8k2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8k2c1">Xanadu</span></a> to be implemented as a
    transaction-based system. The idea is to split backend
    requests into series of the simplest possible primitive transactions which
    involve in-core data structure operations.
    These operations don’t involve interaction with disk storage.
    Disk accesses are handled by <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8k2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8k2d1">Xanadu</span></a>’s virtual memory manager.
    A number of host dependent design issues are partially unresolved,
    and will remain so until the host environment is determined.
    These include:</p>
    <ul id="8k3">
      <li id="8k3a"><p id="8k3a1"><a href="#8k3a1">8k3a1</a>What is the most appropriate memory management scheme for the

      <li id="8k3c"><p id="8k3c1"><a href="#8k3c1">8k3c1</a>The complete mechanisms to handle berts must be designed.</p></li>
      <li id="8k3d"><p id="8k3d1"><a href="#8k3d1">8k3d1</a>Access protection and authority control mechanisms must be designed.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p id="8k4"><a href="#8k4">8k4</a>Once the complete multi-user system is designed, it must then of course be
    implemented.
    We estimate a month to study the host system, two months to
    design and specify the multi-user backend work, and
    six months to implement it.
    However, such time estimates are, at best, educated guesses at this stage.</p>

  <section id="future-various"><a href="#future-various">future-various</a>
    <h3 id="8l1">Various design improvements and corrections:<a href="#8l1">8l1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="8l2"><a href="#8l2">8l2</a>There are a few things which we would like the system to do that the
    present design cannot. We have ideas as to how these various problems can be
    solved, but the ideas need to be refined. For example:</p>
    <ul id="8l3">
      <li id="8l3a"><p id="8l3a1"><a href="#8l3a1">8l3a1</a>It cannot distinguish between the “original” of some material and a
      virtual copy if both the original and the copy are in the same orgl.
      This problem derives from the fact that virtual copies are made of
      I-spans, whereas they are referred to externally in terms of V-spans.
      The DIV Poom was the first step to solving this problem:
      in the original design, there was no way to distinguish between the
      original and the copy at all, even if they were in different orgls.
      The third axis of the DIV poom encodes the orgl of origin of
      a V-span (as opposed to the orgl of appearance).
      However, this does not enable us to determine where in that orgl the
      span came from, since this is potentially variable.
      Two possible ways of solving this problem are to change the way I-stream
      space is structured to embody a difference between copies of things,
      or to somehow dynamically keep track of how the V-stream address of a
      span shifts over time.
      Neither of these solutions is very well defined right now.</p></li>
      <li id="8l3b"><p id="8l3b1"><a href="#8l3b1">8l3b1</a>The system does not deal with the time dimension of material very well.
      In particular, we would like to be able to perform restricted retrievals
      using time as one of the dimensions of restriction.
      It seems like it would be relatively straightforward to time-stamp orgls
      as to their time of origin and most recent time of change.
      Adding time-wids to granfilade crums would also aid in filtering
      retrievals. As with the previous example. there appear to be
      things that we can do. but they need much more thought.
      Dealing effectively with the time dimension is something that we feel
      will be essential to many applications of the system.</p></li>
      <li id="8l3c"><p id="8l3c1"><a href="#8l3c1">8l3c1</a>There is undoubtedly a lot of tuning and refining that can be done
      to make things more efficient. We do not assume that our architecture is
      optimum.
      These tasks are, by their very nature, rather vague and open-ended. Much
      of the work to be done in this category involves solving unsolved design
      problems. It is difficult to estimate how long this will take when the
      result is, by definition, not known.
      We do, however, have some ideas about how to proceed on some of these
      problems and feel that they are not insoluble.
      The design work listed here is perhaps best categorized as “ongoing”.</p></li>

      highly distributed network.
      This will not be readily accomplished, but we believe that an
      intermediate step to this, which we call “semi-distributed”, is more
      feasible.
      Semi-distributed networking involves distributing the functionality of a
      single-node <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8l4b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8l4b2a">Xanadu</span></a> backend over several computers “tightly” coupled by a
      LAN. Each of the elements in this system would take responsibility for
      storing and managing parts of the different data structures, with one
      central machine acting as coordinator and request dispatcher.
      Orgls, being independent of one another, can be spread over several
      machines. The granfilade would reside on a central machine, though the
      data at which the granfilade points could be spread over several
      machines. The spanfilade, though it needs to be a centralized
      resource, could certainly be given a CPU of its own too.
      All of this is another large bite to chew.
      We guess a month or so to design it and many more to implement it.</p>

      <p id="8l6b"><a href="#8l6b">8l6b</a>“Fully-distributed” networking implies large numbers of loosely coupled
      systems each functioning without centralized control and without
      necessarily having full knowledge of the complete network topology.
      This clearly involves solving a lot of problems that are at the
      forefront of research into distributed processing.
      Much further development work will be required before fully-distributed
      networking is possible. We don’t care to even try to guess
      how long this will take, if it is possible at all.
      It is a problem we would like to work on.</p>
      <p id="8l6c"><a href="#8l6c">8l6c</a>We feel that much of the present work being done in the field of
      distributed data processing does not address the fundamental problems of
      network-based storage.
      Mainstream research in this field seems to concentrate on the problems of
      deadlock avoidance and the maintenance of data integrity.
      The <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8l6c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8l6c1a">Xanadu</span></a> mechanisms of berts and versioning side-step these problems
      entirely.
      We feel that the hardest problems in distributed data storage have
      to do with the questions of how a node in the network determines where
      non-local data is to be found and how it determines how best to route
      its queries through the network in the absence of less than perfect
      knowledge of the network layout.
      In the <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8l6c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8l6c2a">Xanadu</span></a> system this involves the problems of determining the
      existence and locations of remote links to, and remote versions of,
      local orgls and keeping track of who elsewhere knows about changes made
      locally.
      Our enfilade paradigm hints at some potential solutions to these
      problems: wids and disps may be viewed as a mechanism for representing
      partial knowledge.
      Some sort of enfiladic structure might be constructed to allow a <a href="http://xanadu.com/" id="8l6c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="8l6c3a">Xanadu</span></a>
      network node to maintain a representation of the overall network
      topology and of the contents of other nodes without requiring that the
      node have complete knowledge of everything that is happening elsewhere.
      We are fond of an analogy to the Hindu “Web of Indra”, an infinite,
      intricate latticework of jewels in which each facet of each jewel holds a
      reflection of the whole lattice, including the reflections of the whole
      in the faces of all the other jewels.</p>

<p id="9b1"><a href="#9b1">9b1</a>ABSTRACT: Well golly. It’s long. What else is there to say?</p>
  <p id="9b2"><a href="#9b2">9b2</a>This document analyzes the theoretical performance of a multi-user Xanadu
  backend, constructed according to our present plans, in terms of memory
  (core and disk) consumption and computational requirements.
  It also discusses, briefly, the performance of the present implementation

    <h3 id="9c1">Memory/CPU Overhead<a href="#9c1">9c1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="9c2"><a href="#9c2">9c2</a>The current design for a multi-user Xanadu system calls for multiple
    processes in the backend processor to share a common segment of
    core memory which will contain the in-core portions of the enfiladic
    data structures.
    Modifications to these data structures are permitted only under the
    umbrella of serializing transactions.
    Each transaction represents a single primitive operation on the data
    structures and is executed in an uninterruptable block of computation
    during which time the other processes are excluded from looking at
    or themselves modifying the system enfilades.
    Reading from disk is performed by Xanadu’s underlying virtual memory
    manager when a process attempts to read a piece of some data structure
    which is not in core.
    Writing to disk is also the job of the virtual memory manager, and
    occurs when unused portions of the data structures are swapped out of
    core to make room for things being read in or when a process requests the
    virtual memory system to checkpoint its state.</p>
    <p id="9c3"><a href="#9c3">9c3</a>The data structures required in-core for system operation are the
    granfilade (including the atoms), its bottom crums date, the spanfilade and
    some number of poomfilades.
    However, only certain parts of these data structures need be
    core-resident at any given time.
    An operation performed on the data structure reads or modifies certain
    bottom crums and their ancestors,
    and only those branches of the trees which are are currently being used
    need be kept in core.</p>
    <p id="9c4"><a href="#9c4">9c4</a>Enfilades are, in general, said to be logarithmic with the number of
    data items stored, in terms of both time to perform the various
    primitive operations and in terms of data structural storage overhead.
    Like many generalizations, this one is not completely correct.
    Storage overhead <em id="9c4a">is</em> logarithmic.
    However, certain multi-dimensional enfilades have non-logarithmic factors
    in the times required for certain useful retrieve and edit operations.
    These are discussed in more detail in the companion paper on enfilade
    theory. The worst  case involves a term varying as the square root of a
    measure of orgl size, but we are not sure of the consequences of such
    non-logarithmicities in terms of system performance on typical documents.
    We <em id="9c4b">believe</em> that they are not a significant source of inefficiency.</p>
    <p id="9c5"><a href="#9c5">9c5</a>Our memory management scheme requires that crums in core
    (i.e., the “active” crums) be accompanied by all their ancestors.
    The volume of the ancestor crums, as mentioned above, grows as the
    logarithm of the number of bottom crums in the whole system.
    Thus, core requirements vary as the product of the number of bottom crums
    in use with the logarithm of the total number of bottom crums in the
    corresponding enfilade(s).
    The amount of disk swapping over time will be directly proportional to the
    amount of change in the set of active bottom crums,
    which is effectively constant for a given number of users.</p>
    <p id="9c6"><a href="#9c6">9c6</a>The regularities of enfilades and their associated algorithms invite the
    design of a memory management system that takes explicit account both of
    disk blocks and of the (somewhat different) tree-structures in core.
    Thus, we think that Xanadu’s virtual memory manager can make more astute
    judgements about what to swap to disk than can a more general page-oriented
    virtual memory scheme.
    If Xanadu is installed on a system with such a virtual memory mechanism
    underneath, then it will need to know how much core it really has to work
    with.
    We are not sure how our virtual memory scheme would interact with those of
    list-oriented systems, since we are not current in our knowledge of
    list-oriented virtual memory techniques. We will undoubtedly learn about
    these if we work with such systems to any significant extent.</p>
    <p id="9c7"><a href="#9c7">9c7</a>Subtree sharing is used in multi-versioning orgls so that the common
    portions of different versions are stored in common.
    We believe that different versions of a given piece of material will have
    significant commonality and thus that subtree sharing will substantially
    reduce memory consumption.
    The exact degree of savings realized depends on the degree of commonality
    between versions which in turn depends upon the data being stored and on
    how the versions differ.
    Tradeoffs involving subtree sharing can better be studied when a fully
    operational system is available, since we can then see how people
    actually use it.</p>

    <h3 id="9d1">I/O Overhead<a href="#9d1">9d1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="9d2"><a href="#9d2">9d2</a>The Xanadu system makes use of two types of input/output (I/O).
    These are disk-block I/O, for data retrieval and long-term storage
    (via the virtual memory mechanism), and character I/O, for interaction
    with the frontend.</p>
    <p id="9d3"><a href="#9d3">9d3</a>The frontend/backend interface is designed to minimize backend character
    I/O. The backend transmits requested data to the frontend in a terse
    format and does not concern itself with screen management or data display
    functions, since these typically require substantial computational
    overhead and I/O bandwidth.</p>

  <section id="performance-current-implementation"><a href="#performance-current-implementation">performance-current-implementation</a>
    <h3 id="9e1">The Current Implementation<a href="#9e1">9e1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="9e2"><a href="#9e2">9e2</a>Although the present system implementation has the basic algorithmic
    efficiency described above, it is inefficient in many low-level ways.
    We believe that, in general, optimization is best left until one has a
    working system to optimize.
    Many of the data structures now contain data which is redundant or stored
    in a wasteful manner.
    For example, it is common to use a full-word integer — four bytes — to
    store a one-bit flag. This would be changed in a production system, but
    makes sense in a development system because it simplifies the code by
    eliminating the need to twiddle individual bits.
    This in turn makes it easier to get the system working in the first place.
    Many data objects which are inherently variable in size are now stored in
    fixed-size chunks of memory which are typically much larger than required
    for the average object.
    For example, all tumblers are now 40 bytes long, but a typical tumbler will
    only occupy a fraction of this space in a variable-length implementation.</p>
    <p id="9e3"><a href="#9e3">9e3</a>A single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="9e3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="9e3a1">C</span></a> <em id="9e3b">struct</em> is used to represent the upper crums of all three
    types of enfilades. This struct occupies 220 bytes in core and 164 bytes on
    disk. For storage on disk, the crums are packed into a struct which
    represents an entire loaf. The disk loaf struct is 1004 bytes long and
    contains 6 crums.
    The packing factor was chosen to enable a loaf to be stored in a single
    1024-byte disk block. A crum is read into memory together with its sibling
    crums, since disk blocks are read as wholes.
    To read in a bottom crum thus requires up to <span id="9e3c"><span id="9e3c1">6×220=1320</span></span> bytes times the
    depth of the enfilade.
    This in turn is the base-6 logarithm of the number of bottom crums in the
    whole enfilade.</p>
    <p id="9e4"><a href="#9e4">9e4</a>Granfilade bottom crums contain either characters or orgls.
    A character bottom crum may contain up to 800 characters.
    An orgl bottom crum contains a single orgl pointer.
    This is in turn a struct which can hold both a core address and a disk
    address. The disk address is the permanent location of the fullcrum of an
    orgl on disk.
    <span id="termdef-core_address">The <span id="9e4a1">core address</span> is the location in core of the core-resident
    fullcrum, if one exists (i.e., if the orgl is in core). The core location
    is null if the orgl has not been brought in from disk.</span>
    Although up to 800 characters may be packed into a granfilade character
    bottom crum, no effort has been made to similarly pack orgl bottom crums.
    This is another source of inefficiency that can be easily corrected when
    appropriate.</p>
    <p id="9e5"><a href="#9e5">9e5</a>Spanfilade and poomfilade bottom crums differ little from upper crums,
    but (like granfilade orgl bottom crums) are not tightly packed when on disk.</p>

    <h3 id="9f1">Miscellaneous Issues<a href="#9f1">9f1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="9f2"><a href="#9f2">9f2</a>The present prototype implementation spends a signicant fraction of its
    time in a few low-level routines that perform tumbler comparison and
    tumbler arithmetic: these account for between 30% and 50% of the
    system’s total CPU usage.
    Though simple, these operations are heavily used.
    Further, they require a procedure call and return each time they are
    invoked, and involve data types which are not supported by the underlying
    hardware. These characteristics make the tumbler operations good
    candidates for implementation in microcode.</p>
    <p id="9f3"><a href="#9f3">9f3</a>Another support function that consumes a lot of computational overhead is
    storage allocation and free-space management
    (involving both core and disk space).
    The present scheme is modeled on Unix’s storage allocation facilities,
    but was implemented from scratch since the Unix facilities try to gobble up
    all of the available core in the system and then blow up when they run out
    of space. The Unix storage allocation mechanism also requires an excessive
    amount of storage overhead when, as in our system. very large numbers of
    small pieces (i.e., a few bytes each) are being allocated and freed with
    great frequency. Our present storage manager is modelled after Unix’s,
    so  it is not an improvement over the Unix storage manager
    in this respect.
    There are many possible techniques for dealing with storage allocation
    that are better adapted to dealing with small pieces.
    For larger pieces, a scheme using a doubly-indirect index through a table
    to ease compaction of storage may be most appropriate.
    This would resemble the system used in

</h2>
  <p id="11b1"><a href="#11b1">11b1</a>This document describes various aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="11b1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11b1a1">C</span></a> source code for the
    current implementation of the Xanadu Hypertext System backend.
    This document is intended as a guide and reference for people examining
    the source and readers may find parts of it to be fairly meaningless
    without a
    <a href="http://udanax.xanadu.com/green/index.html" id="11b1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copy of the backend source</a>
    as a companion document.</p>
  <section id="src-coding-conventions"><a href="#src-coding-conventions">src-coding-conventions</a>
    <h3 id="11c1">CODING CONVENTIONS<a href="#11c1">11c1</a>
</h3>
    <p id="11c2"><a href="#11c2">11c2</a>The Xanadu backend is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="11c2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c2a1">C</span></a> and we try to follow a fairly small
    set of coding conventions.
    Identifiers — we use long identifiers for the names of functions and
    global variables. The purpose of long identifiers, in our estimation,
    is not merely to avoid the use of cryptic abbreviations but to enable
    an identifier to contain a complete phrase or sentence fragment
    describing the thing identified.
    Por example, a function to retrieve end-sets from the spanfilade would be
    named <span id="11c2b">retrieveendsetsfromspanfilade</span> in preference to, say,
    <span id="11c2c">retspanfends</span>.
    The purpose of this convention is to make the code more self-documenting.
    Long identifiers are used in preference to descriptive comments at the
    beginning of each function.
    There are two reasons for this: first, comments tend not to be updated in
    the frenzy of debugging and thus the comments and the actual code
    tend to drift away from each other; second, such comments are tied to the
    definitions of functions rather than to their use, thus making the purpose
    of a function call obscure if the function name is obscure.</p>
    <p id="11c3"><a href="#11c3">11c3</a>Unfortunately, the long identifier convention was not followed from the
    very beginning of implementation, and some older pieces of code contain
    functions with shorter, less descriptive names.
    Also, note that we do not use any contextual cues to indicate the
    separations between words in an identifier,
    such as underscores (<span id="11c3a">retrieve_endsets_from_spanfilade</span>) or
    capitalization (<span id="11c3b">retrieveEndsetsFromSpanfilade</span>).
    The original justification for this was that an identifier is a single
    unit, not a bunch of separate words.
    As a practical matter, if we had to do it over again we would probably
    follow the capitalization-of-interior-words convention.
    However, we feel that changing the convention in mid-implementation
    would result in confusion.</p>
    <p id="11c4"><a href="#11c4">11c4</a>Another side-issue is that in standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="11c4a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c4a1">C</span></a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" id="11c4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c4b1">Unix</span></a> environment,
    only the first eight characters of an identifier are significant
    (and only the first lseven for external symbols).
    To cope with this we use a preprocessor which
    prepends a unique sequence of characters to any long identifiers which
    disambiguates them within seven characters. Currently, this preprocessor is
    used in all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="11c4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c4c1">C</span></a> software we write.
    Soon we will be converting to <a href="http://gunkies.org/wiki/4.2_BSD" id="11c4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c4d1">4.2BSD Unix</span></a>
    which supports long identifiers directly.</p>
    <p id="11c5"><a href="#11c5">11c5</a>Formating — we use a control-structure formating convention which is
    popularly called the
    “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&amp;R_style" id="11c5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one true brace style</a>”.
    The following examples are illustrative:</p>
    <div id="src-format-control-structures">
<pre><code>if (youdontcutthatout) {
        illtellyourmother();
}

if (itdoesntwork) {
        fix();
} <em id="11c6a1">else</em>  <em id="11c6a2">if</em> (itworksrealgood) {
        sell();
} <em id="11c6a3">else</em>  {
        publish();
}

while (thecatsaway) {
        themicewillplay();
}

for (hesa(); jollygood; fellow()) {
        whicbnobodycandeny();
}

switch (swarlock) {

  case ofdynamite:
        goboom();
        break;

  case ofcoke:
        takea();
        break;

  default:
        thebankloses();
        break;
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="#src-format-control-structures">src-format-control-structures</a>
</p></div>
    <p id="11c7"><a href="#11c7">11c7</a>Functions are formated according to the following pattern:</p>
    <div id="src-format-functions">
<pre><code>typeofreturneddata
functionname (firstargument, secondargument)
  typeoffirstargument   firstargument;
  typeorsecondargument  secondargument;
{
  typeoffirsttemporaryvariable firsttemporaryvariable;
  typeofsecondtemporaryvariable secondtemporaryvariable;

        bodyoffunction;
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="#src-format-functions">src-format-functions</a>
</p></div>
    <p id="11c9"><a href="#11c9">11c9</a>Another formating convention we often follow is to keep very long lines
    “as is”, rather than splitting them up.
    This is partially due to the fact that nobody has been able to agree
    upon a consistent convention for splitting lines and partially to
    enable us to unambiguously locate things using
    “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep" id="11c9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grep</a>”.
    It does, however, result in some ugliness if the code is displayed or
    printed on a narrow (i.e., 80 columns or less) device.</p>
    <p id="11c10"><a href="#11c10">11c10</a>Use of types — We follow the practice of defining new data types for any
    structs that are used. In addition, types are defined for common uses of
    normal data types such as ints. Most type names begin with “<span id="11c10a">type</span>”, for
    example:</p>
    
    <p id="11c12"><a href="#11c12">11c12</a>An historical artifact found in some of the code is that many types are
    defined using <span id="11c12a">#define</span> rather than <span id="11c12b">typedef</span>.
    These definitions date back to the initial phases of implementation in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDS_C" id="11c12c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c12c1">BDS C</span></a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M" id="11c12d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c12d1">CP/M</span></a> based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" id="11c12e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id="11c12e1">C</span></a> dialect which lacks the <span id="11c12f">typedef</span> construct.</p>
    <p id="11c13"><a href="#11c13">11c13</a>Comments — As a rule, we are sparing in our use of comments. It has been
    our experience that comments and the implementation have a tendency to drift
    away from each other (as mentioned above).
    Comments are reserved for explaining things that are difficult to make
    obvious from the structure of the code itself
    (i.e., things which can’t be made self-documenting).
    These are things such as efficiency hacks for optimization, kludges of
    any kind, obscure debugging fixes, and peculiar data structure use.
    Comments are also used to block out pieces of code for debugging purposes.
    If, when debugging, some function is found to require revisions which are
    either substantial or subtle, it is our practice to “comment out” the
    offending piece of code, make a copy, and then modify the copy.
    This enables us to recover the old version if we really mess up the new one.
    To aid in this, our preprocessor supports recursively nested comments.
    This enables us to comment out sections of code, which may themselves
    contain comments, with impunity.</p>
