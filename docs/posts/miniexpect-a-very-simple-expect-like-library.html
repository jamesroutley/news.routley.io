    <h1>Miniexpect â€“ A very simple expect-like library</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <div><pre>miniexpect is a very simple expect-like library

It has a saner interface than libexpect, and doesn&#39;t depend on Tcl.
It is also thread safe, const-correct and uses modern C standards.

It is standalone, except that it requires the PCRE2 (Perl Compatible
Regular Expressions) library from <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcre.org/</a>.  The PCRE2
dependency is fundamental because we want to offer the most powerful
regular expression syntax to match on, but more importantly because
PCRE2 has a convenient way to detect partial matches which made this
library very simple to implement.

License
-------

The library was written by Richard W.M. Jones &lt;rjones@redhat.com&gt;
and is licensed under the Library GPL (LGPL) version 2 or above.

Source is available from: <a href="http://git.annexia.org/?p=miniexpect.git;a=summary" rel="nofollow">http://git.annexia.org/?p=miniexpect.git;a=summary</a>

Using the library
-----------------

If you wanted to copy the library into your own code (instead of
linking to it as a dependency), you only need to copy the two files:
miniexpect.h, miniexpect.c.

The API is documented in the manual page (miniexpect.pod / miniexpect.3).

For examples of how to use the API in reality, see the examples and
tests in the source directory.
