					<p>This graph showing year on year performance is made up of thousands of <a href="https://www.passmark.com/products/pt.htm">PerformanceTest</a> benchmark results
							and is updated bi-weekly (i.e. every two weeks). The chart is composed of data from PerformanceTest
							V5 to the V11. PerformanceTest V8 (released 2012) was the first version to collect single thread performance. The
							different data series can be enabled or disabled by checking the corresponding checkboxes below the graph.</p>
