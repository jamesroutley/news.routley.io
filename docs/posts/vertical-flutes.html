The standard (&#34;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_flute">transverse</a>&#34;)
flute has pretty terrible ergonomics: your arms are way out to the
side.  Most woodwinds use a much more natural playing position where
the arms are comfortably in front of you, including some (&#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-blown_flute">end-blown</a>&#34;)
flutes.  In the case of the flute, however, this gives a pretty
different sound.  Could we give up on the simple cylindrical design of
the flute to get some thing that sounds like a transverse flute and
plays like a transverse flute but is more ergonomic?

</p><p>

Yes!  By putting a bend in the head joint it&#39;s possible to do just
that.  This is a common configuration for bass flutes and lower:

You can get a replacement head joint for a standard concert flute,
though it&#39;s pricy:

I don&#39;t know why this isn&#39;t more common?  Do people not like that it
looks unusual?  Katherine Saenger looked into this some (<a href="https://www.nyfluteclub.org/uploads/2020-2021/FluteFair-2021/FluteFair2021-angled-headjoints2-low.pdf">pdf</a>)
and claims that the main options for concert flute today don&#39;t sound
great but better-sounding ones are possible.  Has anyone tried these?

I really like going in the water and this beach is a great place for
building sand castles and boogie boarding.  I also like trying to
float on top of big waves.  I&#39;m not very good at it.  I only float on
the flat waves.
