    <h1>Ask HN: Where Do Seasoned Devs Look for Short-Term Work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN</p><p>In a short form question: If you do, where do you look for a short time projects?</p><p>I&#39;d like to put my skill set to use and work on a project, I&#39;m available for 6-9 months. The problem seems to be for me, that I cannot find any way of finding such project.</p><p>I&#39;m quite skilled, I have 15 years of experience, first 3 as a system administrator, then I went full on developer - have been full stack for 2 of those years, then switched my focus fully on the backend - and ended up as platform data engineer - optimizing the heck out of systems to be able to process data fast and reliably at larger scale.</p><p>I already went through UpWork, Toptal and such and to my disappointment, there was no success to be found.</p><p>Do you know of any project boards, or feature bounty platforms, that I could use to find a short time project?</p><p>Thank you for your wisdom :)</p></div></div></div>
