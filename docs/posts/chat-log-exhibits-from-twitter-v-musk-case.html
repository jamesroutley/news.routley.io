    <h1>Chat log exhibits from Twitter v. Musk case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a scan/OCR of Exhibits H and J from the Twitter v. Musk case, with some of the conversations de-interleaved and of course converted from a fuzzy scan to text to make for easier reading.</p>

<p>I did this so that I could easily read this and, after reading it, I&#39;ve found that most accountings of what was said are, in one way or another, fairly misleading. Since the texts aren&#39;t all that long, if you&#39;re interested in what they said, <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/dunning-kruger/">I would recommended that you just read the texts in their entirety</a> (to the extent they&#39;re available ‚Äî¬†the texts make it clear that some parts of conversations are simply not included) instead of reading what various journalists excerpted, which seems to sometimes be deliberately misleading because selectively quoting allows them to write a story that matches their agenda and sometimes accidentally misleading because they don&#39;t know what&#39;s interesting about the texts.</p>

<p>If you want to compare these conversations to other executive / leadership conversations, you can compare them to <a href="https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/us-v-ms/">Microsoft emails and memos that came out of the DoJ case against Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/">Enron email dataset</a>.</p>

<li><b>Alex Shillings [IT specialist for SpaceX / Elon]</b>: Elon- are you able to access your Twitter account ok? I saw a number of emails held in spam. Including some password resets attempts</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: I haven&#39;t tried recently</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Am staying off twitter</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Is my twitter account posting anything?</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Not posting but I see one deactivation email and a dozen password reset emails. Assuming this is a scammer attempt but wanted to check to ensure you still had access to your Twitter</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: It Is someone trying to hack my twitter</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: But I have two-factor enabled with the confirmation app</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: OK, great to hear.</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Yes -FaceTimed with them to confirm my identity(hah) and they are hopefully gonna reset your 2FA to SMS soon. Asking for an update now</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Sounds good</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: I can also FaceTime with them if still a problem</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Tldr; your account is considered high profile internally over there. So they&#39;ve made it very hard to make changes like this by their teams. They are working through it...</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Happy to FaceTime directly</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Not sure how I was able to make Twitter work on this new phone, as I didn&#39;t use the backup code.</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Connecting with their head of Trust &amp; Safety now</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: I assume we used your old phone to verify the new, once upon a time</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Oh yeah</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: They can fix it by disabling all 2FA for your account which will let you in and then you can re-enable it. Are you available in 90 mins to have them coordinate it?</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: [&#34;liked&#34; above]</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: I know things are in flux right now, but is EMDesk SpaceX still your primary calendar? I realize there a meeting on there in 1 hour. In case I should move this twitter fix out a bit.</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: Yeah</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: But I can step off the call briefly ta Face Time them if need be
Alex: Sounds good. And ideally I&#39;m just texting you ta sign in once they disable 2FA and then you can immediately sign in and re-enable. No FaceTime needed.</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: [&#34;liked&#34; above]</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Elon-we are ready to make the change if you are</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: [&#34;liked&#34; above]</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: 2FA disabled. Please try to log in now</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: Able to get back in ok?</li>
<li><b>Elon</b>: [&#34;liked&#34; above]</li>
<li><b>Alex</b>: And once in you can enable 2FA Settings&gt; Security and account access&gt; Security&gt; 2FA Alex Stillings</li>
