      <span>Abstract:</span>  Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are a promising tool for
designing scalable, coordination-free distributed systems. However,
constructing correct CRDTs is difficult, posing a challenge for even seasoned
developers. As a result, CRDT development is still largely the domain of
academics, with new designs often awaiting peer review and a manual proof of
correctness. In this paper, we present Katara, a program synthesis-based system
that takes sequential data type implementations and automatically synthesizes
verified CRDT designs from them. Key to this process is a new formal definition
of CRDT correctness that combines a reference sequential type with a
lightweight ordering constraint that resolves conflicts between non-commutative
operations. Our process follows the tradition of work in verified lifting,
including an encoding of correctness into SMT logic using synthesized inductive
invariants and hand-crafted grammars for the CRDT state and runtime. Katara is
able to automatically synthesize CRDTs for a wide variety of scenarios, from
reproducing classic CRDTs to synthesizing novel designs based on specifications
in existing literature. Crucially, our synthesized CRDTs are fully,
automatically verified, eliminating entire classes of common errors and
reducing the process of producing a new CRDT from a painstaking paper proof of
correctness to a lightweight specification.
