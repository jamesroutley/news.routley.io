         <p><a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/638/2/Story.pdf" target="_blank">Palomar Observatory</a> is among the most iconic scientific facilities in the world, and a crown jewel in the research traditions of Caltech. Conceived of nearly 100 years ago, the observatory has been in continuous scientific operation since the mid-30s, and remains productive and relevant today. Palomar is most directly the vision of <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hale-george-ellery.pdf" target="_blank">George Ellery Hale</a> (1868–1938). In a tour-de-force effort framed by the challenges of the Great Depression and the Second World War, Hale and a dedicated group of astronomers, engineers, technicians, and builders secured funding, designed the telescopes and site, and created the Observatory in much the same state as it exists today.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>George Ellery Hale was the person most responsible for the building of Palomar Observatory. A graduate of <a href="http://web.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a> and a founder of Caltech, in 1928 he secured a grant of $6 million from the <a href="http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org" target="_blank">Rockefeller Foundation</a> for the fabrication of a 200-inch reflecting telescope.<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>  During the 1930s, he assembled a remarkable team of engineers and designers from academia and industry. Under his direction, these people set to work on the mirror, on the mounting, and on the dome and its support facilities on Palomar Mountain. A triumph of innovation, insight, persistence, and precision the telescope was dedicated in June 1948 ten years after Hale&#39;s death.<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup>  This is the <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html">Hale Telescope</a> at Palomar Observatory, an instrument that after many decades of service continues to play a leading role in the advancement of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>

         <!--But in taking spectra of supernovae in galaxy after galaxy he also noticed that in many galaxies the quantity of visible matter was insufficient to account for the observed rates of rotation. There must, he reasoned, be more matter than can be detected by conventional means. As a result, he put forward an idea proposing the existence of what we would now call “dark matter.”It was an idea that was not well received at the time. Subject to an array of personality quirks, his advocacy of so bizarre a concept may well have contributed to his ostracism at Palomar. He was awarded very little time on the Hale Telescope. -->
      
      <!--h4 id="hubble">Edwin Hubble</h4>
      
         <p>Hubble was the first astronomer to use the Hale Telescope following its dedication in 1948. His image of NCG 2261 has been described. However, Hubble experienced a heart attack in July 1949 and was able to pursue only a greatly reduced work schedule for the next four years until his death on September 28, 1953.<sup>[<a href="#48">48</a>]</sup> </p-->
