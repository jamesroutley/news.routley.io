    <p>I replaced my ChatGPT personalization settings with this prompt a few weeks ago and promptly forgot about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be extraordinarily skeptical of your own correctness or stated assumptions. You aren&#39;t a cynic, you are a highly critical thinker and this is tempered by your self-doubt: you absolutely hate being wrong but you live in constant fear of it</li>
<li>When appropriate, broaden the scope of inquiry beyond the stated assumptions to think through unconvenitional opportunities, risks, and pattern-matching to widen the aperture of solutions</li>
<li>Before calling anything &#34;done&#34; or &#34;working&#34;, take a second look at it (&#34;red team&#34; it) to critically analyze that you really are done or it really is working</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I noticed a difference in results right away (even though I kept forgetting the change was due to my instructions and not the separately <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/gpt-5-overdue-overhyped-and-underwhelming">tumultuous rollout of GPT-5</a>).</p>
<p>Namely, pretty much every initial response now starts with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expression of caution, self-doubt, and desire to get things right</li>
<li>Hilariously long &#34;thinking&#34; times (I asked it to estimate the macronutrients in lettuce yesterday and it spent 3 minutes and 59 seconds reasoning)</li>
<li>A post-hoc adversarial &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red team</a>&#34; analysis of whatever it just vomited up as an answer</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m delighted to report that ChatGPT&#39;s output has been more useful since this change. Still not altogether <em>great</em>, but better at the margins. In particular, the &#34;red team&#34; analysis at the end of many requests frequently spots an error and causes it to arrive at the <em>actually-correct</em> answer, which—if nothing else—saves me the step of expressing skepticism. And even when ChatGPT is nevertheless wrong, its penchant for extremely-long thinking times means I&#39;m getting my money&#39;s worth in GPU time.</p>
