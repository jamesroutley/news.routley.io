One of the less emphasized of these costs is fraud. To enrich themselves, managers who own a relatively small fraction of the stock might be willing to break the law, even when the cost of breaking the law from the company’s point of view exceeds its benefits. Is corporate fraud a major component of the agency costs of public ownership? Should regulation do something to reduce this cost?</p><p>Before we even try to answer these questions, we need to establish how pervasive corporate fraud is. Is the fraud we observe the whole iceberg or just its visible tip? The answer to this question requires an estimate of the ratio of the exposed tip to the submerged portion, also known as the detection likelihood. Thus far in the literature, approaches to estimating the detection likelihood (and by implication the hidden prevalence of fraud) have included (i) accounting misconduct prediction models (Beneish <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Beneish, M.D. 1999.

In this paper, we introduce a fourth approach, which relies on a natural experiment: the 2001 demise of Arthur Andersen (AA).</p><p>The simple idea is that after the AA demise, former AA clients were subject to vastly increased scrutiny. They found themselves in the spotlight of the media, investment intermediaries, short-sellers, and their internal gatekeepers. In addition, they were forced to seek a different audit firm. Given the extreme cloud of suspicion that was covering AA clients immediately after the Enron scandal exploded (Chaney and Philipich <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Chaney, Paul K., and Kirk L.

Even if this increased scrutiny does not reveal all the existing fraud, the Kolmogorov axiom of conditional probability allows us to derive an upper-bound (and thereby conservative) estimate of the detection likelihood, which in turn provides us with a lower-bound estimate of the pervasiveness of corporate fraud.</p><p>As we explain in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Sec2">2</a>, we use the term “fraud” loosely, since what we measure is some form of misconduct or alleged fraud. To estimate the detection likelihood, we use several different measures. The first measure is auditor-detected securities fraud from Dyck et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Dyck, A., A. Morse, and L. Zingales. 2010. Who blows the whistle on corporate fraud? Journal of Finance 65 (6): 2213–2254." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR20" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e467">2010</a>) (hereafter “DMZ”). The second is SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) from Dechow et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2011" title="Dechow, P.M., G.E. Weili, C.R. Larson, and R.G. Sloan. 2011. Predicting material accounting misstatements. Contemporary Accounting Research 28 (1): 17–82." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e470">2011</a>). The third is financial misreporting not due to simple clerical errors. The last one is all securities fraud under SEC section 10b-5.</p><p>We find that the detection likelihood varies depending on the measure used: 0.29 for auditor-detected securities fraud, 0.34 for accounting restatements, 0.47 for securities fraud at large, and 0.52 for AAERs. All of the estimates are statistically significant and robust to a host of potential omitted differences between the firms audited by Arthur Andersen and the rest (e.g., industry focus, regional variation, and importance of IPOs). Our estimates represent an upper bound of the detection likelihood, which implies that our estimates of unobserved fraud are conservatively low. The best estimate of the detection likelihood is 0.33, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.24 and 0.45.<sup><a href="#Fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup> Fraud is indeed like an iceberg with significant undetected fraud beneath the surface.</p><p>With our estimates of the detection likelihood, we can calculate the pervasiveness of corporate fraud as a function of the definition of fraud we adopt. Accounting violations are widespread: in an average year, 41% of companies misrepresent their financial reports, even when we ignore simple clerical errors. Fortunately, securities fraud is less pervasive. In an average year, 10% of all large public corporations commit (alleged) securities fraud, with a 95% confidence interval between 7 and 14%.</p><p>Having estimated the pervasiveness of fraud, we can calculate the losses produced by fraud using cost estimates from the prior literature. For detected frauds, we use the decline in equity value at the revelation of the fraud as estimated by Karpoff et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Karpoff, J.M., D.S. Lee, and G.S. Martin. 2008. The cost to firms of cooking the books. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 43 (3): 581–612." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR27" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e492">2008</a>) (henceforth “KLM”). For undetected frauds, we apply the average value lost due to cover-up, as estimated by Beneish et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2013" title="Beneish, M.D., C.M.C. Lee, and D. Nichols. 2013. Earnings manipulation and expected returns. Financial Analysts Journal 69 (2): 57–82." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR7" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e495">2013</a>). Combining these detected and undetected fraud losses – 25% and 11% of the equity value, respectively – to the proportion of frauds detected (0.33) and undetected (0.67) results in an average fraud cost of 16% of equity value. Putting together our estimate of the pervasiveness of fraud (10%) with the per-firm cost of fraud (16%), we arrive to an expected annual cost of fraud of 1.6% of the total equity value of US public firms (with a 95% interval between 1.2% and 2.2%). Hence, the annual cost of fraud among US corporations at the end of our sample period (2004) is $254 billion or – bringing our cost calculation forward to 2021 – $830 billion. If we compare the 2004 expected cost of fraud with the $19.9 billion of annual SOX compliance cost (as estimated by Hochberg et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Hochberg, Y.V., P. Sapienza, and A. Vissing-Jorgensen. 2009. A lobbying approach to evaluating the Sarbanes-Oxley.

They do not find a similar result for small firms, likely due to a greater rejection of small AA clients with dubious accounting by Big Four auditors. We find that when we look at all auditors (not just Big Four), the revelation of misconduct is more likely in small former AA clients than in similar-sized non-AA clients.</p><p>Finally, our paper also builds off the literature seeking to understand the costs associated with corporate fraud, both in direct reputation effects (Karpoff and Lott <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1993" title="Karpoff, J.M., and J.R.

As one court observed, “The law does not define fraud; it needs no definition; it is as old as falsehood and as versatile as human ingenuity.”<sup><a href="#Fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup> In a similar vein, the Fourth Circuit noted that “fraud is a broad term, which includes false representations, dishonesty and deceit.”<sup><a href="#Fn3"><span>Footnote </span>3</a></sup> Thus, it is not easy to define corporate fraud precisely. Securities law defines securities fraud as “to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”<sup><a href="#Fn4"><span>Footnote </span>4</a></sup> Since our primary measure derives from securities class actions, we assume that definition and regard corporate fraud primarily as misrepresentation.</p><p>In spite of this ambiguity, the established legal practice requires the presence of three elements to label an act of misconduct fraud: misrepresentation, materiality, and intent. As we will explain below, all our measures of misconduct contain an element of misrepresentation. We do our best to set a minimum threshold to ensure materiality. Where we cannot deliver is on intent. Intent can only be proven in court, and all these alleged fraud cases are settled before they reach the final verdict, since directors’ and officers’ insurance does not indemnify executives if they are convicted in court (see, for example, the data and discussion in Black et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Black, B., B.R. Cheffins, and M. Klausner. 2006. Outside director liability. Stanford Law Review 58 (4): 1055–1159." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR8" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e588">2006</a>)). As a result, all the corporate fraud we discuss is <i>alleged</i> fraud that was settled out of court.</p><p>To capture alleged fraud we resort to four different measures. The first measure is financial misrepresentations exposed by auditors. To construct “auditor-detected fraud,” we start with SEC <i>Rule 10b-5</i> securities fraud from DMZ’s dataset of class actions suits. To ensure comprehensiveness, DMZ focus on large firms (those with over $750 million in assets) so that a potential payoff from a suit would be sufficiently attractive to mobilize monitoring by legal actors.<sup><a href="#Fn5"><span>Footnote </span>5</a></sup> To remove frivolous suits, DMZ impose a series of filters, building on the existing legal literature.<sup><a href="#Fn6"><span>Footnote </span>6</a></sup> The final step is to restrict the DMZ sample to frauds that are revealed directly or indirectly by an auditor. Directly revealed by the auditors are frauds where the auditor in DMZ was the whistleblower. Indirectly revealed by the auditor are frauds where the auditor issued a qualified opinion and the whistleblower in DMZ is either the company itself or an analyst. For these latter cases, we reread the auditor’s qualifying opinion in the DMZ cases where the company itself or an analyst was the whistleblower and dropped two cases where the fraud could not be plausibly related to the reason why the audit opinion was qualified.</p><p>The second measure is financial misrepresentation that led to an Accounting and Auditing Enforcement by the SEC, as contained in the AAER dataset created by Dechow et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2011" title="Dechow, P.M., G.E. Weili, C.R. Larson, and R.G.

Since 1982, the SEC has issued Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) during or at the conclusion of an investigation against a company, an auditor, or an officer for alleged accounting or auditing misconduct. The benefit of this sample is that all AAERs are likely to be material violations, since an AAER release by the SEC is considered a severe step meant to attract attention. Dechow et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2011" title="Dechow, P.M., G.E. Weili, C.R. Larson, and R.G.

Furthermore, as the SEC website notices, “[AAER] only highlights certain actions and is not meant to be a complete and exhaustive compilation of all of the actions that fall into this category.”<sup><a href="#Fn7"><span>Footnote </span>7</a></sup> For example, during the period 2001–2014, there were, on average, 54 AAERs per year, versus 220 securities class actions (Soltes <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2019" title="Soltes, E.F. 2019.

To obtain such a measure, we start from the most widely employed data on restatements: the Audit Analytics database. We then use the Audit Analytics classification to separate clerical errors from intentional implementation of misstatements.</p><p>Finally, the fourth measure of fraud is the full set of SEC section 10b-5 securities fraud cases. While all 10b-5 cases arise from some material misstatements or omissions in providing material information, they also include non-auditing-related misrepresentations, like this example from DMZ: “The Department of Justice indicts Sotheby’s for price fixing after a long investigation of the art industry. Shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose that a large portion of their revenues are being derived from the unsustainable high prices achieved through the pricing arrangement with Christie’s” (DMZ Appendix, 2010). In this example, no <i>accounting</i> violation has occurred, but omitting the economic implications of fixing prices represents an SEC rule 10b-5 violation. In DMZ, 35% of the 10b-5 violations are omissions of information concerning an underlying legal violation, as in the Sotheby’s example. Rather than using the original DMZ set of 10b-5 class actions, we use the updated dataset from the Securities Class Action Clearinghouse, as compiled by Kempf and Spalt (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2022" title="Kempf, E., and O.

The data are monthly from 1997 to 2005, and a company is classified as committing a fraud during a certain month if that month falls within the fraud period determined after detection. When the measure we use is accounting restatements, the fraction of firms involved in fraud is large (on average 13% per year, plotted with magnitudes on the right axis) and increasing over time (which might reflect the increased complexity of the accounting rules). All the other measures of misconduct produce a much lower incidence – between 1 and 4% of firms (plotted with magnitudes on the left axis) – with a pronounced hump shape centered around the turn of the millennium.

Our main agenda is to estimate what percentage of initiated frauds are caught. We refer to this percentage as the detection likelihood.</p><p>Our methodology relies on two key ingredients – the Kolmogorov axiom of conditional probability and the Arthur Andersen natural experiment. The pervasiveness of corporate fraud is the probability of a firm engaging in fraud (denoted <i>F</i>), regardless of whether it is caught or not: <span>\(Pr\left(F\right)\)</span>. What we observe instead is the joint event of a firm engaging in fraud and being caught: <span>\(\bf Pr\left(\boldsymbol{F},\boldsymbol{caught}\right)\)</span>. (We will use the convention of bolding the variables we observe.) By the law of conditional probability, the unconditional probability of engaging in a fraud can be written as:</p><div id="Equ1"><p><span>$$\Pr (F)=\frac{{\mathbf{Pr}}\left(\boldsymbol{F},\kern0.25em \boldsymbol{caught}\right)}{{Pr}\left( caught| F\right)}$$</span></p><p>
                    (1)
                </p></div><p>Thus, if we knew the denominator, <span>\({{Pr}}\left(caught | F\right)\)</span>, we could calculate <span>\({Pr}\left(F\right).\)</span>  </p><p>Our experiment derives an upper bound of <span>\({{Pr}}\left(caught | F\right)\)</span> and thus a lower bound of <span>\({Pr}\left(F\right)\)</span> by comparing the frequency of revealed fraud in “normal” times with the frequency of revealed fraud in a sample where scrutiny increased substantially. In our experiment, the sample of firms under enhanced scrutiny is the set of Arthur Andersen (AA) clients after the AA demise following the Enron scandal. On October 22, 2001, Enron acknowledged an SEC inquiry concerning possible conflicts of interest in various partnerships (Barton <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Barton, Jan. 2005.

On November 23, 2001, the <i>New York Times</i> ran an article with the headline “From Sunbeam to Enron: Andersen’s Reputation Suffers.” Thus, we assume that the period of enhanced scrutiny started after November 30, 2001, a date to which we refer as “the watershed date.”<sup><a href="#Fn8"><span>Footnote </span>8</a></sup> Since roughly one-fifth of all large publicly traded firms had AA as their auditor in 2001, this event provides a natural experiment of increased scrutiny of firms. We look at the revelation of fraud that started being perpetrated before the watershed date. Thus, we can ignore any deterrence effect, since the enhanced scrutiny produced by Enron’s crisis was unexpected.</p><p>One source of the increased scrutiny is the new auditors (Chen and Zhou <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Chen, K.Y., and J.

              <p>AA’s indictment by the Department of Justice and its initial conviction for obstruction of justice may make this a surprising assumption. Yet, the initial conviction of AA was for obstruction of justice, not for being a bad auditor, and it was unanimously overturned upon appeal.</p><p>More convincingly, the accounting literature has concluded that there was no difference between AA and other auditors in terms of auditing rigor.

The firms in the set are large (&gt; $750 million in assets) US corporations with data in Compustat. We identify auditors using the Compustat “AU” item, mapping the auditor who signs a financial statement to the calendar month-year of the report. We use two sets of non-AA clients: all non-AA clients and the subset of all non-AA clients that are audited by another of the Big Five audit firms. Statistics are collapsed to one observation per firm over the time period. A firm appears in multiple columns only if it switches auditors. Because of auditor transitions and firms’ delisting during the three-year period, the sample of AA firms is larger than in the subsequent tables, where we require a firm to be audited by AA in 2001.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Statistics: Arthur Andersen Clients (AA) and Non-AA Clients, 1998–2000</b></figcaption></figure></div><p>Panel A reports that AA clients are statistically similar to other Big Five clients in assets, sales, and EBITDA, but have higher leverage (long term debt-to-assets). The leverage difference suggests a difference in industry composition, which is what we present in Panel B. For example, compared to Big Five auditors that are not AA, AA has at least 2 percentage points fewer clients in the industries of Banks &amp; Insurance, Retail &amp; Wholesale, and Computers, and 2 percentage points more clients in Utilities, Refining &amp; Extractive, Communication &amp; Transport, and Services &amp; Healthcare. We return to these industry compositional differences in our empirical specifications.</p><p>Were AA clients more fraudulent?

For the discrete variables of caught fraud – <i>auditor-caught frauds</i>, <i>AAERs</i>, <i>restatements</i>, and <i>SCAC securities fraud</i> – we define a fraud event if the event ever occurs in the three-year period.

However, when we use, as a measure of fraud, all SCAC cases (including for instance price fixing), the level of alertness was less. The reason is that some of the detectors with enhanced incentives (like the new auditors) have no role in uncovering these types of fraud.

The former AA engagement partner moved to another audit firm, bringing the account. This continued relationship might reduce the new auditor’s willingness to “clean the dirty laundry”; yet it is hard to imagine that such relationships will completely eliminate the power of the experiment. Speaking about a firm that went from AA to Grant Thornton, the CEO of Grant Thornton testified at trial that “we converted it to a Grant Thornton audit approach and Grant Thornton audit-quality controls, and we had other people review the engagement.”<sup><a href="#Fn12"><span>Footnote </span>12</a></sup> Thus, even when the audit partner remains the same, the new audit firm performs an extra screening.</p><p>A more general concern is that the increased attention on corporate fraud that followed the Enron and WorldCom scandals might have prompted the SEC (or the other auditors not affected by the turnover) to become more active in detecting fraud. In the limit, if this enhanced scrutiny exposed all fraud in all firms, there will be no difference between the amount of fraud revealed in AA clients and the amount of fraud revealed in clients of other audit firms, invalidating our experiment.

For each company, we observe whether fraud is discovered during the so-called detection period, both for companies that were AA clients and for companies that were not. This experiment can be thought of as a sum of Bernoulli trials, which can be modeled using a Poisson probability distribution, where the mean <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is the proportion of firms discovered as fraudulent per unit of time. The maximum likelihood estimate of <span>\(\lambda\)</span> in a Poisson distribution is simply the frequency of fraud during the detection period. To facilitate a system estimation (see below), we will estimate this mean <span>\(\lambda\)</span> with a Poisson regression, where <span>\(E\left(Y|X\right)=\lambda ={e}^{\theta x}\)</span>.</p><p>In this framework, the object of our interest (i.e., the detection likelihood (<span>\(Pr\left(\left.caught\right|F,\overline{AA}\right)=\frac{\mathbf{Pr\left(\left.F,caught\right|\overline{AA}\right)}}{\mathbf{Pr\left(\left.F,caught\right|AA\right)}}\)</span><b>)</b> is simply the relative risk (RR) of a firm being caught committing a fraud if it is not an AA former client versus if it is an AA former client. Thus, the detection likelihood is simply the ratio of the frequency of fraud in the two samples. Given the paucity of fraud observations, we compute the exact p-values of this ratio in finite samples. Following Agresti (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1992" title="Agresti, A. 1992.

We define a company as having AA as an auditor if AA signed a financial report anytime in the calendar year 2001, irrespective of the firm’s fiscal year. All companies without AA as auditor during this period are non-AA clients. We consider that a fraud was revealed during the detection period if the fraud started before the watershed date of November 30, 2001, and came to light between the watershed date and the end of 2003 (the detection period). Note that our estimates are obtained from the ratio of the fraud caught in AA and non-AA firms. Thus, as long as the amount of fraud committed in AA and non-AA clients responds to cyclical fluctuations in a similar fashion, our estimates are not affected by business cycle fluctuations in the <i>aggregate</i> level of fraud, an important phenomenon documented by Wang et al.

The natural experiment includes 353 AA clients in the pre-period who survive at least one year in the post-period, and 2,404 non-AA client firms. The number of detected fraud events depends on the fraud measure: 168 restatements, 63 SCACs, 59 AAERs, and 21 auditor-detected fraud.</p><h3 id="Sec10"><span>4.1 </span>Detection likelihood results</h3><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>, Panel A reports the main detection likelihood estimates across the four fraud measures – <i>auditor-detected fraud</i>, <i>AAER</i>s, <i>restatements</i>, and <i>SCAC securities fraud</i>. For each of these measures, the estimated coefficient of the Poisson regression we report is the coefficient of a dummy variable equal to one if a company was a former AA client. Thus, if former AA clients have an average frequency of fraud of <span>\({\lambda }_{AA}={e}^{{\theta }_{AA}x}\)</span> and non-AA clients have an average frequency of fraud of <span>\({\lambda }_{N}={e}^{{\theta }_{N}x}\)</span>, the estimated coefficient we report is <span>\({\theta }_{AA}-{\theta }_{N}\)</span>. Since the detection likelihood ratio is nothing but <span>\(\frac{{\lambda }_{N}}{{\lambda }_{AA}}=\frac{{e}^{{\theta }_{N}}}{{e}^{{\theta }_{AA}}}={e}^{{\theta }_{N}-{\theta }_{AA}}\)</span>, we obtain the detection likelihood ratio as <span>\(\frac{1}{{e}^{{\theta }_{AA}-{\theta }_{N}}}\)</span>, or the inverse of <i>e</i> raised it to the power of the estimated coefficient.

These findings verify the assumption that after the demise of AA more frauds are caught in AA firms than in non-AA firms (<span>\(Pr\left({\text{caught}}|F|AA\right)&gt;Pr\left({{caught}}|F|\overline{AA }\right)\)</span>).</p><p>More specifically, when we look at <i>auditor-detected fraud</i>, the estimated detection likelihood is 0.29, which is different from 1 at the 3% level. For <i>AAERs</i>, the detection likelihood estimate is 0.52, different from 1 at the 7% level. The detection likelihood estimate for accounting violations is 0.34, different from one at the 0.1% level. For the <i>SCAC securities fraud</i> measure, the detection likelihood is 0.47, different from 1 at the 2% level.<sup><a href="#Fn13"><span>Footnote </span>13</a></sup> In sum, despite the different sources and the different definitions of fraud, there is a clear result: a substantial amount of corporate fraud remains undetected. With detection likelihood between 29 and 52%, there is indeed an iceberg of undetected fraud that ranges between 48 and 71% of total fraud.</p><p>If we want to move beyond this simple result and estimate more precisely the amount of undetected fraud, we need to pool together all the possible observations toward the estimation of a single detection likelihood. This is what we do in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>, Panel B. The first column reports the estimates obtained by estimating simultaneously the four Poisson regressions, with the restriction that the coefficient should be the same in all four. When we pool the four measures of fraud, the estimated detection likelihood is 0.38, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.30 and 0.49. Thus, we can say with 95% confidence that between 51 and 70% of all fraud is undetected.</p><p>These estimates of undetected fraud are downward biased because Assumption 2 (that after the Enron scandal all the fraud in former AA firms was revealed) is unlikely to be satisfied. This is true for all the measures, but particularly so for SCACs and AAERs. The SCAC securities fraud measure includes frauds that are not misrepresentation of accounting information but rather failures to disclose material information. It is unlikely that the additional scrutiny triggered by the AA demise would expose all these failure-to-disclose cases. In such cases, the experiment design implies that 0.47 detection likelihood is only an upper bound (biasing downward the proportion of undetected fraud). Similarly, the detection of an AAER-type of fraud depends on the willingness of the SEC to bring an enforcement action. In any economic analysis of crime and punishment (see Becker <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1968" title="Becker, G.S. 1968.

Thus, the 0.52 AAER estimate is also likely an upper bound.</p><p>By contrast, Assumption 2 is more likely to hold for misconducts that auditors are more likely to catch, such as accounting restatements and auditor-detected fraud. Thus, in column 2 of Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>, Panel B, we report the detection likelihood estimate obtained by pooling together only the two fraud measures for which Assumption 2 is more likely to hold. The estimated detection likelihood is 0.33, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.24–0.45. Thus, only one-third of corporate fraud is detected, and the total amount of corporate fraud is three times the corporate fraud that is observed. In the rest of the paper we will treat this as our best point estimate, with a 95% confidence interval that the total amount of fraud is between 2.2 and 4.1 times the fraud observed.</p><h3 id="Sec11"><span>4.2 </span>Detection likelihood robustness</h3><h4 id="Sec12"><span>4.2.1 </span>Small firms</h4><p>Krishnan et al.

It is likely that Big Four auditors accept all the large former AA clients but only the best of the small ones, leaving the rest to less prestigious auditors.

To do so, however, we need to expand the sample to small firms.</p><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab4">4</a>, Panel A reproduces our detection likelihood estimation setup for smaller public corporations – those that were never over $750 million in assets in the pre-period years. We run the experiment in the same setup as Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>. Since DMZ does not collect auditor-detected data for small firms, the first measure of misconduct is not available for this sample.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-4"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab4" data-test="table-caption">Table 4 Detection Likelihood Robustness: Small Corporations &amp; Placebo</b></figcaption></figure></div><p>We find, in Panel A, that for all three measures the detection likelihood is less than 1 and that for two out of three measures the detection likelihood is significantly less than 1 at the 1% level. This analysis, suggested by an anonymous referee, provides an out-of-sample validation of our methodology to use the AA-forced turnover to identify misconduct that generally remains undetected.</p><p>For the AAER and restatement measures, the detection likelihood estimates obtained using small firms in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab4">4</a> are very similar to the ones obtained using large firms and reported in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>: 0.64 versus 0.52 for AAERs and 0.42 versus 0.34 for restatements. By contrast, for securities fraud cases, the detection likelihood falls drastically from 0.47 (large firms) to 0.29 (smaller firms). Most likely, this drop is due to the fact that the probability of a class action suit among small non-AA clients is only 0.5%, versus the 2% observed in large firms. This is hardly surprising. The main reason why DMZ restrict their sample to large companies is that the discovery of a fraud will always lead to a class action suit in large companies, where there is plenty of money to pay the lawyers, but not necessarily in small companies. Thus, the lower detection likelihood reflects a real difference between large and small companies: more fraud goes undetected in small companies.</p><h4 id="Sec13"><span>4.2.2 </span>Placebo</h4><p>It is possible that AA clients were in businesses intrinsically more prone to corporate fraud or its detection. One way to help to rule out this possibility is to observe these firms in a different time period and check that they are not behaving differently. To this purpose, we reproduce the same experiment comparing former AA and non-AA clients (minus a few firms that do not survive) in the two years after the detection period (i.e., 2004–2006) and measure fraud detection in these years. Since the enhanced scrutiny following the demise of AA cannot last forever, we regard this exercise as a placebo test. This placebo period coincides with the beginning of the implementation of SOX. A large literature has tried to establish what the effects of the introduction of SOX are (see Coates and Srinivasan (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2014" title="Coates, J.C., and S.

Our test, however, is unaffected by any impact of SOX, since it compares the detection rate in former AA clients and former non-AA clients at the same time.</p><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab4">4</a>, Panel B reports the results. The percentage of firms caught committing fraud is very similar between former AA clients and former non-AA clients (detection likelihood estimates for all three measures are not different from 1), suggesting that there is not a natural proclivity of former AA clients to commit more fraud. In addition, the similarity between the fraud revealed in AA and non-AA clients suggests that the enhanced disclosure of fraud during the treatment period is not just an acceleration of the discovery that would have taken place regardless, but a net increase in discovery.</p><h4 id="Sec14"><span>4.2.3 </span>Industry and geography</h4><p>In Sect. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Sec5">3.2</a>, we showed that AA had more clients in Communications &amp; Transport, Refining &amp; Extractive, Services &amp; Healthcare, and Utilities, and fewer clients in Banks &amp; Insurance, Retail &amp; Wholesale, and Computers. If, for unspecified reasons, corporate fraud was more prevalent among sectors in which AA was overrepresented just prior to the detection period and not afterward, then our detection likelihood estimate could be biased. To address this concern, we report the detection likelihood estimates in various subsamples that remove industries where AA was either overrepresented or underrepresented.

Since fraud may be cyclical (Wang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Wang, T.Y., A.

The start in January 1998 and the end point in December 2005 are each almost exactly halfway through the respective expansion periods; thus the period covers one full business cycle from mid-point to mid-point.<sup><a href="#Fn14"><span>Footnote </span>14</a></sup></p><p>Panel A reports that auditor-detected securities frauds hover around 1%, with a peak of 1.1% in 2000–2001. AAER investigations average 2.6%, with a peak of 3.5% in 2000–2001 and a trough of 2.0% in 1998–99. Accounting violations measured by non-clerical restatements average 13.5% during the entire sample period, with a peak of 18.3% in 2002–2003 and a trough of 7.2% in 1998–1999. The broader SCAC securities fraud averages 3.4%, with a peak of 4.8% in 2000–2001 and a trough of 2.3% in 2004–2005.</p><p>Using these observed misconduct averages in Panel A and detection likelihood estimates from Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a> reproduced in Panel B, Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab6">6</a>, Panel C reports estimates of the pervasiveness of fraud. A concern with Panel C is that, as we discussed with regard to Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#Tab3">3</a>, some of the detection likelihood estimates are clearly more biased than others. The biases are always conservative, but they do not help with the precision of our fraud pervasiveness estimates. In particular, our experimental design of using AA’s demise has the most power to identify the whole iceberg of hidden fraud (Assumption 2 holding as an equality) for auditor-detected securities fraud and restatements, as opposed to AAERs and the broader SCAC securities fraud cases, since no matter how rigorous the monitoring of the new auditors is, they will find it difficult to identify cases of price fixing such as Sotheby’s. Thus, the best estimate detection likelihood is based on the pooled detection likelihood of auditor-detected and restatement measures, or 0.33, as highlighted before. We use this detection likelihood to calculate the best estimate of corporate misconduct across all of our fraud measures in Panel D.</p><p>Our findings as to the pervasiveness of corporate fraud depend on the measure of misconduct we use. We find that in any year averaged across the business cycle, 2.5% of large corporations are committing severe financial misreporting that auditors can detect. Auditor-detected securities fraud is a subcategory of SCAC alleged securities fraud; thus, it is not surprising that it has a low frequency. Such a measure is interesting for the detection likelihood estimation, given that it maps well to our AA demise design, but of more interest to speak to fraud at large are the SCAC securities frauds.</p><p>We find that, during an average year over the business cycle, 10% of large corporations are committing a misrepresentation, an information omission, or another misconduct that can lead to an alleged securities fraud claim settled for at least $3 million (with a 95% confidence interval between 7 and 14%). This result from the SCAC data is our main estimate of the pervasiveness of corporate fraud, since SCAC cases are indeed (alleged) securities fraud. By using the AAER measure, we arrive at similar estimates: 8% of fraud pervasiveness, with a 95% confidence interval range of 6%-11%. This magnitude is similar to the SCAC estimate, even though AAERs have lower observed frequencies because their existence requires the SEC to act. (Recall that the SEC failed to act on Madoff despite six substantive complaints.<sup><a href="#Fn15"><span>Footnote </span>15</a></sup>)</p><p>Accounting violations, less severe than alleged securities fraud, are more prevalent, with an average annual pervasiveness of 41% (95% confidence interval between 30 and 55%). We do not want to conclude from this estimate that each year 41% of large corporations commit a severe misreporting. To reach this conclusion we would need some more substantive filters to eliminate inconsequential misreporting. Nevertheless, this estimate does not bode well for the US auditing system. In spite of all the regulation, roughly half of the US financial statements suffer from misreporting more serious than pure clerical errors.</p><h4 id="Sec16"><span>4.3.1 </span>Comparison with pervasiveness estimates in the literature</h4><p>Taking the estimate of 10% as our main estimate of the pervasiveness of corporate fraud, we now ask how our estimates lines up with the literature. As the summary reported below shows, our estimate is at the low end of the pervasiveness of corporate fraud found in the literature. This is not surprising, since if Assumption 2 is violated, our estimate represents a lower bound.</p><p>We begin with evidence concerning the appetite for corporate misdoing for personal gain.

To draw this conclusion, we need to estimate the cost of these corporate frauds. We do not innovate here, but rely on existing estimates of the cost of fraud. As in the prior literature, we focus on the cost of fraud borne by equity holders of firms involved in fraud, ignoring other potential losses (e.g., loss in debt value, loss of employee pensions and jobs, loss of supplier payables, loss of customer prepayments, loss of taxes owed, professional fees and administrative expenses for firms in bankruptcy) and spillover costs borne by competitors (e.g., Bower and Gilson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Bower, J.L., and S.C. Gilson. 2003. The social cost of fraud and bankruptcy. Harvard Business Review 81 (12): 20–22." href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/article/10.1007/s11142-022-09738-5#ref-CR9" id="ref-link-section-d253521081e10560">2003</a>). In this sense, the equity cost estimates provide a lower bound on costs from a social welfare perspective.<sup><a href="#Fn17"><span>Footnote </span>17</a></sup> We build our calculations off two prior papers.</p><p>Using an event-study methodology, KLM estimate the reputational loss of detected fraud at 25% of the equity value of a fraudulent firm. This cost, which is almost entirely due to a loss in reputation, represents the present value of the decline in expected cash flows as firms’ investors, suppliers, and customers change the terms on which they interact with a fraudulent firm.</p><p>KLM’s cost estimates are for detected fraud and do not necessarily apply to undetected fraud. Even when a fraud is not yet in the public domain, the firm incurs costs for two reasons. First, the fraud is unlikely to remain a secret for customers and employees, who will seek business relationships or employment elsewhere, demand a premium to remain, or take advantage of the fraud themselves. For example, Bernie Madoff’s employees like Frank Di Pasquale were lavishly paid to ensure their silence. In addition, they stole money for themselves.<sup><a href="#Fn18"><span>Footnote </span>18</a></sup> Second, the biggest cost is often the cover-up. For 20 years, the Japanese company Olympus was able to hide a $730 million financial loss from 1990 with a series of bad acquisitions and accounting tricks. The bad acquisitions alone cost $300 million.<sup><a href="#Fn19"><span>Footnote </span>19</a></sup></p><p>It is hard to put a number on these costs. Yet, if we assume that, at least in the medium term, the stock market is strong-form efficient, the abnormal low returns of companies that are likely to have committed a fraud but were never exposed as fraudulent can provide an estimate of these hidden costs. Beneish et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2013" title="Beneish, M.D., C.M.C. Lee, and D.

They compare the annual buy-and-hold return of firms with a high probM score with that of firms with a low probM score. After controlling for a four-factor model, they estimate an annual 10.9% difference in returns. We take this underperformance as an estimate of the costs of undetected fraud.<sup><a href="#Fn20"><span>Footnote </span>20</a></sup></p><p>We are now in the position to compute the total cost of fraud. Our estimates suggest that 10% of firms are committing fraud. If the detected fraud (representing 33% of cases) costs the firm 25% of market value and the undetected fraud (representing 67% of cases) costs 10.9%, then the cost of an average fraud is 15.6% of firms’ market capitalization. Thus, the cost of fraud is 1.6% of a firm’s equity value per year (i.e., fraud pervasiveness (10%) multiplied by the loss of market capitalization for an average firm in case of fraud (15.6%)). The 95% confidence interval for cost of fraud is between 1.2% and 2.2% of the firm’s equity value.</p><p>In 2004, the total capitalization of the US equity market was $16 trillion.<sup><a href="#Fn21"><span>Footnote </span>21</a></sup> Since, on average, 10% of firms are engaged in fraud, the annual fraud cost is $254 billion a year (with a 95% confidence interval between $189 billion and $347 billion). If we repeat the calculation at the end of 2021, the expected annual cost of fraud is $830 billion (with a 95% confidence interval between $5609 billion and $1,133 billion).</p><h3 id="Sec19"><span>5.2 </span>An application to cost–benefit analysis</h3><p>When a firm is 100% owned by one individual, the cost of fraud is fully internalized by the owner. In publicly traded companies, where equity is dispersed and insiders often own only a tiny fraction of the outstanding equity, this is not the case. These agency costs are one of the justifications for the introduction of regulations like Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX). As an illustration of the wide applicability of our estimates, we sketch how it can be used for a cost–benefit analysis of SOX. Note that reducing agency costs is only one of the benefits of SOX. We are completely silent on other potential benefits, like reducing the lemon discount due to the asymmetry of information in the financial accounts.</p><p>Hochberg et al.

Note that faced with a regulatory mandate to increase monitoring in some ways, firms may cut down some of the monitoring they were previously doing in other ways (Karpoff and Lott <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1993" title="Karpoff, J.M., and J.R.

Thus, $19.9 billion represents an overestimate of SOX compliance costs.</p><p>The potential benefit of SOX is equal to the net reduction in the probability of fraud times the cost of fraud when it occurs. If instead of 10% of firms engaged in fraud, a policy change resulted in only 9% of firms engaged in fraud, the cost of fraud would drop by $25 billion (1% times 15.6%, which is the average cost of fraud, times $16 trillion, which is the 2004 total equity market capitalization). Thus, for the benefits of SOX regulation to exceed the costs, it would suffice if SOX were able to reduce the probability of fraud by one percentage point (a 10% reduction). Establishing whether this was indeed the case is beyond the scope of our paper. The purpose here is simply to illustrate the usefulness of an estimate of the pervasiveness of fraud, which enables us to derive an estimate of the total cost of fraud. With this estimate, we can easily assess what is the minimum level of effectiveness (in terms of reduction in the probability of starting a fraud) that any system of controls needs to achieve to justify its cost.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusion"><div id="Sec20-section"><h2 id="Sec20"><span>6 </span>Conclusion</h2><div id="Sec20-content"><p>In this paper, we use the natural experiment provided by the sudden demise of a major auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, to infer the fraction of corporate fraud that goes undetected. This detection likelihood is essential to quantify the pervasiveness of corporate fraud in the United States and to assess the costs that this fraud imposes on investors. We find that two out of three corporate frauds go undetected, implying that, pre Sox, 41% of large public firms were misreporting their financial accounts in a material way and 10% of the firms were committing securities fraud, imposing an annual cost of $254 billion on investors.</p><p>These figures project a dismal picture of the effectiveness of financial auditing pre SOX. Whether SOX reduced or eliminated the problem, our paper is unable to answer. Yet, the magnitude of the problem suggests that some action was warranted. Based on our estimates, we can also infer that if the new regulation reduced by 10% the probability of starting a fraud, its cost would be fully justified.</p></div></div></section>
