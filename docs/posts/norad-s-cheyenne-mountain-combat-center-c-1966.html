<p>In 1966, the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) Cheyenne Mountain underground facility became America’s command and control centre for when the <a href="https://flashbak.com/category/cold-war-2/">Cold War</a> turned white and the nuclear apocalypse became real.</p>
<p>We can take a look around the bunker in pictures published in a 1966 official NORAD report by David W. Shircliffe, Directorate of Command History, Command Public Affairs Office, and the 1970s book <em>NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain</em> by Henry W. Hough.</p>

<h2>The Need</h2>
<blockquote><p>When the USAF Air Defense Command moved to Ent AFB in Colorado Springs in January 1951, it set up a tiny combat operations center in one of the office buildings by combining one room, a latrine with the plumbing removed, and part of a hallway. Control of the air battle from such cramped quarters became virtually impossible by 1952.  A new concrete block COC built on Ent AFB, became operational on 15 May 1954.</p>
<p>In comparison with the first COC, this new center was luxurious. Although this new COC had some 15,000 square feet of floor space, by the end of 1955 it was evident that even it would soon be inadequate.</p>
<p>In response to General Partridge’s directive, the CONAD/ADC staff began preliminary planning in January 1956 on a larger COC, located underground. The existing above-ground COC would eventually be too small to manage the growing air defense system and currently was highly vulnerable to attack and sabotage. General Partridge gave a clear picture of the COC:’s vulnerability when he said: ‘The Combat Operations Center is a concrete block building of extremely light construction and is exposed to the traffic on the adjacent street so that a man with a bazooka passing in a car could put the establishment out of commission.”</p>

<p>Excavation for the hardened COC in the 9,565-foot Cheyenne Mountain began on 19 June 1961 and was essentially completed by August 1962. It was completely finished on 1 May 1964. NORAD moved its headquarters to nearby Peterson Air Force Base in 2006, but the underground complex is still used by a number of military and intelligence agencies.</p>

<h2>The Threat</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://flashbak.com/tag/soviet-union/">USSR</a> was expected to have a significant ICBM capability by 1960 or earlier. To defend against this threat, CONAD wanted an automated defense system controlled from within an underground COC.</p>
<p>The advent of ICBMs, with their incredible speed, would greatly reduce the time available for defensive reaction and national strategic warning. Automation, wherever possible, was considered essential. Their plans also included computers and computer-operated displays of air traffic, weapon status, and ICBM attack warning data.</p>

<h2>Computing Power At The Cheyenne Mountain Combat Center</h2>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Near 100 per cent probability of continuing to function against multi-megaton weapons (i.e., underground location).</p>
<p>2. Duplexed large computers and enough floor space to accommodate more computers for anti-ICBM operations.</p>
<p>3. Displays of hostile ICBM status, weapon status, states of alert, aircraft and missile traffic, target damage, radioactive areas, and weather and jet stream information.</p>
<p>4. Communications, and backup facilities, with subordinate, lateral, and higher commands.</p>
<p>5. completely independent water and power supply.</p>
<p>6. Protection against radioactive fallout, biological and chemical warfare, and all other external covert and overt actions.</p>
<p>7. Location within 10 minutes travel time of CONAD and component headquarters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The COC, wherever located, will be a prime target. The site should be selected, as far as practicable, away from other facilities so, if attacked, a minimum “bonus effect” to the enemy would result.</p></blockquote>

<h2>30 Days</h2>
<blockquote><p>Provisions were made so that, in an emergency, the COC could be operated for 30 days in a sealed condition, During that time, except for air from the outside that could be filtered for people inside the mountain, the COC would need no other outside support. Its resources include a built-in power plant, heating and air conditioning systems, dormitories, dining areas, maintenance and storage areas, and a dispensary, Southeast of the buildings there are three large underground res~rvoirs. These hold 350,000 gallons of diesel fuel; 1,375,000 gallons of drinkable water; and 4,125,000 gallons of water for industrial uses,1</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Tech</h2>
<blockquote><p>During the spring and summer of 1965, 15 consoles, two Philco 212 computers, and a large board display were installed in the new COC. Except fo·r four Type I I I consoles, all of this equipment had been operating in the Group II facility. A third Philco 212 computer was to be moved in January 1966 from the Spacetrack Center Alternate Facility at L. G. Hanscom Field to the new COC.</p></blockquote>

It can photograph light reflected from an object the size of a basketball out in space about 25,000 miles. This camera, at Cold Lake, Alberta, is operated by the Canadian Forces Air Defense Command. Others supplying data to the NORAD Space Defense Center in Colorado are operated by the U.S. Air Force and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. By identification and correlation of known star backgrounds in the Baker-Nunn photographs, a satellite’s position can be determined with great precision.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“PATHS OF A SATELLITE – Deep within Colorado’s Cheyenne Mountain are large display screens which show what is going on in space. These screens in the NORAD Combat Operations Center can show the routes space satellites will take as they circle the earth, such as the ones here charted by a computer. By pushing buttons the battle staff members can see the paths a satellite will follow for as many as twelve revolutions in the future. While guarding the continent against air attack, the command is also responsible for keeping tabs on space objects orbiting the earth.”</p></blockquote>
