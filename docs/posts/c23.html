<p>The most recent version of C, C23, has just been released. </p>

<p>You can see it here, on the
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects#9899">WG14 Website</a></p>

<p>While there are a number of changes that I think were mistakes, and I
joined too late to really push the changes I wanted, I&#39;m proud that
this is the first version of the standard I was involved in.</p>
