These systems are low</span><span>-</span><span>cost an</span><span>d</span><span> can operate autonomously around the clock, making them ideal for continuous monitoring of transient events or long-duration signals that professional telescopes cannot commit to observing full-time.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Their geographic distribution enables global sky coverage and coordinated observations across different time zones, which is especially valuable for </span><span>validating repeating or time-variable signals</span><span>. Coincidence detection across multiple stations helps </span><span>reject local radio frequency interference (RFI)</span><span>, increasing confidence in true astrophysical or technosignature candidates.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>These networks are also highly scalable, resilient to single-point failures, and capable of </span><span>rapid response to external alerts</span><span>. Furthermore, they are cost-effective, engaging, and accessible, </span><span>ideal for education, citizen science, and expanding participation in radio astronomy</span><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>However, these systems also come with notable limitations when compared to professional telescopes. They have </span><span>significantly lower sensitivity</span><span>, limiting their ability to detect faint or distant sources. Their angular resolution is poor due to smaller dish sizes and wide beamwidths, making </span><span>precise source localization difficult</span><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Calibration can be inconsistent across stations</span><span>, and frequency stability or dynamic range may not match the performance of professional-grade equipment. Additionally, without standardized equipment and protocols, data quality and interoperability can vary across the network. Despite these constraints, when thoughtfully coordinated, such networks can </span><span>provide valuable complementary observations to professional facilities</span><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_48"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_45"><div><div><h2 id="h.xu5ifbv830af_l" dir="ltr"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;"><p><span>The </span><span>Wow@Home Radio Telescope</span></p></div></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_44"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_41"><div><div><p dir="ltr"><span>This page presents a test of our first </span><span>Wow@Home Radio Telescope</span><span> hardware and software configuration (Figure 1). The system is tested for a network of small radio telescopes designed to emulate, as closely as possible, the observation protocol of the meridian radio telescope </span><span>Big Ear</span><span> used by the </span><span>Ohio SETI project</span><span> in the 1970s. As in the </span><a href="http://www.bigear.org/Wow30th/wow30th.htm" target="_blank"><span>original setup</span></a><span>, we use a </span><span>10 kHz channel width</span><span> and a </span><span>12-second integration time</span><span>. However, our system differs in several ways: it features 256 channels instead of 50, a much larger beam size, but significantly lower sensitivity.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The telescope is </span><span>fixed at a constant elevation</span><span>, pointed south, and scans a specific celestial declination over the course of one or more days using a wide field of view of approximately 25° (HPBW or its beamwidth). As the Earth rotates, this configuration allows the telescope to capture a </span><span>continuous 360° strip of the sky</span><span> at that declination. After completing three or more full-sky passes, the telescope is adjusted to a new elevation to begin scanning a different declination, gradually building up </span><span>full-sky coverage over time</span><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>While optimized for </span><span>educational use</span><span>, this configuration also yields valuable data on RFI near the H I line in urban environments, helping us assess the likelihood of RFI mimicking a Wow!-like signal. Additionally, it serves as a practical platform for a </span><span>wide-field search for strong transient events</span><span>, whether of astrophysical origin or potential technosignatures.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For events that persist longer than a day, </span><span>multiple observing passes</span><span> can be used to validate their presence, detect weaker features, improve overall sensitivity, and help distinguish them from RFI. Additionally, </span><span>simultaneous observations</span><span> by two or more telescopes pointed at the same location can further aid in rejecting local interference and confirming the reality of signals that last less than 24 hours.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Wow@Home Radio Telescope operates autonomously, 24/7, as a meridian-style instrument, conducting a continuous </span><span>all-sky survey</span><span> </span><span>for transient events</span><span>. The hardware required to build these telescopes is both </span><span>inexpensive and widely accessible</span><span>, relying on readily available components. </span><span>The critical element lies in the software</span><span>, which must be capable of analyzing data effectively, whether from a single station or across a coordinated network of telescopes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Future expansions could include the integration of </span><span>multibeam systems</span><span> to enable simultaneous ON–OFF observations </span><span>to improve sensitivity</span><span>, </span><span>tracking capability</span><span> to perform targeted observations of specific sources, </span><span>multi-site detection</span><span> for signal validation, higher sensitivity, and RFI discrimination, </span><span>interferometric capabilities</span><span> for improved angular resolution, and </span><span>phased array configurations</span><span> to enhance sensitivity and enable electronic beam steering.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_3"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_0"><div><div><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f663nq0DCH3-cCxCVnhWZrSp87dK0RX78iciHe2GqXon5B_FDSGHQYAiRc-WpNdm5SMyW7kw4Wnmci7zwjRblIikD2OKWHaci39RG3nBXC-mWRQOIZwBTT2lrO9u4xtnlQ=w1280" role="img"/></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_13"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.3e7c17c5694c8634_10"><div><p dir="ltr"><span>Figure 1: </span><span>Components of our first Wow@Home Radio Telescope.

The broadband SNR is suitable for detecting continuum sources, but RFI heavily contaminates it. A second telescope at a different location could be used to cross-correlate astronomical signals. The mediumband SNR is good for highlighting the</span><span> Galactic center transiting </span><span>after</span><span> 6 hours and the Galactic anticenter </span><span>about</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span> hours later.
