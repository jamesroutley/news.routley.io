      <p dir="auto">This patchset adds full interpreter and backend support for RISC-V 64 G(IMAFD) with LP64D ABI on Linux, with compile-time/runtime extension support for RVC, Zba, Zbb, Zicond, XTheadBa, XTheadBb, XTheadCondMov and XTheadMac.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to Mike Pall, LuaJIT is well renowned for its accomplishments and performance in JIT compilers. As an undergraduate interested in RISC-V and compilers, I&#39;m honored to have a chance to contribute to a production compiler. I also want to express my gratitude for the internship opportunity provided by PLCT Lab, ISCAS, which enabled me to this endeavor.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would greatly value a review of my patch to catch my misses and for a better polish; Your feedback would be invaluable. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
