                                <p>California’s community colleges do not employ enough full-time faculty and in some cases districts are misspending state funds allocated for those faculty instead on too many part-time adjuncts, according to a newly released report from California’s state auditor.</p><p>The audit, ordered last year by state lawmakers, <a href="https://edsource.org/2023/california-community-colleges-rely-too-much-on-part-time-faculty-and-misspend-funds-audit-finds/686030" target="_blank">probed hiring practices for full-time faculty at four community college districts</a>: Foothill-De Anza, Kern, Los Rios and San Diego. Auditors also reviewed how those districts have spent state dollars, including $100 million provided by the Legislature in 2021 to help districts hire more full-time faculty.</p>
