Today, gas turbine and combined cycle plants make up 86% of natural gas power plant capacity, with the balance being conventional steam turbine plants that use natural gas as a fuel.</p><p>Both gas and steam turbines work on similar principles. In a steam turbine, water is pumped through a boiler to become steam, and is then sent through a turbine, a series of rotors with airfoils mounted around the edge. As the steam flows through the turbine, the rotors spin, converting the heat energy of the steam into mechanical energy (which is then converted to electrical energy by a generator). In a gas turbine, air is pressurized by a compressor, and then sent to a combustion chamber, where it&#39;s mixed with fuel and burned. The hot gasses from combustion then drive the turbine rotors directly, rather than being used to heat up water.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 4368w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273da12c-9454-4652-a6a7-cb913dc3c87d_1600x601.png 4368w" title="Steam and gas turbine schematics.

And why did it eventually conquer the electric power industry? Let’s take a look.</p><p><span>The idea of using the force of steam to generate rotational energy dates back to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile" rel="">Hero of Alexandria</a><span>, but the invention of the modern steam turbine is generally credited to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Algernon_Parsons" rel="">Charles Parsons</a><span>, who in 1884 built a 7.5 kilowatt turbine connected to a dynamo that was used to generate power for electric lighting on ships. Over the next five years Parsons built more than 300 steam turbines for shipboard use, and in 1890 built the first steam-turbine powered central electric power station. The steam turbine was smaller, more efficient, less noisy, and could be built much larger than the reciprocating engines then used to generate electric power, and by the early 1900s power companies began to widely adopt steam turbines. By the 1920s Parsons was building enormous, 50,000 kilowatt (or 50 megawatt) steam turbines for central station use, and steam turbines were built by every major manufacturer in America.</span></p><p>As more steam turbines were being built in the early 20th century, engineers also experimented with gas turbines. Because a gas turbine could use burning gasses directly instead of using them to heat up water first, it was theoretically simpler than a steam turbine. A gas turbine could omit heat exchangers, boilers, cooling towers, and all the other steam-handling equipment that a steam turbine required. This made a gas turbine a compelling proposition, if it could be made to work. In his 1939 retrospective on the early history of gas turbines, Adolf Meyer described them as “the long cherished dream of engineers,” and that “hardly any other kind of machine has received more attention from inventors, skilled and otherwise.” By 1900, there had been hundreds of proposals to build a gas turbine.</p><p><span>As with the steam turbine, the basic ideas behind the gas turbine preceded its construction by many years. </span><a href="http://researchingfoodhistory.blogspot.com/2019/01/smoke-jacks.html" rel="">Smoke jacks</a><span>, which used rising smoke and hot air to rotate a fan which turned a spit, date to the 1400s, and in 1791 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barber_(engineer)" rel="">John Barber</a><span> patented the design for a gas turbine (though it was never built). But modern gas turbines weren’t built until the early 1900s. In 1903, Rene Armengaud and Charles Lemale built a gas turbine in Paris that successfully generated 220 kilowatts of work. In 1904, F. Stolze built a “hot air engine” in Berlin, which used compressed air that had been heated in a furnace to drive a turbine. And between 1903 and 1907, extensive experiments on gas turbines were performed at General Electric by Sanford Moss (who would spend the rest of his career </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Alexander_Moss" rel="">developing</a><span> turbochargers for aircraft engines).</span></p><p>But these early attempts to build a gas turbine all ended in failure. Stolze’s turbine failed to generate enough work to even run the air compressor. Armengaud and Lemale’s turbine fared better, but it was “woefully inefficient,” with a thermal efficiency of just 2-3%, about one-eighth the efficiency of piston engines at the time. GE’s experiments yielded similar results.</p><p>These early failures can be traced to low operating temperatures and inefficiencies in the various turbine components, particularly the compressor. Early engineers couldn’t build a compressor that was efficient enough, or a turbine that could run hot enough, to produce useful amounts of work.</p><p><span>But early steam turbines worked on similar principles as the gas turbine, and were subject to the same limitations.

To understand the behavior of actual engines that can be built in the real world, we want to use a cycle based on how the engine actually functions. Gas turbines can be modeled by the Brayton cycle. The Brayton cycle is similar to the Carnot cycle, except that the temperature of the gas rises and falls when heat energy is added/removed. (As we can see, this makes the Brayton cycle less thermally efficient than the Carnot cycle.) </p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_944,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 944w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1888,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1888w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2832,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 2832w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_944,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_944,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 944w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1888,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 1888w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2832,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39fadeeb-6e9d-45d0-ab03-9f1db26a5fb2_833x677.png 2832w" title="T-S diagram of the Brayton cycle.

This air is then fed into a combustion chamber where it&#39;s mixed with fuel and burned, adding heat energy to it and increasing its temperature further, but keeping its pressure constant. The hot exhaust from the combustion chamber is then fed through a turbine, which lowers the temperature and pressure of the gas as heat energy is extracted and turned into mechanical energy. This hot gas is then either cooled down and sent back to the compressor (in a ‘closed cycle’ turbine), or vented into the atmosphere (in an ‘open cycle’ turbine). As with the Carnot cycle, we have four steps: compression, heat addition, expansion, and heat removal.</span></p><p>A steam turbine is modeled by a slightly different cycle, called the Rankine cycle. In the Rankine cycle, liquid water is pumped into a boiler, where heat energy is added and the water turns to steam. The steam is sent through a turbine where it expands, lowering its temperature and pressure as heat energy is extracted. The steam is then condensed back into liquid water in a condenser, dumping its remaining heat energy, and is sent back to the pump to repeat the cycle.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1042,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1042w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2084,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 2084w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3126,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 3126w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1042,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1042,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1042w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2084,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 2084w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3126,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F649a916a-152e-4f76-bca3-e9cd4c79f64f_680x623.png 3126w" title="T-S diagram of the Rankine cycle.

Specifically: when water is being transformed from liquid to gas, heat is added/removed without an increase in temperature, yielding straight horizontal lines on the temperature-entropy diagram.</p><p>In both the Brayton and the Rankine cycle, the compressor in step 1 is driven by the turbine, and the net output of the engine will be the work done by the turbine minus the work required to run the compressor. The fraction of the turbine’s work required to run the compressor is known as the “back work ratio.”</p><p>In a Rankine cycle, the back work ratio will be very low, on the order of 1% or less. In a Brayton cycle on the other hand, the back work ratio will be very high. Driving the compressor might take 50% or more of the work done by the turbine. </p><p><span>The difference in back work ratios is due to differences in the working fluid. In a Rankine cycle, the compression step takes place with a liquid, whereas a Brayton cycle is compressing a gas. It takes much more work to increase the pressure of a gas than it does a liquid.</span></p><p>“Ideal” Rankine and Brayton cycles assume that the compressors and turbine components have 100% “isentropic” efficiency: that they can perfectly convert heat energy into mechanical energy (or vice versa) without any increase in entropy. And with a perfectly efficient compressor, this high back work ratio is not an issue. The energy used to drive the compressor will all be converted to energy in the air that&#39;s being compressed, which will then be recaptured by the turbine. But real components are never 100% efficient. Some fraction of the energy fed into them will be “lost” as friction, vibration, and so on. And the higher the back work ratio — the more energy the turbine must supply to the compressor — the greater the losses from component inefficiencies. If my compressor is 90% efficient, that 10% loss means much less on a pump that requires 1% of the turbine’s work than an air compressor that requires 50% of the turbine’s work.</p><p><span>Thus, Brayton cycle engines, with high back work ratios, are </span><strong>much more sensitive to compressor and turbine inefficiencies, </strong><span>particularly compressor inefficiencies, than Rankine cycle engines are.</span></p><p><span>(It’s worth emphasizing the two different concepts of efficiency we’re talking about here. </span><strong>Thermal efficiency</strong><span> is the fraction of input heat that&#39;s converted into mechanical energy by the engine. </span><strong>Isentropic efficiency</strong><span> is a measure of how much of the input energy to a compressor/turbine is lost to things like friction, turbulence, and other entropy-increasing effects. Thermal efficiency is what we ultimately care about, because that determines how much useful work we get from a given quantity of fuel. Isentropic efficiency of the engine components will affect how thermally efficient our engine is.)</span></p><p><span>Consider, for instance, a Brayton cycle gas turbine and a Rankine cycle steam turbine operating over the same temperature range, a low of 300 Kelvin (about 80 degrees Fahrenheit) and a high of 900 Kelvin. If both use perfectly efficient turbines and compressors (ie: transfer all input energy to/from the working fluid with no losses to things like friction), they will operate at very similar thermal efficiencies: 43.6% for the gas turbine and 41.9% for the steam turbine. </span><strong>But as the isentropic efficiency of the components decreases, the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine falls much faster than the steam turbine</strong><span>. With a compressor and turbine that are each 75% efficient (combined 56% isentropic efficiency), the net work done by the gas turbine falls to </span><em>zero</em><span>, while the steam turbine is still doing useful work at 31% thermal efficiency.</span></p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1094,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1094w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2188,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 2188w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3282,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 3282w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1094,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1094,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1094w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2188,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 2188w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3282,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80b2a6b7-569b-406e-af8c-966574641fde_681x493.png 3282w" title="Brayton vs Rankine thermal efficiency.

Velox boilers and Houdry units took advantage of the ability of a gas turbine to blow large volumes of hot air (the fact that gas turbines could actually generate positive amounts of work in Houdry units turned out to be an unexpected bonus). Jet engines didn’t have the aerodynamic limitations of propeller-based engines, making it possible to achieve much higher altitudes and aircraft speeds.</p><p><span>As jet engines powered aircraft, they were also generating electricity for the first time. The first gas turbine-based power plant in the world was built at </span><a href="https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history/landmarks/135-neuchatel-gas-turbine" rel="">Neuchâtel in Switzerland</a><span> in 1939 by the Brown Boveri Company, which had invented the Velox boiler and built many Houdry unit turbines. Brown Boveri would go on to build 10 more gas turbine power plants over the next 6 years. The first gas turbine power plant in the US was </span><a href="https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/100-belle-isle-gas-turbine.pdf" rel="">built</a><span> by GE in Oklahoma City in 1949.</span><span> It used a turbine that had been originally designed to power a locomotive, and was based on the designs of the aircraft jet engines GE built during the war.</span></p><p>These first gas turbine power plants were inexpensive to build and ran reliably but were far less efficient than steam turbine plants. The Belle Isle plant operated at a thermal efficiency of around 17%, compared to the 30% or more that was achievable in steam turbines. The gas turbine was considered “the weak sister” of the steam turbine. The few gas turbine plants were mostly used for things like peak-loading or standby operation, where fuel use was less of a concern. Natural gas did become increasingly popular for electric power generation following WWII, but it was almost entirely used in conventional steam turbine plants. By 1962, worldwide electric generation capacity of gas turbines was just 4 gigawatts, roughly the equivalent of 10 large steam turbines.</p><p>But outside of the electricity sector, the gas turbine was finding more success. Hundreds of gas turbines found their way into industrial uses such as burning blast furnace gas in steel plants, pressurizing natural gas pipelines, and powering locomotives.</p><figure

And gas turbine plants were getting cheaper to build. Between the mid-1950s and the mid-1960s, the capital cost of a gas turbine plant fell by nearly 50%, below that of a coal-fired steam turbine. The comparatively small size of a gas turbine also made it possible to build </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1243/PIME_PROC_1965_180_019_02" rel="">“package” plants</a><span>, which could be quickly assembled on-site from large, prefabricated components.

Environmental laws that regulated the emissions of coal power plants greatly increased the cost of coal-generated electricity, and public opposition made it difficult to build new hydroelectric power plants. Nuclear power, which had held so much promise in the 1960s, had steadily increased in cost, and also faced significant public opposition following the accidents at 3 Mile Island and Chernobyl. Renewables such as wind and solar were gaining in popularity, but without government subsidies they remained far more expensive than existing sources of energy. The time was ripe for an alternative method of electricity generation.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_988,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 988w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1976,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1976w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2964,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 2964w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_988,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_988,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 988w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1976,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 1976w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2964,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd31e3e28-d960-4055-af29-7380600a9e24_532x394.png 2964w" title="Via Watson 2001" width="988"/></picture><figcaption>Via Watson 2001</figcaption></div></div></figure><p><span>The gas turbine was well-positioned to fill the gap that had emerged. Natural gas prices had fallen nearly 40% from their peak in the early 1980s, and the Fuel Use Act that prevented gas turbine plant construction was repealed in 1987. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Utility_Regulatory_Policies_Act" rel="">Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act</a><span> (PURPA), passed in 1978 as part of the National Energy Act, forced utility companies to buy power from anyone who built a plant and connected it to the grid (for certain types of power plant). One of the technologies allowed by PURPA was cogeneration, plants that produced both electric power and heat. Combined cycle gas turbines qualified, and they were quickly adopted by independent power producers. Because gas turbines had relatively low capital costs and could be built quickly, they had low financing costs, making them attractive to private builders. By 1992, gas turbines were generating 44% of the electricity provided by non-utility companies in the US.</span></p><p><span>Independent power producers were a small fraction of overall electricity production in the early 1990s, but PURPA was followed by wide-scale </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-dream-of-deregulation-the-grid" rel="">electricity deregulation</a><span> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Suddenly, anyone could build a power plant of any size and fuel, and connect it to the grid.</span></p><p>The result was an explosion in gas turbine construction. Between 1986 and 2001, the number of simple gas turbine plants in the US increased 3x, and the number of combined cycle plants increased 10x. Gas turbine plants became so dominant that “virtually no other type of power plant was built” (Blanchard 2021). This sudden spike proved to be a temporary bubble, but combined cycle plants continued to be popular after it popped. In 1989, natural gas provided less than 10% of US electricity. Today, it&#39;s nearly 40%.</p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1326,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1326w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2652,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 2652w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3978,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 3978w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1326,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1326,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1326w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2652,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 2652w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_3978,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d4a82-96b9-447d-bca9-ff00809643a1_567x290.png 3978w" width="1326"/></picture></div></div></figure><p><span>As the combined cycle gas turbine became widely adopted, its efficiency improved.

GE</figcaption></div></div></figure><p>Thanks to continued advances in turbine technology, a utility gas turbine can operate at a turbine temperature of nearly 2000 degrees Kelvin, and a pressure ratio of more than 20, with compressor and turbine mechanical efficiencies exceeding 90%. A simple gas turbine can have a thermal efficiency above 40%, with a combined cycle plant having a thermal efficiency of 60%.</p><p><span>It&#39;s worth comparing the development of gas turbines for electricity generation to another important energy technology, </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-solar-power-get-cheap-part" rel="">solar PV</a><span>. In both cases, the basic technology first appeared in the late 19th/early 20th century and first became practical in the mid-20th century. Armengaud and Lemale built their turbine in 1903, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that turbines were built that could do appreciable amounts of work. Likewise, the first solar PV cell was built in 1881 by Charles Fritts, but it wasn’t until the silicon PV cell was invented in the 1950s that solar PV became more than a curiosity. </span></p><p>Both technologies were initially expensive compared to other methods of electricity generation, but had other benefits that made them useful in certain niches. Because solar PV could provide electricity without fuel, it proved to be an ideal way to power satellites. For gas turbines, their combination of small size, low capital cost, quick startup time, high power to weight ratio, and ability to blow large volumes of heated air made them useful for certain industrial tasks, as well as for transportation (jet aircraft, marine engines, locomotives). In each case, these initial use cases enabled the technology to continuously improve via small, incremental improvements over many decades, gradually getting cheaper until it was competitive with utility-scale electricity generation.</p><p>(This is schematically similar to Clay Christensen&#39;s theory of disruptive innovation, in the sense that both technologies started out worse than some existing solution but excelled for certain use cases, which enabled them to develop until they were superior to the existing solution. One major difference with gas turbines is that many of the players that developed them, such as GE, Brown Boveri, Westinghouse, and Mitsubishi, also had, and have, successful steam turbine businesses. So gas turbines aren’t a case of an incumbent being disrupted by some new player that uses different technology.)</p><p>With solar PV, the technology was pushed forward by a long series of government subsidies and other funding programs: military funding for satellite solar PV in the 1950s, DOE funding for cost-per-watt reductions in the 1970s, Japan&#39;s rooftop program, Germany&#39;s feed-in tariff, renewable portfolio standards and tax credits, and so on. This funded the continuing development of the technology over the decades it took to achieve cost parity with other methods of electricity generation (One way of looking at the enormous cost declines of solar PV is how incredibly terrible it was for most of its life as a method of electricity generation.)</p><p><span>Gas turbines had many fewer direct subsidies. The major US one was the </span><a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/828617" rel="">Advanced Turbine Systems program</a><span>, a DOE program to fund the development of gas turbine technologies, which can be credited for things like closed loop steam cooling and the adoption of single crystal turbine blades. But it’s unclear whether this program simply </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5057" rel="">substituted</a><span> for industry research and development that would have taken place anyway. In fact, some of the most important developments for gas turbines, such as repealing the fuel use act and electricity deregulation, were about the government stepping back and letting the market take a greater role. </span></p><p><span>However, gas turbines saw an enormous amount of </span><em>indirect</em><span> subsidies, in the form of government funding for jet engine development. Ever since Frank Whittle developed the first jet engine in the 1930s, jet engine development has extensively relied on military and other government funding. The military </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1596.pdf" rel="">funded</a><span> many early jet engine </span><a href="https://blog.geaerospace.com/100-year-anniversary/cold-war-child-how-the-ge-j47-became-the-worlds-most-produced-jet-engine/" rel="">development projects</a><span>, as well as research into things like </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02646310" rel="">improved turbine blade materials</a><span>. Technology developed for aircraft and jet engines, such as airfoil-shaped turbine blades, superalloys, special ceramic coatings, and single crystal turbine blades, has eventually made its way into industrial gas turbines. Jet engine development has proved so crucial to the advancement of industrial gas turbines that the gas turbine companies that don&#39;t have a jet engine business (and many, like GE and Mitsubishi, do) have partnered with jet engine developers to keep their products competitive.</span></p><p>We in fact see something similar with solar PV, where it was able to piggyback on improvements in semiconductor technology for most of its early existence.</p><p><span>This then points to a fundamental challenge of technology development. Technology improves in incremental steps over many decades (</span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-blast-furnace-800-years-of-technology" rel="">or centuries</a><span>). There needs to be some way to fund that development over that period of time. In many cases, the market can address this, but if the technology is competing with an existing, superior solution, this is more challenging, even if the long-term prospects of the technology are brighter.</span></p><p><em>Thanks to Austin Vernon, Nick McCleery, Ben Reinhardt and homerificus for reading drafts of this.
