<dl><dd><h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system
implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.
Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved
a type structure;
created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve
a meager programming environment, it has become
one of the dominant languages of today.
This paper studies its evolution.
