    <h1>Casinos, high-rises and fraud: The BBC visits a city built on scams</h1>

Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.</p><p>It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.</p><p>But Yatai, She Zhijiang&#39;s company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.</p><p>The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.</p><p>She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.</p><p>But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Tall buildings in Myanmar&#39;s Myawaddy seen from Thailand&#39;s border, where armed guards stand on a bridge  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="847.0107526881721"/></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>New high-rises on the Myanmar side are visible from Thailand&#39;s border</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.</p><p>Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.</p><p>Yatai is trying to fix the city&#39;s sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.</p><p>So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.</p></div></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Inside-Shwe-Kokko-" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Inside Shwe Kokko </span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Getting there is tricky.</p><p>Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.</p><p>As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country&#39;s commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.</p><p>She Zhijiang&#39;s colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – &#34;Mr She believes in making a green city,&#34; they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.</p><p>At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="A man riding past a red sign saying &#39;Let&#39;s build a beautiful home together&#39;  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="846.5081081081081"/></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/ BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>With signs written in Chinese characters, Yatai has the appearance of a Chinese city</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. &#34;Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,&#34; they told us. And what about the businesses? &#34;Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.&#34;</p><p>However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar&#39;s ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.</p><p>Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that &#34;online businesses&#34; should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.</p><p>Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar&#39;s border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.</p><p>The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.</p><p>Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/f385/live/febf4730-e480-11ef-89a1-3f5b746fc0a2.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="A vehicle inside the city.

She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.</p><p>Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.</p><p>&#34;The target is the elderly,&#34; she said. &#34;You start a conversation like &#39;oh you look just like one of my friends&#39;. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.&#34;</p><p>Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that&#39;s how they made a lot of money.</p><p>&#34;When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,&#34; she says. &#34;The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.&#34;</p><p>During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.</p><p>Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border. </p><p>We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them.

He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.</p><p>She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.</p><p>He accuses China&#39;s communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.</p><p>While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai&#39;s part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to &#34;a high probability&#34; that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.</p><p>&#34;Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely.
