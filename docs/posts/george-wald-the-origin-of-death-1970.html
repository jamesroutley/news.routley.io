      <p><SPAN size="3"><img src="https://www.elijahwald.com/images/georgelab.jpg" width="302" height="306"/>When one has wondered over the years about the origin 
        of life, as I have done, one comes inevitably to ask oneself, just what 
        kind of thing is one trying to bring forth? Need those first primitive 
        organisms on the earth, for example, have had such complex apparatuses 
        of reproduction as all organisms possess today? And then one comes to 
        the curious question: Need those first organisms have died? Because if 
        they didn’t need to die, they needn’t at least be in such a 
        hurry to reproduce. And this brings one to this question of the origin 
        of death.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">For not all living creatures die. An amoeba, for example, 
        need never die; it need not even, like certain generals, fade away. It 
        just divides and becomes two new amoebas.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">In fact, death seems to have been a rather late invention 
        in evolution. One can go a long way in evolution before encountering an 
        authentic corpse. This is the journey that I would like to make with you. 
        What I should like to do, of course, is to begin with the first living 
        organism on this planet and then pursue evolution onward, asking the question: 
        When did the first organism appear that cultivated the habit of dying? 
        But that is just what I can’t do. As in so many other evolution stories, 
        I have to be content with a poorer thing, and that is to discuss this 
        transition in terms of contemporary organisms, of organisms alive today.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Let us begin with a familiar, single-celled organism, 
        the amoeba. Its nucleus divides by pinching into two equal halves, then 
        the whole amoeba divides. Thus we have two organisms where we started 
        with one. This is the usual way singlecelled organisms, plant and animal, 
        tend to reproduce, just by simple division: so called fission.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Occasionally they do something a little different. Reproduction 
        in the single-celled organism Paramecium is usually by fission, but sometimes 
        it engages in what we call conjugation. Two organisms, each containing 
        a large nucleus (macronucleus) and a small nucleus (micronucleus), come 
        together side to side. Then the cuticle breaks down between them. The 
        macronucleus is by and large the working nucleus. The micronucleus represents 
        a store of genetic material. The next thing that happens is that the macronuclei 
        disintegrate and the micronuclei divide, and something very interesting 
        happens that makes one think a little of sexual reproduction: there is 
        an exchange of micronuclei, of genetic material. Then the Paramecia separate, 
        the micronuclei divide repeatedly, then the Paramecium divides repeatedly. 
        One ends up with eight brand new Paramecia just like the pair with which 
        we started.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">In the generation just before mine there was a very distinguished 
        zoologist named Lorande Woodruff. He began to publish a series of papers, 
        the first of which was entitled something like “Two hundred generations 
        of Paramecium aurelia without conjugation.” We waited a few years 
        and another paper came out with a title something like “Five hundred 
        generations of Paramecium aurelia without conjugation.” Finally this 
        series reached its culmination in a paper entitled “Eleven thousand 
        generations of Paramecium aurelia without conjugation.” So Professor 
        Woodruff lived a happy and useful life, and convinced all of us that Paramecium 
        can live indefinitely without conjugation.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">But in the course of these researches Woodruff made another 
        discovery. You see, every morning he’d come into his laboratory and 
        find two Paramecia where he’d left one the night before; so he’d 
        carefully separate them. One Paramecium, he thought, can’t conjugate. 
        But that’s where he was fooled, because watching these Paramecia 
        so intently he discovered still a third wrinkle in this process which 
        he called endomixis. It’s a sort of do-it-yourself conjugation. In 
        endomixis the macronucleus in a Paramecium disintegrates, the micronucleus 
        divides, one of those new micronuclei grows up to a new macronucleus and 
        you have a brand new Paramecium.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Then there is a fourth process, which is very interesting. 
        It is called syngamy. In syngamy two cells fuse to make one; and that, 
        of course, is essentially what happens in sexual reproduction. So, here 
        we have, just among these single-celled organisms, four different ways 
        of going about reproduction but no necessary dying, no corpses.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Let us now take an enormous jump in evolution, to a lower 
        invertebrate, the sea anemone. We’ve gotten from a single-celled 
        organism to a very many-celled organism. It is not very highly specialized, 
        having only two cell layers where we have three. It has only an ectoderm 
        and endoderm; we also have a mesoderm. It is radially symmetrical, which 
        we think rather primitive compared with our bilateral symmetry, our two-sidedness. 
        Yet this is a big jump from single-celled organisms. The sea anemone splits 
        down the middle, reproducing by simple division, simple fission.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">That kind of process is rather a habit at this level of 
        organisms. A close relative, the Hydra, reproduces by budding. A bud grows, 
        finally separating from the parent Hydra, and that starts some new Hydras.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Next we take another enormous jump in the hierarchy of 
        organisms. We have a flatworm named Planaria. Such an animal is bilaterally 
        symmetrical, as we are. It has three germ layers, as we do. It has its 
        nervous system concentrated at the head end. It has rather good sense 
        organs. It represents a big jump from Hydras and sea anemones; yet we 
        see this organism reproducing by simple division. It pinches in at the 
        waist and separates into two parts, each of which then regenerates whatever 
        it lacks—the tail end cultivates a new head, the head end a new tail, 
        resulting in two brand new flatworms where we started with one. A number 
        of flatworms go through this kind of process. One called Stenotomus breaks 
        into five or six fragments; then each fragment regenerates whatever it 
        lacks.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I thought that with Planaria perhaps I had finally found 
        an organism that could just fade away. A Dutch worker named Stoppenbrink 
        many years ago began to starve Planaria. As he starved them they began 
        to consume their own substance, following a definite program. First they 
        absorbed whatever sex products there were. Then they went to work on their 
        digestive systems, which weren’t doing them much good anyhow. Then 
        they started absorbing their muscles. In this way the flatworms got smaller 
        and smaller. The only thing they didn’t absorb was the central nervous 
        system; so that as they got smaller and smaller, they came to look highly 
        intellectual—all brain and no worm. By this time I was panting, waiting 
        to read about the moment when Stoppenbrink went into his laboratory, and 
        behold! there were no more flatworms. But to my great disappointment, 
        instead he started feeding them again, and they rapidly regenerated everything 
        they had lost. Then, however, Stoppenbrink made a discovery; for what 
        you get back in this way is a brand new flatworm. He found that if you 
        periodically starve flatworms and feed them again, they go on living forever. 
        I am sure that there’s a moral in this somewhere.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The furthest I have been able to pursue this way of reproducing 
        by simple division was into the real worms, close relatives of our common 
        earthworm. There is one with a beautiful name, Enchytraeus fragmentosus, 
        that has no sex organs at all. It divides entirely by breaking up into 
        many pieces; then each of the pieces regenerates anything it lacks, and 
        one has that many new worms.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">But long before this, organisms have taken up a quite 
        different way of reproducing, the sexual mode of reproduction; and it 
        is in the most intimate associations with the sexual mode of reproduction 
        that death comes upon the scene.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I can describe the situation best in the terms in which 
        a distinguished zoologist of the nineteenth century, August Weismann, 
        described them. Any organism that reproduces sexually begins its life 
        as a single cell, a fertilized egg. The single cell divides repeatedly, 
        eventually to become an adult organism. In the course of its many divisions, 
        there is a line of cells that constitutes what Weismann called the germ 
        line, which will eventually produce the mature sex products, eggs or sperm. 
        In the course of those repeated divisions there is also produced a body, 
        what Weismann spoke of as the soma. At sexual maturity this organism mingles 
        its eggs or sperm with the eggs or sperm of a similar adult of the opposite 
        sex; so one has a new fertilized egg, which in exactly the same way, by 
        repeated divisions, produces both sex products and a new body which at 
        maturity, again, mingles its sex products with those of another adult 
        organism. Thus one has the next fertilized egg that by repeated divisions 
        produces the next adult generation. And so on and on, from generation 
        to generation.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">On this simple basis August Weismann stated two fundamental 
        principles. The first he spoke of as the isolation of the germ plasm. 
        I think the way we would say it now is that genetic information passes 
        always in one direction, always from germ plasm to soma; never in the 
        opposite direction, from soma to germ plasm. That’s why there can 
        be no inheritance of acquired characters. An acquired character is a change 
        in the body, in the soma, and there is no way that this can be transmitted 
        into the germ plasm, and hence inherited.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The other principle stated by Weismann he spoke of as 
        the potential immortality of the germ plasm. You see, germ plasm goes 
        on making more germ plasm as well as bodies. The line of germ plasm goes 
        on without a break. And now we see what death is. Death is the casting 
        aside of the body, of the soma, after it has done its work. That work 
        is to carry the germ plasm, to feed it, to protect it, to warm it in a 
        warmblooded organism, and finally to mingle it with the germ plasm of 
        the opposite sex. With that, it has completed its function and can be 
        discarded.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The thought that life is through with the body once sexual 
        reproduction has been accomplished is repugnant to us as men. I shall 
        have more to say of this later. Yet now I should like to say that, repugnant 
        or not, this would be no surprise to a salmon. For in salmon, and eels, 
        and many such creatures, it is all too clear that reproduction is the 
        last act of life, and that the preparation to reproduce is simultaneously 
        the preparation to die.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I should like to speak of one such animal, the lamprey. 
        So-called sea lampreys are probably not familiar to some of you, but they 
        are quite familiar to us along the coasts. That’s because of their 
        life cycle. Lampreys have the general shape of eels, and are frequently 
        called lamprey eels, but they are not eels nor are they even fish. They 
        belong to a small group of the most primitive of living vertebrates, the 
        jawless vertebrates or Agnatha. They have no jaws, just a sucker disc 
        with a kind of coarse rasp on it. When they get a chance, they attach 
        themselves to a fish by that sucker disc and just begin to rasp their 
        way in. If it is a big enough fish and the fish holds out, the lamprey 
        may end up completely inside of it. A lot of this has been going on in 
        the Great Lakes, as many of you perhaps know, because the digging of a 
        canal persuaded the lampreys, instead of going down to the sea as they 
        had done heretofore, to go into the Great Lakes. For a while they had 
        almost cleaned out the whole Great Lakes fishery.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The lamprey begins its life as a wormlike larva, with 
        no eyes, buried in the mud or sand of a swift-flowing stream. It stays 
        that way for perhaps two or three years. Then it goes through a first 
        metamorphosis, in the course of which, among other things, it acquires 
        eyes. With that it gets itself out from the mud and sand and starts migrating 
        downstream, usually to the sea, where it grows up. At sexual maturity 
        it goes through a second metamorphosis. There are a lot of changes, but 
        one of the most striking is a complete disintegration of the digestive 
        system. That animal will never eat again; it loses its entire apparatus 
        for consuming food. Then it starts its journey upstream.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I got my lampreys in the Exeter River in New Hampshire. 
        A hydroelectric development and a dam had been built across the river. 
        The good people of Exeter had been throwing bottles and tin cans into 
        the water below the dam for generations. There wasn’t much water 
        and it was pretty perilous, but there were those lampreys still coming 
        up with the first warm days of spring. How they got themselves over the 
        dam I do not know. I suspect they took to the shore, because one of these 
        animals on a sexual migration has only one thing on its mind, and that 
        is to get up into its spawning ground. There it makes a nest of round 
        stones, the females lay their eggs in the nest, the males shed their sperm 
        over the eggs, and with that they’re through. All the adult lampreys 
        then die; there is nothing more left in life for them.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The freshwater eels have a life cycle that’s just 
        the reverse of that of the lamprey. It was discovered by a great Danish 
        oceanographer, Johannes Schmidt, many years ago. It had been a great mystery 
        until then, where the eels reproduce. The eels of the shores of the Atlantic 
        are of two different species, European and American. All of them come 
        together to spawn in overlapping areas of the Sargasso Sea, the region 
        of the South Atlantic that includes Bermuda. It represents the deepest 
        and saltiest part of the Atlantic Ocean. Having made that enormous journey, 
        the adult eels spawn and die. Then the baby eels make their way back alone. 
        We have no idea how they get back. It takes the American eels about 15 
        months to come back to our shores, metamorphose, and head upstream. It 
        takes the European eels three years to get back home. There is no record 
        as yet of any baby eel ever getting mixed up and going to the wrong place. 
        When they get into fresh water, they live there for five to fifteen years, 
        growing up. Then at sexual maturity they go through a second metamorphosis. 
        There are a lot of changes: the eyes blow up to twice their former diameter, 
        four times their former area. This animal is getting ready for a deep 
        sea journey. Among other things, there is a complete collapse of the digestive 
        system. Before beginning this enormous journey that will take the adults 
        to the Sargasso Sea, those animals have had their last meal. They will 
        never eat again.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">A more familiar organism, the Pacific Coast salmon, has 
        a life cycle like the lamprey&#39;s. It begins its life invariably in fresh 
        water, grows up a little way, and then goes through a first metamorphosis, 
        losing its spots and nice colors. Up to that point it had looked like 
        a freshwater trout. Now it turns silvery, and goes to sea, where it grows 
        up. At sexual maturity it metamorphoses again, the flesh becomes pink, 
        its color changes. There are all kinds of changes, including again a complete 
        collapse of the digestive system. These salmon, before beginning their 
        migration upstream, are through with eating. They will never eat again. 
        In fact, in many of the males, the jaws become deformed, so that they 
        can no longer meet. This animal isn’t interested in jaws anymore. 
        In this way it begins its journey upstream. It is no fun. The bears are 
        waiting for it, the Indians are waiting for it, the sportsmen are waiting 
        for it, the canning industry is waiting for it. Those handsome travel 
        folders show you the salmon leaping over falls. That is no fun either. 
        They beat themselves to pieces doing that kind of thing. The salmon that 
        reach the spawning grounds are already dying organisms. They’re all 
        torn up, with great wounds in their sides which bacteria have invaded. 
        They are capable only of that last act of reproduction, and that’s 
        the end of them.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">So it is all too clear in these organisms and many others 
        that reproduction is the last act of life, and that the preparation to 
        reproduce is simultaneously the preparation to die.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Sometimes death doesn’t wait for the act of reproduction 
        to be accomplished, but takes part in the act. There was a golden period 
        of insect observation in the second half of the nineteenth century. We 
        had Henri Fabre in France, August Forel in Switzerland, Sir John Lubbock 
        in England, and Maurice Maeterlinck in Belgium who wrote about the life 
        of the bee. While these biologists were watching insects so intently, 
        great interest was aroused in the habits of the praying mantis. The praying 
        mantis is a voracious animal. It will tackle something much bigger and 
        stronger than itself, and usually wins. It was observed that when a pair 
        of mantises is copulating, the female, which is a much bigger animal, 
        will occasionally just swing her head around on its beautiful, stalklike 
        neck and quietly begin to devour the male. He goes right on copulating, 
        while she goes right on eating him. As long as the male’s last two 
        abdominal segments are left, they go on copulating.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Some years ago I visited my good friend, Professor Kenneth 
        Roeder at Tufts College. When I got there and asked for him, a student 
        told me, “You’ll find Professor Roeder down that hall, last 
        door on the right.” So I went down, and there I found Ken Roeder 
        sitting on a soap box watching praying mantises. He offered me another 
        soap box and we sat there, watching together. He told me he had been doing 
        this for years. He told me that, if you’ve got a female mantis alone 
        in a cage, and put in a male, that male instantly freezes. The praying 
        mantis, like a lot of other animals, such as frogs, don’t seem to 
        be able to see anything unless it moves. The male knows that, and he’s 
        watching the female very carefully. If she looks away for a moment, he 
        takes a hasty few steps forward. Then he freezes again as soon as she 
        looks back. Roeder said that this can go on for hours. If the male is 
        fortunate, he reaches the female, mounts her, and goes through a normal 
        copulation. Incidentally, Roeder told me that once an American male mantis 
        starts copulating, the female never bothers him. It’s our better 
        standard of living. But often the female sees him first. With that, she 
        grabs him, always by the head. Then she begins to eat him, always starting 
        with his head. As soon as she has eaten off the head, the male goes into 
        a very interesting pattern of behavior. He plants his front feet squarely 
        and begins to circle around them, meanwhile going through violent copulatory 
        motions. In this way, Roeder told me, such a headless male will frequently 
        succeed in mounting the female and going through a normal copulation.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Ken Roeder is a distinguished neurophysiologist. He was 
        anxious to know that was going on here, and eventually worked that out. 
        There is a copulatory center in the last abdominal segment. But there 
        is an inhibitory center in the subesophageal ganglion that holds the copulatory 
        center in check. It’s all very simple. You don’t need a female 
        to remove this inhibition. Roeder used a razor blade to cut off the head. 
        Once a male loses his head, the copulatory center is released. So here 
        is an instance in which killing the male helps to stimulate the reproductive 
        act.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">At Harvard we have an arrangement whereby undergraduates 
        who feel like and seem to be up to it, can start doing research in their 
        last couple of years. Some years ago a Radcliffe girl came to me to do 
        a senior research. I had just found a few dozen activity cages in the 
        animal room that weren’t being used, so I put two and two together, 
        and dreamed up a beautiful problem for that Radcliffe girl.</SPAN><SPAN size="3">An activity cage is just a cage in which a rat can 
        live in a little squared-off living compartment that ordinarily has its 
        food and water. He lives there perfectly well, but any time he likes he 
        can go through a little open door into a very carefully balanced running 
        wheel, and can run if he feels like it. When he gets through, he comes 
        back in and eats and generally goes to sleep. When he wakes up, he goes 
        into the wheel and runs awhile, and then comes out and eats, and sleeps. 
        That’s the way most animals, including rats, go through their day. 
        Such a rat doesn’t get anywhere by running. It just does it anyhow. 
        A normal animal is iikely to run anything from two to six miles a day.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Life brought me rather early to vitamin A—but sometimes 
        I grow a little restless and want to expand my horizons. So I thought, 
        why not do something with Vitamin B? Just then that Radcliffe girl turned 
        up.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I wasn’t going to be reckless, I was going to start 
        with Vitamin B1, thiamine. Thiamine is an important vitamin. Pharmaceutical 
        houses all over the world have to be ready to estimate how much thiamine 
        is in various foods. I don’t know exactly how they go about it now, 
        but in those days they kept big animal rooms full of rats. They would 
        put a group of rats on a thiamine-deficient diet and let them develop 
        rat polyneuritis, which is the rat form of what’s called beriberi 
        in human beings. Every morning a bunch of girls would come in, put on 
        white coats, and go down the line of cages. They would take each rat and 
        would give it the twirl test: They would pick up the rat by the tail, 
        hold it over a table, twirl it and drop it. If you do that with a normal 
        rat, he just gives you a dirty look and runs off; but if you do this with 
        a rat that is beginning to be thiamine deficient—polyneuritic—he 
        has trouble getting his balance back, righting himself again, and that 
        is the first sign of polyneuritis. Once you saw that, you could begin 
        to feed these animals various foods and estimate how much thiamine was 
        in them.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">It seemed to me that we could do better than that. I thought 
        that if we took away a rat’s thiamine, as it went into polyneuritis, 
        it would of course stop running. That way we would have an early and quantitative 
        sign of thiamine deficiency.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Well, that’s where I was fooled. I haven’t heard 
        it cited lately, but we used frequently to quote to one another what we 
        called the “Harvard Law of Animal Behavior.” It says, “Under 
        the most rigidly controlled conditions, an animal does as it damn pleases.” 
        That’s exactly what happened this time. As we took the thiamine away 
        from these rats, instead of stopping running, they just began to run their 
        heads off. They ran day and night, sometimes as much as forty times their 
        normal running. Meanwhile they were losing weight. Occasionally, though 
        we tried to keep that from happening, we’d come in the morning and 
        find a rat dead in the running wheel. The counter would show that somehow 
        it had struggled out a last mile in the previous night.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Well, that seemed extraordinary, and got us pretty excited. 
        So I wondered, how about Vitamin B2, riboflavine. If you take riboflavin 
        out of the synthetic diet, again the rat begins to run its head off. If 
        you take away its water, the rat runs; if you take its food away, the 
        rat responds by running. If you take away both its food and water, it 
        runs—though you can’t keep that up very long and still have 
        a rat. What was going on? All of us are told, usually by someone who is 
        just about to pick our pockets, that self-preservation is the first law 
        of nature. Here were animals going directly counter to that rule. If the 
        animal had just gone to sleep in a corner of its cage, heaven knows what 
        might have happened. The Radcliffe girl might have got married; or we 
        might have just got bored with the experiment. Those animals were just 
        killing themselves.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">That made me plunge into the literature; and then I learned 
        that the universal sign of hunger, of genuine deprivation of food, in 
        all animals from protozoa (those single-celled animals) to man, is increased 
        activity. You might think: Those animals are looking for food. But they’re 
        not; they are just driven to run. In the heyday of this kind of experiment, 
        people tried all kinds of things. They took the stomachs out of animals. 
        Your sensation of hunger is just the response to a kind of deep, slow 
        contraction of the upper part of the stomach, called hunger contractions. 
        Those animals behaved just like the others. One could take the cerebral 
        cortex out of an animal. Such an animal was incapable of recognizing food; 
        yet when it was hungry, it ran. It couldn’t feed itself, but if you 
        poked food into its mouth, it swallowed and so was fed. Then it would 
        go to sleep, then it would wake up and run until it was fed again, after 
        which it would go to sleep. Our rats weren’t looking for food. Such 
        a hungry animal is not asked to run; it is told to run. These are orders, 
        not requests. They are forced to run.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I think that what we have here is a kind of small scale 
        model for a well known phenomenon, a hunger migration. The most famous 
        of the hunger migrations, one that all of you have heard about, is the 
        migration of the lemmings. The lemmings are rodents that live high up 
        on the mountainsides in Norway. There is a mythology about this that says 
        that in a lemming year the lemmings come down from the mountains in hundreds 
        of thousands if not millions, and go rampaging through the cities, driving 
        people indoors, stopping all of the traffic. They’re on their way 
        to the ocean. When they reach the ocean they plunge in, and in an act 
        of mass suicide, swim off and are never seen again.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Well, it isn’t quite that way. Lemmings are rather 
        cute-looking but unsociable organisms. A lemming ordinarily will tolerate 
        no more than one other lemming of the opposite sex. When a pair of these, 
        traveling together, meets another such pair they sort of growl at each 
        other and each pair goes its way. Norway is of such a shape that for animals 
        wandering off the mountainsides, many of them reach the sea; and it is 
        true that many of them then go into the water and swim off never to be 
        seen again. But they were not searching out the sea. The lemmings on the 
        other side of the same mountains in the same way reach the plains of Lapland, 
        and go wandering off across those plains to die.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">That is the point. It’s pretty well realized by now 
        that that kind of migration is impelled by hunger. It happens in a population 
        that has outgrown its resources. Animals are hungry, and a hungry animal 
        has to run. It’s driven to run. It isn’t looking for anything. 
        It just has to keep moving. You might think that the point of such a hunger 
        migration is colonization. You might think such a horde of hungry animals 
        leaving their home territory are looking for a better place to live. But 
        there is no such place. If there were a better place to live, they would 
        have found it long before. There is no place for them. The point of a 
        hunger migration is not to colonize, but to remove the migrating animals. 
        The end of every hunger migration is the death of the migrating animals.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Some of you may wonder why I include men in this pattern. 
        You may say, “Well, I don’t run around when I’m hungry.” 
        That’s because you are said to be civilized. That gets in the way 
        of all kinds of sensible patterns. If you want to see men behaving this 
        way you have to catch them in the raw.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">One way to do that is to observe an infant. Every young 
        couple knows what it’s like with a new infant. It is just the classic 
        animal pattern. A new infant wakes up, starts to writhe, and yells its 
        head off and grows red in the face, and is full of activity. Every muscle 
        is working. Then you start feeding it. Usually it falls asleep in the 
        middle of the feeding. You have to keep patting its bottom just to get 
        it to finish feeding. Then it sleeps awhile, then it wakes up, writhes 
        and yells and has to be fed again. That’s the way it starts its life; 
        until that young couple civilizes it into eight hours on and eight hours 
        off.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The other way to catch human beings in the raw is when 
        they’re asleep. There was a golden period that I look back upon with 
        great regret, in which the cheapest of experimental animals were medical 
        students. Graduate students were even better. In the old days, if you 
        offered a graduate student a thiamine-deficient diet, he gladly went on 
        it, for that was the only way he could eat. Science is getting to be more 
        and more difficult.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Some years ago, in the laboratory of Professor Curt Richter 
        at Johns Hopkins, he offered a group of medical students the extraordinary 
        privilege of a bed in the laboratory. There were a few formalities: Before 
        the medical student got into bed, he swallowed a balloon attached to a 
        rubber tube that came out of his mouth and went to a mercury manometer 
        which recorded through the night the motions of his stomach. Then, that 
        cot was not an ordinary cot. It was very carefully balanced, so that if 
        that medical student moved in his sleep, that was all recorded on a revolving 
        drum. Well, in just the classical pattern, in a four-hour cycle right 
        through the night, the medical student’s stomach would begin to go 
        through the slow, deep hunger contractions. As they reached their peak, 
        the medical student began to toss around in his bed. Then the hunger contractions 
        would die down, and the medical student go back to sleeping quietly, until 
        four hours later he went through the same cycle.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">As for a human hunger migration, there is a beautiful 
        passage in Herodotus’s <em>Histories </em>which has it in classic 
        form. Herodotus is describing the origin of the Greek games, what we now 
        call the Olympic Games. He says that in the reign of Atys, son of Manes, 
        there was a great famine in Lydia. It persisted year after year. After 
        seven years, the king ruled that all the people must spend every second 
        day in athletic games and on alternate days they would eat. After seven 
        years of this, the famine still persisting, the king divided the population 
        in half, half to migrate, the other half to remain. That brings us at 
        last to man.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">It’s rather odd that we regard mass suicide on the 
        part of lemmings as an aberration, as a kind of psychopathic behavior; 
        whereas our way of dealing with the same problem is considered normal. 
        Where the lemmings go off to die, we go off to kill; for it’s equally 
        true for the human migrants that there is no other place for them. Every 
        place is occupied. Have you ever heard of people migrating to a place 
        fit to live where there were no people before? There are always people. 
        If the migration ends in a colonization, that’s through conquest. 
        It is strange that we look on that as normal and proper, whereas the lemmings 
        seem to be doing something aberrant; for biologically there is much to 
        be said for the way lemmings go about it.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">On the one hand, the way the lemmings do it, there is 
        a minimum of dying. As soon as enough lemmings have left the center of 
        population, there is enough food for those that remain, so the migration 
        automatically stops. Second, there is no destruction. The lemmings’ 
        home territory is just as good as it ever was. Third, and whenever I say 
        this I shudder, since I can’t jump over my shadow, but a selection 
        process is at work. It’s the hungriest lemmings that go off to die; 
        the ones that are doing better stay home. Whereas in the human way of 
        doing things, we pick the flower of our manhood to go off to kill and 
        die. The lemmings are exercising better biology.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I would like to return now to the repugnant thought that 
        life is through with animals once reproduction has been accomplished. 
        That is not true for man. To relieve this situation of the usual Pollyanna 
        practice in which, whenever one describes something uncomfortable, one 
        explains that it’s not true for us, let me talk about bees. All of 
        you know that the heart of what goes on in a bee colony is what is done 
        by the workers. The workers build the hive; they take care of the young, 
        they forage for food, they clean the hive, they run the airconditioning 
        system, everything. They do everything; and yet they are sexless females 
        that have no part in reproduction. The only sexual female in the hive 
        is the queen. And that’s the point. If animals such as bees have 
        a society, then individuals can serve the purposes of that society, and 
        whether they reproduce or not becomes irrelevant. We human beings have 
        a society, and that’s the way it is with us. Beethoven, so far as 
        we know, had no children; Bach had a lot of them. Who cares? That isn’t 
        the reason we go to Beethoven and Bach. Rembrandt had one boy; Isaac Newton 
        had no children. Who cares? It’s completely irrelevant. For organisms 
        that have a society, this becomes a complete irrelevance.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Since we have had a history, men have pursued an ideal 
        of immortality. I am speaking now, not of immortality of the soul—I 
        don’t really know what that means—but of fleshly immortality, 
        of immortality of the body. Over the centuries and the millenia, one has 
        searched for the Philosopher’s Stone, the Fountain of Youth, all 
        of those efforts somehow to abolish death.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">That age-old quest for fleshly immortality is a hoax. 
        Peter Medawar has a book called <em>The Uniqueness of the Individual</em>, 
        and in its first two chapters you will find this all laid out. Medawar 
        points out that if we already possessed every feature of bodily immortality 
        that one could want, it would change our present state very little. As 
        Medawar says, we’d all like to grow up, so let’s be able to 
        reach something like 20 years of age, and then never grow any older. Then 
        he adds: let there be no natural death. Medawar says that at that point 
        he got worried, and went about asking all his physician friends in London 
        whether they had ever seen a person die of old age. All of us go about 
        with the familiar concept of death of old age, of natural death. It turned 
        out that none of the doctors he knew had ever observed it. I think if 
        a physician wrote on a death certificate that old age was the cause of 
        death, he’d be thrown out of the union. There is always some final 
        event, some failure of an organ, some last attack of pneumonia, that finishes 
        off a life. No one dies of old age. Nevertheless, said Medawar, no natural 
        death; and then he said, “Let’s give them a bonus of perpetual 
        fertility.” No matter how long this person lived, he’d be as 
        fertile as at age twenty. That’s about all one could ask for, isn’t 
        it?</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">Medawar points out that with all these conditions fulfilled, 
        our lives would have changed very little --that is, if one went on living 
        human lives, the way we are used to living them. Every time you cross 
        a street you risk your life; there are cars, trucks, trains, and planes; 
        there are viruses and bacteria. They need to live, too, and they’d 
        be working away still. There are electric circuits, and all the other 
        hazards. All the insurance actuaries would have to do is hang around for 
        awhile, and pretty soon they’d send you the new rates. Matters would 
        have changed so little, says Medawar, that possibly our patterns of old 
        age and death are essentially following the inevitable patterns, were 
        we, in fact, immortal.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">The strange thing about all this is that we already have 
        immortality, but in the wrong place. We have it in the germ plasm; we 
        want it in the soma, in the body. We have fallen in love with the body. 
        That’s that thing that looks back at us from the mirror. That’s 
        the repository of that lovely identity that you keep chasing all your 
        life. And as for that potentially immortal germ plasm, where that is one 
        hundred years, one thousand years, ten thousand years hence, hardly interests 
        us.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I used to think that way, too, but I don’t any longer. 
        You see, every creature alive on the earth today represents an unbroken 
        line of life that stretches back to the first primitive organism to appear 
        on this planet; and that is about three billion years. That really is 
        immortality. For if that line of life had ever broken, how could we be 
        here? All that time, our germ plasm has been living the life of those 
        singlecelled creatures, the protozoa, reproducing by simple division, 
        and occasionally going through the process of syngamy -- the fusion of 
        two cells to form one—in the act of sexual reproduction. All that 
        time, that germ plasm has been making bodies and casting them off in the 
        act of dying. If the germ plasm wants to swim in the ocean, it makes itself 
        a fish; if the germ plasm wants to fly in the air, it makes itself a bird. 
        If it wants to go to Harvard, it makes itself a man. The strangest thing 
        of all is that the germ plasm that we carry around within us has done 
        all those things. There was a time, hundreds of millions of years ago, 
        when it was making fish. Then at a later time it was making amphibia, 
        things like salamanders; and then at a still later time it was making 
        reptiles. Then it made mammals, and now it’s making men. If we only 
        have the restraint and good sense to leave it alone, heaven knows what 
        it will make in ages to come.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="3">I, too, used to think that we had our immortality in the 
        wrong place, but I don’t think so any longer. I think it’s in 
        the right place. I think that is the only kind of immortality worth having 
        -- and we have it.</SPAN></p></td>
