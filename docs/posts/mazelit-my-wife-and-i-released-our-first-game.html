    <h1>Show HN: Mazelit - My wife and I released our first game</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey folks,</p><p>About a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game development. Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/" rel="nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/</a></p><p>The demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we&#39;d appreciate any feedback you have, whether it&#39;s for the store page or the game itself.</p><p>We made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can&#39;t redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)</p><p>Cheers and happy weekend!</p></div></div></div>
