    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1962, the first digital video game, Spacewar! debuted on an early computer released in 1959 called the PDP-1 at MIT.</p><p>The beginning of video games.</p><p>Spacewar! set forth and established the fundamental characteristics and philosophical approaches that would define and serve as the earliest guidelines of what a video game is.</p><p>Inspired by science fiction literature and cinema. Driven by creatively pushing technology to its limits.</p><p>A new medium and art form was born.</p><p>SpaceWar! was released on a computer produced in 1959 called the PDP-1. Spacewar! is arguably the first digital video game ever created. PDP-1 has been painstakingly recreated with the public domain open source code for openFPGA by a 3rd party developer. So it can be preserved, studied and played forever without compromises.</p><p><a href="https://www.analogue.co/developer/spacewar"><span>PDP History</span></a></p><p>Find out more on the history of the PDP-1 and the creation of Spacewar!</p></div></div>
