    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>For years, geese have been leaving their mark on our docks and in our yards. People have
        tried a number of &#34;<a href="https://irowbot.duckdns.org:1776/goose/OtherSystems.html">solutions</a>&#34; to get rid of them: fences, reflective
        tape,
        plastic animals, dogs, kites, blinking lights, loud noises, ... Unfortunately, none have done the job.
        Geese
        figure out each system&#39;s weakness and eventually have their way.

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To outsmart geese, we built a system that uses motion detection, Image Recognition, and AI to detect
        geese
        and people. If it finds geese, it activates sprinklers. If it finds people or nothing of interest, it
        disables sprinklers. We call it the Smart Goose Deterrent System. (see <a href="https://irowbot.duckdns.org:1776/goose/HowItWorks.html">how
            SGDS
            works</a>)
