    <h1>No is a complete sentence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I liked this Tom, thanks for posting.  We’re an Agile networking team now, and my boss has been great about telling people to send a story, it will get put in the backlog and then will get prioritized.  If they say it’s a priority and needs to be done now, we’ll talk about if it can go in the next sprint.  So people have to wait almost two weeks sometimes to get their ask done, but we don’t sacrifice what we’ve already promised to others and it really is helping.</p>
<p>It’s a guilty pleasure when developers trying to do some cloud thing that they don’t even quite understand ask to schedule a meeting with me so we can just do ”the things” real quick, and I tell them to create and send over a story!</p>
