            <p>
                Whether it is that funny music file from a hacker musician, the recording of the conference 
                you wanted to download or simply documentation about your favourite mainframe from the 60s. 
                Gophie has an integrated download manager and also allows launching files directly with the 
                corresponding application registered in your system for handling the file you want to download. 
                MP3, Ogg, MP4, PDF etc. are no problem.
