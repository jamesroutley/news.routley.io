    <h1>Stripe is wrongly suspending accounts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>context: We are a SaaS for martial arts academies located in Europe. We are using Stripe for our payment integrations and all our academies have their own account connected to our platform using Stripe Connect (standard), since the last couple of days 2 accounts have been suspended due to &#34;suspicious activity&#34;.</p><p>Stripe has implemented a new fraud detection system that is clearly flawed here. These customers are small gyms in local areas with accounts active for the last 11 months without no issues whatsoever, now all of a sudden they were both suspended (and payout blocked) due to suspicious activity. The suspicious activity is disputed payments, which for SEPA DD (the main payment method used) can simply be that the customer has no money in the bank account.</p><p>The Stripe response so far has been vague, to say the least. Has this happened to you?</p><p>I believe Stripe is a very good product and we have had no issue with them until now, but this situation is deteriorating trust very fast. Do they literally have the power of taking your funds hostage over a &#34;suspicious&#34; fraudulent activity that is clearly due to a bug in their automatic detection system?</p><p>Please let me know if you know someone that can help us here</p></div></div></div>
