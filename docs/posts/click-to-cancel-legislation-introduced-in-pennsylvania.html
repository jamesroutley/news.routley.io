    <p>Rep. Joseph Ciresi    <span><i>April 13, 2022</i></span></p>
    
    
              <p><strong>HARRISBURG, April 13</strong> – State Rep. Joe Ciresi, D-Montgomery, this week introduced legislation (H.B. 2511-- Click to Cancel) that would increase consumer protections by requiring service providers to provide notification before each automatic renewal of a service, to be transparent about renewal terms, and to allow consumers to cancel subscription services exclusively online if they initially subscribed over the internet.</p>

<p>“I’ve introduced legislation, ‘Click to Cancel,’ that would amend the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act to make consumers aware of their active subscriptions and their renewal terms and empower them to easily cancel their subscriptions,” Ciresi said. “I firmly believe that subscriptions should be transparent and easy to understand, and that consumers should be able to cancel them as easily as they can begin a subscription.</p>

<p>“The situation too many consumers face today is that their online contracts often automatically renew without them being notified or even aware. Making matters worse is that some subscription services require consumers to jump through hoops just to cancel their subscription, such as by forcing them to call or speak to an online representative before they can end the service.</p>

<p>“When it is passed, consumers in Pennsylvania will be better protected from companies’ subscription practices that have burdened them with fees for subscriptions they no longer want or are aware of. It is time we provided greater transparency to consumers regarding their subscription services and empower them to cancel subscriptions they no longer want with limited hassle.”</p>



<p>The bill has been introduced as H.B. 2511 with bipartisan support and has been referred to the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee.</p>
