    <h1>Installing Ubuntu on a 2017 MBP - Power management</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
<p>Continuing from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/mbp-linux-wifi">previous post</a>, there were two other issues I faced after installing Ubuntu:</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery drained super quickly despite less usage</li>
<li>The laptop would get warm and remain warm even when the system was idle</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&#39;t get any warnings regarding battery life or heat issues from the family member I got the laptop from, neither was I using the laptop enough for it to be this warm or use this much power.</p>
<p>Solving this wasn&#39;t as straightforward as the fixing WiFi, becuase the searches didn&#39;t lead to any one single solution. So I had to debug my way through this somehow.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-starting-point">Finding a starting point</h2>
<p>I started by finding ways to see the temperature of my laptop, for which I found a package called <code>lm-sensors</code>. Before checking the temps, I ran <code>sensors-detect</code> and selected all of the default options.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install lm-sensors
$ sudo sensors-detect</code></pre>
<p>When I ran <code>sensors</code> for the first time, there was too much output and it barely made sense. I spent some time deciphering the output, and then came the second problem - I didn&#39;t know the ideal temperatures to know which ones were high.</p>
<p>So I tried a different approach. I decided to capture the <code>sensors</code> output twice - once after boot, and one 30mins after that - and compare the two. In those 30mins, I tried to keep the system idle or used it minimally.</p>
<p>This approach worked, as I saw a difference in <code>coretemp-isa-0000</code>, which shows the temperatures of the CPU cores:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<pre><code>coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +45.0°C
...</code></pre>
<figcaption>After boot</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<pre><code>coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +55.0°C
...</code></pre>
<figcaption>30mins after boot</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><code>Package id 0</code> refers to the temperature of the CPU as a whole, and there is a 10 degree increase in about 30mins, with little to no activity in that duration.</p>
<p>I was off to search again, and I landed with two possible causes of this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some process is hogging CPU</li>
<li>Bad power management of Linux on Macs</li>
</ol>
<p>The first cause got eliminated pretty quickly, as I <code>htop</code> didn&#39;t show any process with a high CPU usage, and the CPU usage was also fairly low overall. Bad power management was a very common issue reported in online forums, and I knew my machine worked fine on macOS, so this seemed like a valid cause.</p>
<p>One of the tools I came across to enable better power management was <code>powertop</code>, that displays the energy usage of a system and offers default settings for better power management. I enabled the defaults using the <code>--auto-tune</code> flag after installing.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install powertop
$ sudo powertop --auto-tune</code></pre>
<p>When <code>powertop</code> is run without any flags, it runs in a similar fashion to <code>top</code>, displaying the energy usage and other statistics that update in real time.</p>
<pre><code>The battery reports a discharge rate of:  14.5  W
The energy consumed was :  325  J
The estimated remaining time is 2 hours, 6 minutes

Summary: 123.1 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/seconds, 0.0 VFS ops/sec and 3.1% CPU use

            Usage       Events/s    Category       Description
        675.2 µs/s      46.6        Timer          tick_sched_timer
          0.8 ms/s      21.0        Interrupt      [79] amdgpu
...</code></pre>
<p>Some things stood out here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery discharge rate seemed high</li>
<li>As a result, the energy consumption was also high</li>
<li><code>amdgpu</code> was second highest in the energy usage list</li>
</ul>
<p>The appearance of <code>amdgpu</code> seemed something to look into further, and saw that there was an option to disable it all together. I wasn&#39;t planning on doing any heavy-duty work on this machine, so it seemed like a reasonable solution if it would help reduce temperatures.</p>
<p>I started following <a href="https://medium.com/codeflu/disabling-discrete-amd-graphics-card-in-linux-5d365738fc97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a>, which first checks if you have two graphics on your system or not.</p>
<pre><code>$ lspci | grep VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Baffin [Radeon RX 460/560D / Pro 450/455/460/555/555X/560/560X] (rev ff)</code></pre>
<p>I don&#39;t see a second GPU, but <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this machine</a> has two GPUs - an integrated GPU and a discrete/dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>OH WAIT, I found the root cause - the iGPU didn&#39;t get detected for whatever reason, and the dGPU is being used as the main graphics driver in its place. The dGPU uses a lot of power, which explains the the high energy usage in <code>powertop</code>, the quick battery drain and the laptop getting warm!</p>
<p>Other people have also <a href="https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced the same issue</a> and have documented solutions for it, which I followed along.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-the-igpu">Enabling the iGPU</h2>
<p>The iGPU is not detected thanks to the way Apple&#39;s firmware works. If it recognizes that it&#39;s booting an OS other than macOS, it will power down some of the hardware, the iGPU being one of them. Thanks Apple!</p>
<p>The TL;DR solution to this is to make the firmware believe that it is booting macOS by running custom code before boot.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-build-the-custom-efi-code">Step 1: Build the custom EFI code</h3>
<p>The custom code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple_set_os.efi</a> repository. All I had to do was build the file.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi
$ cd apple_set_os.efi
$ make
cc -I/usr/include/efi -I/usr/include/efi/x86_64 -DGNU_EFI_USE_MS_ABI -fPIC -fshort-wchar -ffreestanding -fno-stack-protector -maccumulate-outgoing-args -Wall -Dx86_64 -Werror -m64 -mno-red-zone   -c -o apple_set_os.o apple_set_os.c
ld -T /usr/lib/elf_x86_64_efi.lds -Bsymbolic -shared -nostdlib -znocombreloc /usr/lib/crt0-efi-x86_64.o -o apple_set_os.so apple_set_os.o /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/libgcc.a \
/usr/lib/libgnuefi.a
objcopy -j .text -j .sdata -j .data -j .dynamic -j .dynsym -j .rel \
        -j .rela -j .reloc -S --target=efi-app-x86_64 apple_set_os.so apple_set_os.efi
rm apple_set_os.o apple_set_os.so</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-2-move-the-code-to-the-boot-partition">Step 2: move the code to the boot partition</h3>
<p>Next, the code needs to be in a location that is accessible during boot, aka the boot partition. I can put the code in <code>/boot/efi/EFI</code> directly too, but the instructions I was following put this in a sub-directory called <code>custom</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /boot/efi/EFI/custom
$ sudo cp apple_set_os.efi /boot/efi/EFI/custom</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-3-ask-grub-to-run-the-code-before-boot">Step 3: Ask GRUB to run the code before boot</h3>
<p>Placing the code in the boot partition alone isn&#39;t enough, I needed to add instructions to run the code before boot somewhere. That somewhere is the bootloader configuration, which in this case is GRUB. I added the following lines to a file created for users to add custom configurations: <code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/grub.d/40_custom
search --no-floppy --set=root --file /EFI/custom/apple_set_os.efi
chainloader /EFI/custom/apple_set_os.efi
boot
EOF</code></pre>
<p>The GRUB menu display was disabled on my machine. To be able to debug any issues on boot, I made the following changes to <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Comment the following line
# GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden

# Change the timeout value
GRUB_TIMEOUT=10

# Uncomment the following lines
GRUB_TERMINAL=console
GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480</code></pre>
<p>Then I ran <code>sudo update-grub</code> to save the changes.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-switch-to-using-the-igpu-on-boot">Step 4: Switch to using the iGPU on boot</h3>
<p>This is done using a shell script called <a href="https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gpu-switch</a> that writes the required values to an EFI variable to use the iGPU. The changes were applied on the next boot, so I rebooted the machine.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch
$ cd gpu-switch
$ sudo ./gpu-switch -i
$ sudo reboot now</code></pre>
<p>After rebooting, the iGPU now appears in the <code>lspci</code> output!</p>
<pre><code>$ lspci | grep VGA
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation HD Graphics 630 (rev 04)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Baffin [Radeon RX 460/560D / Pro 450/455/460/555/555X/560/560X] (rev ff)</code></pre>
<h2 id="disable-dgpu">Disable dGPU</h2>
<p>The dGPU continued to run and warm up the laptop despite the iGPU being detected, so I disabled it with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo OFF | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
$ sudo mobprobe -r amdgpu</code></pre>
<p>And slowly, my laptop started to cool down. I checked the output of <code>sensors</code> after a while, and the temperatures were MUCH lower than with the dGPU enabled:</p>
<pre><code>coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +42.0°C
...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>powertop</code> output also reflected this:</p>
<pre><code>The battery reports a discharge rate of 7.60 W
The energy consumed was 151 J
The estimated remaining time is 8 hours, 35 minutes

Summary: 62.1 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/seconds, 0.0 VFS ops/sec and 0.7% CPU use

            Usage       Events/s    Category       Description
        100.0%                      Device         Audio codec hwC1D0: ATI
        491.8 µs/s      27.3        Timer          tick_sched_timer
...</code></pre>
<p>The battery discharge rate and energy consumption values were lower, battery life became longer and <code>amgdpu</code> no longer appeared at the top of the list!</p>
<p>Lastly, I created a systemd service to disable the dGPU on boot. Thanks to this, my machine remains cool throughout:</p>
<pre><code># disable-dgpu.service
[Unit]
Description=Disable discrete GPU
Before=display-manager.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/modprobe amdgpu
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c &#39;echo OFF &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch&#39;
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/modprobe -r amdgpu
RemainAfterExit=yes
TimeoutSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>I remember being scared when I noticed these issues for the first time. I&#39;d been used to things &#34;just working&#34; on macOS and Windows, and this was the opposite of that. Going from a feeling of fear to slowly gaining the courage to fix stuff has felt great. I think I&#39;m less scared now.</p></div></div>
