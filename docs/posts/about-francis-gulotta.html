    <h1>About Francis Gulotta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi, I&#39;m Francis! I spend my days building engineering teams and my nights hacking on software or electronics projects.</p>
<p>This is my blog. You can dig back to 2001 when my friends and I started it in high school. Most of my writing is about software development. I sometimes write <a href="https://roborooter.com/tag/stories/">stories</a> too.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I have a history of making structural changes in organizations and applications. I enjoy removing the difficult problems that make work hard for others. These problems usually require a lot of institutional research and a lot of persistence to solve. They always exist in code, but they often exist in how the business operates. Regardless of what needs to be solved, it&#39;s people that make it happen, and I&#39;ve found that a well-rested, emotionally secure team can solve any problem that I put in front of them.</p>
<p>Over the years I&#39;ve helped build some of the best engineering teams I could possible serve;</p>
<ul>
<li>2023-Present GitHub: Staff Engineering Manager of the Mac Actions Infrastructure Team. We <a href="https://s3.roborooter.com/ftp/movies/github_mac_cloud_actions.mp4">create the hardware</a> that builds your apps.</li>
<li>2021-2023 Vercel: Created the Edge Networking Department. Took a 4 person team and grew it into a 16 person department. Stabilized core infrastructure and payed off 7+ years of technical debt. Launched 3 major products Edge Functions, Vercel Firewall, and VDC/ISR. Reduced cogs over 40%, increased performance (lowering p99 <strong>over 99%</strong>) and re-architected core systems for stability and scaling to manage high year over year growth.</li>
<li>2020-2021 Shopify: Worked on the Scripts Platform, a WASM execution platform for 3rd party extending of performance critical aspects of the shopify e-commerce platform. Started teams to rebuild key areas of product including discounts to allow for 3rd party extension.</li>
<li>2019-2020 Justworks: Lead a transformation in engineering building a career growth framework, starting a working groups program to address years of technical debt, and started the first cross discipline department between sales and product engineering in the companies history.</li>
<li>2016-2019 Bustle Digital Group: Transformed the engineering team and infrastructure to allow us to grow from 2 brands to over 10 enabling a 5x growth in revenue and 3x growth in headcount.</li>
<li>2015-2016 Bocoup: Started a new division specializing in advising IoT and Electronics companies, building tools, and solving problems quickly using open source software.</li>
<li>2014-2015 Wizard Development: Started a company based around <a href="https://www.roborooter.com/post/1570/our-two-visions/">training a diverse team of junior developers</a>. Served customers in publishing and logistics. Featured on the PBS News Hour for our work in education.</li>
<li>2012-2014 The Levo League: Brought a fledgling startup onto the national stage.</li>
<li>2010-2012 Highbridge Capital Management: Transformed a traditional NOC into makers of the company&#39;s tool and providers of training.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I started the Web Connected DevicesÂ initiative at <a href="https://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a>. I built a team around trying to improve the developer experience and tooling around making web connected devices, I wanted to make it easier to build the &#34;internet of things that do what I tell them&#34; and explored the internet I wish we had. While a lot of our work was behind the scenes, we did build the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14265">SparkFun Inventors Kit</a> which has one of the best books to come with any educational electronics kit you&#39;ll find anywhere. It&#39;s also a great platform to prototype on.</p>
<p>When I joined the Bustle Digital Group. I lead the projects that migrated and decommissioned years of legacy systems, moved everything to a serverless architecture (which saved 90% of operating costs), and acquired over 8 other publishing companies. I&#39;m quite proud of our API that&#39;s <a href="https://roborooter.com/post/1911/we-live-in-memory/">very fast</a>. In addition to software engineering I&#39;ve built and hired a top notch engineers and technicians who kept us modern and nimble.</p>
<p>See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisgulotta/">LinkedIn</a> for a full job history.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://serialport.io">Node Serialport</a> I&#39;ve been the primary maintainer since 2015. The project had been largely unmaintained for a few years and it needed some love. I spent several months doing bug triage and fixing what was possible without a major release. Re-engaged users who had felt abandoned. And then purposefully had major releases to bring the api in line with the common use cases, developer assumptions and reality. I&#39;ve recruited a few other maintainers since and am working on unifying node serialport and the proposed web serialport api. Currently the #4 binary package.</li>
<li><a href="http://nodebots.io">NodeBots</a> Helped start the wordwide JavaScript hardware events.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluestream">bluestream</a> Make nodejs streams play nice with async functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/streaming-iterables">streaming-iterables</a> Replace your streams with async iterators.</li>
<li>Many more projects can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/reconbot">github</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=author%3Areconbot">npm</a> pages. They range from helpful libraries to silly experiments.</li>
</ul>
