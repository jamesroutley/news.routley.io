Because blockchain <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#wallet" target="_blank">wallet</a> addresses are long, random alphanumeric strings, traders often use the first and/or last several characters to quickly recognize wallets, and copy and paste regularly used wallet addresses from their transaction history. This has given rise to a type of scam known as &#34;address poisoning&#34;, where scammers generate wallet addresses that share similar beginning and end characters, and use them to send transactions to wealthy victims. If they&#39;re lucky, as they were in this case, the victim will accidentally copy the similar looking scammer&#39;s wallet address when making a transfer of significant size.<p>After the theft, the victim sent an on-chain message to the scammer, offering a $1 million &#34;<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#bounty" target="_blank">bounty</a>&#34; for the return of the remaining funds. They threatened, &#34;We have officially filed a criminal case. With the assistance of law enforcement, cybersecurity agencies, and multiple blockchain protocols, we have already gathered substantial and actionable intelligence regarding your activities.&#34; However, there&#39;s been no activity from the wallet since the message, and the thief had long since begun laundering the funds via Tornado Cash.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Thief wallet</span></a><span>, Etherscan</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251223200045/https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/idm?addresses=0xcb80784ef74c98a89b6ab8d96ebe890859600819,0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5&amp;type=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>On-chain message</span></a><span>, Etherscan</span></li></ul></div></div></div>
