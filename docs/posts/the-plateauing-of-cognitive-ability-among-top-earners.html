    <h1>The plateauing of cognitive ability among top earners</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For some reason whenever I&#39;m in a transitionary point in my life I end up rebuilding my website. Well, this time is no different: I recently quit my job, moved halfway across the world to Germany and, in the spare time between mountains of visa paperwork, have rebuilt my website once more.</p><p>Aside from a few UI tweaks (and probably bugs) it shouldn&#39;t look too different than it did before. The real change is what is generating the site: a shiny new Clojure-based static site generator I&#39;ve named Jupi (pronounced HOO-pee, after our cat). I did this partly as a means to gain more experience with Clojure and partly out of frustration with some of the limitations I faced building the previous version of my site with Jekyll. For now, Jupi is pretty specialized to my use case, but here are a few interesting factoids about it:</p><ul><li>The HTML for pages can be generated using nothing but Clojure. I use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">hiccup</a> to translate the data structures into HTML strings. See the source for <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/main/item/src/vesto/routes/index.clj">the index page</a> for an example.</li><li>I wanted to experiment with how far I could get by using <em>only</em> Clojure, so even <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/main/item/src/vesto/routes/stylesheets.clj">the CSS</a> is generated with clj using <a href="https://github.com/noprompt/garden">garden</a>. After a few weeks with this I&#39;ve actually found that I like it more than writing SASS.</li><li>It has the concept of &#34;collections,&#34; similar to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">Jekyll&#39;s</a>, however they&#39;re much more flexible and can be defined by anything from markdown files to JPEG files. See examples of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/main/item/src/vesto/routes/blog.clj">my blog</a> and <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/main/item/src/vesto/routes/photo_galleries.clj">photo galleries</a>.</li><li>I managed to get a REPL-based live-reloading workflow going using a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/9bec04947255fc8ad4be374a32aa94bc960223a3/item/src/jupi/tpl_helpers.clj#L6-11">highly savage macro</a> that overloads <code>defn</code>. Is this a good idea? Maybe not. But it&#39;s undeniably <em>an</em> idea.</li><li>The photo gallery collection <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me/tree/9bec04947255fc8ad4be374a32aa94bc960223a3/item/src/vesto/routes/photo_galleries.clj#L25-53">handles</a> automatically resizing large photos into thumbnails which should make it much less work to add new galleries in the future.</li><li>The flexibility of having a full programming language at my disposal to generate pages should allow for some fun experimentation. A couple ideas I&#39;m currently floating around:<ul><li>Query my listening history from Plex at compile time and generate a last.fm-like page of my top albums for the month.</li><li>Fetch posts from Mastodon and archive them on the site.</li></ul></li></ul><p>For those who are curious and want to poke around, I&#39;ve released the source code <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vesto/stevegattuso.me">on SourceHut</a>. I&#39;ll likely have more to say on this in the future, as I have a growing desire to clean and package Jupi into a library that others can experiment with.</p></div></div>
