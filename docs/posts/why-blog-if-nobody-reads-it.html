    <p>Back in the day, advertising legend Bill Bernbach said, “The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.”</p>
<p>Let’s tell the truth, then: Nobody reads your blog.</p>
<p>At least, not as many as you’d like. Maybe a handful, maybe none. You pour your thoughts into it, craft each sentence, pick the right image — then silence. No likes, no shares, no engagement.</p>
<p>So what’s the point?</p>
<p>There’s two lies we tell ourselves:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If I write it, they will come.</em> They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.</li>
<li>If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it, though?</p>
<p>There is a hidden value in blogging.
There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.</p>
<p>Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.</p>
<p>When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.</p>
<p>So, who’s there real audience?</p>
<p>You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future you. Your posts become a time capsule of your evolving mind.</li>
<li>One right person. Maybe one day, someone stumbles across your words at exactly the right moment. And that changes something for them.</li>
<li>The work itself. Consistency beats virality. A hundred posts with depth will outlast a single viral hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there’s another thing. My other passion is street photography. Which is a bit like blogging.</p>
<p>You walk through the city, camera in hand. You see a scene — a moment of light, shadow, humanity. You capture it.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>But that’s not why you did it. You did it because you saw something.</p>
<p>Like blogging. You write because you think, because you observe, because you need to put it somewhere.</p>
<p>If someone reads it? Bonus. If not? The work still got done.</p>
<p>And that’s the real point.</p>
