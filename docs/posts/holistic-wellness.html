      <p>Today I found out that one of my fellow Recursers makes music. No, that&#39;s not entirely true: today I found out he makes <em>awesome</em> music. He performs under the moniker <a href="https://holisticwellness.bandcamp.com/album/what-time-does-the-shock-arrive-at-the-top-of-the-pipe">Holistic Wellness</a>, and his last work is a three-song serving called “What Time Does the Shock Arrive at the Top of the Pipe?”. This wordy and beautiful piece of sonic deconstruction sneaked up on me, and I loved every second of it. The first song, “Melt Glass”, is a home-made concoction, while the other two songs are covers.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here&#39;s Abe aka Holistic Wellness performing “What Time Does the Shock Arrive at the Top of the Pipe?”. Props if you know where he might derive this monster of a title from.</p>
