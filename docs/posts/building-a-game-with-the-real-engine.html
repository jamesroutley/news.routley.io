    <h1>Building a Game with the Real Engine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people make games using the Unreal Engine.  That’s nice, but I
wanted something a little different.  That’s why I’m using the Real
Engine.</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/real-engine.png" alt="Real Engine Logo" title="A logo that looks like Unreal Engine&#39;s, except instead of a spiky U it&#39;s a spiky R and instead of saying &#39;Unreal&#39; it says &#39;Real&#39;" id="realenginelogo"/></p>

<p>(OK, I’m not really calling it “Real Engine”; Epic please don’t sue me).</p>

<p>What’s the Real Engine?  Simple: instead of modeling a space in
Blender and then texturing it, I’m building a diorama and taking some
pictures of it.  Then I import it into the point-and-click game engine
I built and connect up the pictures into a space.  If something needs
to move, I either do stop-motion animation, or I photograph the
components separately and animate it within the engine.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/high-mountain-abbey-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot" title="A bookcase sits against a speckled, streaked, white wall. A book lies open, spine-up, on the floor.  The floor is marble tiles in red and gray.  In the foreground, there&#39;s a church pew viewed edge-on.  A streak of light from above shines on the bookcase." id="screenshot"/></p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Why would I do a cockamamie thing like this?  Well, it’s not the first
thing I tried.  The first thing I tried was reaching out to an artist
whose work I’ve been enjoying for decades, who lives in my city, and
who claimed to be inspired by Myst.  He agreed to work with me on the
project, which was just perfect.</p>

<p>Then I guess he thought better of it, and he ghosted me.</p>

<p>So I found another artist who wanted to work with me.  He didn’t ghost
me.  He just didn’t do the work, and eventually told me that he wasn’t
going to do the work.  I think there was some sort of illness
involved.  So we parted ways.  It’s too bad, because he clearly
understood where I was coming from, and had some great ideas.</p>

<p>So at that point, I could have gone and found yet another artist.  But
if two artists had failed, why would I think a third one would do any
better?  As Einstein supposedly said (but didn’t actually), “the
definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
expecting different results.”  Also, I had to consider my emotions:
it’s heartbreaking to think you have a partner, and then realize that,
actually, you don’t.  I didn’t want to put myself through that again.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve started working on this myself, I realize that it’s
possible that I was asking too much of the artists.  I’m going to end
up spending three times as many hours doing the art as I’ve spent on
the code, at least.  I’ve had thirty years of experience as
a programmer, and much less as an artist, so it’s not really a fair
comparison.  But it’s still the truth.</p>

<h2 id="howlongwillthistake">How long will this take?</h2>

<p>To get started, I prototyped a single room.  Actually, I only did one
end of the room, because it was just a quick test.  My prototype only
took a few days.  So I thought that maybe it would only take a few
months to do a full game.  I was wrong.  Here’s the room:</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/real-prototype.jpg" alt="Prototype model" title="A model of a scriptorium at dollhouse scale.  It&#39;s kinda janky looking, and large areas are made of construction paper." id="prototypemodel"/></p>

<p>Looking at that image, I hope you’ll see why I thought this was a good
idea.  But look a little closer, and you’ll see why I was wrong about
the timing.  There are four major issues (and some minor ones):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Light leaks. The edges aren’t well sealed, because I wasn’t
thinking hard about light.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll notice that you can see a nubbly gray thing behind the
scroll niches.  That’s a random blanket that I put there to block
light.  I actually needed to do a bunch more construction to hide that
background correctly (replacing the blanket with duvetyne would help
too).  Anyway, the visual design of that scroll case could use some
work — the niches should be diagonal, and go less close to the walls.</p></li>
<li><p>The table has tiny dowels for legs, and the top is plain
construction paper.  I would rather have something that looks a little
more like wood, and legs that aren’t so spindly — even if it’s just
faux finishing.</p></li>
<li><p>The windows don’t have glass in them, and in fact, the muntins (or
cames, or whatever the bits between the glass are called in this
context) are made of the same paper as the walls.</p></li>
<li><p>The ceiling is flat and boring.</p></li>
<li><p>The depth of field is not great, about which more later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the same problem that AI art has: it’s fine on first glance, and then
you get closer and it all falls apart.  As <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">John Salvatier notes,  “Reality has a surprising amount of detail”</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is: I could fix most of these — but fixing them basically
means rebuilding the entire room.</p>

<p>So “a few days” becomes a few weeks or a month, and now I’m looking at
a much longer timeline.  Fortunately, nobody is going to scoop my idea,
because nobody else is insane enough to build a game this way.</p>

<h2 id="priorart">Prior Art</h2>

<p>OK, maybe someone else is.  There’s <a href="https://slow-bros.com/harold-halibut">Harold
Halibut</a>.  They’ve built real
objects and then used photogrammetry to put them into a traditional 3d
engine.  It’s a neat idea, but my idea involves one fewer step.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Also apparently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205020/Lumino_City/">Lumino City</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZVhtuKleLuI">Papetura</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood">The Neverhood</a> use
similar physical modeling techniques.</p>

<h2 id="whynotblender">Why not Blender?</h2>

<p>Why don’t I just use Blender like everyone else?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I hate Blender.  I mean, I understand that it’s the standard thing
that everyone uses, and I know that I would eventually get used to the
UI.  But almost every time I use Blender, I end up mangling the
geometry in some way that requires either me to take a hundred years
of clicky work to fix it, and in the end I wish I had remade the part
from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not much good at textures.  I could just buy a bunch of
textures, but getting them to look nice together would be tough.  And
I would still end up with a bunch of repetition, because there’s just
no way a solo dev can get enough textures.  Cyan manages it — when
playing Firmament, I didn’t notice any texture repetition (I did
notice that the music was an incomprehensible drone, except for the totally perfect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzKjFTAbhjg">VNV Nation
track</a> at the end).  But
this seems to scale with studio size.  In this screenshot from <a href="https://querngame.com/">Quern:
Undying Thoughts</a>, take a look at the wood
texture on the dock.  They get a little extra mileage by mirroring the
texture on alternate boards, but it’s still the same texture:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/quern-textures.jpg" alt="Quern" title="A. screenshot from Quern: Undying
 Thoughts. A wooden dock extends out into the ocean under a cloudy
 sky. The weathered boards of the dock all use the same texture." id="quern"/></p>

<p>Zadbox, which created Quern, is smaller than Cyan.  Going down to a
single-person studio, <a href="https://haven-moon.com/">Haven Moon</a> is a noble
effort, but I got awfully bored of seeing the exact same brick wall in
dozens of places.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to do that to my players.  The whole point of games like
this is to explore a new world.  But if you’ve already seen all of the
textures on the first island, then you’re not really exploring a new
world.</p>

<p>By contrast, here’s what my staircase looks like (before I install it
— it’ll be in a stone tunnel, so the details might be harder to see
in situ):</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/stairs.jpg" alt="Stairs" title="A photograph of a model
staircase in dark wood.  The stairs are worn and cracked, and the
angles are not quite square.  It sits atop a &#39;stone&#39; rectangle, which
sits on a piece of cardboard." id="stairs"/></p>

<p>Every stair is different.  Some of the angles are a little off square,
which is totally fine, since it’s supposed to be sort of beat up and
ramshackle.</p>

<h2 id="whynotaiart">Why not AI art?</h2>

<p><a href="https://novalis.org/blog/2023-05-30-turds.html">I’ve addressed this before</a>.  But also
consider the following prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Painting based on Goya’s Saturn Devouring His Son, but with a giant
  eagle eating a tiny headless monk in a brown robe. The eagle holds the
  monk’s in its giant claws. Crimson fluid leaks from the monk’s neck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/fuck-midjourney.jpg" alt="Fuck Midjourney" title="Four images: an eagle
 feeding blood to a child in a brown robe. An eagle dripping blood
 onto the hand of a youth in a brown robe; the child&#39;s hand and face
 are bloody and the hand only has three fingers but not because one
 was eaten. A child with no legs holding back the claw of an
 eagle. The best one but still no good: an eagle with its beak at the
 face of a man; maybe it&#39;s eating him or maybe it&#39;s feeding him.  The
 eagle has distorted, weirdly large human hands wrapped around the
 man&#39;s neck." id="fuckmidjourney"/></p>

<p>So, AI is bad at prompt following.  But also, it would be really hard
to have it do two images of the same room from different locations.  I
would probably have to generate one image, then convert it to a 3d
model, and then use controlnet.  I’m not sure this is less work than
any of the other methods.</p>

<p>And even if I did build a gray box model to use with controlnet,
Midjourney doesn’t even understand that if there are arches and
columns, the arches have to be on top of the columns.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>So given that I’m going to use the Real Engine (Okay, okay, Epic, I’ll
stop now), how will I do it?</p>

<h2 id="whatkindofspace">What kind of space?</h2>

<p>Myst and Riven are set on a series of islands.  Haven Moon is set on a
series of islands.  Quern is set on a series of islands.  Firmament is
set in… well, I won’t say to avoid spoilers, but a small number of
relatively enclosed spaces.  In a game like this, any time the player
tries to walk off the edge of the map and just hits an invisible wall,
it’s immersion-breaking.  That’s why there are so many islands.</p>

<p>So I needed space without a lot of freedom.  I decided on an abbey
high in the mountains.  The mountains will be a matte painting, and
most of the game will take place indoors.  It’s not exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose">an
original setting for a
mystery</a>, but I
think I’ve put my own twist on it.  The setting then gave me enough
inspiration to put together a story.  And the story has then suggested
certain aspects of the puzzles.</p>

<h2 id="roughingout">Roughing out</h2>

<p>First, I drew a floorplan in Inkscape.  (I’m not sharing any maps
here because I don’t want to spoil the fun of exploring the space once
the game is released).  This just marked out the walls and doors of
each room, so I could get a sense of how the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>Then I copied that floorplan into Blender, building up the volumes of
the space.  This let me more easily see how the roof lines would
appear, and fly around to get a sense of scale.  I guess some people
can do this mentally from just a floorplan, but since I plan to have
complex roofs, Blender was easier. I left some interior spaces out of
the model, since they don’t have roofs.</p>

<h2 id="scale">Scale</h2>

<p>Dollhouse scale is usually 1:12 (for a delightful note on this,
<a href="https://clairelevans.substack.com/p/the-queens-dolls-house">search this page for “Mervyn O’Gorman”
</a>).  This
makes the arithmetic easy for Americans like me who grew up with
“customary units”: an inch is a foot.  And it’s workable for
interiors: you can fit a large room on your table, if you have a big
table, and you can fit a phone camera into a small room and still get
things in focus.</p>

<p>But if you want an exterior of the entire abbey (and you definitely
do!), you either need a bigger workshop than I have, or you need to
take a hint from model railroading and go to 1:48 scale, which the
model railroading folks call “O scale”. Having two different scales is
annoying, because it means that you can’t seamlessly blend — if you
want a door from the interior at 1:12 to the exterior at 1:48, you
can’t just put the two dioramas next to each other, you have to put a
green screen on both doors and then later paste in to each the
appropriate photograph of the other one.</p>

<p>I think I actually will end up using a third scale because 1:12 is
too teensy for some of the really complex bits, but hopefully that’s
just for a room or two.</p>

<p>For another wonderful article of scaling, see John McPhee’s article
<em>The Ships of Port Revel</em>, in his collection <em>Uncommon Carriers</em>.  “At
scale the mallards are thirty feet long,” is a line I often think of
as I work on this project.</p>

<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>

<p>I had initially planned on shooting the whole thing on my phone
camera.  There’s a problem with this: my phone is six inches wide, and
the camera is at one end, so if I have a narrow hallway, I can’t have
the camera centered unless I hold it vertically (which loses
resolution, since the game will be designed for 16:9).  Also, the
phone camera is very smart, which means that I’ll be constantly fighting
it to get consistent lighting.  I know there are APIs for manual mode, but
building a custom Android camera app would be a lot of work.</p>

<p>A SLR was right out; they are giant compared to the space I’m
shooting, and even macro lenses typically have too-large minimum focal
distances.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: the camera must operate inside an entirely enclosed
space, and I need to see the pictures as I go in order to make sure
I’m getting what I want, and I need to do this without picking up
the camera to look at a screen.</p>

<p>So I decided to build a camera.  Well, I bought a Raspberry Pi camera
module (and then a second one when the first one wasn’t good enough),
and built a tiny Flask app which runs on the Pi to take pictures and
allow me to adjust the exposure and focal length over wifi.  The Pi
is powered by one of those phone battery packs, which is cheap and
runs about all day before needing a recharge.  It sits on some wooden
blocks so that the photos are all from the same eye level.  The camera
is a bit noisy, but long exposures help a lot.</p>

<p>Actually, I ended up buying a third camera and a second Pi.  The
OwlSight only has a 68 degree horizontal field of view.  My aspect
ratio is 16:9 (1.77:1), but for most shots it’s actually 1.956:1,
because I leave a little margin around the edges so that I can show it
as you rotate, making the direction of rotation clearer. So I ended up
having to move the camera very far away from the wall to get enough
into view.  With a second camera at a slight angle to the first, I can
stitch two photos into a panorama.</p>

<p>I’m also doing focus stacking.  The idea is that a macro lens has a
relatively shallow depth of field.  This is a distinctive look: things
shot in macro look like they are shot in macro.  If you want to make
large things look like macro, you use tilt-shift photography to fake
this effect.  If you want the opposite, you use focus stacking: take
photos at multiple depths of field, and choose the in-focus parts of
each.  The stacking happens before the panorama, since then I don’t
have to worry about panotools picking the same points of
correspondence for each image pair in the stacks.</p>

<p>The Pi doesn’t have enough RAM to easily run focus stacking software,
so my Flask app just scps the files up to my desktop, and then runs
the focus-stacking software there.  Then it copies the composited
image back for display.  Then if I like the pic, I can press a button
to copy it back into the game’s assets directory (named
appropriately).  I also save the images from which I built
each focus stack, in case I want to do more editing later.</p>

<p>The whole thing is slightly janky, but there’s a trade-off between
spending time improving the app and actually making the game.  By
nature, I’m very excited about working on tools.  As an indie game
dev, that’s a trap.  Because of the long exposures at multiple focus
levels, I do have a bit of time between shots to futz with the camera
code and write the post that you are reading now.</p>

<p>Every room I build, I learn something.  For instance, the OwlSight
camera’s auto white balancing seems to blow out reds.  I didn’t notice
that until I tried to shoot some red-orange needle-felted balls.  So
I’ve added manual white balancing control.</p>

<p>The second room I built has a rough floor.  This means that the camera
stand (which is literally some random wood blocks that I had laying
around) doesn’t sit flat.  Or maybe the floor just isn’t level to
begin with — there was definitely some warping when I applied the
air-dry clay to the masonite, and I’m not sure gluing braces on later
quite got it all out.  Mostly, I don’t care if if the camera is a bit
off level, but in one case, I have a machine on the wall that needs to
be dead square to avoid annoyances during animation. So I built a
camera leveler with another wood scrap.  It has threaded inserts at
the corners, so I can turn screws to adjust the height of the four
corners of the cameras.</p>

<p>The third room ended up having insufficiently bright lighting. I
bodged together a partial solution, but it’s still going to be the
dimmest room in the game.  Next time I’ll use brighter LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Architecture is really hard.  Consider the chapel: I picked the shape
for it based on where it fit into the rest of the monastery.  There
are some subtle constraints — like, I really wanted one of its walls
to be blocking the view from the door to the front hall, because
otherwise that door would open into the garden, which is at O scale.
And I did a flat angled roof because a gable roof would be hard to
square with the six-sided floorplan. Also, I think a gable roof with
elaborate decorative skylights might be weird, and skylights are the
only hope for lighting a room of this size.</p>

<p>After examining the model in Blender, I decided that it could be a
chapel.  A bit 1960s looking, but OK.  Unfortunately, this meant
trapezoidal walls, and compound angles.</p>

<p>The skylight wasn’t going to be quite enough light, so I added a bunch
of fenestration.  I decided on stained glass, and tried several ways
to make it look right. In the end, one of the windows has a complex
pattern which I printed on acetate, and the others have simpler
patterns which are alcohol-based ink on acrylic.  The acetate is
brighter, but the acrylic is good enough and comes in larger sizes.</p>

<p>Of course, the windows have to be high enough that you can’t see much
out of them, because outside the windows is the garden, which is still
a different scale.  I guess I could have just planted some trees right
outside, and built two scales of tree, but then I wouldn’t as much
extra light.  With high windows, the sky will still be visible.  So I
just painted a rough blue-white gradient on some cardboard, which,
through the acrylic, is good enough.</p>

<p>If this were actually built in the 1960s, the windows would be
aluminum rectangles.  But rectangles are boring.  I went with
bird-inspired shapes, which are hopefully a bit Gaudi-esque. Birds are
a big theme in this game, for reasons players will discover.</p>

<p>I made the chapel floor with “stone” tiles.  To make tiles, I used
<a href="https://jenniferrizzo.com/how-to-do-acrylic-paint-pouring-for-beginners/">poured paint</a>
on paper, cut into squares.  This was a bad decision, because I had to
pour like a dozen sheets to get enough squares, and then I had to glue
them down (I used gray paint as the glue, so it could double as
mortar).  The good decision I made was to align it diagonally, which
meant that I could hide some of the unevenness.  But then I didn’t do
a great job of getting straight lines, so I had to trim some of the
tiles.  Probably nobody will notice.  Also the tiles peeled some,
which means that the floor looks kind of cracked.  Fortunately, the
story of the game makes this not totally unreasonable, so I’ll just
knock over some of the pews and throw some prayer books around, and say
there some sort of catastrophe here.</p>

<p>The walls are covered with Thai kozo paper.  But where the paper
joins, it doesn’t look great, so I built some columns to cover those
places up.  The columns are foam covered with more kozo paper.  For a
couple of the interior corners, I used some wood framing.  There are
a lot of little decisions like this: I need to cover an edge or a
corner, so I add a little trim, which ends up adding visual interest
to the space.</p>



<h2 id="premadedollhousefurniture">Premade dollhouse furniture</h2>

<p>No. If I do that, my game will look like everyone else’s dollhouse.
Also, in theory it’s copyright-infringing, although in practice, I’m
unlikely to get sued.  I tried to use some lighting marketed for
dollhouses just to avoid wiring my own LEDs, but they ended up not
being bright enough.  Dollhouses usually have one open wall so that
you can <a href="https://youtu.be/j9V4s75yivg?si=cWux63_ptdKJZYTJ&amp;t=273">get Sandy Toksvig inside
them</a>, so
lighting inside a dollhouse is for looks not for illumination.  So I
won’t try that again.</p>

<h2 id="dprinting">3d Printing</h2>

<p>I want to avoid 3d printing as much as possible, because 3d printed
stuff lacks that handmade look.  Also, it means I have to use Blender.
Well, when I’m lucky, OpenSCAD.  I have needed a few prints.  First I
ordered online, then I borrowed <a href="https://thingswemake.com/">my
brother-in-law’s</a>, and now my wife brought
me home a 3d printer that someone in her office was just giving away
for some reason (this is how the rich get richer).</p>

<p>The other bad thing about 3d printing is layer lines.  I had some
bench parts printed, and I thought I could cover up the layer lines
with acrylic paint, but it it turned out that even two layers of gesso
followed by two layers of paint didn’t solve the problem.  When your
camera is four inches from the subject, every little line shows.  The
actual solution is
<a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/product-line/xtc-3d/">XTC-3D</a>, which is a
rather unpleasant product: expensive, short pot life, hard to apply
thinly, and weird-smelling.  But it does the job, which is the
important thing.</p>

<p>Speaking of extremely fine details, my workshop is unfortunately also
inhabited by two long-haired cats.  Every time I see them, I think
“Did he who made the lamb make thee, and if so, why did he make you
shed so damn much?”  Keeping the hair out of the dioramas is quite
tricky, and I often find that I have to remove a stray hair and
reshoot.</p>

<p><img src="https://novalis.org/blog/images/cats-are-bad.jpg" alt="Cats are bad" title="A piece of sonotube with a veneered inside.  Inside the tube is a janky-looking collection of electronics and a large silver Maine Coon cat." id="catsarebad"/></p>

<h2 id="clay">Clay</h2>

<p>Even though I have a full pottery studio with a kiln, I’m going to use
very little ceramic clay for this project.  One reason is that the
cycle time is high: I need to accumulate enough stuff to fill a kiln,
and then run the kiln, and then glaze, and then run the kiln again.</p>

<p>Ceramics has a very distinctive look, which is mostly not what I want
for this space.  I do have plans for a couple of pieces — which,
given the cycle time, I should probably start on.</p>

<p>Some of the door moldings are made from DAS air-dry clay.  It’s
nowhere near as nice to work with as real clay, but it’s surprisingly
strong — you can pick up a piece of molding that’s 1/16” thick and 7”
long by one end, and it won’t break.  Try that with green stoneware
clay and you’ll have a bad day.  And you can cut it with a knife even
when it’s dry.  I also made a vase out of it, but getting something
round at that scale with that clay is tricky.  I should probably just use
real clay for that.</p>

<p><a href="https://avesstudio.com/shop/apoxie-sculpt/">Epoxy clay</a> is really nice
to work with, if you’re quick.  I made doorknob parts with it, and filled in
some of the cracks in the door moldings.  It’s hard as a rock once it’s
dry, so you don’t want to be too sloppy, but it remains sandable when hard.</p>

<h2 id="needlefelting">Needle felting</h2>

<p>Instead of glowing screens, I’m probably going to do most of the
screen-like puzzles using needle felting.  I think in my ideal world,
every puzzle would have a reasonable and diegetic hardware
manifestation, but that’s not quite how the puzzle design ended up
going.</p>

<p>So far, it’s a lot of fun. I’m not anywhere near the level of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMKxk0Xu52s">Andrea
Love</a>, but I can make
cool stuff.  For my first animation, I made ten frames (for each of
the three animations), then I used
<a href="https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan">RIFE</a> to add three frames
in between each of my originals.  I think this was especially helpful
at the end of the animation, since my animation loops back to the
first frame, but the felt didn’t end up exactly perfect.  At 20 FPS,
it still looks like stop-motion, which I think matches well with the
handmade look of the rest of the game.  I’ll probably reduce the
frame rate of the other animations in the scene, and add a little
jitter, to match.</p>

<p>(This video has a white rim which will be masked out in the actual
game — doing alpha channels in video is tricky, so I’ve just written
little shader which applies a mask at runtime)</p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>

<p>I’m really excited to be working on this project.  I go to work every
day happy, and I fall asleep thinking about what I’ll do next.  I can’t
wait to show you the world I’ve built.</p>

<p>High Mountain Abbey will be released once I have designed,
