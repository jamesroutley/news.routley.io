    <p>A long overdue addition to this page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello and welcome to Hell Gate. We are a subscriber-funded, worker-owned news outlet about New York City, named for the city’s sturdiest (and handsomest) bridge over its most treacherous currents.</p>

  <p>The goal? To be trenchant, playful, outraged, irreverent, and useful to our readers; deeply skeptical of power but stubbornly idealistic. And never a chore to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been a subscriber since they first started and have never regretted it. They stole my heart with <em><a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/who-does-upstate-matter-to">Where Does Upstate Begin If You Are Traveling at the Speed of Light?</a></em></p>
