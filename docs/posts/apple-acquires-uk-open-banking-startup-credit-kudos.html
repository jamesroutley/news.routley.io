    <h1>Apple acquires UK open banking startup Credit Kudos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Credit Kudos, a UK open banking startup that helps lenders make better decisions, has been acquired by US tech giant Apple.</p>
<p>The deal closed earlier this week, according to three people close to the deal. One source said it valued the startup at about $150 million, a significant uplift in valuation. A link labeled ‘Website Terms of Use’ on the Credit Kudos website currently leads to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html">a page</a> outlining Apple’s terms of use. Both Credit Kudos and Apple were contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.</p>
<p>Credit Kudos last raised money at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in April 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/credit-kudos/">bagging £5 million</a> (roughly $6.5 million) in a round led by AlbionVC. TriplePoint Capital, Plug and Play Ventures, Ascension Ventures’ Fair by Design fund, Entrepreneur First and a number of angel backers also invested.</p>
<p>The startup offers insights and scores on loan applicants drawn from bank data — specifically transaction and loan outcome data — sourced via the UK’s open banking framework. Its API can offer lenders faster decision-making, less risk, and increased acceptance rates, according to its website.</p>
<h2><strong>Open Banking frenzy</strong></h2>
<p>Launched in 2015 by founders Freddy Kelly and Matt Schofield, Credit Kudos becomes the latest in a string of big European open banking acquisitions in the past year — albeit the first to be snapped up by a tech giant.</p>
<p>Up to now, card network operators Mastercard and Visa have been driving consolidation in the sector. In June 2021, Visa <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/109441/visa-acquire-european-open-banking-tink">paid €1.8 billion</a> (roughly $2.15 billion at the time) for Swedish open banking firm Tink — an acquisition that was finalized earlier this month. In September, Mastercard announced <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-expands-open-banking-reach-with-acquisition-of-aiia/">the acquisition of</a> Aiia, a Danish open banking startup.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear what Apple has planned for Credit Kudos. The Silicon Valley-based company currently offers financial products primarily through its mobile wallet Apple Pay, and in the form of a credit card that it began <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-card-launches-today-for-all-us-customers/">rolling out</a> in August 2019</p>
