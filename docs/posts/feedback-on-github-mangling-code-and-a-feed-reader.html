    <h1>Feedback on github, mangling code, and a feed reader</h1>
    
    
<p>
Before I launch into responding to some reader feedback, there&#39;s a 
strange meta-note that I&#39;ll mention in case it twigs any memories for 
other people who run web servers.  There&#39;s some really strange set of 
web robots that seem to go crawling for URLs that end in something like 
&#34;feedback&#34; or &#34;contact&#34; or &#34;support&#34; and &#34;help&#34; and stuff like that.  
They&#39;ll pull an index page and then fetch *all of them* in one fell 
swoop.  It&#39;s pretty clear that they don&#39;t give a damn about looking 
halfway plausible.  Real people don&#39;t request pages like that.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s really strange is that nothing else happens after that point.  
Maybe they&#39;re looking for pages that have feedback forms, or comment 
fields, or something like that?
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I have no such things on my posts.
</p>

An anonymous reader asked for my Github URL.  I actually used it with 
a paid account for a while, but then stopped using it a long time ago.  
I&#39;m talking
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/03/04/git/">waaaaay back in 2012</a>
when they were pulling all kinds of stupid &#34;let&#39;s trust your data to 
this overly dynamic web shit&#34; on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
I moved out 12 years ago and haven&#39;t gone back.  It turns out that it&#39;s 
rather simple to just set up a repo on an accessible box and point the 
participant boxes at it - the ones where I do dev work, the ones that 
run automatic builds for me these days, and so on.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ve done some
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2013/07/20/ssh/">dubious</a>
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2013/04/07/ssh/">things</a>
with &#34;public keys&#34; that I disagreed with, too.  Someone actually went 
and made a &#34;ssh whoami&#34; type thing where if you connect to it and 
present the public key that&#39;s on a github profile, it greets you by 
that profile&#39;s name.  Cute.
</p>
<p>
(Aside: There&#39;s a DEF CON talk out this week which talks about how 
people *still* don&#39;t really know that sshd will totally tell a client 
whether a key pair is allowed in given just the *public key*.  You 
should find the slides for &#34;SSHamble&#34;.  They&#39;re good.)
</p>
<p>
Since then, they had a bunch of crazy stuff involving the treatment 
of their employees and all of that kind of crap, but I was already 
gone.  Then, hey, an old adversary from the 90s popped its head up and 
gobbled them up.  Yep, Microsoft bought Github in 2018.  That&#39;s the kind 
of devious move that is entirely consistent with their old ways of 
operating.
</p>
<p>
This is where a bunch of people who weren&#39;t even alive in the 90s pop up 
and tell me how they&#39;re different, and thus prove a point I was telling 
people about 10 years back: &#34;you&#39;re not going to recognize them 
eventually, and younger folks will have no idea of the evil they&#39;ve 
foisted upon the world over the years&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Basically, if I was an evil sort and wanted to keep my thumb on the 
scale of what the &#34;dirty free software hippies&#34; were doing, buying the 
thing that&#39;s practically become synonymous with &#34;git&#34; itself for many 
people would be a great place to start!  So, when they went and did 
that, well, that&#39;s just cake.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;d be like IBM buying Red Hat... but wait, that happened too!
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s ironic that a fully-distributed-capable system like git ended up 
with its own &#34;network effect&#34; that brought people into a single site to 
that degree.  Sure, there are others, but you have to know something 
about the scene to even realize they exist in the first place.
</p>
<p>
I bet if that had happened in 1998 instead of 2018, it&#39;d be 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Desktop">&#34;Microsoft ActiveGit&#34;</a> 
or some crap like that by now.  They would have totally rebranded it to 
try to fit with the rest of their corporate hell.
</p>
<p>
When it finally does happen, try to act surprised.
</p>
<p>
So... TL;DR there&#39;s a github profile out there where you&#39;d expect to 
find one for me, but it has no activity, and for good reason.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
The previous reader also asked if I had ever taken someone else&#39;s code 
base and turned it into something that &#34;bears little resemblance to the 
original creature&#34;.  I&#39;m pondering this one, and, well, I don&#39;t think I 
have?  It&#39;s not like I turned a wolf into an eel or something like that.
</p>
<p>
Okay, there was this 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/05/02/py/">internal web service</a>
up at a place with WAY too much Python.  It was (of course) written 
in Python as well, and I&#39;ve mentioned it before.  It was a tool 
which was intended to make it easier for people to collaborate on 
outages... you know, &#34;SEVs&#34;, or whatever you might call them where you 
are.
</p>
<p>
It had been written by someone as a side project of sorts, and that 
particular company had no love for such pure engineering work.  In fact, 
that person was on the verge of getting in trouble with their manager 
for hacking on it in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So, when I showed up and realized we needed some different behavior out 
of this tool, I reached out to the nominal owner, learned of the 
situation, and then got their blessing to go and hack on it, and hack I 
did.
</p>
<p>
I put in enough to get it to where other people could see where I was 
trying to go with it, and then a couple of solid developers showed up 
and started cranking on it.  They fixed a bunch of stupid things I had 
inflicted upon the code base, and got it to where it was a joy to use.
</p>
<p>
Also, I had an intern come through who did an amazing job on all of the 
&#34;followup&#34; side of things - you know, getting a report together, 
bringing it to a review meeting, collecting follow up tasks, and making 
sure those actually happen.  I had been doing it by hand, and it was 
awful.  When he got done with it, it was a breeze.
</p>
<p>
Did it look like the original tool?  I guess superficially it kind-of 
did.  It still had a list of comments and a way to add a new comment.  
It picked up features for both the direct users and the reliability 
people behind the scenes, but it was still nominally an &#34;incident 
manager&#34;, even though I had rebranded it &#34;SEVPanel&#34;.
</p>
<p>
It effectively went from a young wolf to an adult wolf.  No eels or 
other aquatic wildlife mangling was involved.  That&#39;s all.
</p>
<p>
The better question is probably *why* I did what I did and set to work 
on an existing thing instead of trying to come up with something new.  
That&#39;s a long and messy answer.  It has chunks of &#34;because it was a 
right pain in the ass to start a new project there&#34; along with &#34;I was 
getting enough pushback just introducing the term &#39;SEV&#39;&#34;, so changing 
the *host name* of the service from incidentassistant.${COMPANY}.${TLD} 
to something else was <em>right out</em>.  I never would have heard the end 
of that one.
</p>
<p>
It was so hard to start a service there... (&#34;how hard was it?&#34;) ... that 
one weekend, someone parked a critical piece of infra atop our 
&#34;bookmark&#34; shortcut service because it was needed to support a 
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/fhv-accessibility-passenger.page">certain piece of legislation</a>
that had been passed by a city.  It was a matter of &#34;put it right 
there right then&#34; or the company would have been in capital-T Trouble.  
Also, the company would have looked like giant assholes to the people 
who needed that level of service, but don&#39;t despair - they delivered on 
that sort of thing
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/01/26/feedback/">plenty of other times</a>
that year.
</p>
<p>
In the rush, the only real solution was to stack it atop something  
solely intended to support in-browser shortcuts for employees.  Why 
there?  It was simple, it was easy to hack on, and if they broke it for 
a few days, eh, it wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  It was literally a 
thing that saved you typing out longer URLs when you wanted a shortcut 
to a particular internal web page.
</p>
<p>
As for why it was so urgent, apparently management sat on it as long as  
possible, THEN dropped it on the engineers.  Typical crap for them.
</p>
<p>
And hey, now you know a bit more about the context of my 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/03/05/prod/">&#34;edit in prod&#34; story</a>
from a few years back.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Another reader asked for my opinion of Tiny Tiny RSS because they are
planning on self-hosting it.  I pretty much covered the range of 
behaviors that are showing up to the feed test site in my 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/08/02/fs/">summary post</a>
from the other day.  
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s definitely doing a bunch of &#34;double tap&#34; polls all over the place, 
and I have no idea why.  To be clear, I don&#39;t really care all that much 
WHY it happens, just that it does, and it happens a lot.  It&#39;s not like 
a single user went and hacked something broken into the source.  That 
doesn&#39;t fly when it shows up from multiple users who don&#39;t even know 
about each other.
</p>
<p>
Nope, whatever&#39;s going wrong is some weird stuff from upstream.
