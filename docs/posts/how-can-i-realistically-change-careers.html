    <h1>Ask HN: How can I realistically change careers?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve spent almost two decades in digital-focused roles, specialising in strategy, user research, and creating frameworks for better customer experiences (ostensibly UX I suppose).</p><p>While I’ve found the work rewarding, I feel it’s time for a significant career change—potentially outside of this domain entirely.</p><p>I’m seeking advice from others who have made mid-career transitions:</p><p>• How did you pinpoint new directions that matched your skills and interests?</p><p>• What were the most effective ways to reposition your experience in a new field?</p><p>• Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for upskilling or building networks?</p><p>I&#39;ve often thought about cybersecurity as something I&#39;d like to specialise in, but it seems like bootcamps and the like aren&#39;t worth the money they charge (most advice has been starting at the bottom as an IT helpdesk worker and going from there, but I&#39;m no spring chicken anymore. But I&#39;m not against starting at the very bottom and working my way up).</p><p>I realise this is quite a broad ask, and apologies for the throwaway. I’d appreciate any insights, especially from those who’ve shifted from established careers to something entirely different. Thanks in advance!</p></div></div></div>
