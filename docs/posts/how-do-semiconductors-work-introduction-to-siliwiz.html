<p>SiliWiz will help you get a basic understanding of how semiconductors work and are manufactured at a fundamental level. Semiconductors are the most important technology of the 21st century but only a tiny fraction of us know how they work or are designed and made.</p>
<p>Completing and understanding all the lessons will take around 3 hours.</p>
<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Curious people who are probably over the age of 14</li>
<li>High schools, universities</li>
<li>People who want to get a better understanding of how microelectronics function and how they are made.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aims">Aims</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draw your own logic gate and understand how that gate would be manufactured in a <a href="https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/foundry/">foundry</a>.</li>
<li>Learn how the gate is built out of the fundamental circuit elements used in chip design</li>
<li>Understand how the drawings are used to manufacture the chip</li>
<li>Be aware of some of SiliWiz’s limitations and simplifications</li>
