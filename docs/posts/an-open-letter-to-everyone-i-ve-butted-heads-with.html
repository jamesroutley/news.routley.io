    <h1>An Open Letter to Everyone I&#39;ve Butted Heads With</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Note: This blog post is not a reaction to recent events or some kind of apology. Nothing happened;
this is just me doing self-reflection.</p>

<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/8e08cf4bec80b87a7a22a18086a3db5c2c0f1772">turned
10 years old</a>, and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the project overall, and what another ten
years of my life might look like.</p>

<p>More specifically, I&#39;ve been thinking about my interactions with people over
the years, both positive and negative.</p>

<p>Since Zig&#39;s inception, I never stepped down from the &#34;creator&#34; role.
Although the core team has grown to about five active people, I never stopped
triaging. I never stopped thinking critically about the language. I
never stopped helping newbies get their bearings. I never stopped welcoming
contributors to join the project. I never stopped reviewing code. I never stopped
working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f30PceqQWko">major features</a>.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/">not
willing to put up with advertisements</a>, I am perfectly willing to help
beginners and advanced users alike <a href="https://ziggit.dev/">in a traditional forum setting</a>,
where relationships can be forged.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I&#39;ve had a fair share of negative interactions with
various individuals. This actually really bothers me, because I love people. 
Naturally, I love my friends and family, but I also love my neighbors, and random
people walking down the street. I love chit-chatting with people I haven&#39;t met before.
When I was a teenager I used to make fun of the idea of &#34;small talk&#34;, but now I proudly
have mastered the art in order to spark conversations with strangers.
I love people in other countries. I love people who are different than me. I love people
who make fun of me. I love people with different political opinions than me. I
love the person who cuts me off in traffic and flips me off. They&#39;re just
having a bad day, you know?</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to figure out: why do these negative interactions happen?</p>

<p>The reasons behind this can be complex, but I think in relation to Zig, there is one pattern
in particular that has strong explanatory power.</p>

<p>Programming language and toolchain technology can have a huge impact. Specifically,
even minor differences can affect the day-to-day lives of a
large number of hours for a large number of people. For example, time spent waiting to compile
is multiplied by a person&#39;s time spent in a workday, multiplied by how long they are employed
to use that technology, multiplied by how much that technology is used in the industry.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, workers do not have the choice of which technology to use. They are generally stuck
using what their company tells them to. Of course, one can
use tricks like <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">&#34;it&#39;s
easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission&#34;</a>, but people who are bold enough
to employ such tricks are typically the same people who are capable of being entrepreneurs themselves.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that most people on our beautiful, precious planet will not have the
opportunity to create a programming language project that reaches a level of maturity such that
it can be part of their careers, or even a realistic choice for their hobby projects.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s incredibly frustrating.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t have the madness required to dedicate 10+ years of your life working on an
unproven technology, doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have a valid opinion about <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/544">tabs vs spaces</a>.</p>

<p>You, along with 99.999% of programmers, are faced with the reality of
picking your favorite set of <em>practical</em> programming language
technologies for tackling whatever problems you encounter. This presents two
nasty problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>You want your favorites to become more popular, because this increases the
probability that you can find a job using those technologies, and increases the
practicality of using those technologies for hobby projects. Similarly, you don&#39;t want
a newcomer in the space to compromise your existing skills, forcing you to spend a bunch of time learning
a new technology just to maintain relevance in the industry.</li>

<li>If the leadership of one of your chosen favorite technologies makes a decision that you don&#39;t like,
<strong>you are fucked</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>There is a huge range of decision-making in which the effects weigh heavily
on any particular individual, and yet forking is not a realistic option.</p>

<p>In these moments, it&#39;s only natural to be angry. I really, truly get it. I do! Because
I&#39;m a hypocrite. I do the exact same thing. There are plenty of projects that I depend on and use
daily, but I know that, sadly, I&#39;ll never have time to compete with them or even meaningfully
contribute to them. For example, as much as I&#39;d love to create a mainstream operating system,
I simply have too many other competing interests lined up first. And I catch myself, repeatedly,
complaining about operating systems and saying harsh things about those who
develop and maintain them.</p>

<p>In other words: it comes down to <em>lack of agency</em>. When we care about something, but
we perceive futility in our efforts to change it, our only resort is to lash out.</p>

<p>Directly addressing those whom I&#39;ve had unpleasant Zig-related exchanges with:</p>

<p>First of all, I&#39;ve had plenty of bad days. I&#39;ve done issue triaging while
grumpy. For that, I&#39;m sorry. I hope in the future, I can have a more consistent
pattern of expressing the warmth I feel inside my heart for my fellow humans
through my everyday interactions on the Zig issue tracker.</p>

<p>Even if I disagree with you, even if I blocked your GitHub account, even if
I locked an issue after you made a comment, even if I ignored your pull
requests for a long time and then closed them without even a word, I still
think that <strong>you are not only justified in wanting what you want, you are also
justified in feeling angry about not getting it</strong>.</p>

<p>My friend - it&#39;s not personal. I care about you. I actually do value your opinion. I&#39;m interested
in your thoughts and feelings. I want to make you happy. I&#39;m sad that I can&#39;t serve you better with my
open source project. I want to. I wish I could.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hustling. I&#39;m <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/">playing the game</a>. I&#39;m
doing what it takes to make this thing mainstream and a viable, practical
choice for individuals and companies. If you talk shit about Zig in public, I&#39;m
going to fight back. But I respect you. I see you. I understand you. I don&#39;t
hate you. I would literally buy you a drink.</p>

<p>With the dawn of another decade, I hope to maintain this perspective in my day-to-day interactions.
I think I can level up - cranking up the empathy dial with my interactions - even the contentious ones - while still cultivating
this budding technology; protecting it from those who would destroy or corrupt it; growing
it into a flourishing global community that brings digital prosperity to all
who congregate under its inclusive, welcoming tent.</p>
