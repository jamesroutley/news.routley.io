    <h1>KeePassXC 2.7.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Today, we are releasing <strong>KeePassXC 2.7.0</strong>. Closing 118 issues and merging in 149 pull requests, this 
release is one of our biggest and most important yet! We have incorporated several significant improvements
including:</p>

  <li>Much, much moreâ€¦</li>
</ul>

<p>Pictures are worth a thousand words, so here are some shots of the new features within 2.7.0. The first
image shows the new Auto-Type selection dialog brimming with options. You can now easily search all open
databases for an entry to type using the same powerful search syntax as in the main application. You can also
type out TOTP codes and copy data to the clipboard from this dialog. We feel like this is a game changer
to interacting with your database.</p>

<p>Up next is the long-awaited implementation of entry tags. We added a quick selection panel to the bottom-left
of the main view. When a tag is clicked, the entry list is filtered instantly to show entries that contain that
tag. We also included some default searches for showing entries that are expired or have weak passwords. Tags
are easily added when editing an entry with auto-completion enabled. This feature is going to see additional
growth in upcoming releases.</p>

<p>We also took this opportunity to improve how you view entry history. We now show which fields changed between
each line item, so you can easily revert a specific change.</p>

<p>Lastly, we added a new tab to the database reports that shows data used by the browser extension. You can very
quickly see all entries with URLs and with custom settings for the browser extension. This report allows
you to quickly hone in on entries with wrong URLs or misconfigured allow/deny settings.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> The new release is the first to be built with the Microsoft toolchain instead of Msys2 on Windows.
As a result, Windows users may need to install the <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable</a>
if experiencing issues with missing DLLs.</p>
