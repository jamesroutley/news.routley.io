    <h1>Show HN: I&#39;m building an app to replace Overleaf and Notion</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN,</p><p>Since 2019, I’ve been working on a writing platform designed for creating complex documents (e.g., theses). I personally use it for everything as it also allows to classify documents in categories so you can organize them efficiently.
As of a few months ago, the app is also available in the browser, and you can now invite coworkers to collaborate on a document in real time.</p><p>The app is somewhat inspired by LyX. It offers an intuitive, modern editor, but users don’t need to know any LaTeX. When it’s time to export, they can choose from a range of templates (IEEE paper, thesis, etc.).</p><p>A few highlights:</p><p>- It uses a custom-built block editor that performs well with large documents. Each block is its own contenteditable element (instead of having one massive contenteditable for the whole document)</p><p>- If you prefer plain text - you can insert a Markdown block and write using Markdown instead</p><p>- Built-in citation management</p><p>- Support for cross-references and footnotes</p><p>- Mermaid diagrams, inline LaTeX equations, and display math are all supported</p><p>- &#34;To-do&#34; sections help you stay organized while writing</p><p>You can try it out here: <a href="https://www.monsterwriter.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.monsterwriter.com/</a></p></div></div></div>
