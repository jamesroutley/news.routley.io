    <h1>Google destroyed my Play Developer Account and my work for the last 2 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="591c">I hope that sometime in the future Google will change its automatic termination policy and stop destroying the dreams and labors of developers who are trying to create something in the Android ecosystem.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*t7PlbQzAGRZO2t_XmIeCXQ.png" width="700" height="419" role="presentation"/></p></div></figure><p id="cd94">I am a full-stack developer and about 5 years ago, I came up with the idea of creating an application, but for various reasons I postponed it. And 2 years ago, the stars aligned, and I started working on the application.</p><p id="4ce7">I have come a long way with some mistakes, and as a developer, had to learn some unusual things for me, such as creating my own brand, social media pages, promotional videos, adverts, etc. After almost 2 years of development, working with users, collecting feedback, and, of course, improving the app, my account and my app have been completely removed, here are some details.</p><p id="8399">To cut a long story short — due to moving to another country, I wanted to update my developer account to follow all the rules related to taxes in that country, but with Google, it’s not so easy, you can’t change the country for an existing payment profile (and also create a new payment profile), you need to create a new Google account, then pay for a new developer account and only then create a new payment profile and transfer your app to that new account.</p><p id="eca1">After all the steps described above had been done, in order not to mislead anyone, I changed my developer name, which, according to the <a href="https://support.google.com/paymentscenter/answer/9037880?hl=en" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Play documentation</a>, should be fine, here is a fragment from it:</p><blockquote><p id="5e36">1. Follow these steps to create a new payments profile. Pay careful attention to the country you enter when you set up your profile.</p><p id="6d91">2. Transfer your developer name. If you want to use the same developer name on your new profile as you’re using on your original profile, change the name on your original profile first. After you change your developer name on the original profile, you can update the developer name on your new profile.</p></blockquote><p id="3504">And what I did is exactly what is listed in this snippet: I changed my developer name on my original account, and then, after a couple of minutes, changed it on my new one. This is, probably, the place where my mistake is. I guess that I need to wait for the changes in my original account to be approved and only then change the new one, but this is just my assumption, and you can see that there is nothing in the documentation about this.</p><p id="2ce7">The next morning I received an email from a merciless Google bot:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*V4CWDzgT-xbpoAUSQ40rBA.png" width="700" height="725" role="presentation"/></p></div></figure><p id="b3a8">I couldn’t believe what I was reading — my account and my app had been terminated. Immediately after, I filed an appeal, which stated that both accounts belong to me, that I followed the Google documentation and did not want to mislead anyone, even on the contrary I tried to prevent it. Next to the submitted appeal I still can see that it may take up to seven days:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*kzw6p-WOuPKCYBP_" width="700" height="111" role="presentation"/></p></div></figure><p id="e572">After 20 days, they violated their own deadline almost 3 times and I have received no further responses at all.</p><p id="7611">Also, during these 20 days, I created 10 tickets for the Support team, tried to chat with real people to describe the situation, and asked for how long I need to wait for a response. Guess what? Nothing. The answer is always the same, just a copy-pasted snippet from their policy, and if you keep insisting, you just get: “We feel your pain, sorry, but we can’t help and can’t provide any contacts to reach the Policy team out”, you can’t find anyone to contact to have your case reviewed.</p><p id="d6c3">Why do they call themselves a support team? There is no support from their side at all, it’s more like mockery.</p><p id="33d0">And here we are, I am completely shocked by the lack of customer support from Google, even more, worried that any new account I create in the future may also be deleted without any warnings. There’s literally nothing I can do here.</p><p id="3446">Now, answering the questions of the users who bought my app or who can’t find it in the Google Play market and apologising to them, I understand that I kind of hate Google for feeling helpless, for 2 years of almost daily work that can be destroyed in a couple of seconds, and no one cares about it, for the attitude from Google to developers thanks to whom Google gets a lot of money and builds the Android ecosystem.</p><p id="eeb1">My last hope is that the kind people reading this letter will like, share and comment on this story in the hope that the Google team will do the right thing and restore my application and developer account.</p></div></div></section></div>
