          <p>This article covers a use case for <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, an exciting new product by <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, on holidays in Far North Queensland, my wife and I parked our rental car in a paid parking lot to visit a restaurant.</p>
<p>I paid using the EasyPark App per the council&#39;s instruction on various signs throughout the lot.</p>
<p>When we returned, they had slapped a fine on our Toyota anyway.</p>
<p><img alt="Parking Fine" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-parking-fine.png"/></p>
<p>I double-checked what I had entered into the app. I mistyped the number plate by one letter. Oops.</p>
<p>Since we have never received a parking fine before, and I had proof of payment, I knew there was a good chance the council would let me off if I sent a letter of explanation.</p>
<p>We had already been experimenting with ChatGPT, and the letter seemed a good test case.</p>
<p><img alt="This is the prompt I first put into ChatGPT" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-prompt1.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="This is the first response I first put into ChatGPT" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-response1.png"/></p>
<p>The first response was close but longer than I would like. Plus, I didn&#39;t tell it that I was planning to attach a photo of the fine and proof of payment.</p>
<p><img alt="The 2nd prompt passed to ChatGPT" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-prompt2-response2.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="ChatGPT 2nd Response" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-response2.png"/></p>
<p>That works. Now for a title.</p>
<p><img alt="Title request" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-title.png"/></p>
<p>I emailed that<small>*</small> from my phone and a day later received this response.</p>
<p><img alt="Response from Council" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-response-email.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="Council response" src="https://notesbylex.com/_media/chatgpt1-council-response.png"/></p>
<p>So you can dispute a parking fine with ChatGPT.</p>
<hr/>
<p>ChatGPT is incredible -  I cannot believe how well this technology works. It&#39;s like having a talented personal assistant (who is often wrong - need to read their work thoroughly) at your fingertips.</p>

* I used ChatGPT from my phone and didn&#39;t screenshot the prompt, so I had to generate a new prompt/response for this blog post. It&#39;s similar enough that I&#39;m sure it would work too.
