    <h1>Tell HN: Please don&#39;t print â€“-help to stderr in your CLI tools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you get a lengthy help description which then you pipe to less.. and you only get (END) in your terminal. Turns out the author decided to print help message to stderr instead of stdout. I assume newcomers will be as confused as I was when it happened to me for the first time. GNU utils use stdout for help texts, and so should you.</p></div></div>
