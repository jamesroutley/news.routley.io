    <h1>US airlines transported passengers over two light-years since the last crash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>Sometimes, the most important news is when something isn’t happening.</h2></header><p><span>When an airplane crashes, we all hear about it. Large crashes are major news events, with shocking pictures repeated endlessly across our television screens.</span></p><p><span>What is much harder to notice is the opposite: the absence of plane crashes.</span></p><p><a href="https://x.com/RyanRadia/status/1764868263903723874" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>A post on X</span></a><span> by Ryan Radia made me aware of just how rare plane crashes have become in the United States. In response, I looked up the relevant data and wrote this brief article to bring it to our attention.</span></p><p><span>The title gives away just how incredibly safe US airlines have become.</span></p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/data/Pages/paxfatal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>last time</span></a><span> a US airline crashed was on February 12, 2009, in New York State. Fifty people died.</span><a href="#note-1"><sup><span>1</span></sup></a></p><figure><figcaption><span>Private jets, smaller planes, and helicopters have crashed more frequently, but this article is about the safety of the regularly scheduled flights of commercial airlines that most people travel with (flights regulated as “Part 121”-travel in the US).</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>How far have US airlines carried passengers since February 2009? According to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, US airline customers traveled </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>13.3 trillion passenger miles</span></a><span> since then. “Passenger miles” are a straightforward way to account for both the number of passengers and the distance they travel. A single passenger mile represents one person traveling one mile. So, five people traveling ten miles would sum to 50 passenger miles.</span></p><p><span>13.3 trillion miles is a lot! It’s equivalent to 535 million trips around the Earth or 28 million visits to the moon and back.</span><a href="#note-2"><sup><span>2</span></sup></a></p><p><span>It is such a long distance that it is not unreasonable to measure it in light-years. One light-year is the distance light travels over one year — 5.9 trillion miles. So, the total distance traveled without a crash equals 2.3 light-years.</span><a href="#note-3"><sup><span>3</span></sup></a></p><p><span>It is hard to visualize this vast distance. In the chart, I’ve compared it with Earth’s distance from the sun. The distance passengers traveled on US airlines without a plane crash is 143,208 times further than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. So, if the distance between the Earth and the Sun is represented by a line of the length of 10cm, then the 2.3 light-years would be represented by a distance of 14.3 kilometers.</span><a href="#note-4"><sup><span>4</span></sup></a></p><figure><picture><source srcset="/images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_48.png 48w, /images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_100.png 100w, /images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_350.png 350w, /images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_850.png 850w, /images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_1350.png 1350w, /images/published/US-airline-travel-v2_8823.png 8823w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"/><img src="http://tinylogger.com/images/published/US-airline-travel-v2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="8823" height="4590"/></picture></figure><p><span>It shows me how hard it is to notice the absence of something. I was not aware that no US airline had crashed in the past 15 years. And I didn’t realize what an incredible safety record this represents, given how many people are boarding flights every day.</span></p><p><span>More importantly, this shows us how very safe we can make technologies if we want to.</span></p><p><span>One key reason for the safety improvement in the US airline industry was the open sharing of data. US airlines started to openly share information about all incidents that risked passenger safety with each other. This made it possible for everyone to learn from the aggregate of all incidents rather than just the incidents each airline encountered themselves.</span><a href="#note-5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a></p><p><span>Because safety has been made such a clear priority, flying is now extraordinarily safe.</span></p><p><strong><span>Acknowledgments:</span></strong><span> Thanks to Hannah Ritchie, Simon van Teutem, and Angela Wenham for their helpful feedback.</span></p><section id="article-citation"><div><h3>Cite this work</h3><p>Our articles and data visualizations rely on work from many different people and organizations.
