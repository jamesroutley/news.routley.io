Like many others, I found myself spending over 12 hours a day in front of a computer or digital screen. My days were filled with supporting students, attending meetings, reading documentation, learning, and programming. By the end of the day, my eyes felt strained, and I was tired and distracted.</p><p>I realized that the digital tools we depend on for our day-to-day activities could be improved. They should be more beneficial to our health, less demanding of our attention, and better suited to our needs. I wanted to create a space free from distractions and eyestrain where I could focus on reading, writing, and thinking—a productive environment conducive to my health. This realization led me to reimagine personal computing and build calm, intentional technology.</p><h3>Shared Challenges</h3><p>As I shared my vision with others, I found that many people faced similar challenges: writers, authors, journalists, programmers, students, teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, makers, digital minimalists, people with visual impairments, those with health issues and many more.</p><p>We all struggled with the same problems—headaches, eyestrain, and distractions caused by our reliance on digital screens. This shared experience fueled my desire to create technology that respects our time, attention, and well-being.</p><h3>Open-Hardware and Open-Source</h3><p>As an open-hardware and open-source company, we strive to create an environment where experimentation, learning, and creativity can flourish. For those who wish to delve deeper, <a href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider">our README on GitHub</a> provides a comprehensive primer on e-ink technology. </p><p>We believe that open-source and open-hardware are crucial to envisioning and building a different reality—one where technology supports our well-being and fosters a healthier relationship with our digital lives.</p><p>We invite you to <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/modos-tech/modos-paper-monitor">sign up on Crowd Supply</a> to stay informed about the latest news and updates on our project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div>
