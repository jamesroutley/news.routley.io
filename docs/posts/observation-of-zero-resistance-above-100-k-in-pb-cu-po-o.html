            <span>Abstract:</span>  Room-temperature superconductivity has always been regarded as the ultimate
goal in the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, with its
realization holding revolutionary significance, capable of triggering
significant changes in energy transmission and storage. However, achieving it
poses various challenges. Recent research revealed that material
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O displays room-temperature superconductivity
under atmospheric pressure, sparking global interest in further exploration.
Here, we utilized solid-phase synthesis to obtain a polycrystalline sample of
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O. X-ray diffraction confirmed its structural
consistency with referenced literature. Zero resistance, which is important
evidence for superconductivity, was observed above 100$^\circ$ K under ambient
pressure in our experiment. Our finding indicates that
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a possible candidate for searching
high-temperature superconductors.
