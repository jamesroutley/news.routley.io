To pull off this incredible medical feat, doctors employed the world’s first custom in vivo (i.e. inside a living organism, rather than in a petri dish) <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a28539000/crispr-testing-will-challenge-inherited-blindess/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a28539000/crispr-testing-will-challenge-inherited-blindess/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CRISPR gene therapy" data-node-id="6.3">CRISPR gene therapy</a>. This technique, developed over decades thanks to U.S.-funded medical research, could help alleviate painful lives for millions of people born every year with now-fixable genetic disorders. </p><section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="7"></section><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8">“Years and years of progress in <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a21461/crispr-human-trials/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a21461/crispr-human-trials/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gene editing" data-node-id="8.1">gene editing</a> and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,” Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a co-author of the study, <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2025/may/worlds-first-patient-treated-with-personalized-crispr-therapy" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2025/may/worlds-first-patient-treated-with-personalized-crispr-therapy" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in a press statement" data-node-id="8.3">said in a press statement</a>.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9">The details of this incredible medical intervention play out like a made-for-tv medical drama, but the stakes were incredibly real and deadly serious. A week after his birth, doctors noticed something wasn’t quite right with KJ. After ruling out a few possibilities, they stumbled across the unfortunate answer—a rare genetic disorder called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency that affects only one in every 1.3 million babies. This disorder inhibits the body’s ability to get rid of <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a31036312/green-ammonia-renewable-energy-risks/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a31036312/green-ammonia-renewable-energy-risks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ammonia" data-node-id="9.1">ammonia</a>, a product of protein metabolism. This can have deadly consequences, impact brain development, and wreak havoc on the liver. Usually, the treatment for a disorder like this is a liver transplant, but that was not an option for the infant boy, who was still too young to be considered for the surgery.</p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">So, once arriving at a diagnosis, Ahrens-Nicklas contacted a gene-editing specialist at the University of Pennsylvania named Kiran Musunuru and “the clock start[ed]in my mind,” he later told <em data-node-id="10.1"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/health/gene-editing-personalized-rare-disorders.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/health/gene-editing-personalized-rare-disorders.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" data-vars-ga-product-id="169050d8-6b17-45fe-a1da-c392d92c105c" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="10.1.0">The New York Times</a></em>. Working with a team of specialists across the country for six months, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a targeted gene therapy to fix KJ’s specific variant of CPS1. Meanwhile, KJ was kept under medical surveillance at the hospital and subsisted on a diet completely devoid of <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/solar-system/a31192959/protein-meteorite/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/solar-system/a31192959/protein-meteorite/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein" data-node-id="10.3">protein</a> to avoid making his condition worse. By the time the CRISPR treatment was ready, KJ was in the 7<sup data-node-id="10.5">th</sup> percentile for his weight. </p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11">On February 25, the team began administering the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64593150/gold-nanoparticles-vision/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64593150/gold-nanoparticles-vision/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="treatment" data-node-id="11.1">treatment</a>, with Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru describing the process as both exciting and terrifying. </p><section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="12"></section><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13">“One of the most terrifying moments was when I walked into the room and said, ‘I don’t know if it will work but I promise I will do everything I can to make sure it is safe,’” Ahrens-Nicklas told <em data-node-id="13.1">The New York Times</em>. </p><p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">The first infusion took two hours, and within two weeks, KJ began eating protein like a healthy baby. A second dose arrived 22 days later, and about two weeks ago, KJ received a third. Although it’s unknown if he will eventually still need a liver <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64514733/heart-transplant-beating/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64514733/heart-transplant-beating/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="transplant" data-node-id="14.1">transplant</a>, doctors can now safely say that a human life has been saved thanks to the world’s first bespoke in vivo gene therapy—a huge testament to decades of a research and experimentation.
