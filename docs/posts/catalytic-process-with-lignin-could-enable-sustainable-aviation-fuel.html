               <p>An underutilized natural resource could be just what the airline industry needs to
                  curb carbon emissions.
               </p>
               
               <p>Researchers at three institutions—the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable
                  Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Washington
                  State University—report success in using lignin as a path toward a drop-in 100% sustainable
                  aviation fuel. Lignin makes up the rigid parts of the cell walls of plants. Other
                  parts of plants are used for biofuels, but lignin has been largely overlooked because
                  of the difficulties in breaking it down chemically and converting it into useful products.
               </p>
               
               <p>The newly published research demonstrated a process the researchers developed to remove
                  the oxygen from lignin, such that the resulting hydrocarbons could be used as a jet
                  fuel blendstock. The research, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435122004068">Continuous Hydrodeoxygenation of Lignin to Jet-Range Aromatic Hydrocarbons</a>,” appears in the journal <em>Joule</em>.
               </p>
               
               <p>Gregg Beckham and Earl Christensen are the researchers involved from NREL.</p>
               
               <p>The paper points to the need to use sustainable sources for jet fuel as the airline
                  industry has pledged to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Airlines consumed 106
                  billion gallons of jet fuel globally during 2019, and that number is expected to more
                  than double by 2050. Accomplishing the industry’s goal of achieving net carbon neutrality
                  during that same period will require a massive deployment of sustainable aviation
                  fuel (SAF) with high blend limits with conventional fuel.
               </p>
               
               <p>Jet fuel is a blended mixture of different hydrocarbon molecules, including aromatics
                  and cycloalkanes. Current commercialized technologies do not produce those components
                  to qualify for a 100% SAF. Instead, SAF blendstocks are combined with conventional
                  hydrocarbon fuels. As the largest source of renewable aromatics in nature, lignin
                  could hold the answer to achieving a complete bio-based jet fuel. This newly published
                  work illustrates the ability of a lignin pathway to complement existing and other
                  developing pathways. Specifically, the lignin pathway described in this new work allows
                  the SAF to have <span>fuel system compatibility </span>at higher blend ratios.
               </p>
               
               <p>Because of its recalcitrance, lignin is typically burned for heat and power or used
                  only in low-value applications. Previous research has yielded lignin oils with high
                  oxygen contents ranging from 27% to 34%, but to be used as a jet fuel that amount
                  must be reduced to less than a half-percent.
               </p>
               
               <p>Other processes have been tried to reduce the oxygen content, but the catalysts involved
                  require expensive noble metals and proved to be low yielding. Researchers at the trio
                  of institutions demonstrated an efficient method that used earth-abundant molybdenum
                  carbide as the catalyst in a continuous process, achieving an oxygen content of about
                  1%.
               </p>

                  Innovation funded the research.
