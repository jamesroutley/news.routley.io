    <h1>Solving SICP</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org09ba1f9">
<p> The execution was performed in the following way: </p>
<p> At the start of the work, the outline-tree corresponding to the book subsection tree was created. Most leaves are two-state <b>TODO</b>-headings. (Some outline leaves correspond to sections without problems, and thus are not <b>TODO</b>-styled.) </p>
<p> <b>TODO</b>-heading is a special type of an org-mode heading, that exports its state (TODO/DONE) to a simple database, which allows monitoring of the overall TODO/DONE ratio of the document. </p>
<p> Intermediate levels are not <b>TODO</b>-headings, but they contain the field representing the total ratio of <b>DONE</b> problems in a subtree. </p>
<p> The top-level ratio is the total number of finished problems divided by the total number of problems. </p>
<p> An example of the outline looks the following: </p>

<pre id="nil">* SICP [385/404]

<p> When work is clearly divided into parts and, for each unit, its completion status is self-evident, the visibility of completeness creates a sense of control in the student. The “degree of completeness of the whole project”, available at any moment, provides an important emotional experience of “getting close to the result with each completed exercise”. </p>
<p> Additional research is needed on how persistent this emotion is in students and how much it depends on the uneven distribution of difficulty or the total time consumption. There is, however, empirical evidence that even very imprecise, self-measured KPIs do positively affect the chance of reaching the goal. (See: \cite{VanWormer2008}) </p>
<p> From the author’s personal experience, uneven distribution of difficulties at the leaf-level tasks is a major demotivating factor. However, the real problems we find in daily life are not of consistent difficulty, and therefore managing an uneven distribution of difficulty is a critical meta-cognitive skill. Partitioning a large task into smaller ones (_not necessarily_ in the way suggested by the book) may be a way to tackle this problem. Traces of this approach are visible through the “reference” solution PDF. </p>
<p> The problems were executed almost sequentially. Work on the subsequent problem was started immediately after the previous problem had been finished. </p>
<p> Out of more than 350 exercises, only 13 were executed out of order (See section <a href="#orgdeb122c">Out-of-order problems and other measures</a>). Sequentiality of problems is essential for proper time accounting because the total time attributed to a problem is the sum of durations of all study sessions between the end of the problem considered and the end of the previous problem. It is not strictly required for the problem sequence to be identical to the sequence proposed by the book, but it is important that, if a problem is postponed, the study sessions corresponding to the initial attempt to solve this problem be somehow removed from the session log dataset. </p>
<p> In this report, study sessions corresponding to the initial attempts of solving out of order problems were simply ignored. This has not affected the overall duration measures much because those sessions were usually short. </p>
<p> Sequentiality is one of the weakest points of this report. It is generally hard to find motivation to work through a problem set sequentially. SICP does enforce sequentiality for a large share of problems by making the later problems depend on solutions of the previous ones, but this “dependence coverage” is not complete. </p>
<p> As the most straightforward workaround, the author may once again suggest dropping the initial attempts of solving the out-of-order problems from the data set entirely. This should be relatively easy to do because the student (arguably) is likely to decide whether to continue solving the problem or to postpone it within one study session. This study session may then be appropriately trimmed. </p>
<p> The author read the whole book before starting the project. The time to read the prose could also be included in project’s total time consumption, but the author decided against it. In fact, when approached from the viewpoint of completing the exercises, material given in the book appeared to have nothing in common with the perception created by only reading the text. </p>
<p> A deliberate effort was spent on avoiding closing a problem at the same time as closing the study session. </p>
<p> The reason for this is to exploit the well-known tricks (See: \cite{adler_factors_1939}): </p>
<ul>
<li>“When you have something left undone, it is easier to make yourself start the next session.”</li>
<li>Even just reading out the description of a problem makes the reader start thinking about how to solve it.</li>
</ul>
<p> The data come in two datasets, closely related. </p>
<p> <b>Dataset 1:</b> Exercise completion time was recorded using a standard org-mode closure time tracking mechanism. (See <a href="#org21aed7c">Appendix: Full data on the exercise completion times.</a>) For every exercise, completion time was recorded as an org-mode time-stamp, with minute-scale precision. </p>
<p> <b>Dataset 2:</b> Study sessions were recorded in a separate org-mode file in the standard org-mode time interval standard (two time-stamps): </p>

<pre id="nil">&#34;BEGIN_TIME -- END_TIME&#34;.
</pre>
<p> (See <a href="#org0308b2c">Appendix: Full data on the study sessions.</a>) </p>
<p> During each study session, the author tried to concentrate as much as possible, and to do only the activities related to the problem set. These are not limited to just writing the code and tuning the software setup. They include the whole “package” of activities leading to the declaration of the problem solved. These include, but are not limited to, reading or watching additional material, asking questions, fixing bugs in related software, and similar activities. </p>
<p> Several software problems were discovered in the process of making this solution. These problems were reported to the software authors. Several of those problems were fixed after a short time, thus allowing the author to continue with the solution. For a few of the problems, workarounds were found. None of the problems prevented full completion of the problem set. </p>
<p> The author found it very helpful to have a simple dependency resolution tool at his disposal. As has been mentioned above, SICP’s problems make heavy use of one another. It was therefore critical to find a way to re-use code within a single org-mode document. Indeed org’s WEB-like capabilities («noweb»-links) proved to be sufficient. Noweb-links is a method for verbatim inclusion of a code block into other code blocks. In particular, Exercise 5.48 required inclusion of <b>58</b> other code blocks into the final solution block. Pure copying would not suffice because SICP exercises often involve the evaluation of the code written before (in the previous exercises) by the code written during the execution of the current exercise. Therefore, later exercises are likely to expose errors in the earlier exercises’ solutions. </p>
