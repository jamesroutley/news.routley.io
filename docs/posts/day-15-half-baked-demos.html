<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Busy social day! I brought chocolate chunk cookies to the hub for Half-Baked Demos (<a href="https://www.taraobrady.com/recipes-in-full/2019/5/1/tara-obradys-basic-great-chocolate-chip-cookies">this recipe</a> is one of my favorites) and demoed my work-in-progress Twine game. Pairing with Alex I was able to get my counter working to track completed steps in the recipe gameplay. I’d like to make those sections even more dynamic but we’ll see what’s possible before the game jam ends tomorrow. Good lesson for future game jams—get started right away! I put it off for a few days but once I started work on the game I wanted more time to make it better.</li>



<li>Nolen’s Localhost talk was both funny and moving, and all the talks I had with people at the hub today were inspiring. Just feeling grateful that I’ve found myself at RC right now, and motivated to keep going and keep learning.</li>
