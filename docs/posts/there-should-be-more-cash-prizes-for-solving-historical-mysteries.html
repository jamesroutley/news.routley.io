A poignant example: the Greek philosopher Chrysippus was both famed and prolific in his day, authoring some 700 texts. But aside from stray quotations in the works of others, </span><em>all</em><span> of these texts were lost. </span></p><p>… that is, until portions of them were found among the scrolls at Herculaneum. The stakes of this library, in other words, are enormous. Being able to read through all 1,800 scrolls would amount to one of the biggest historical breakthroughs of the century, literally rewriting the history of the ancient Mediterranean. </p><p>The trouble is, the scrolls are lumps of carbon. They were torched by volcanic smoke and gas during the eruption of Vesuvius. To unroll them is to destroy them. </p><p>Nevertheless, they can now be imaged in remarkable detail, using methods like X-rays and 3-D CT scans.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg" width="1456" height="753" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:753,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Carbonized Herculaneum Scroll&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;Carbonized Herculaneum Scroll&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Carbonized Herculaneum Scroll" title="Carbonized Herculaneum Scroll" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09af8692-da16-4e04-8a6a-f196e2138717_1500x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Digital Restoration Initiative, University of Kentucky</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The progress of this imaging work led to the creation, in 2021, of the Vesuvius Challenge, which promises a series of cash prizes to anyone in the world who reaches certain milestones.

The key was the “crackle pattern,” or distinctive texture left by ink. </p><p>As the post explains: </p><blockquote><p>[Farritor] began spending his evenings and late nights training a machine learning model on the crackle pattern. With each new crackle found, the model improved, revealing more crackle in the scroll — a cycle of discovery and refinement. He found a few dozen ink strokes — and some complete letters — that could be labeled and used as training data. Before long, the model was unveiling traces of crackle invisible to his own eye. Soon, these traces began to form letters and hints of actual words.</p></blockquote><p>For anyone interested in ancient history, this is a big deal. Further refinements of the technique could lead to the transcription of many (most?) of the Herculaneum scrolls. If that happens, it could add hundreds of new texts to the relatively small corpus of writings from Greek and Roman antiquity. It would be a breakthrough for scholars of the ancient world. </p><p>But I think this news is important for another reason, too. It’s strong evidence that cash prizes — even relatively modest ones like $10,000 — are effective in producing new historical knowledge. </p><p><span>The offer of material rewards for scientific breakthroughs goes back to the very beginnings of modern science. The Wikipedia page for </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_rewards" rel="">“Longitude rewards”</a><span> covers the various eighteenth-century figures — watchmakers, mathematicians, astronomers — who were awarded substantial prizes by the British government for improving techniques for determining longitude at sea (this was extremely important for early modern navies, since it was the only way to navigate reliably). But this concept is older still. As far back as 1567, King Philip II of Spain was offering similar cash rewards for similar challenges relating to improving navigation technology.  </span></p><p><span>But although these “inducement prizes” have a long history when it comes to technological advances, they are almost unknown in the world of historical research. As far as I can tell, the Vesuvius Challenge is the first such prize that is intended specifically to spur efforts to translate, preserve, or decode historical texts.</span></p><p><span> (If you know of others, please let me know in the comments). </span></p><p>Can we imagine other situations where a Vesuvius Challenge-esque setup could yield real results? </p><p>This was my first attempt at drawing up a list of possibilities: </p><ol><li><p><strong><span>Decipherment of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A" rel="">Linear A</a><span>. </span></strong><span>Unlike the riches of the Herculaneum scrolls, the existing corpus of text in this script from Crete circa 1500 BCE  is </span><em>tiny</em><span> — everything we’ve found could fit on two pages. However, it’s also far older than the scrolls, and thus could potentially add a great deal to our knowledge of the Bronze Age Mediterranean. The big problem here is that we don’t know what language the script was written in, so translating it may not be possible without additional archaeological evidence. Deciphering </span><strong><span>the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script" rel="">Indus script </a></strong><span>is a related challenge, though it’s still unclear if this is a written script at all (in the sense of encoding spoken language). </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Digitization and translation of ancient texts in known, but obscure languages. </strong><span>The </span><a href="http://ebda.cnr.it" rel="">Ebla Digital Archive</a><span>, funded by the Italian government and a consortium of Italian universities, is a great example of what this could look like. It’s a remarkable achievement, offering up not only photos and transcriptions of each of the surviving 4,500-year-old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets" rel="">Ebla tablets</a><span>, but also concordances and full text search (in Sumerian and Eblaite!). But wouldn’t it be amazing if a </span><a href="http://ebda.cnr.it/tablet/view/1118#44361" rel="">page like this</a><span> also contained a translation of the original? And if this sort of thing were duplicated for the thousands of ancient archives written in languages that few people bother to learn? </span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Decipherment of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongorongo" rel="">Rongorongo script </a><span>of Rapa Nui</span></strong><span> (Easter Island). I personally find this the most intriguing of all undeciphered languages. </span></p></li></ol><p>Thinking about it more, though, I realized that other impactful contributions would be more diffuse and distributed, less about cracking a code than about taking the time to do difficult and self-directed work over lengthy stretches. </p><p>For instance, what if there were general prizes for: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Preserving and digitizing endangered archives. </strong><span>A huge percentage of all written texts are not yet digitized. More importantly, a large portion of these </span><em>have no viable path to being digitized — </em><span>they simply do not exist in a setting where digitizing texts is possible. Keep in mind that even the United States Library of Congress, which is among the world’s largest and most well-funded archives, has, despite dedicated efforts, not even come close yet to fully digitizing its own collections. Now imagine archives like </span><a href="https://eap.bl.uk/project/EAP1068" rel="">court records from rural western Nigeria</a><span>. The British Library, via support</span><a href="https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk" rel=""> from the Arcadia Fund</a><span>, has a great, </span><a href="https://eap.bl.uk" rel="">long-standing program</a><span> to preserve and digitize such archives (and FYI, you can </span><a href="https://eap.bl.uk/sites/default/files/2023-09/Guide_for_Applicants_September_2023.pdf" rel="">currently apply for funding from it</a><span>!). But these grants of between £15,000 and £150,000 include a complex application process and team-based approach that may be prohibitive to some. I wonder how many new archives would surface if more modest cash prizes of, say, $1,000 to $10,000 were awarded for digitizing and making freely available a set amount of historical manuscripts from anywhere on earth provided they dated to ~1950 or earlier? </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Identification of archaeological sites using publicly available satellite data</strong><span>. This is not something I know much about, but it’s really striking to see how effective the internet seems to be at geolocation, on a collective level. Unfortunately, lately that skill is mostly used for warfare porn “OSINT” Twitter accounts rather than things like finding Mayan temples or ancient caravan routes on the Silk Road (although it </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/10/1558" rel="">sometimes</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/02/17/467104127/space-archaeologist-wants-your-help-to-find-ancient-sites" rel="">helps</a><span> do that, too). </span></p><p><span>+ Relatedly: how about a prize for improving methods of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/science/archaeology-lidar-maya.html" rel="">LIDAR for archaeological surveying</a><span>?</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Genomic and stable isotope analysis of historical artifacts, like </span><a href="http://theappendix.net/posts/2012/12/ravens-scull--a-handfull-of-fennel-early-modern-drug-recipes" rel="">early modern drug jars</a></strong><span>.

Or, to take another example, isotopic signatures from the claw of a dodo or other species that went extinct in historic times could reveal new information about its diet, origins, and even where it traveled and when. </span></p></li></ol><p>In other words, it’s not so much about “solving” historical “mysteries” as it is about incentivizing basic historical research. </p><p><span>This lack of wow factor when compared to goals like, say, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansari_X_Prize" rel="">launching a spaceship</a><span>, is probably part of the reason why there isn’t a long track record of setting up inducement prizes for history. </span></p><p>Is it a good reason? Not particularly. If you’re wondering why existing funding mechanisms aren’t enough to spur research in fundamental historical problems like decoding scripts or finding new sources, part of the problem is that funding is almost entirely channeled toward people like me: professional historians. One of the distinguishing features of inducement prizes, and part of why they work, is that they bring experts from other fields into the mix. History is not flashy, but it’s of fundamental importance to our species and deserving of ambitious collaborations.  </p><p><span>I’m a historian because I believe we humans tend to systematically underrate the value of knowledge from before we’re born. Different ways of being human were available in different time periods — and </span><em>only </em><span>in those time periods. When a century or a culture ends, a door closes, forever, on a spectrum of possible human experience. All historians can do is preserve and reconstruct the </span><em>traces </em><span>of those experiences.</span></p><p>But there is profound wisdom in those scraps. To extend the memory banks of our species, and to broaden our collective historical memory into cultures not yet well-represented in the written record, seems to me to be one of the better ways that human beings can spend their lives. </p><p>In other words, let’s get some inducement prizes for history going! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg" width="1456" height="1090" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1090,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Image&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758f60f8-1624-4642-8234-c1bbe6ded170_4000x2995.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><span>A surreal detail from a fresco in the Roman villa at Boscotrecase, built by Agrippa (63 BCE - 15 BCE) and buried by Vesuvius (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/OptimoPrincipi/status/1716380832116404477" rel="">via Gareth Harney</a><span>).</span></em></p><p><span>• </span><strong>The first review of my new book </strong><em><strong>Tripping on Utopia </strong></em><strong>came out — and, thankfully, it’s a starred review from </strong><em><strong>Publisher’s Weekly</strong></em><strong>!</strong><span> The key part: “Historian Breen (</span><em>Age of Intoxication</em><span>) blends fleet-footed biography with an accessible analysis of mid-20th-century research into ‘psychedelic’ experiences… Breen artfully weaves Mead’s biography with fascinating details of the sprawling psychedelics scene (producers of the TV show Flipper took acid).
