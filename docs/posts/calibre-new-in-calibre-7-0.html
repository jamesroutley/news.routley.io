<p>Welcome back, calibre users. It has been a year since calibre
6.0. The headline new feature is <b>notes for authors, series, tags, etc.</b>
calibre can now store notes with links, images and rich text formatting associated
with every author, series, publisher, tag, etc. The notes are searchable, browseable,
linkable and can be exported as standalone HTML files.
</p>

<p>To use the new <i>Notes</i> feature, right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on 
an author or tag in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and <i>Edit notes</i>.
</p>

<ul id="feature-list">
    <li>
        <span>Category notes</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            You can store notes associated with an author, publisher, series, et cetera,
            in your calibre library. To do so right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on
            an author or tag name in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and
            choose <i>Edit notes</i>. Once you have created the note, a little pencil icon
            will show next to the name in the book details panel. You can click the
            pencil to view the note.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can browse and search through all notes in your library by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>
            or adding the <i>Browse notes</i> tool to the toolbar via <i>Preferences-&gt;Toolbars &amp; menus</i>.
            </p>

        <span>Audio EPUB books in the E-book viewer</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre has gained support for so called &#34;Audio EPUB&#34; books. Typically,
            these are books that have a pre-recorded voice reading the text. Freely downloadable
            examples of such books are available at: <a title="Read Beyond books" href="https://www.readbeyond.it/ebooks.html">Read Beyond books</a>.
            When reading such a book, clicking the <i>Read Aloud</i> button in the
            viewer will automatically use the embedded audio in the book to read the text
            aloud, marking the currently read sentence and showing progress. Note that
            this may not work on Linux because of issues with patented codecs, but works on
            Windows and macOS.
            </p>

    <li>
        <span>Store extra data files associated with any book</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            A long requested feature in calibre, was the ability to store &#34;data&#34; files associated with a book
            and have calibre manage them automatically. This is finally available. Extra data files can be
            added to a book by selecting the book, right clicking the <i>Add books</i> button and choosing
            <i>Add data files to selected book records</i>. You can also manage the data files by right clicking
            the <i>Edit metadata</i> button and choosing <i>Manage data files</i>. The data files are simple
            files stored in the <code>data</code> sub-folder inside the book&#39;s folder. A common use for such
            files is storing alternate covers or supplementary material associated with the book.
            </p>

        <span>calibre&#39;s own private Recycle Bin</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre now has its own private Recycle Bin instead of using the
            operating system one. This means that it is now possible undo the
            deletion of a book with a single click, restoring all its files and
            metadata automatically. Indeed when you delete a book calibre will
            show an unobtrusive popup offering to undo the deletion for a few
            seconds. You can also browse recently deleted books by right
            clicking the <i>Remove books</i> button and choosing <i>Restore
            recently deleted</i>.
            </p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre
community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm —
without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of
day.</p>

<p>Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the
lifetime of the 6.x series. This document describes new features as compared
to 6.0</p>
