                    <p>I once heard that Javascript has so many warts because the first version was made in just ten days. I was curious 1) if this is true, and 2) if it explains the language&#39;s warts.</p>
<p>After some research, I can unconfidently say: it&#39;s complicated.</p>
<p>The &#34;first version&#34; of JavaScript did in fact take ten days. The exact dates aren&#39;t confirmed, but Brendan Eich recalls it being <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-which-10-days-of-May-did-Brendan-Eich-write-JavaScript-Mocha-in-1995" target="_blank">May 6-15, 1995</a>. But this was only a minimal prototype (&#34;Mocha&#34;) for internal demonstration. JavaScript 1.0 was publicly released in March 1996 (<a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/jshopl.pdf" target="_blank">pg 10</a>) and the first &#34;complete&#34; version in August 1996 (ibid). Even after that point, the Netscape team regularly tweaked the design of JS; Eich <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/" target="_blank">recalls that</a> &#34;Bill Gates was bitching about us changing JS all the time&#34; in the Fall of 1996.</p>
<p>Eich also had about ten years of experience with language design and compiler developer and was explicitly hired by Netscape to put a programming language in the browser (pg 7). Originally this was supposed Scheme, but then Netscape signed a deal with Sun and agreed to make it more &#34;Java-like&#34;. </p>
<h3>Does this explain the warts?</h3>
<p>Most of JavaScript&#39;s modern flaws are arguably <em>not</em> due to the short development time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mocha didn&#39;t originally have implicit type conversion, but users requested Eich add that to 1.0 (<a href="https://youtu.be/krB0enBeSiE?si=s9_oUf9Tp9Nxz-qh&amp;t=2503" target="_blank">video link</a>). He deeply regrets this.</li>
<li>JS 1.0 added <code>null</code> to be more compatible with Java (<a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/jshopl.pdf" target="_blank">pg 13</a>. Java compatibility is also why <code>typeof null = object</code>.</li>
<li>Any JavaScript API warts must have come afterwards because <em>all</em> the API work happened after Mocha. Mocha&#39;s a pretty minimal language!</li>
<li>The &#34;all numbers are floats&#34; problem was originally in Mocha, but I think that was always the intended behavior. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970613234917/http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/handbook/javascript/index.html" target="_blank">JavaScript 1.0 manual</a> cites HyperTalk as a major inspiration. I&#39;ve never used HyperTalk skimming the manual suggest to me it does the same thing (<a href="https://cancel.fm/stuff/share/HyperCard_Script_Language_Guide_1.pdf" target="_blank">pg 102</a>, 517).</li>
</ul>
<p>I found one way the 10-day sprint <em>definitely did</em> harm JavaScript: Brendan Eich didn&#39;t have time to add a garbage collector, and later attempts to add that in added a bunch of security holes (<a href="https://youtu.be/krB0enBeSiE?si=dHTMzc0DXbj-1ELQ&amp;t=2584" target="_blank">43:04</a>).</p>
<p>This newsletter takes the new record for &#34;most hours of research per word.&#34;</p>
