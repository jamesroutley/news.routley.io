    <h1>Levels of Technical Leadership</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>This document describes why and how a tech company can offer a
career path to its engineering technical leaders, that is,
different tracks for “deep ICs” versus “broad ICs”.</p>
<p>To motivate this evolution, we identify two separate pressure points:
from the business, to grow an increasingly skilled and mature
technical leadership organization. Then also from engineers, to
acknowledge a growing misalignment between their effective leadership
responsibilities and their nominal responsibilities on the <span>IC</span> career track.</p>
<p>To release this pressure, this document identifies technical
leadership as its own distinct organizational role. It has its own
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/levels-of-technical-leadership/tl-career-ladder.pdf">gradient of skills, responsibilities and organizational impact</a>,
starting as a partial overlap with the individual contributor (<span>IC</span>)
role at the senior level and forking into its own career progression
beyond that point.</p>
<p>Considerations about employee compensation are left
out of scope here and deferred to a separate discussion.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>A young tech company with large ambitions requires strong and adaptive
technical leadership. As the complexity of projects grows, so does the
amount and quality of the technical leadership.</p>
<p>It is customary for a starting business to grow technical leadership
organically, “on-demand”, by adding and removing <span>TL</span> responsibilities
from ICs at the senior level.</p>
<p>While adequate to maintain high levels of technical quality on
individual projects, the focus of ICs remains to solve problems and
build products; leadership generally remains a secondary concern. To
incentivize further leadership involvement, it is customary to promote
a <em>career ladder</em> where individual contributors (ICs) above the senior level are
invited to work on “multi-system projects”, develop “organizational
awareness”, think about “long-term technical strategy” and shape
“direction and future of entire products”.</p>
<p>As we will discuss below, this <span>IC</span>-centered vision of technical
leadership does not properly incentivize the actual leadership
responsibilities needed by a growing technical
organization. Additionally, it does not properly acknowledge the tasks
and responsibilities taken up by employees who fulfill the existing
leadership needs of the organization. In short, an <span>IC</span>-center technical
ladder, as is commonly set up in starting organizations,
is inadequate to support a growing business’ needs for technical leadership
and the career goals of certain employees.</p>
<p>However, we cannot argue either that a <span>IC</span> career ladder is a defective
approach altogether. Commonly, the “Staff” and later career levels
reflect the growth of ICs into technical depth and impact, which any
organization also needs to foster. An attempt to stretch a single <span>IC</span> career
ladder to accommodate both the org’s needs for technical depth and
organizational leadership would likely fail to achieve either.</p>
<p>This is why should identify and describe a distinct set of technical
leadership roles and identify its responsibilities.</p>

<div id="an-organization-s-growing-leadership-needs">
<h2><a href="#id4">An organization’s growing leadership needs</a></h2>
<div id="benefits-of-the-seamless-transition-between-ic-and-tl-at-the-senior-level">
<h3><a href="#id5">Benefits of the seamless transition between <span>IC</span> and <span>TL</span> at the senior level</a></h3>
<p>Commonly, ICs are assigned (or organically grow into) <span>TL</span>
responsibilities at the Senior and Staff levels. Often, at the
beginning there is no associated formal process nor a need to relabel
the position. This flexibility ensures that ICs who grow a sense of
ownership over a product area are organically recognized as leaders by
their team, adjacent teams and engineering managers (EMs). In turn,
this yields two different benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides a sense of recognition and purpose to ICs, which contributes to morale.</li>
<li>It organically staffs local technical leadership for all areas of
the product under active development, by ICs who have current
knowledge of their area, at no additional cost to the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seamless transition can perdure for a few years of growth. From
my experience, the org culture can be so defined that ICs can be made
to enter and also leave the <span>TL</span> role at this level, without incurring a
feeling of loss or demotion.</p>
</div>
<div id="shortcomings-of-ic-driven-leadership">
<h3><a href="#id6">Shortcomings of <span>IC</span>-driven leadership</a></h3>
<p>ICs, by definition, look at situations from a technical and
solution-building perspective. The work instruments wielded by an <span>IC</span>
are derived from their own skill and their knowledge, but also limited
by them.</p>
<p>For example, the ability to acknowledge and advocate that a particular
project would be best achieved by hiring new employees with a
new/separate set of skills was traditionally seen as out of the scope
of responsibilities for ICs.</p>
<p>Moreover, most ICs tend to gravitate towards technical impact; either
by increasing depth in one or more areas, or the ability to realize
broad technical projects through their direct involvement in the
realization. This is incidentally what most organizations (including
<span>CRL</span>) rewards through promotions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a mature organization also needs staff who audits,
controls, refines and communicates technical strategy. It also needs
technical staff to continuously work to train and educate PMs and
other departments in understanding technical constraints to product direction.</p>
<p>While ICs tend to organically grow the skills to fulfill these
responsibilities over time, they are often perceived to be a burden,
secondary to the primary mission of solving technical problems. The
result is that fulfilling these responsibilities through ICs results
in sub-par and inadequate technical leadership.</p>
<p>At a certain level of scale, leadership needs to be staffed by
individuals who seek and celebrate these responsibilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="needs-for-cross-team-and-cross-project-leadership">
<h3><a href="#id7">Needs for cross-team and cross-project leadership</a></h3>
<p>The unit of reasoning to organize technical work is the project. The
unit of resource to realize technical work is the team. These units
are necessary to compartmentalize work and provide a scope to ICs;
this is necessary both for morale and for technical
progression. Healthy projects and teams need to remain focused in scope.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the business grows, projects and teams become more
numerous. The organization then grows a need for staff who <em>coordinates</em>
strategy across projects, <em>analyzes risk</em>, develops <em>concurrent
alternative plans</em> to de-risk business critical initiatives, and
<em>architectures teams</em> to realize complex projects. The need for technical
staff to <em>identify patterns</em> across projects and teams and <em>consolidate
best practices</em> across entire sub-organizations also grows.</p>
<p>At that scale, ICs cannot any more fulfill these responsibilities,
especially across multiple teams while also remaining technical
experts in their area and building solutions through their direct involvement.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, a nascent organizations can rely exclusively on their
Chief Architect and/or their <span>CTO</span> as accountable for these
responsibilities; with incidental (albeit informal, and therefore
unreliable) support from (senior) staff engineers. As the organization
grows, this narrow implementation of leadership quickly becomes unsustainable.</p>
</div>
<div id="designated-responsibilities-as-growth-incentive">
<h3><a href="#id8">Designated responsibilities as growth incentive</a></h3>
<p>While the organization could hire technical leads with a proven track
record and extensive understanding of their leadership
responsibilities, it is also beneficial to foster leadership behavior
within the existing staff pool.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to promote leadership internally. The best
way, arguably, is to demonstrate by example. A more experienced leader
can serve as a role model. However, relying exclusively on role models
limits the growth of the organization to the behaviors exemplified by
the current most senior staff.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is also useful to identify and name the skills and
responsibilities that are known to be necessary to the
organization. This can be achieved by reflecting on the current
unanswered needs of the organization or sourcing them from other organizations.</p>
<p>Naming the skills and responsibilities explicitly provides three
separate benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables staff to develop curiosity and interest for leadership roles.</li>
<li>It enables staff and management to develop internal career growth plans towards leadership roles.</li>
<li>It ensures that due attention is given to all aspects of technical leadership, and not just those that happen to be exemplified by current staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, these paths to promotion are often not well expressed
in the more “basic” career ladders that are adopted at the beginning
of an organization’s history. ICs may not even realize they have an
interest for these paths, for lack of clear identification.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="acknowledging-employee-growth">
<h2><a href="#id9">Acknowledging employee growth</a></h2>
<p>The previous section identifies the need to evolve technical
leadership from the organization’s perspective. It so happens that
another need exists from the perspective of current and future
employees: to acknowledge and reward actual leadership behavior in
excess of the skills <span>&amp;</span> responsibilities identified on the <span>IC</span> career track.</p>
<div id="leadership-behaviors-in-excess-of-ic-expectations">
<h3><a href="#id10">Leadership behaviors in excess of <span>IC</span> expectations</a></h3>
<p>As an organization grows and the complexity of projects grows, it is
just natural that an increasing large contingent of <span>IC</span> staff starts
displaying “additional responsibility taking” behaviors that are not
aligned with traditional management’s expectations for the <span>IC</span> role.
Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>a staff member who is designing staffing plans for multiple teams to support technical initiatives, supplementing/complementing the <span>EM</span> role.</li>
<li>a staff member who is routinely educating product managers to safeguard alignment between product strategy and technical capabilities.</li>
<li>a staff member who is seeding technical design drafts for multiple teams concurrently without actually driving the design to completion nor its realization.</li>
<li>a staff member who circles back and forth between TLs from separate teams to maintain cohesion in their technical approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>These behaviors come at the expense of direct technical impact; there
is simply not enough time in a work week to push these behaviors to a
fruitful outcome and also focus on direct technical impact.  From that
perspective only, these behaviors are detrimental to recognition and
progression on a regular <span>IC</span> career track.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, obviously such an organization <em>does rely on these
behaviors, increasingly over time</em>. They are beneficial to the
organization and thus should not be disincentivized either.</p>
</div>
<div id="designated-responsibilities-to-recognize-growth">
<h3><a href="#id11">Designated responsibilities to recognize growth</a></h3>
<p>When an organization lacks a framework to acknowledge and promote technical
leadership behaviors, especially at the more advanced levels, staff
members who exemplify them have to navigate a faustian trade-off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either they need to stack up hours to achieve both their <span>IC</span>
ambitions and fulfill these leadership responsibilities, resulting
in poor work-life balance; or</li>
<li>They need to negotiate promotions with a friendly manager outside of
the standard framework recognized by the organization, which is
fraught with peril: the manager may not be friendly, and the staff
members have no framework to rely on as recourse when political
considerations thwart promotions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where <em>designated, explicit leadership responsibilities</em> have additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>They enable staff to deliberately make trade-offs in how they
allocate their time, with confidence of alignment between their
behavior and the needs of the business.</li>
<li>They enable staff to point to identified evaluation criteria and
argue objectively with management when supporting their case for
employment promotion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="technical-leadership-career-ladder">
<h2><a href="#id12">Technical Leadership Career Ladder</a></h2>
<p>To address these organizational needs, the table linked below
complements an existing <span>IC</span> career ladder with a <a href="https://dr-knz.net/levels-of-technical-leadership/tl-career-ladder.pdf">technical leadership
career ladder</a> with a similar structure, and a large overlap at
levels Senior/Staff for the reasons identified above.</p>
<p>We’re also assuming here that the <span>IC</span> ladder has levels beyond T5/T6,
to promote a further evolution in technical depth and execution
skills. In comparison, this technical leadership ladder promotes
technical breath and organizational impact. They fork at level T6/L6
and evolve in parallel from there.</p>
<p>(If local cultural expectations require the “Director” word for roles
that direct staff, even indirectly, consider using “Director of
Technology” instead of “Tech Lead” in your implementation of the
ladder, as a non-management title, to separate it from “Director of
Engineering” for managers.)</p>
<p>To introduce such a ladder to an existing organization, it is useful
to communicate to all engineering staff that the role expectations at
level Senior and Staff are very close to those expected on the <span>TL</span>
ladder at that level. The new ladder thus continues the opportunity to
switch from one ladder to the other without prejudice, should an <span>IC</span>
desire to do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, the existing leadership should consider relabeling the
roles of the staff who was already carrying the duties of the more
advanced levels of the leadership ladder, as a way to acknowledge and
clarify the responsibilities they had already taken.</p>
