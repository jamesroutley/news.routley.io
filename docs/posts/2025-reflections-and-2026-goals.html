    <h1>2025 Reflections and 2026 Goals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><time datetime="2026-01-06T09:00:00+00:00">January 6, 2026</time><p>It seems like 2025 came and went in a flash. Looking back, I’m happy to say
that I continued being social and made some more friends.</p><p>This past year, I..</p><details><summary><strong>Built a home server</strong></summary><div><p>Okay, I actually built it in 2024, but I used it a lot this year and had a lot
of fun setting up VMs with <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" rel="external">Proxmox</a>. I keep all
of my notes there, a gaming VM, and various media containers too. It may be
recency bias, but I installed <a href="https://immich.app/" rel="external">immich</a> and have had a
great experience with it, and even started a
<a href="https://github.com/mcastorina/immich-photo-frame" rel="external">photo frame project</a> that
has been a lot of fun.</p><p>I’m happy I invested in it, and it feels good to have a playground for random
server projects or self-hosting shenanigans.</p></div></details><details><summary><strong>Traveled!</strong></summary><div><p>I traveled so much this year, it was awesome. My best friend and I like to do a
big trip every year, and this year it was Iceland!</p><p><img src="https://miccah.io/assets/iceland.jpg" alt="Iceland"/></p><p>I also went on a roadtrip, camping along the way, for the first time. It has
been a long time since I camped, so it’s nice to ease into it as an adult.</p><p><img src="https://miccah.io/assets/camping.jpg" alt="Camping"/></p></div></details><details><summary><strong>Made some friends and maintained existing friendships</strong></summary><p>As I have mentioned in previous posts, I’m trying to prioritize relationships
now that I’m in my 30s. Making friends as an adult can be a challenge, but I’m
happy to say that I did it! All it takes is showing up. Not everyone is going
to be my new best friend, and that’s okay. All forms of friendships are
important and it feels great nurturing that part of my life.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Explored more hobbies</strong></summary><div><p>This year I continued with existing hobbies, like parkour and flips, but also
found some new ones! <a href="https://www.atlasquest.com/about/" rel="external">Letterboxing</a> has been
a fun way to spend time with friends carving stamps and getting outside. I also
took a synth class and learned about generating noise that sometimes sounds
like music. I took an intro to drawing class and started doodling more to try
and improve my abilities, and ultimately got some printed as stickers.</p><p><img src="https://miccah.io/assets/stickers.jpg" alt="Stickers"/></p></div></details><details><summary><strong>Found a partner</strong></summary><div><p>I started dating in 2024 and met my current partner this past year. I have a
lot of thoughts on dating in the world of apps that maybe deserves a longer
post, but I’ve found the best way to think about dating apps is that they are
simply a way to meet strangers. You won’t always get along or be looking for
the same things and that’s okay. That’s why the cliché advice to “just be
yourself” is the best advice. But you need to set expectations that not
everyone will like you and that can be hard. It’s only natural to want to be
liked, but those emotions can get in the way of being yourself.</p><p>Luckily, I eventually learned that, found a partner, and got out with my
sanity still intact!</p></div></details></div></div>
