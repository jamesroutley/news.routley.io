    <h1>Ask HN: Please recommend a router without need for a cloud account</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hi friends,<p>I&#39;m shopping a router and from what I read in the reviews, ALL mid-end family routers (those between $40 and $100) that I see need a cloud account to access the management page. I&#39;m wondering if there is anything that does not need a cloud account? Thanks~~</p></div></div>
