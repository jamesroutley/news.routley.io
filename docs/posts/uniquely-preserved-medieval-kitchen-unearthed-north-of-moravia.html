Given the surrounding evidence, including the items that we found inside, we have been able to date it roughly to the period of the early 15th century.”</em></p><p>Based on its location, Mr Stabrava believes that the house would most likely have belonged to a burgher family, a social class equivalent to the medieval bourgeoisie.</p><!-- wa data-asset-id="62f10291843781.44443232" data-asset-type="video" --><div><div id="file-5465285">

The richest burghers would have lived in so-called ‘beer court’ houses around the town square.”</em></p><p>Most likely founded in the 1300s by the Lords of Kravaře, Nový (New) Jičín seems to have gradually evolved from an earlier settlement around the castle of Starý (Old) Jičín which protected the nearby Amber Road that ran from Poland.</p><p>František Kolář from the National Heritage Institute, which took part in the dig, says that the town would probably have been largely made up of wooden houses, but admits that not much is known about the medieval settlement.</p><!-- wa data-asset-id="62f1030cd9db21.38028732" data-asset-type="image" --><div><a href="https://english.radio.cz/sites/default/files/styles/rcz_lightbox_v2/public/images/1af0c1a4557fb3dc20cf3cc4db384d35.jpg?itok=ZiOTTaIw&amp;timestamp=1659962112" data-size="1280x960" data-overlay-title="Photo: Pavel Stabrava,  Muzeum Novojičínska"><picture title="Photo: Pavel Stabrava,  Muzeum Novojičínska">
