    <h1>OpenSSL 1.1.1 End of Life Approaching</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OpenSSL 1.1.1 series will reach End of Life (EOL) on 11th September 2023. Users of OpenSSL 1.1.1 should consider their options and plan any actions they might need to take.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>OpenSSL 1.1.1 was released on 11th September 2018, and it will reach its EOL on 11th September 2023. As such it will no longer be receiving publicly available
security fixes after that date.</p>

<p>OpenSSL 1.1.1 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Our policy is to support LTS
releases for a period of 5 years. During the last year of that we typically only
backport security fixes to a release.</p>

<p>If you got your copy of OpenSSL 1.1.1 from your Operating System vendor (e.g.
via .rpm or .deb packages) or some other third party then the support periods
that you can expect from them may differ to those provided by the OpenSSL
Project itself. You should check with your OS vendor/other third party what
support for OpenSSL you might expect from them.</p>

<p>If you downloaded your copy of OpenSSL direct from the OpenSSL project then we
would strongly encourage you to plan an upgrade to a more recent version before
1.1.1 reaches its EOL date. Our most recent version is OpenSSL 3.1 which will
be supported until 14th March 2025. Also available is OpenSSL 3.0 which is an
LTS release and will be supported until 7th September 2026. Our
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man7/migration_guide.html">migration guide</a>
provides some useful information on the issues you should be considering when
upgrading.</p>

<p>Another option is to purchase a premium support contract which offers extended
support (i.e. ongoing access to security fixes) for 1.1.1 beyond its public EOL
date. There is no defined end date for this extended support and we intend to
continue to provide it for as long as it remains commercially viable for us to
do so (i.e. for the foreseeable future). Further information is available on our
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html">support contracts</a> page. You
can also send an email to osf-contact@openssl.org for further information.</p>
