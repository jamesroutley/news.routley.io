    <h1>The Calvine UFO photograph</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>Read the full story of how I found the most famous UFO photo in the world in my exclusive story published by <em><strong>The Daily Mail</strong></em> <a href="https://www.mailplus.co.uk/edition/features/211532/revealed-after-32-years-the-top-secret-picture-one-mod-insider-calls-the-most-spectacular-ufo-photo-ever-captured">here</a>. And follow the breaking story over on <strong><a href="https://www.uapmedia.uk/">UAPMedia UK</a></strong>.</p>



<p>After thirty years immersed in the world of UFOlogy I had grown cynical after viewing hundreds of unconvincing photographs and films.</p>



<p>Most were blurred, grainy and out-of-focus shots of what could have been frisbees, streetlamps or even seagulls.</p>



<p>But when retired RAF officer <strong>Craig Lindsay</strong> showed me the only surviving print of the<strong> Calvine UFO</strong> photo he had kept safe for more than three decades I knew I was looking at something exceptional.</p>

<p>My quest for the truth behind this photograph began back in 2009 when I was curating the release of thousands of once secret MoD UFO documents at <strong><a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/">The National Archives</a></strong>.</p>



<p>One of the files contained a poor-quality photocopied drawing of a UFO with a Harrier beside it, produced by the RAF’s photographic experts in 1990.</p>



<p>There was also a briefing prepared for Defence ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s government should they need to answer questions when the story broke in the Press.</p>



<p>Yet it never did and the file revealed nothing more about the photograph or the man who took it.</p>



<p>As an investigative journalist this mystery was too intriguing to ignore.</p>



<p>Little did I know then, however, that it was soon to become the longest and most frustrating investigation I have ever conducted. In the summer of 2021 I published the results of research in my <strong><a href="https://drdavidclarke.co.uk/secret-files/the-calvine-ufo-photographs/">Calvine case file</a></strong> update.</p>



<p>But even now, one year later and with one of the original missing photograph found, many questions still remain unanswered.</p>

<p>Wherever I searched for answers, I found insiders blocking my inquiries. </p>



<p>For example, the MoD and <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/freedom-of-information/information-requests/1990-calvine-ufo-incident/">The National Archives have refused to remove the black ink</a> that covers the name of the photographer in the Calvine file, claiming it would be an intrusion into his privacy.</p>



<p>Yet in 1990, within days of his sighting, this man had sent his negatives and personal details to Scotland’s best-selling tabloid, so he was not shy of publicity at that time.</p>



<p>Even more baffling no one at <em>The Daily Record</em> remembered the story clearly or could explain what had become of the negatives that remain missing to this day.</p>



<p>A week spent knocking on doors in <strong>Pitlochry</strong>, the nearest tourist town to Calvine and gateway to the Scottish Highlands, also failed to develop any new leads.</p>



<p>Inquiries at the hotels where I knew the two young witnesses had worked likewise drew a blank. No one remembered the story or had even heard rumours about it.</p>



<p>Had the original story been spiked by a <strong><a href="https://drdavidclarke.co.uk/2018/06/16/black-projects-ufos-and-the-mysterious-mo-d-notice/">D-Notice,</a></strong> a gagging order based on national security concerns, served on the newspaper by the MoD?</p>



<p>While this might sound like something from TV’s <em>The X-Files</em> research by UFOlogist <strong>Matthew Illsley</strong> revealed that the <em>Record’s</em> editor, the late Endell Laird, had been a member of the MoD’s D-Notice committee at the time.</p>

<p>Was this just a coincidence?</p>



<p>And is there a link between the date of the sighting and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_invasion_of_Kuwait">invasion of Kuwait </a>by Iraqi forces that happened <em>two days before</em> the Calvine incident?</p>



<p>Thirteen years and many dead ends later a lucky break led me to call Craig Lindsay who, it turned out, had kept a genuine, first-generation print of the ‘best’ photograph.</p>



<p>He said: ‘<em>I have been waiting more than 30 years for someone to call me about this story…and you are the first person to do so</em>.’</p>



<p>In his own words, it is ‘either an extremely clever hoax or it shows “<em>the real thing</em>”’</p>



<p>But if it is ‘the real thing’ was the craft built by humans in a secret hangar somewhere on <strong>Area 51</strong>?</p>



<p>Or could it have come here from another planet?</p>



<p>Ex-MoD desk officer turned UFO pundit <strong>Nick Pope</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324193601/http://nickpope.net/calvine-ufo-photo.htm">has described </a>the Calvine image as ‘the most spectacular UFO photo ever sent to the Ministry of Defence’.</p>



<p>But could it be a very elaborate fake? Expert photographic analysis by my colleague <strong>Andrew Robinson</strong>, senior lecturer in photography at <strong>Sheffield Hallam University</strong>, suggests not.</p>



<p>He says: ‘My conclusion is that the object is definitely in front of the camera, i.e. it’s not a fake produced in post production, and its placement within the scene appears to be approximately halfway between the foreground fence and the [Harrier jet] in the background.</p>



<p>‘Could this be a kite or a radio controlled model? It could be but it would have to be a very large kite/model, at least 20-30m [65-98 ft] long if not longer’</p>



<p>In June 2021 the Pentagon released its <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf">long-awaited report </a>on what it now calls <strong>UAPs</strong> or <em>unidentified aerial phenomena</em> after a spate of similar sightings and footage taken by US Navy pilots. </p>



<p>The new <strong><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2853121/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-airborne-object-identification-and-manag/">US UAP Task Force</a></strong> listed five identified categories that most sightings, when resolved, are likely to fall into. One of these is ‘<strong>classified programs</strong>’ developed by the US government.</p>



<p>The report says ‘we were unable to confirm, however, that these systems accounted for any of the UAP reports we collected’.</p>



<p>When I <a href="https://drdavidclarke.co.uk/2021/07/31/the-ufo-that-never-was-the-calvine-photographs/">last published an update on this story</a> I concluded it must be a hoax. But now I am convinced the Calvine UFO photograph shows one of these US classified ‘Black Project’ programs.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the Americans, and possibly also the British government, have found it useful to ‘keep the UFOs flying’ because they provide a useful cover for their own covert military activities.</p>

<p>But in this case their cover was blown by two young men who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p>



<p>The<strong> Ministry of Defence</strong> must now explain to the public why, if there are no such things as UFOs, how they can justify keeping their identities secret for a further 54 years.</p>



<p>And MoD also should explain what happened to the negatives and their file on this case – otherwise they are simply adding further grist to the mill of the conspiracy theorists who believe the authorities are hiding ‘the truth’ about visits to Earth by aliens.</p>



<p>I am open-minded about the possibility that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe. But I remain unconvinced that it has ever visited Earth.</p>



<p>The <strong>Calvine UFO photograph</strong> is in my opinion the best image of an unidentified flying object ever taken. </p>



<p>But as Dr J Allen Hynek, consultant to the USAF’s former UFO Project Blue Book once said, ‘unidentified to <em>whom</em>?’</p>



<p><em>Note: the original Calvine print and related documents were donated to my legend archive at Sheffield Hallam University Library Special Collections in July 2022.</em></p>
