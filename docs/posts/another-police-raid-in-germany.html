              <p>Hello to all list-reading entities!</p>
<p>On Aug 16th 2024 German police considered it once again appropriate to raid the home&amp;office at the registered address of our organization. The first raid was 2017. There are obviously still people working in German law enforcement today, who think that harassing a node-operator NGO would somehow lead to the de-anonymization of individual tor users. At least that is what they claim in the paperwork.</p>
<p>As with the first time, the raid team was fortunately a bit better educated and acted significantly more reasonable than the non-technical people applying for the raid and the judge signing it off. So again, no hardware was seized. Apart from one burnt (middle relay) node and some billing paperwork for the exit node this was all about, the team left the house after one and a half hours with mostly empty hands. We intend to legally challenge the search warrant to make sure that this does not happen again (but this is not what this email here is about).</p>
<p>These were once again one and a half hours with armed police in a personal living room, threatening to de-facto kill a livelihood and software business (carrying a truckload hardware away) of an non-profit board member to force cooperation.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I am personally no longer willing to provide my personal address&amp;office-space as registered address for our non-profit/NGO as long as we risk more raids by running exit nodes.</p>
<p>Artikel 5 e.V. is now calling for a general assembly on Sep 21st 2024.</p>
