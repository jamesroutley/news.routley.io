    <h1>&#39;It&#39;s a Heist&#39;: Real Federal Auditors Are Horrified by Doge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (<a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/">DOGE</a>) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">upside down</a>. It has moved from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">agency to agency</a>, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-website-offers-error-filled-window-into-musks-government-overhaul-2025-03-04/">“findings” on its website</a>, many of which have been <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html&#34;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revealed to be</a> errors.</p><p>But two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.</p><p>“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”</p><p>In September, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Rs572N9965E?t=2002s">speech</a> during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut <a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/&#34;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727">$1.7 trillion</a>. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.</p><p>While there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—<a data-offer-url="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833&#34;}" href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a Government Accountability Office study</a> published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.</p><p>The auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.</p><p>“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”</p><p>There are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2020-09/OIG-20-76-Sep20.pdf">available to the public</a>. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
