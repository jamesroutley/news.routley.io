    <h1>Ask HN: How to price your first enterprise customer?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We are a small SaaS company with a recently launched product. Currently we have mostly smaller customers (50+ users is &#34;large&#34; for us at the moment).</p><p>We now have, somewhat unexpectedly this early, the interest of a large enterprise that wants a deal to onboard 5000+ users. The problem is that we have no idea how to price this, as we have not yet had time to scale up our pricing enough to gain the necessary experience.</p><p>Our current pricing model, for smaller customers, is a simple, linear $49 per-seat plan.</p><p>- How do pricing for enterprise SaaS usually work? 
- What kind of volume discounts are they expecting?
- Should we offer a &#34;flat&#34; price for 1-3 year contract, or per-seat model?
- How did you handle your first large-scale customers?</p><p>We honestly feel a bit thrown into the deep end here, and we don&#39;t want to miss this opportunity just because we are inexperienced.</p></div></div></div>
