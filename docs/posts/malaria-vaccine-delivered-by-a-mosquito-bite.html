In a trial, the approach reduced participants’ susceptibility to malaria, potentially paving the way for more effective ways to stop the disease, which infects some 250 million people a year.</p><p>“These findings represent a significant step forward in malaria vaccine development,” says Julius Hafalla, an immunologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. “The ongoing global malaria burden makes the development of more effective vaccines a critical priority.”</p><p>The study, which was published<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> on 20 November, exposed participants to bites from mosquitoes that had a modified version of the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasite, which causes malaria. In humans, the parasites travel to the liver and then infect red blood cells. The parasites were engineered to stop developing shortly after delivery into a human. Nearly 90% of participants exposed to the modified parasites avoided contracting the disease after being bitten by malaria mosquitoes.</p><p>There are two <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02755-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02755-5" data-track-category="body text link">approved</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03115-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03115-1" data-track-category="body text link">malaria vaccines</a>. Both aim to provide long-term immunity by producing antibodies that block malaria parasites from infecting liver cells, as well as targeting breakthrough infections.</p><p>But the vaccines are only about 75% effective, and require booster shots. So immunologists are continuing to explore alternative strategies.</p><p>One approach is using genetically modified parasites. The research team had previously trialled the effectiveness of a modified malaria parasite, called GA1, that is designed to stop developing about 24 hours after infection in humans<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. But the GA1 parasite protected only a few participants against malaria, leading the team to engineer a second parasite, GA2. GA2 is designed to stop developing about six days post-infection, during the crucial period where the parasites replicate in human liver cells.</p><p>The researchers tested whether exposure to GA1 or GA2 could help humans develop immunity to malaria. They exposed participants to bites from 50 mosquitoes; 10 participants received bites from mosquitoes infected with GA1 parasites, and 10 were bitten by those with GA2 parasites. Three weeks later, they exposed participants to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Just before exposure to these mosquitoes, both sets of participants had higher levels of antibodies than before. One of eight (13%) participants bitten by GA1 parasites didn’t contract malaria compared with 89% in the GA2 group. Other than the the itching associated with mosquito bites, side effects were limited.</p><p>The researchers are now keen to replicate their results in a larger trial.</p><p>The work “should be followed by more extensive studies to confirm GA2’s viability as a candidate for global malaria control”, says Hafalla.</p>
