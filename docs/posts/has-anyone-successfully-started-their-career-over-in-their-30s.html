    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone successfully started their career over in their 30s?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Quit grad school and spent my 20s at a chaotic startup where I learned nothing about how to intentionally build a business. I spent years running around like a headless chicken to satisfy sales-type execs who had no interest in leveling me up. I was a moron for staying on as long as I did.</p><p>I was eventually let go, and for the past few years have been doing on-and-off menial gig work. Feel like I’ve wasted my life. No marketable skills. Unimpressive résumé. No network. No mentor. No confidence. No motivation. And I’m in my mid-30s.</p><p>-Is there any hope for someone like me?</p><p>-Is there any reasonable path to starting over?</p><p>-Where do I even begin?</p><p>-Will tech co’s ever consider hiring someone like me?</p></div></div></div>
