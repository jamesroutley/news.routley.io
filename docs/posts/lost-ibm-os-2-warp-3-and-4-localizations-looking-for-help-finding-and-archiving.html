    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It&#39;s amazing how software from a major company that is less than 30 years old can get lost &amp; forgotten so fast.</p><p>Building on a 2022 post about finding a copy of the long lost Slovenian OS/2 Warp 4 - https://www.os2museum.com/wp/slovenian-os-2-warp-4/ - some fellow software archaeologists have concluded some other localization editions are still missing - copied from the post&#39;s comments:</p><p>--

It turns out Slovenian isn’t the only version missing of OS/2 Warp 4.0 – Portuguese (Portugal) and Portuguese (Brazil) are also missing, as are Dutch, French, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish, and a non-trial version of Hungarian.</p><p>OBattler says:

I just found FixPack 5 for OS/2 Warp 3.0 (or at least, references thereof) Arabic, French (Canada), Hebrew, Thai, Turkish, and, apparently, also Bulgarian and Lithuaian! So OS/2 Warp 4.0 must have also existed in these languages.</p><p>Source: https://ecsoft2.org/system-fixpacks-and-patches 
--</p><p>Anyone who can help find these CDs and help the os2museum.com preserve them (and optionally upload them to archive.org, too) is very welcome to join our cause.</p><p>Also looking for any (ex)IBM employees thst worked on the OS/2 localization projects and can help with this!</p><p>Marko Štamcar
