    <h1>Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an &#34;extremely sophisticated attack&#34; against targeted individuals.</p>
<p>CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google&#39;s Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple&#39;s dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.</p>
<p>Its <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/126346" rel="nofollow">advisory</a> stated: &#34;An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.&#34;</p>

    

<p>Google&#39;s researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.</p>

        


        

<p>CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome&#39;s ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.</p>
<p>The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.</p>

        

<p>Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: &#34;Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.</p>
<p>&#34;Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security &#39;sandbox&#39; where they can&#39;t touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, &#34;attackers have created a &#39;zero-click&#39; or &#39;one-click&#39; path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman&#39;s flaw to take over the entire building,&#34; Milbier added.</p>
<p>&#34;This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/polish_pegasus_inquiry/">Pegasus</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/predator_spyware_sanctions/">Predator</a>. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade.&#34;</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®</p>
