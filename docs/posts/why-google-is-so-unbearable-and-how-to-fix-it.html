<p>If you simply google:</p>



<p>the first website in the search results is <a href="https://www.millerautoplaza.com/stuck-with-a-flat-tire-heres-how-to-change-a-tire-in-10-steps/">this</a> piece of bloatware, MillerAutoPlaza:</p>

<p>Why are they asking for my location? There’s 3 different popups going on here.</p>

<p>Just look at the treemap for this site. Countless bloatware trackers, APIs and Javascript downloads just to load the page (<em>9mb of it to be precise!</em>):</p>

<p>Oh, and also, Miller is <em>hiring</em> if you’re interested in <strong>joining the team</strong>.</p>

<p>I want to change my tire! Get off my back, and stop trying to make money off me for one second while I solve this tire crisis.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-avoid-these-bloated-websites">How to avoid these bloated websites</h2>
<p>Using a Google search trick, we can avoid seeing any of these bloated sites ever again.</p>

<p><strong>To do this, we’ll limit the Google search results to only domains with the .edu TLD.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-do-this">Why would we do this?</h3>
<p>Well, think about it this way: MillerAutoPlaza’s intentions in publishing that “tutorial” on how to change your tire is not meant to inform. It’s meant to find <em>new hires</em> for MillerAutoPlaza, and track your location for use in marketing. As a business, they want to make more money.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that, making money is noble. But right now, I’d really just love MillerAutoPlaza and their bloat trackers to fuck off, kindly.</p>

<p>Universities (sites with the .edu TLD) also want to make money. But, Universities make their money by paying professors to <em>spread knowledge</em>; MillerAutoPlaza makes their money by <em>selling you stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Professors are paid generous salaries to share knowledge with the paying customers of the University (students). 
So, let’s find some <del>paid</del> unpaid University knowledge on how to change a tire by using our new trick!</p>

<h3 id="the-new-query">The new query</h3>
<p>Google this instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>site:*.edu how to change a tire
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, the <a href="https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/303win97/Group3/2245.html">first result</a> is very promising:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixns/ixns.github.io/gh-pages/media/images/change_a_tire_edu.webp" alt="image-20220517120455356"/></p>

<p>As long as you aren’t scared of some good old fashioned serif, and an admittedly unappealing <em>mustard yellow</em> background, this website has all the information you need to change a tire! Woohoo!</p>

<p>Look at the treemap for this site:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixns/ixns.github.io/gh-pages/media/images/non_bloat_tree.webp" alt="image-20220517120704662"/></p>

<p>Notice the lack of bloatware trackers?</p>

<p>The other day, I was curious how pearls are made. So, naturally, I googled:</p>



<p>and found <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/how-do-oysters-make-pearls.html">this site</a> as the first result:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixns/ixns.github.io/gh-pages/media/images/pearls_bloated.webp" alt="image-20220517121002024"/></p>

<p>Ok, you might say, that’s the <em>Natural History Museum</em>.. They’re good, right? Yeah yeah, I think most museums are well intentioned. But if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s cookie popup.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixns/ixns.github.io/gh-pages/media/images/elon_tweet_cookies.webp" alt="image-20220517121134407"/></p>

<h3 id="the-new-query-1">The new query</h3>

<p>Google this instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>site:*.edu how are pearls made
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/347k/redesign/Gem_Notes/Pearl/pearl_triple_page.htm">first result</a> now:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixns/ixns.github.io/gh-pages/media/images/pearls_edu.webp" alt="image-20220517121248375"/></p>

<p><strong>Now we’re talking.</strong> What we’ve just found is a comprehensive guide from some University class that describes everything there is to know about how pearls are formed.</p>

<p><em>And they didn’t ask me about cookies, because they don’t give a damn about selling anything to me!</em></p>

<p><strong>Now, go use this, and enjoy the Internet without bloat!</strong></p>

<p>P.S, using this method you can find a TON of great computer science resources for basically free, here’s an amazing <a href="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~csonline/index.html">Virginia Tech site</a> I found while using this method!</p>
