    <h1>Google terminated our Developer Account, says it is “associated”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We are facing a difficult situation and I hope the community is able to help us.</p>

<p>After 10 years of working with Google Play and getting more than 1 million downloads in total, we have received an email that our company&#39;s Play Developer accounts are terminated permanently and all of the games and apps have been removed. I can not still believe that we are being destroyed in an instant without any prior notice:</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Our company used to have several employees with access to the business&#39;s Play Console, and one of them recently had done something wrong with &#34;<strong>his own personal</strong>&#34; Google Play Developer account. Now company&#39;s account has been terminated, because it is assumed to be associated with the former employee who has left the company in March 2019 (3 years ago).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve found a few other individuals who&#39;ve posted online with very similar issues and were able to get their accounts back in good standing after getting in touch with the right people at the Play policy team, but after the last few weeks, we&#39;ve been hard-pressed to get in touch with anyone.</p>

<p>We have also used the formal appeal process but received the same automated/repeated response. After thoroughly reviewing Google&#39;s Developer Policies, we are sure that all apps are compliant with them and the only problem is currently this wrong, unfair, and unreal association.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>We are living in a climate of fear. Without doing anything wrong, or crossing any redline, not only all apps and the account has been removed, but also we are threatened not to open a new account as Google will close it immediately.</p>

<p><strong>My Request:</strong></p>

<p>Does anyone have an experience with this situation or could possibly connect us with the right person in this case?</p>
