<p>Build systems are awesome, terrifying – and unloved. They are used by every developer around the world, but are rarely the object of study. In this paper we offer a systematic, and executable, framework for developing and comparing build systems, viewing them as related points in a landscape rather than as isolated phenomena. By teasing apart existing build systems, we can recombine their components, allowing us to prototype new build systems with desired properties.</p>

<p>This is a revised and expanded journal version of our <a href="https://simon.peytonjones.org/build-systems-a-la-carte/">ICFP’18 paper “Build systems a la carte”</a>, with more detail and a new section on our experience of turning theory into practice.</p>

<p>Executable code is <a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/build/releases/tag/jfp-preprint">available here</a>.</p>
