  <h2 id="hytradboi-program-and-tickets">HYTRADBOI program and tickets</h2>
<p>...are <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/#program">here</a>. I&#39;m very happy with how the program turned out.</p>
<p>I have 20 talks uploaded and transcribed. I&#39;m still waiting on recordings for the last 6 talks, but I&#39;ve seen drafts for most of them so I&#39;m not too stressed. We may also get 1 bonus talk added to the program, if we&#39;re lucky.</p>
<p>Also we&#39;ve sold 174 tickets so far and there are 174 names in the chat. And I only had to answer one support email. So the infrastructure is working smoothly so far.</p>
<p>There is still room for more lightning talks. You should <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025#lightning-talk-buffet">submit</a> a lightning talk! All the cool kids are doing it.</p>
<h2 id="query-compilers">query compilers</h2>
<p>I wrote a thing about <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/the-missing-tier-for-query-compilers/">the missing tier for query compilers</a>.</p>
<p>Fun facts from the comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>In SingleStore parameterized queries are planned ignoring the values of the parameters. This allows caching the compiled query but prevents adapting the query plan - for the example in the post SingleStore would pick one plan for both queries. But you can opt out of this behaviour by wrapping each parameter in <a href="https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/code-generation-functions/noparam/">NOPARAM</a>.</li>
<li>ClickHouse is a vectorized engine but <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-just-in-time-compiler-jit">still jits</a> scalar expressions and order-by/group-by/aggregates, the two big pain points for vectorization. They report speedups for 1.5-3x (presumably only for that operator, not for the whole query) at the cost of 5-15ms of compilation. So there is room for gains from compilation even in a very highly optimized vectorized engine!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m kind of pondering writing a query compiler for postgres. The existing jit is pluggable and the main reason people don&#39;t use it is the compile times. Compatibility seems tricky though, especially across multiple versions of postgres and against various different extensions which provide their own jittable functions. I&#39;m also unsure what the market for postgres plugins is like, since cloud hosted postgres instances typically don&#39;t allow 3rd party plugins.</p>
<h2 id="decorrelation-encore">decorrelation encore</h2>
<p>Neumann has a <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2025/papers/11-unnesting/neumann-btw2025.pdf">new paper</a> about improving their decorrelation algorithm. It turns out that applying their algorithm one-by-one to nested queries in a bottom-up fashion creates a nasty edge case that creates unnecessary product operations. They avoid that in the fixed version by applying the algorithm top-down in a single pass, combining the context for multiple nested queries as they reach them.</p>
<p>I was struggling to follow the paper at first, and then realized that the reason I&#39;m confused is because the decorrelation algorithm I <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/materialize-decorrelation">used in materialize</a> already works like their fixed version. I came up with that approach by extending the partial solution described in <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/46488818/subqueries-libre.pdf?1465942651=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DOrthogonal_optimization_of_subqueries_an.pdf&amp;Expires=1739495049&amp;Signature=AjRJ8YQzFPMBTDE30dxLK3pYp~JMao8ubKjnl1hSwItrh57~sd8rcjpJUko3xZR4gX1G~km3mhuvnEENgfWHuysdGfJmvCtAnLI2YwwLe-fPCktpWPkVsu5Ey8rMcIt5GjGVWzCoRYyjULEdsp2plE9yUBsq6pa6PZdYELA93RO6bMN95nwWwE-8GN5K0OTMJSkqw25NJb2eWXw0CXrwGJ-LWLeonWvs2dOaPsfxhldjJd5advzdyKEY6YcLNxnUJtiRjuP1ayOiQZBmOW7EM71uCBbejuDhes8O5a4TFgOcDso7Kft6zKV46xuUiXxXL3OT8z-qicMuqJaLMOI6ng__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA">sql server in 2001</a> and when I read Neumanns <a href="https://dl.gi.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/10f3ad20-e9ae-4876-abdf-5c8e83e4c595/content">2015 paper</a> I assumed it was the same thing, and that the fact that I wrote it top-down was just an inconsequential implementation decision. But I talked to one of the umbra phd students last week and ran their example query in both materialize and the new umbra version, and they produce essentially the same product-free plan now.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, cool story, lucky decision. But on the scarier hand I didn&#39;t even realize I was making a decision or that the order mattered. Not sure how to get better at spotting that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And materialize still sometimes creates products during decorrelation in other queries, but that is apparently a separate problem related to a separate optimization that destroys information about column equivalence.</p>
<h2 id="books">books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36613747-how-to-change-your-mind">How to change your mind</a>. Spends too much time on the authors own psychedlic experiences, and felt too credulous when talking to researchers. But I liked the history of psychedelic research and getting different points of view on why it stalled out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205363955-meditations-for-mortals">Meditations for mortals</a>. Anti-productivity-ish musings. Unobjectionable, but doesn&#39;t add much to his previous book.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624737-not-the-end-of-the-world">Not the end of the world</a>. I really appreciate the nuance and the focus on effective action. Also surprised at how optimistic the picture is on some fronts eg air pollution, ocean plastic. Definitely recommended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52592768-the-uncontrollability-of-the-world">The uncontrollability of the world</a>. The abstract was promising, but the writing is typical academic philosophy. Lots of references to famous philosophers, no concrete predictions or falsifiable claims.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/190854977-brief-flashings-in-the-phenomenal-world">Brief flashings in the phenomenal world</a>. About the author recovering from shattering her leg in a rafting accident and going on to win an ultramarathon. But also mostly about zen. I wanted to like it but it never veered far enough away from wellness cliche.</p>
<h2 id="misc">misc</h2>
<p>Polars <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/dataframe-group-by">has subqueries</a>, although they don&#39;t call them that. I wonder if they decorrelate them?</p>
<p>TigerBeetle <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2430">found a UAF</a>. They called it their first, but I think the <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/log/0032/#manifest-race">manifest race</a> also counts as a UAF.</p>
