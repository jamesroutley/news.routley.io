    <h1>Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/IanAllison/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/619642c9-4a6a-4bc1-afb5-c3ba1c59d785.png" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Ian Allison is an award-winning senior reporter at CoinDesk.

Roughly half a day into that process of reviewing FTX’s internal data and loan commitments has led Binance to strongly lean against completing the transaction, the person said.</p></div><div><p>Binance declined to comment on the current status of the proposed deal. FTX also declined to comment.</p></div><div><p>After CoinDesk released this story, losses in the cryptocurrency and U.S. stock market worsened. Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank">BTC</a>) revisited its 2022 low of around $17,100, and ether (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank">ETH</a>) returning to its post-<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-is-done-did-it-work/" target="_blank">Merge</a> low of $1,160. The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/indices/cmi/" target="_blank">CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) </a>recently was down 5.2% from 24 hours earlier. The S&amp;P 500, the benchmark for American equities, fell to its low of the day.</p></div><div><p>Backing out would be yet one more stunning step in a week of drama. CoinDesk a week ago published a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">scoop</a> about the balance sheet of Alameda Research, the corporate sibling of FTX. The story prompted concerns about the financial stability of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, which includes both companies, leading to a liquidity crunch at FTX – a situation exacerbated Sunday when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/06/binance-sells-holdings-of-ftx-token-as-alameda-ceo-defends-firms-financial-condition/">sell his holdings of the FTT cryptocurrency issued by FTX</a>.</p></div><div><p>Binance then struck the deal after FTX had sought help from and was turned down by other large exchanges, Coinbase and OKX, according to people familiar with the matter.</p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 9, 15:43 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds in third paragraph that FTX declined to comment.</i></p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 9, 15:49 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds in fourth paragraph that losses in the crypto market worsened after this story was published.</i></p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Nov. 9, 16:01 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds in fourth paragraph that the S&amp;P 500 fell to its low of the day.</i></p></div></div><div data-module-name="article-body/newsletter-cta" data-module-version="1"><hr/><p><span>Sign up for The Node, our daily newsletter bringing you the biggest crypto news and ideas.</span></p><p><span>By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk product updates, events and marketing and you agree to our <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/terms/">terms of services</a> and<!-- --> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</span></p></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/IanAllison/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/619642c9-4a6a-4bc1-afb5-c3ba1c59d785.png" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Ian Allison is an award-winning senior reporter at CoinDesk.
