Using Roaring bitmaps instead of traditional bitmaps in that application reduced memory usage from ~125GB to 300MB, an impressive 99.8% savings.</p><p>But... how?</p><p>You can learn about Roaring bitmaps over two research papers: </p><ol><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6407.pdf">This one proposes the data structure.</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06549.pdf">This one introduces a critical optimization.</a></li></ol><p>In this post I briefly describe what bitmaps are, what they&#39;re used for, and what Roaring bitmaps solve that traditional bitmaps don&#39;t. Then, I distill the high-level structure of Roaring bitmaps and how they work, one step at a time.</p><p>Roaring bitmaps employ a number of algorithms, techniques, and heuristics that I won&#39;t go into in detail. They also offer some operations beyond the ones I describe. These details are not critical to understanding the basic internal structure and operation of Roaring bitmaps which is the focus of this post.</p><p>Let&#39;s begin!</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">Bitmaps</a> are arrays of bits used to store sets of integers.</p><p>They work by setting the Nth bit when an integer N is in the set, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/2022/08/bitmap-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="534" height="340"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 1. </strong>An illustration of how a bitmap works.</figcaption></figure><p>By storing sets of integers this way, bitmaps can take advantage of extremely fast bitwise-AND and bitwise-OR CPU instructions to compute set intersections and unions.</p><p>It turns out that fast set intersections and unions are critical for many search and database applications. Various operations exist in search and database indexes that boil down to having two sets of integers and needing to intersect or union them quickly.</p><p>Take an inverted search index, for example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>You&#39;ve indexed billions of documents.</strong> Each document has an integer id.</li>
<li><strong>The index maps terms to a set of documents in which they appear.</strong> For example, the term <code>pigeon</code> appears in documents with these ids: <code>{2, 345, 2034, ...}</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Queries that search across terms use set operations.</strong> In order to resolve a search query like <code>carrier AND pigeon</code> you need the intersection of the set of documents that contain <code>carrier</code> and the set of documents that contain <code>pigeon</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Bitwise operations can perform these set operations quickly.</strong> If you  represent sets of document ids as bitmaps, the query above is a bitwise-AND.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Columnar databases use set operations similarly for certain classes of queries.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to dive into a use case outside search and databases, <a href="https://vikramoberoi.com/using-bitmaps-to-run-interactive-retention-analyses-over-billions-of-events-for-less-than-100-mo/">a previous post I wrote</a> discusses how bitmaps can be used to analyze user retention for SaaS products.</p><p>Unfortunately, bitmaps suffer from awful compression in common cases involving very large sets of integers â€“ scenarios that appear frequently in the use cases I just described.</p><p>Recall the figure I cited at the beginning of the post:</p><blockquote>Using Roaring bitmaps instead of traditional bitmaps in that application reduced memory usage from ~125GB to 300MB, an impressive 99.8% savings.</blockquote><p><em>That&#39;s</em> the problem with bitmaps, and I&#39;ll walk you through why this happens shortly.</p><p>From <a href="https://roaringbitmap.org">roaringbitmap.org</a>:</p><blockquote>Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps. They can be hundreds of times faster.</blockquote><p>A great, pithy marketing statement on the Roaring bitmap website! Let&#39;s expand on it a wee bit.</p><p>Roaring bitmaps are just optimized bitmaps, <em>which I&#39;ll refer to henceforth as &#34;traditional bitmaps&#34;</em>.</p><p>Both traditional and Roaring bitmaps offer a set data structure for integers. You can insert integers, check the existence of an integer, and get the intersection and union of two sets of integers.</p><p>Roaring bitmaps offer better compression than traditional bitmaps. Importantly, they do so without significantly sacrificing the performance of set operations.</p><p><a href="https://roaringbitmap.org">roaringbitmap.org</a> boasts an impressive list of OLAP databases and search systems that use Roaring bitmaps under the hood. These are all applications that:</p><ul><li>... need to store large sets of integers</li><li>... in as little memory as possible</li><li>... and execute fast set operations.</li></ul><p>When a set is <strong>sparse</strong>, traditional bitmaps compress poorly.</p><p>Recall that traditional bitmaps will set the Nth bit when you add an integer N to it (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><p>Let&#39;s say you have an empty traditional bitmap to which you add the integer 8,000,000. Here&#39;s what will happen:</p><ul><li>It will allocate 1,000,000 bytes.</li><li>It will set the 8,000,000th bit.</li></ul><p>This is illustrated in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/2022/08/8mm-bit.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="590" height="366"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 2. </strong>What happens if you allocate the 8 millionth bit outright in an empty bitmap.</figcaption></figure><p>Why is this bad?</p><ul><li>Your set has 1 integer.</li><li>An integer takes up 4 bytes.</li><li>Your traditional bitmap has allocated 1 megabyte.</li></ul><p>That&#39;s 6 orders of magnitude more memory than you need.</p><p>Whoops!</p><p>Roaring bitmaps solve this problem. Importantly, they do so <strong>while maintaining fast set operations</strong>. This is what makes Roaring bitmaps special.</p><p>Prior research attempts to solve poor compression in bitmaps achieve impressive results too, but at the cost of efficient set operations.</p><p>There isn&#39;t one deep insight that allows Roaring bitmaps to perform well. But there is <em>a lot of stuff</em> going on that is greater than the sum of its parts. </p><p>The following builds up an understanding of Roaring bitmaps one concept at a time.</p><h2 id="part-1-how-roaring-bitmaps-are-represented-in-memory">Part 1: how Roaring bitmaps are represented in memory</h2><h3 id="all-32-bit-integers-are-partitioned-into-contiguous-chunks">All 32-bit integers are partitioned into contiguous chunks.</h3><figure><img src="https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/2022/08/chunks-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1276" height="678" srcset="https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/chunks-1.png 600w, https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/chunks-1.png 1000w, https://vikramoberoi.com/content/images/2022/08/chunks-1.png 1276w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 3. </strong>How the space of 32-bit integers is partitioned into chunks in Roaring bitmaps.</figcaption></figure><p>Each chunk shares the same 16 most significant bits.</p><p>As shown in <strong>Figure 3, </strong>the partitioning scheme used by Roaring bitmaps ensures that an integer will always belong to the same chunk of 2^16, or 65,536 consecutive integers.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>there are 64-bit implementations of Roaring bitmaps, but this post does not go into them.
