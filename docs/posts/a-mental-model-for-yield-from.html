        <p>To grasp the difference between <code>yield</code> and <code>yield from</code> in Python, itâ€™s helpful to start with how each handles the flow of control and values between generators. Essentially, <code>yield</code> is like a &#34;pause button&#34; on a generator that temporarily yields a value back to the caller, while <code>yield from</code> is a more sophisticated delegation mechanism, allowing one generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator. Here&#39;s a breakdown of how to understand <code>yield from</code> with a mental model.</p><h3 id="yield-%E2%80%94-a-simple-flow-of-values"><code>yield</code> â€” A Simple Flow of Values</h3><p>When you use <code>yield</code>, you are effectively saying, &#34;here&#39;s a value from my generator; take it, and I&#39;ll pick up where I left off when you ask me for the next one.&#34; The <code>yield</code> statement pauses the generator&#39;s execution and provides a single value back to the caller, who can then continue asking for more values.</p><pre><code>def my_gen():
    yield 1
    yield 2</code></pre><p>With this, calling <code>next(my_gen())</code> will yield <code>1</code> first, and then <code>2</code> upon a second call.</p><h3 id="yield-from-%E2%80%94-delegating-to-another-generator"><code>yield from</code> â€” Delegating to Another Generator</h3><p><code>yield from</code>, on the other hand, can be thought of as creating a &#34;tunnel&#34; between the outer generator and an inner generator or iterable. Instead of having to manually iterate through the inner generator yourself, <code>yield from</code> does the work for you and handles the back-and-forth communication between all parties involved: the outer generator, the inner generator, and the caller.</p><h4 id="a-more-sophisticated-flow">A More Sophisticated Flow</h4><p>The mental model here is: imagine <code>yield from</code> as connecting pipes between the caller (who consumes values), the delegating generator (the one with <code>yield from</code>), and the inner generator (the one being delegated to). All values, exceptions, and input values (<code>send</code>, <code>throw</code>, etc.) flow through this tunnel, with <code>yield from</code> managing the flow transparently.</p><pre><code>def inner_gen():
    yield 1
    yield 2

def outer_gen():
    yield from inner_gen()
    yield 3</code></pre><p>In this example:</p><ul><li>The caller gets <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> from <code>inner_gen</code> as if they were directly yielded by <code>outer_gen</code>.</li><li>Once <code>inner_gen</code> is exhausted, <code>outer_gen</code> yields <code>3</code>.</li></ul><h4 id="handling-of-send-and-throw">Handling of <code>send()</code> and <code>throw()</code></h4><p>The <code>yield from</code> construct also forwards anything sent to the delegating generator to the inner generator, such as values sent with <code>send()</code>, or exceptions thrown with <code>throw()</code>. Here&#39;s how it works:</p><ul><li><strong><code>send(value)</code></strong>: The value is forwarded to the inner generator&#39;s <code>yield</code>, continuing its execution.</li><li><strong><code>throw(exception)</code></strong>: The exception is thrown into the inner generator, and if not caught there, it propagates back to the outer generator.</li><li><strong>Return values</strong>: If the inner generator has a <code>return</code> statement (introduced in PEP 380), <code>yield from</code> will catch that returned value as a special kind of <code>StopIteration</code>.</li></ul><h4 id="mental-model-%E2%80%94-a-transparent-proxy">Mental Model â€” A Transparent Proxy</h4><p>A good analogy for <code>yield from</code> is a transparent proxy or &#34;subroutine delegation&#34;:</p><ul><li>Imagine that <code>outer_gen</code> says, &#34;I&#39;m going to pause myself and let <code>inner_gen</code> take over completely until it&#39;s done.&#34;</li><li>When the caller asks <code>outer_gen</code> for a value (using <code>next()</code>, <code>send()</code>, or <code>throw()</code>), it doesn&#39;t need to know that <code>inner_gen</code> is actually handling things â€” <code>yield from</code> makes it look like <code>outer_gen</code> itself is providing those values.</li></ul><h3 id="a-simpler-simulation-with-loops">A Simpler Simulation with Loops</h3><p>A way to &#34;simulate&#34; what <code>yield from</code> does mentally is to think of it as looping over the inner generator manually:</p><pre><code>def outer_gen():
    for value in inner_gen():
        yield value
    yield 3</code></pre><p>However, this only covers the case of plain iteration, not the forwarding of <code>send()</code> or <code>throw()</code> calls. The <code>yield from</code> essentially hides all the complexities of managing that interaction, making it more than just a simple loop.</p><h4 id="summary-of-yield-from">Summary of <code>yield from</code>:</h4><ul><li><strong>Efficient Delegation</strong>: It provides all values from an inner generator transparently.</li><li><strong>Pass-through Mechanism</strong>: Any inputs (<code>send</code>, <code>throw</code>) are forwarded directly to the inner generator.</li><li><strong>Automatic Handling of Return Values</strong>: Catches the <code>StopIteration</code> exception from the inner generator to access any returned value.</li></ul><p>So, the best mental model might be to think of <code>yield from</code> as a direct link or &#34;channel&#34; between the caller and the inner generator, with <code>yield from</code> acting as a transparent pass-through operator that efficiently delegates the entire control to another generator until itâ€™s finished.</p><p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/670061a8-cb1c-8005-8faf-af3fe50b594c">Continue this conversation yourself</a></p><div><p>ðŸ“£</p><div><p>This post is a bit of an experiment. After perusing the internet for a bit on the difference between `yield` and `yield from` for Python Generators, I found most internet explanations a bit shallow. Besides <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9708902/in-practice-what-are-the-main-uses-for-the-yield-from-syntax-in-python-3-3">a post on stackoverflow</a>, most internet articles didn&#39;t give me a good mental model for what `yield from` did. </p></div></div>
