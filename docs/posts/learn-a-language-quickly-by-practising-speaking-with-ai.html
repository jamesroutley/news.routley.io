    <summary>How do I start using PrettyPolly to learn a language quickly?</summary>
    <p>1. Select your desired language in <a href="https://www.prettypolly.app/www.prettypolly.app">the app</a>. The AI will say something similar to “Hi, How are you?” in that language. </p></details>

    <summary>Why is it important to start speaking from Day 1?</summary>
    <p>There is now a wealth of literature and anecdotal evidence which shows that the fastest way to learn a language is through oral participation [1][2]. There are two reasons that this has been difficult in the past.</p>

    <summary>Do I need to learn vocabulary?</summary>
    <p>Yes, but the good news is that you probably need to learn less than you think. If you take the English language as an example, there are over 170,000 words in the Oxford dictionary (and 47,000 that are classed as ‘obsolete’). However, you can understand and speak 90% of everyday conversational English with only 3,000 words.</p>

    <summary>Do I need to learn grammar?</summary>
    <p>This will come as good news to most. You do not need to study grammar to learn to speak a foreign language [5][6]. When a child is learning to speak their native language, we don’t teach them about past participles and auxiliary verbs. They understand these concepts intuitively from listening and speaking. The same is true for acquiring a second language. If you learn vocabulary and practice speaking the language, over time, you will gain an understanding of correct grammar.</p>
