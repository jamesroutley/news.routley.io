<p>A long overdue personal update!</p>
<h2 id="machine-learnings-manifest-destiny">Machine Learning’s Manifest
Destiny</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/my_ml_path/">At the
start of 2017</a>, I had just wrapped up a nine month sabbatical where I
taught myself machine learning, and started working as an ML engineer at
Verily. It’s hard to explain how exciting it was to be in ML at that
time. Perhaps the best analogy is to compare it to the era of Manifest
Destiny in American history.</p>
<p>Manifest Destiny, for my non-American and otherwise history-unaware
readers, was the era of American history where settlers rushed westward
in pursuit of the “free” land that was being doled out by the U.S.
government. The Destiny was that America would eventually grow from
coast to coast to create a glorious future. The omitted fine print was
that you might have to evict the native inhabitants of that land. It’s a
historical era with strong similarities to recent times.</p>
<p>I’m of course, talking about machine learning circa 2015-2020. It was
obvious to everyone in ML that there was so much low hanging fruit
across every subject, and ML was destined to pick that fruit and move
the state of the art forward to a glorious future. There were
researchers scattering in every direction, hoping to stake claims in
“unoccupied” territory and be the first to apply ML to a problem. Like
the original Manifest Destiny, it ignored existing subject matter
inhabitants and betrayed the arrogance of thousands of ML researchers.
But with breakthroughs like AlphaGo, AlphaFold, incredible computer
vision accuracy and voice synthesis, some arrogance was warranted!</p>
<p>I had a great time with my Noogler project, which was to investigate
the potential utility and data readiness of an electronic medical record
dataset. The answer was a pretty resounding “not ready”, as documented
in “<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_learning_emr/">Deep
learning on EMRs is doomed to fail</a>”. Still, this work was exactly
what I’d hoped to do in the big leagues, and I was excited for my next
project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the next project didn’t live up to my expectations. We
built some data pipelines that were already <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/sql_join/">tech-debt
laden</a> on delivery, and then it turned out that what we’d built was a
complete mismatch to what the business actually needed, which was two
business analysts and a SWE. Instead, our team of 10 SWEs/ML engineers
built a janky pipeline that needed 4 SWEs just to keep afloat.</p>
<p>Frustrated with this project, I started putting my energy into
Minigo, an ambitious attempt to replicate AlphaGo Zero. (Spoiler alert:
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eerhIpLV">we succeeded</a>)
It was technically a 20% project, but was effectively a second 80%
project. It was fun work, though, which is why I didn’t mind. On the
strength of that work, I was able to transfer into Google Brain in 2018
to work on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#autograph_transformations">TensorFlow
2’s AutoGraph</a> feature.</p>
<p>AutoGraph is a Python-to-Python compiler that transformed imperative
Python control flow into the equivalent functional tf.cond and
tf.while_loop calls, making it easier to express complex control flow -
things like <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/wavenet-a-generative-model-for-raw-audio/">WaveNet</a>,
beam search, and meta optimizers. It got me acquainted with compilers
(which was a big gap in my CS knowledge), and taught me how to unleash
Google’s systems to automatically run millions of lines of internal
TensorFlow code as a test input to our compilers. It was the perfect
demonstration of how Google allowed research engineers to work at the
intersection of powerful engineering infrastructure and cutting-edge ML
research.</p>
<p>After TF2 launched, I transitioned to working on graph neural
networks for organic chemistry and more specifically, olfaction. As an
ex-chemist, I’d never imagined that the field I’d abandoned in 2011
would be relevant again. Our team got some <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10685">strong early results</a>, and
started a variety of collaborations to find experimental confirmation of
our results.</p>
<h2 id="complacency-shattered.">Complacency, shattered.</h2>
<p>2021 was an inflection point for me. I’d been promoted to tech lead
of my team, and for the first time since dropping out of grad school, I
finally stopped feeling like I was “behind” some of my peers who had
taken the straight path through a CS degree and into
Google/Facebook/Dropbox right out of undergrad. (I also happened to know
Greg Brockman of Stripe/OpenAI fame from <a href="https://www.acs.org/education/students/highschool/olympiad/about/participants/past-teams.html#:~:text=High%20School%2C%20NJ-,Gregory%20Brockman,-%2C%20(silver)%2C%20Red%20River">high
school summer camp</a>, which really didn’t help my imposter syndrome…)
I was now the one fielding questions from my friends in academia about
switching to industry, instead of the other way around. I had their
dream job - academic freedom to work on the forefront of science, with a
big tech salary.</p>
<p>I got complacent. I thought the environment at Google Brain was
intellectually stimulating enough to continue my personal growth, but
motivation, for me, comes from within. I had a frank conversation with
my manager and skip manager: I told them that the project I’d been
assigned was somebody else’s L5 promo project, but it wasn’t an L6
project. I didn’t feel like I was being stretched or being given room to
grow. They gave me some vague statements about how what I was doing was
the most impactful thing I could be doing for Google right now, but they
didn’t tell me I was wrong.</p>
<p>After that conversation, I felt my motivation drop; an easy project
that should have taken 6 months to finish dragged on to take 18 months
instead. In retrospect, while I’d diagnosed the problem correctly, my
demands were laughably naïve. L6 projects aren’t given to you; you
create them out of thin air. Your ability to envision and materialize a
new future is specifically what it means to be L6.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, envisioning a new future would be equivalent to
declaring mutiny on my manager, who was very protective of his
intellectual ownership of our team’s mission. I should have realized
this when I wrote a precursor to <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/rgb_odor/#in-search-of-the-rgb-of-odor">this
manifesto on the science of smell</a> in 2019 and received a deflection
rather than enthusiastic support from my manager. There was simply no
room on my team to grow, and it would have been better both for myself
and for my team to have somebody who was trying harder.</p>
<p>Eventually, external events forced my hand. In early 2022, our team
was pulled into a conference room and were told, “Congratulations! You
guys are now a startup!”. We learned later that our manager, unhappy
with the size of our team, had petitioned Google leadership to grow
headcount by an order of magnitude, and the resolution was that Google
would not fund our expansion. Undeterred, he found external VC funding
and negotiated a spinout of our project as a new startup. We were the
last ones to find out, learning about the spinout as the ink dried on
that deal.</p>
<p>From our perspective as Google employees, our project had effectively
been canceled, and our choices were to either find a new project, or
quit Google and follow our now ex-manager to Osmo. He was now offering
us our old jobs back at “market rates for startup developers”. “You get
to put ‘founding engineer’ on your resumé - it’s just as good as being
an actual cofounder!”, he told us. I could tell I would not succeed in
negotiating a serious offer from him, nor would I trust him as a CEO,
and decided to look for a new project at Google.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of 2022 asking pointed questions of myself and of
the L7+ PMs, VPs, and execs who had helped orchestrate the spinout. I
learned a great deal about how Google leadership made decisions; how
incentive structures aligned at each level of management, and how, if
you had the right idea to generate greater shareholder profit, you held
the moral high ground in escalating as far as you needed in order to
realize your vision. During this time I searched for new projects and
helped evaluate chemistry/ML project proposals in Climate. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to pitch my own project on refrigerant mixture design,
after seeing an unfilled niche. I would have kept on pitching, but
fatherhood called and I went on paternity leave.</p>
<p>During those sleepless nights with our newborn baby, I started
writing <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/why_brain/">“Why
does Brain Exist”</a> and pondered my future. In the end, I never
resolved my project matching situation, as I got laid off shortly before
my paternity leave ended.</p>
<h2 id="post-layoff-blues">Post-layoff blues</h2>
<p>It took me a few months after the layoff to regain my footing. I was
still underwater from the first-time parent transition, and I was
uncertain about what direction I wanted to go next. As I talked with
many friends, I realized that a year after my manager’s betrayal, I was
still not quite sure what had happened, why, or how I could protect
myself in the future. I refused to consider another big tech job, and I
had an irrational fear of anything LLM-related, given that it would
bring me closer to working with MBA-types.</p>
<p>I tried to understand things from my ex-manager’s perspective,
talking with other founders about how they viewed their ownership and
relative contributions from team members. I also read MBA/consultant
literature. I learned that on the stakeholder inform-consult-negotiate
classification scheme, I hadn’t even qualified for the “inform” bucket.
My conclusion was ultimately that Google execs and my management chain
did it because they could and because there was greater shareholder
value to be created. While I take some solace in knowing that my
ex-manager lost a year of momentum by having to rehire and re-gel his
team, I acknowledge that he probably found a replacement for me who’s
willing to work at market rates for startup developers and be happy with
having “founding engineer” on their resumé.</p>
<p>I resolved to at least learn enough about business to fall into the
“consult” bucket in the future</p>
<p>I set up my LinkedIn for the first time, and learned that the vast
majority of my friends and friend-of-friend consultants were current or
former BCG. In the same way that I benefited from <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/readability/">Google’s deep
and rich internal culture</a> around best engineering practices, I
anticipated I might benefit from BCG’s similarly deep and rich internal
culture around best consulting practices. I practiced my case studies,
did some part-time consulting to get experience, and practiced my
presentation skills by rewriting my Brain essay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle">MECE format</a>. I
networked my way into meetings with sympathetic BCG partners who
referred me to their hiring directors. Unfortunately, I was stymied by
BCG’s hiring freeze. McKinsey and Bain were also in a similar
situation.</p>
<p>Around this time, an old friend reached out and convinced me to join
Motional as a systems engineer, working to collate, analyze, and present
information to executives on progress in capabilities and safety. I
figured that this would both tickle my technical itch as well as get me
the exec-facing experience I was looking for. I did enjoy getting up to
speed on the self-driving technology stack, but I was overwhelmed by the
bureaucracy I saw at Motional. I felt like there was no way I could make
any difference in the company’s success. I think that if I’d stayed, I
would have learned a great deal about negotiating with unaligned
parties, but I would also have gone mad! The “efficient bureaucracy”
theme running through some of my recent essays was my way of working
through the frustration I felt at Motional. So I quit.</p>
<p>Most recently, I’ve been having a great deal of fun at <a href="https://lilacml.com/">Lilac</a>, a startup focused on text data
analysis and curation using LLMs. I have fully recovered from my malaise
- I’m quite actively involved in helping shape narrative/product/company
direction and don’t feel the ugh wall that previously stopped me from
getting near VCs.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>For me, my biggest personal mistake was that I didn’t find a new
mountain to climb once I had summitted the ML mountain. I think that
ultimately, the reason I stayed was because I was pinned by others’
perceptions of my job: why would anyone leave this dream job? There were
hordes of grad students at NeurIPS desperately networking to try and
find their way into my seat; I would be insane to trade places with
them. Yet, I felt far more alive when I was pitching new projects in
Climate/ML/Chemistry than I did before the spinout announcement. I
really should have known better - this was the same mistake I’d made ten
years ago, staying in grad school far longer than I should have.</p>
<p>I don’t think it was necessarily a mistake that I got screwed by my
ex-manager; that happens to everyone eventually. When it happens to you,
my advice is: don’t take it personally. Just remember what it feels
like. Don’t forget it. Learn what you can, and move on. And don’t try to
preempt it - once you start leaning into politics, it’s far too easy to
rely on it as a crutch to progress career-wise, instead of progressing
by honing your technical abilities.</p>
