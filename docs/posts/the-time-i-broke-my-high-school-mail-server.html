    <h1>The time I Broke my High School Mail Server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>For 3 days in 2006, nobody at my high school could turn in homework because of my dumb joke.</p>
<p>In an effort to annoy my friend Brody I had (accidentally!) brought down SWIS - the School Wide Information System - at Northfield Mount Hermon high school.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.bbc.com/blog/the-secret-inside-one-million-checkboxes/#toc:i-found-this-so-moving">mentioned this in passing</a> before, and I think the details are interesting so I thought I’d write it down.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="toc:defining-swis">Defining SWIS</h2>
<p>Very briefly: SWIS was something between an email system and a forum. You could send mail to people (your friends, your teachers) and create threads, like an email client.</p>
<div><p><img alt="A banner for SWIS. It says &#39;SWIS: School Wide Information System.&#39; Below that is the text &#39;Northfield Mount Hermon School&#39;" loading="lazy" width="489" height="121" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.bbc.com/images/breaking-my-highschool-mail-server/SWIS.jpg"/></p><p>the only good image about SWIS that I could find...</p></div>
<p>But it also had lots of ‘forums’ - places that we went to find school announcements, discuss classwork and turn in homework, and even argue about politics.</p>
<p>It was great and weird and wonky and a real part of student life. I have to imagine it doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And I broke it, accidentally, repeatedly, for several days.</p>
<h2 id="toc:annoying-my-friend">Annoying my friend</h2>
<p>So three things you have to know here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SWIS had powerful mail rules</li>
<li>I went to a boarding school and I was around my friends all the time</li>
<li>I was an annoying <a>1</a> highschooler</li>
</ul>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><div><div><div><p><span>1</span></p><p>No comments on whether I’m annoying now, thank you</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>When you got mail while SWIS was open <a>2</a> it made a loud ding. It was loud! My friend Brody always wore headphones during evening study hall, and I noticed that he’d often jump when a message came in.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><div><div><div><p><span>2</span></p><p>One fun quirk of SWIS was that you <em>couldn’t</em> always keep it open! You could
only stay logged in for 3 hours a day; after that it kicked you off till the
next day! I’m assuming this was some kind of resource-saving measure?</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>This was funny to me! Sometimes I’d send him mail to get him to jump.</p>
<p>But I noticed, sometime during my sophomore year, that SWIS had a <em>bunch</em> of programmable mail rules. You could filter mail, sure, but you could also automatically <em>send</em> mail. So I wrote a little rule. It said:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I get an email from myself with an empty subject line</li>
<li>Send an email to Brody</li>
<li>Send two emails to myself</li>
<li>Delete the mail from myself</li>
</ul>
<p>I sent myself an email with an empty subject line. Which sent Brody an email, and sent me 2 emails. Which sent Brody 2 emails and me 4 emails. Which…you get it. Within seconds I was sending Brody (and myself) thousands of emails. My rule automatically deleted the emails on my end, so I was safe. But Brody had no such protection, and he got thousands of emails, which meant thousands of dings.</p>
<p>It startled him! This was funny to 15 year-old me. I was happy.</p>
<h2 id="toc:ethical-hacking">Ethical hacking</h2>
<p>I didn’t leave the rule enabled for long; running it for a few seconds was enough.</p>
<p>And I immediately reported it! I emailed <a href="https://richarde.dev/">Richard Eisenberg</a>, my high school computer science teacher explaining what I had done. Richard went on to make <a href="https://richarde.dev/reisenberg-CV.pdf">substantial contributions to Haskell</a> and then briefly overlapped with me at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a> before I left to do whatever it is that I do now (this fact is unbelievably cool to me).</p>
<p>Anyway. I hope that Richard was entertained by my mischief. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but I think it was something like “this is funny, nice work, don’t break the server.”</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<h2 id="toc:onwards">Onwards</h2>
<p>I enabled my mail rule a few more times to torment Brody. But Brody was smart, and was also a programmer! Pretty quickly he figured out what was going on <a>3</a> and started deploying countermeasures.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><div><div><div><p><span>3</span></p><p>I’m sure that I told him exactly what I was doing. I often joke that while I
think some of my skills would be well-suited to doing crimes, I’d immediately
get caught because I’d need to tell people what I’d done. Better to stick to
more legal mischief.</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>He set up rules that automatically deleted empty emails from me and spammed me right back. So I set up rules that detected those emails and started changing the patterns that I put in my subject lines.</p>
<p>Pretty soon we were both just automatically deleting any email that the other person sent. This was fine; we saw each other in person all the time.</p>
<p>And that’s what lead to my error. Our countermeasures became so good that I no longer knew when my rule was running, since no emails reached either of our inboxes.</p>
<p>So I accidentally left it on.</p>
<h2 id="toc:the-crash">The Crash</h2>
<p>I woke up the next day and SWIS was down.</p>
<p>This was bad! Like I said, SWIS was a critical part of student life. We couldn’t turn in homework or find announcements.</p>
<p>But I didn’t think much about it. That afternoon it came back up. And immediately crashed again.</p>
<p>This pattern repeated for <em>days</em> - SWIS comes up, SWIS goes down. I think I printed out my essay and turned it in by hand.</p>
<p>At no point did I consider that I might have done something wrong here.</p>
<h3 id="toc:what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>Well, I had never turned off my rules. And when SWIS crashed there were still emails in flight between Brody and I.</p>
<p>SWIS was crashing because I had a mail rule that quickly sent millions of emails, overwhelming the system. Those rules didn’t go away after a crash! So the second it came back up it’d get right back to sending my millions of emails, bringing it right back down.</p>
<p>Eventually folks figured out what was going on. I don’t remember the names of the folks in our IT department (sorry! It’s been almost 2 decades!) but I’d imagine that they found some way to observe the crash and trace the emails back to my rule. Maybe they had a way of booting into a “recovery mode” where emails weren’t sent, or maybe they just debugged during the short periods where the system stayed up. But eventually they disabled my rule.</p>
<p>I’ve always enjoyed fire fighting; I hope that the debugging process was fun (I’d imagine it wasn’t. Sorry again).</p>
<h2 id="toc:aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>The IT department found and disabled my rule. But they didn’t really understand what was going on.</p>
<p>They thought that Brody and I were in a fight - we were automatically deleting each others emails! - and that we had inadvertently crashed the server while fighting.</p>
<p>They emailed us and our advisors explaining what we’d done. I’ll never forget one line from the email: they requested that we “sort out our interpersonal issues offline.”</p>
<p>I quickly explained to my advisor - the lovely John Christiansen - the actual story. And he found it <em>hilarious.</em> We were due for yearly T-shirts for our dorm and he put a joke about it on the back of mine <a>4</a>.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><div><div><div><p><span>4</span></p><p>I lost the shirt years ago. I regret it!</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>I got in no real trouble, and I stayed away from mail rules for the rest of my time in school.</p>
<h2 id="toc:its-fun-to-have-fun">It’s fun to have fun</h2>
<p>I think about this story all the time.</p>
<p>I think there’s a clear line from “abusing mail rules for a joke” to many of the projects on my blog like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/blog/flappy-bird-in-macos-finder/">running flappy bird in finder</a>; it’s fun to look back and see that I was the same person at 15 that I am now.</p>
<p>But I think there’s a broader point here. I got up to a lot of mischief in high school, and plenty of that mischief was met with encouragement (or at least appreciation).</p>
<p>That wasn’t always true; I got in real trouble for some of what I did <a>5</a>. But I think folks recognizing that what I had done was neat (while perhaps gently nudging me in more suitable directions) was critical to me developing my playful spirit.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><div><div><div><p><span>5</span></p><p>Keeping the internet on for much of the school after midnight, climbing
buildings, etc</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was extraordinarily lucky back then. As a concrete example, I had a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/blog/a-decade-without-a-drink/">pretty rough time in my late teens</a>, which meant that I never graduated from college and don’t have too much formal computer science training.</p>
<p>But having an extraordinarily talented computer scientist as your high school teacher goes a long way! I’d take “being Richard’s high school student” over a degree any day.</p>
<p>So thanks, Richard and John. I hope today’s kids are as lucky as I was.</p></article></div>
