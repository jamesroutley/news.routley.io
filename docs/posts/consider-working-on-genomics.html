      <p>Genomics needs more talented software engineers.</p>

      <p>
        There is a <em>significant</em> gap between how software is currently
        developed in this space versus how it should be developed. The vast
        majority of genomics-related software is not written with speed or
        reliability in mind. Too often, projects have no documentation within
        the code itself and no tests. Instead, a single individual who built the
        tool and has worked with the code since its inception is solely
        responsible for ensuring that the results &#34;still look good&#34; between
        releases (in an ad hoc manner, no less)—a claim that I think is
        incredibly generous given the breadth and complexity of evaluating
        genomics results. This state of affairs makes it difficult for anyone
        other than the original author to contribute to these code bases,
        further cementing the one-maintainer policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a good position for our field to be in. Many of the projects
        that are critical to the foundation of genomics are reaching or have
        eclipsed the ten-year mark. How much longer can we expect these
        individuals to single-handedly maintain these code bases? Further,
        without repeatable end-to-end testing, how can we be sure results aren&#39;t
        shifting over time in ways that are detrimental? Of course, this would
        not be the fault of the individuals who maintain the software, who are
        often brilliant: it&#39;s just simply not fair to expect individuals to
        ensure this consistency using their own, ad-hoc processses.
      </p>

      <p>
        This field is ripe for innovation, particularly around the way we
        develop software, and I believe a revolution of sorts is needed to
        ensure the future viability of genomics at scale. Much of this
        innovation will likely be driven by software engineers who come in and
        learn the domain. From my experience, what works incredibly well is a
        partnership between biologists and software engineers: the biologists
        first come up with the first concept of the tool, which is purely
        focused on ensuring good results. After this first iteration is
        completed, engineers then come in and rewrite the tool using modern
        engineering practices with things like speed and reliability in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, if you&#39;re a software engineer who enjoys working on the cutting edge
        and wants to put your talents to work on something impactful, my charge
        to you is to consider joining the field of genomics. Contrary to when I
        started, there exists some relatively good material for testing out the
        waters in this fascinating domain (for example, just last week we
        published the
        <a href="https://learngenomics.dev">learngenomics.dev</a>
        site aimed at teaching software engineers the basics of genomics and
        bioinformatics). Often, it&#39;s not required to know the domain before you
        join a group, and they will teach you on the job.

        For those interested, here are the places hiring in this space that I am
        aware of. Please reach out to me on social media if you know of more
        places that are hiring in this area. Note that this is not an
        endorsement of any particular organization or company, this is simply
        listing organizations that might be hiring for awareness—you&#39;ll have to
        do your own due dilligence to determine which one might be right for
        you.
