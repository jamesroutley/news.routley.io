<li>it&#39;s always nice having time off, it&#39;s always weird feeling like i haven&#39;t made the most of it.</li>
<li>the strangeness of the weather (so hot for late august/early september) makes me worry about the health of the climate as ever.</li>
<li>been slowly watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">a uni lecture</a> on writing and quickly watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GXv2C7vwX0">short video</a> on video essays from every frame a painting. i find the research and writing stage of video making a slog but in a fun way. i get stuck in the revising stage way too early though; i can edit for clarity later or at least not read through the whole thing top to bottom every time. i want to outline more too but find it difficult. but enjoying the challenge at the moment!</li>
<li>lighting myself is more fun too; i have two barn door lights from neweer and am trying to persevere with them even though i always feel like i have a column of darkness in the center of my face. I&#39;ve bought enough lights so we&#39;ll keep on adjusting.</li>
<li>i wish i was the kind of person who could move in complete silence on plans; i have a friend who keeps asking if I&#39;ve released any video essays even though they check my page lol. if i could just not talk about it all the time that would be less embarrassing and also less activating, but it keeps me in check too. these videos will be bad but differently, and that&#39;s good and okay.</li>
<li>seriously though, i want to do more independent research into CSS learning and how people who get really good at it think about it. I&#39;m hoping to improve teaching/learning/tooling/linting/etc without having to bust out frameworks. why can&#39;t i just think that in my head without writing it down? who knows?</li>
<li>also wondering if my idea of input, time-based habits (like &#34;i will spend 1 hour a day writing video stuff&#34; instead of &#34;i will produce a video by the end of the week&#34;) is going to help or hurt my goal reaching. it feels a lot kinder, but i also don&#39;t often hit my targets and it feels like i just fall off completely after a few days. need to actually <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-6-week-26-2024/#:~:text=i%27ve%20been%20working,gonna%20start%20again.">make snapback happen</a> and track my habits.</li>
<li>looking over last week I realise I should actually download a time-tracking app again and try it, i like ones where you can do simultaneous entries (yes i am in the bath AND listening to music, app) so that whittles it down a bit. should help with the above.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>how was your week? do you forgive me for posting on wednesday again? I love <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/contact">hearing from you</a>, don&#39;t be a stranger unless you want to be!</li>
