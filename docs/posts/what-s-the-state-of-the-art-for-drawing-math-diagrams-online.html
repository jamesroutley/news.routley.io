    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s the state of the art for drawing math diagrams online?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m interested in having high-quality math diagrams on a personal website. I want the quality to be comparable to TikZ, but the workflows are cumbersome and it doesn&#39;t integrate with MathJax/KateX.</p><p>Ideally I would be able to produce the diagrams in JS with KaTeX handling rendering the labels, but this doesn&#39;t seem to exist (I&#39;m a software engineer so I&#39;m wondering if I should try to make it...). Nice features also include having the diagram being controllable by JS or animatable, but that&#39;s not a requirement.</p><p>What are other people using?</p><p>Things I&#39;ve considered:</p><p>TikZ options:</p><p>* TikZ exported to SVG</p><p>* Writing the TikZ in something else, e.g. I found this library PyTikZ which is old but I could update things to it, that way at least I don&#39;t have to wrangle TikZ&#39;s horrible syntax much myself. I could theoretically write a JS version of this.</p><p>* Maybe the same thing, JS -&gt; TikZ, but also run TikZ in WebAssembly so that the whole thing lives in the browser.</p><p>* Writing TikZ but ... having ChatGPT do it so I don&#39;t have to learn to antiquated syntax.</p><p>Non-TikZ options:</p><p>* InkScape</p><p>* JSXGraph, but it isn&#39;t very pretty</p><p>* ???</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p></div></div></div>
