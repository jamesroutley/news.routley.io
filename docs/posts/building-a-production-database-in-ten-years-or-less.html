<p>So you‚Äôve finally decided you‚Äôre fed up with <code>$database_name</code> and simply
            have no choice but to build a new database. You‚Äôve got oodles of ideas, pages
            of notes, and an unwavering conviction that this is the database the world
            has been waiting for. All that‚Äôs left is to quit your job and grind out
            a 1.0 in a few months. Right?</p>
<p>Maybe! But‚Äîto put it mildly‚Äîthat hasn‚Äôt been our experience.</p>
<p>But before we enter into this next post-1.0 phase of EdgeDB‚Äôs existence, we‚Äôre
            reflecting on the journey so far. The road has been deeply fulfilling, often
            bumpy, and dramatically longer than we initially thought. Along the way we spun
            out two major open-source projects (<code>uvloop</code> and <code>asyncpg</code>), helped
            introduce <code>async/await</code> into the Python language, grew to a 10-person
            open-source company, and‚Äîhopefully‚Äîlearned some lessons that‚Äôll be valuable to
            anyone tempted to build a new database. üöÄ</p>
<p>On February 10th‚Äîin just a couple weeks‚Äîwe‚Äôre releasing the first stable
            version of EdgeDB after 2100 PRs, 4600 integration tests, and 14 pre-releases.
            The release will be part of the inaugural EdgeDB Day: a 2-hour
            livestreamed ‚Äúnanoconference‚Äù featuring lightning talks designed to answer all your questions about EdgeDB: why it‚Äôs necessary, what a ‚Äúgraph-relational database‚Äù is, the killer features of EdgeQL, and more.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go back to the beginning.</p>
<div data-section-id="magicstack" id="magicstack">

<p>This was the year Elvis‚Äîmy EdgeDB co-founder‚Äîand I started
                <a href="https://magic.io">MagicStack</a>, a boutique software development shop.
                Over the years, we‚Äôve worked with a huge range of clients, from early
                stage startups to Fortune 500 companies like General Electric and Microsoft.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="total-caos" id="total-caos">

<p>Early on, we realized we were solving the same set of problems over and over
                on every project. It was a drag, and it took time away from the fun and
                creative aspects of the work.</p>
<p>Frustrated with the existing tech and blown away by things like Google Wave,
                we started incubating a set of home-grown tools, mostly Python-based, that we
                took with us from project to project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A component-based way to build declarative UIs. (Sound familiar?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A library for building RPC backends with decorators and some clever
                        metaprogramming hacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bundler to let us import media assets and stylesheets directly into Python
                        files.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>But chief among these tools was our data layer, Caos, a ‚Äúsuper ORM‚Äù featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A YAML-like object-oriented schema definition language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for mixin-based schema composition, indexes, constraints,
                        dynamically computed properties, and rich introspection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A query language (called CaosQL, naturally) with support for query
                        composition and deep fetching.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Caos would parse CaosQL queries, validate them against the current schema, and
                compile them to equivalent SQL. It was our secret sauce that let us deliver
                faster and have more fun doing it. With each client project, we made it a
                little bit better. Some EdgeDB‚Äôs big ideas were already here‚Äîlinks, schema
                mixins, easy deep querying, and an emphasis on introspectability.</p>

<p>Our code relied heavily on metaprogramming. In late 2012, the Python community
                started looking for volunteers to design a better introspection API
                (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0362/">PEP 362</a>). This was something
                we needed for our RPC library, so we jumped at the chance. This was our
                first major foray into open-source.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I started submitting PRs to <code>asyncio</code> and I became
                a Python core dev later in 2013. From 2013-2015, Elvis and I started
                contributing more heavily to the ecosystem and the language itself.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="the-boats-and-the-bees" id="the-boats-and-the-bees">

<p>By 2014, we‚Äôd grown a bit tired of life as consultants, so we decided to launch
                a product. In Caos, we already had something exceptional on our hands, so
                naturally we decided to build‚Ä¶Airbnb for boats. Yes, really. It was called
                BoatBee.</p>
<p>It was a fun few months but an ill-fated endeavor. Using Caos and our
                other in-house tools, Elvis and I were able to build the core product
                in record time. Rather less quickly, we realized Airbnb for boats was
                a non-viable business. Live and learn.</p>

<figcaption>Some state and schema diagrams for BoatBee.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the post-mortem of this experience, we started looking critically at
                the stack of tools we‚Äôd been incubating over the past 7 years. In many ways,
                the state of tooling, especially in the JavaScript ecosystem, had caught up.
                Our component-based UI kit was made obsolete by React. Newcomer GraphQL covered
                many of the same bases as our RPC library. Our bundler was matched and
                exceeded by Webpack.</p>
<p>But we saw no similar innovation in the database layer. In fact, it seemed to
                regress; we watched in dismay as schemaless NoSQL data stores exploded in
                popularity. It felt like the software world‚Äîafter years of struggling against
                SQL and relational data models‚Äîwas collectively throwing in the towel.</p>
<p>Walking back from the office on a brisk Toronto evening, Elvis and I
                suddenly realized Caos could represent a new way forward. But first it
                had to stop being an ORM and become a database.</p>

<figcaption>The most common response to EdgeDB in the early days: ‚Äúso it‚Äôs just an ORM?‚Äù.
                    We put it on the wall for motivation.</figcaption>

</div>
<div data-section-id="i-o-struggles" id="i-o-struggles">

<p>There were several key pieces of intrastructure we needed to build before we
                could make headway on EdgeDB.</p>
<p>Our plan was to refactor Caos from a Python framework into a full-fledged
                database server that could handle incoming queries over the network. For this
                to scale to thousands of simultaneous connections, blocking I/O with threads
                wasn‚Äôt going to cut it (though that‚Äôs a blog post for a different day).
                EdgeDB needed an asynchronous core.</p>
<p>Around the same time we designing the API for a hypothetical Python client
                library for EdgeDB. We quickly got hung up on the transaction API; With <code>yield
from</code>, the coroutine syntax at the time, it was painfully verbose:</p>
<div><div><div><pre><span>tx <span>=</span> <span>yield</span> <span>from</span> conn<span>.</span>start_transaction<span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>yield</span> <span>from</span> tx<span>.</span>query<span>(</span><span>&#39;...&#39;</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> Exception<span>:</span>
    <span>yield</span> <span>from</span> tx<span>.</span>rollback<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>raise</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>yield</span> <span>from</span> tx<span>.</span>commit<span>(</span><span>)</span></span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>We realized this could be elegantly expressed if Python supported <code>async
with</code> syntax natively. I started working on a PEP.</p>
<div><div><div><pre><span><span>async</span> <span>with</span> conn<span>.</span>transaction<span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> tx<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>await</span> tx<span>.</span>query<span>(</span><span>&#39;...&#39;</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>Quickly, the proposal expanded to include <code>async for</code>
                (to support async database cursors) and of course <code>async/await</code>.
                After a few weeks of fevered work, I published
                <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/">PEP 492</a>, which was finalized
                in April 2015 and accepted just before the Python 3.5 feature freeze.
                Having such a major proposal get accepted by the Python community was
                a thrill unlike anything else I‚Äôve experienced.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="early-2016-cython-swings-in" id="early-2016-cython-swings-in">

<p>We started realizing that pure Python wasn‚Äôt fast enough for handling I/O in
                EdgeDB. So we began tinkering with Cython; it let us quickly prototype ideas
                with Python-like syntax with near-native performance. We spent a couple of
                weeks trying to marry Cython and <a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv</a>, an
                non-blocking I/O library originally developed for Node.js.</p>

<figcaption>Presenting <code>uvloop</code> at EuroPython 2016.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result was <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a>: a drop-in
                replacement for Python‚Äôs built-in asyncio event loop that was 2-4x faster.
                We announced it in a rather well-known <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">blog post</a>.
                In surprisingly short order, <code>uvloop</code> grew to near ubiquity and now
                powers EdgeDB.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="mid-2016-postgres-over-the-wire" id="mid-2016-postgres-over-the-wire">

<p>EdgeDB uses Postgres under the hood. Postgres truly is the world‚Äôs most
                advanced open-source SQL database, and it provides the ultimate foundation on
                which to build a new and better database abstraction.</p>
<div>
<p>This is often a point of confusion among people who are first learning about
                    EdgeDB. If Postgres is already a database, and EdgeDB is built on top of
                    Postgres, then is EdgeDB an ORM (object-relational mapper)?</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt think so. It has its own formally-defined query language, EdgeQL,
                    which matches SQL in power and surpasses it in clarity and brevity. It‚Äôs
                    language-agnostic, whereas most ORMs are libraries written for a particular
                    language. It has its own type system, standard library, binary protocol,
                    client libraries in multiple languages, CLI, workflows, and conventions. By
                    any definition, EdgeDB is a database unto itself.</p>
</div>
<p>With <code>async/await</code> and a fast asynchronous event loop, we started
                evaluating the state of async Postgres drivers for Python. Alas, nothing
                made the cut, so we built our own. In the process, we learned a lot about
                Postgres‚Äôs binary protocol and its many vices and virtues.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg">asyncpg</a>, which I
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi49aiLBas8&amp;t=1375s">announced</a> at
                EuroPython 2016 in Bilbao. True to form, we finished it just two hours before
                my scheduled talk, with Elvis pushing some last minute fixes.
                We <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12227507">launched</a> on Hacker News
                in August, and it‚Äôs since seen wide adoption and accumulated 5200 stars on
                GitHub.</p>

<p>Armed with <code>async/await</code>, Cython, <code>uvloop</code>, and <code>asyncpg</code>,
                we had the tools we needed to make EdgeDB a reality. While still consulting
                full-time, we would spend evenings at the whiteboard fleshing out designs.
                The modern incarnation of EdgeDB emerged during this period: the type system,
                EdgeQL syntax, and the schema declaration language. We started working on
                an initial Technical Preview of what we‚Äôd designed.</p>
<p>To force ourselves to deliver, we signed up to be a gold sponsor at
                PyCon 2018‚Äîfive months in the future. We booked a booth, printed 3500
                booklets showcasing EdgeDB, the whole nine yards. Naturally, we finished
                the preview implementation just under the wire, pulling an all-nighter

<p>And we had a blast. People at PyCon loved EdgeDB. We talked to hundreds
                of attendees, answered thousands of questions, and received a mountain of
                feedback. We fully committed to making EdgeDB happen.</p>

<div data-section-id="early-2019-the-first-alpha" id="early-2019-the-first-alpha">

<p>From this point on, we only did consulting to pay the bills. We were
                laser-focused on releasing the first alpha version of EdgeDB. The technical
                preview was a great prototype, but we needed EdgeDB to level up before it was
                ready for a first release.</p>
<p>We formally defined the type hierarchy and tuned the operators and
                typecasting system for safety and usability. We added built-in support for
                GraphQL. We designed a binary protocol‚Äîinformed by our <code>asyncpg</code> experience
                and deep familiarity with Postgres‚Äôs protocol‚Äîand a Python client library that
                implemented it. Over this period, the modern incarnation of EdgeQL ossified.</p>

<p>In April 2019, just under a year after presenting the Technical Preview,
                we launched the first alpha. We posted it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19638701">to Hacker
                    News</a> to a great response;
                shortly thereafter, another blog post of ours called
                <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#ref-better-than-sql"><span>We Can Do Better Than SQL</span></a> hit #1 on HN. This
                reinforced what we already knew: there‚Äôs a lot of latent dissatisfaction with
                the developer experience of existing database options. We got back to work.</p>

<p>With the core EdgeDB product getting ever more mature, we turned our focus more
                heavily towards workflows. How do we make every aspect EdgeDB‚Äôs developer
                experience‚Äîinstallation, managing instances, running migrations, reading the
                docs, using the CLI, running queries‚Äîbetter than every other database out there?</p>
<p>Well, with a lot of work. We re-structured our CLI (<a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1006-simplified-cli.rst">RFC 1006</a>).
                We upgraded our client libraries with a <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/issues/182">more ergonomic API</a>, and added new libraries for
                <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-go">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-deno">Deno</a>, exposing
                TLS ALPN <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/12786">API</a> in Deno along
                the way. We re-wrote the docs, published an
                illustrated interactive textbook called <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/easy-edgedb">Easy EdgeDB</a>, and
                built a snazzy notebook-like <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/tutorial">EdgeQL tutorial</a>. And we started
                building an EdgeQL query builder for TypeScript that might just make ORMs
                obsolete‚Äîmore on that coming soon. üëÄ</p>
