    <p>I’ve been continuing to think about ideas around <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2024/05/28/digital-independence.html">digital independence</a> but realized that I was getting stuck on not having a clear separation of technologies I found to be worth adopting vs avoiding. To fix this, I <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202406062100.html">wrote up a page</a> listing out the criteria that have, up until now, mostly lived implicitly in my head. I also spent some time testing it by evaluating a couple of “technologies” using the new criteria: the <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202406161328.html">Framework laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202406161417.html">Bluesky</a>.</p>

<p>It ended up being a pretty long-winded exercise but I think helped me clarify a lot of my own thinking. I’m not really expecting people to read through all of this, but figured it’d be worth publishing in the interest of working in the open and/or as source-material for future writing I’m hoping to publish.</p>

<p>As always, I’d love to hear from others via Mastodon or email if you have thoughts about this stuff or it sparks any thinking of your own.</p>
