<h3>Intro</h3><p>Most of my previous posts have been focused on software topics. I&#39;m going to stray a little into hardware for this article. At the end of 2022 I made a promise to myself to learn how to use <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> so that I could design my own printed circuit boards. I have some experience with electronics and I thought that I could design some relatively simple PCBs for my own use. I found this 100 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVUqaB0IMh4&amp;pp=ygUFa2ljYWQ%3D">YouTube tutorial</a> and it provided enough practical info to get me started. This blog post is not about learning KiCad; instead I&#39;m going to walk through all of the steps and equipment necessary to build my Pocket CO2 sensor project. The KiCad files and firmware can be found <a href="https://github.com/bitbank2/Pocket_CO2">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnshpAibIMYRwrJX2QSzDJYpEmScbmqutmR7xJ9SaAzBzHhHSO1QuQ1nwkTwjkgnbAb-Xae02u56ck3Si64nw67ql8B7We_pOrl-hP9iQdafw_zniGQ97Ixg0rqhRGhsh8NAGLsJtLFLf8Cvo6x2cUClGjd_pWZ-54UUk-jl-mYvzi1haCgZ7KdLl1wA/s1014/20230420_155400.jpg"><img data-original-height="1014" data-original-width="696" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnshpAibIMYRwrJX2QSzDJYpEmScbmqutmR7xJ9SaAzBzHhHSO1QuQ1nwkTwjkgnbAb-Xae02u56ck3Si64nw67ql8B7We_pOrl-hP9iQdafw_zniGQ97Ixg0rqhRGhsh8NAGLsJtLFLf8Cvo6x2cUClGjd_pWZ-54UUk-jl-mYvzi1haCgZ7KdLl1wA/s320/20230420_155400.jpg" width="220"/></a></p><h3>Surface Mount Soldering is Easy?</h3><p>After seeing videos of professional makers such as Seon &#34;Unexpected Maker&#34; Rozenblum use pick-n-place machines to build complex PCB boards using impossibly small components, I wrongly assumed that SMD soldering required expensive equipment and lots of expertise. To get to Seon&#39;s level, <b>you do need expensive equipment and lots of expertise</b>, but there are much simpler SMD PCB projects that can be done with inexpensive tools and very little experience. Over the years, I had tried at various times to work with some SMD components on tinned proto-boards using a fine tip soldering iron. I was able to clumsily solder a few 0603 components and destroy/remove others, but it frequently resulted in frustrating failures. What made it much easier was my first new piece of equipment - the hot air rework station. It sounds more impressive than it is; more akin to a high temperature hair dryer.  I purchased one of these 858D clones (see below) for about $35. There are many variants of this in the market, but they&#39;re all very similar. It has a knob to control the fan speed, buttons to raise or lower the temperature and a heat &#39;wand&#39; on a short cable. For safety, there&#39;s a magnetic switch which turns off the heater when it&#39;s sitting in the holster.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0KBHbChIQu1i13YcVbFPp_mGu6Rq0NAkxfr8s_hM31S_OKXJLTgwA2eJ1Zxntoqq8odY3o__x9jV95hPcRkDgsORMqWKCiKFYYmV0eyqESI8aFmXiVrqWHvmYvFvQ0Plq19vJPlFdayrUg7uQyuKdolo9wnvVXKm7BZJqG3_y_sU44vaq8z-cVhuQ0w/s812/Screenshot%202023-04-25%20at%206.51.24%20AM.png"><img data-original-height="812" data-original-width="624" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0KBHbChIQu1i13YcVbFPp_mGu6Rq0NAkxfr8s_hM31S_OKXJLTgwA2eJ1Zxntoqq8odY3o__x9jV95hPcRkDgsORMqWKCiKFYYmV0eyqESI8aFmXiVrqWHvmYvFvQ0Plq19vJPlFdayrUg7uQyuKdolo9wnvVXKm7BZJqG3_y_sU44vaq8z-cVhuQ0w/s320/Screenshot%202023-04-25%20at%206.51.24%20AM.png" width="246"/></a></p><p>With only the hot air gun and a good pair of tweezers, it&#39;s possible to solder or rework (simple) SMD PCBs with minimal frustration. This is just the &#34;getting started&#34; tool and certainly not the best or only one for  SMD hobby work. If you don&#39;t have a lot of extra space or budget for the more advanced tools, then at least you can get a feel for it without investing too heavily. There is a long list of tools people use for working with surface mount components such as reflow ovens, hot plates, pick-n-place machines, microscopic cameras, suction pick-up pens, and on and on. I don&#39;t have the space or budget for them, so I make do with the hot air gun and I recently added an inexpensive ($40) hot plate:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHOckGFVRrzPKK0VlYNqSXyKO2cb8L4T3FmFzV97H48HCJ2oHkBOMI09sWPRnoi6hn0y6Uw0MoHWH-xP5jSaJqbwGfkOH6DlNorWC7XJuTy5dbDAyu6SLc3_MSFg4AekHWSs2P8kyFPln1OT8_MYXCvJwaY1RKpXqhah9BYE_iD87XQlk3Q-M_ur7J_Q/s4032/20230425_164723.jpg"><img data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="3024" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHOckGFVRrzPKK0VlYNqSXyKO2cb8L4T3FmFzV97H48HCJ2oHkBOMI09sWPRnoi6hn0y6Uw0MoHWH-xP5jSaJqbwGfkOH6DlNorWC7XJuTy5dbDAyu6SLc3_MSFg4AekHWSs2P8kyFPln1OT8_MYXCvJwaY1RKpXqhah9BYE_iD87XQlk3Q-M_ur7J_Q/s320/20230425_164723.jpg" width="240"/></a></p></div></div>
