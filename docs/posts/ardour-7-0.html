	October 15th, 2022: After more than a year since Ardour 6.9, Ardour 7.0 is now
	available. This new release features major new features for
	the software, as well as substantial (even if largely
	invisible) internal engineering changes. We are happy to bring
	&#34;clip launching&#34; functionality into Ardour for the first time,
	along with many other significant improvements, including lots
	of enhancements for MIDI editing ....
      </p>
      <p>
	This release also sees the addition of official builds for
	Apple Silicon systems (previously available only via
	the <a href="https://nightly.ardour.org/">nightly build
	site</a>). It is also the end of 32 bit builds for Ardour for
	all platforms as part of the official download site. Some will
	remain available on the nightly site for the near-term future.

      <p>
	Probably the biggest visible change in Ardour 7.0 is the arrival of &#34;clip launching&#34; similar
	to the workflow pioneered by Ableton Live and now also provided by Bitwig, Digital
	Performer, Logic and others.
      </p>
      <p>
	Clip launching allows you to experiment with combinations of various loops and one shot
	samples, with all sound appropriately (but optionally) time-stretched to fit
	the tempo map of the session, and start/stop quantized to the groove.
      </p>
      <p>
      <img src="https://ardour.org/images/cue_grid.png" alt="Ardour&#39;s new Cue Grid"/>
      </p>
      <p>
	Trim or extend the effective length of clips and choose how
	many times they will repeat before they trigger a follow
	option. 
      </p>
      <p>
	You can build automated sequences with controlled randomness,
	using follow options: <code>Forward</code>, <code>Reverse</code>, <code>Jump</code> and <code>Multi-Jump</code>
	(which randomly picks between specific slots).  A great way to
	add random fills and unexpected twists to your drum tracks!
      </p>
      <p>
	Unlike some other DAWs, MIDI clips in Ardour can have 16 MIDI
	channels, and every clip can have its own patches (sounds)
	assigned.  You can use multi-timbral MIDI files for various
	effects, including layering or &#34;true flams&#34; (same note,
	different channels),
      </p>
      <p>
	In this release, only Ableton&#39;s Push 2 surface can be used as
	a controller to control cues, but future dot releases of 7.x
	will bring support for Novation Launchpads and other related
	devices. The existing Push 2 support is fairly deep - most of
	the features of Live&#39;s &#34;Session&#34; mode for the device are
	implemented. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Although we modelled much of Ardour&#39;s clip launching behavior
	on Ableton Live, there are differences. You
	can <a href="https://ardour.org/clip_differences.html">read more about them if you&#39;re interested.</a>

      <p>
	With clip launching now a major feature of Ardour, we had to
	make a choice for our release regarding whether or not we
	would include any pre-existing content with the download. We
	did not want to make the download of Ardour substantially
	larger than it already is, and so we decided to include some
	MIDI material, and then create a new download system to access
	gigabytes of additional audio / MIDI loops.
      </p>
      <p>
	On both the Cues and Edit page/tab, you&#39;ll find the Clips tab
	on the right hand side. It provides limited management of a
	sample library (which we might improve over time). But perhaps
	more importantly it comes preloaded  with 8000+ MIDI chords,
	5000+ MIDI chord progressions and 4800+ MIDI drum grooves,
	ready to use (and obviously royalty free and redistributable).
      </p>
      <p>
	You&#39;ll almost certainly want to use other material too. You
	can add folders containing audio and/or MIDI loops and samples
	yourself by simply drag&amp;dropping them onto the Clips
	tab. You can bounce regions and ranges from the Editor page to
	the Clips tab, straight from the timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
	You might also appreciate easy access to a large set of
	existing loopable material. As part of the 7.0 release, we
	convinced a few of the creative folks who post loops
	at <a href="http://looperman.com">looperman.com</a> to allow
	us to package and redistribute their material. When you
	open <code>Window &gt; Library Downloader</code> you will find
	many libraries of both rhythmic and melodic material for use in
	your sessions. All these libraries are royalty free, though the
	actual license may vary from CC-by-0 to MIT license or
	others. Many thanks to creators Speak, LenoxBeatMaker,
	NegusFirst and ProdGraverr for their collaboration on this. We
	look forward to adding more in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course, you can also use files from nearly any loop provider,
	in dozens of audio/MIDI file formats, including the bundled
	content of other DAWs. Mac users will find Ardour preconfigured to
	show their existing collection of accessible loops from
	Garageband or Logic.
      </p>
      <p>
	<img src="https://ardour.org/images/library-downloader.png" alt="screenshot of the library downloader dialog"/>
      </p>
      <p>
	You add folders to your Clip Library by simply drag &amp; dropping a folder on the Clips tab.
Audition MIDI files with our built-in General MIDI Synth or your preferred synth.
Generate your own loops and drop them onto the Clip tab to store them in your User Library for use in other sessions or to distribute.
Bounce from the linear tracks into your User Library, and use your own tracks as clips in the Cues grid.

      <p>
	Sometimes after finding things you like on the Cue page, you
	may want to be able to work on the timeline in a more
	&#34;linear&#34; workflow. Ardour 7.0 not only allows you to launch clips
	in a similar style to Live, Bitwig and others, it has the
	ability to sequence them from the timeline. A new &#34;Cue Marker&#34;
	rule lets you launch cue scenes by having the playhead pass over
	them. This allows you to build your arrangement without ever
	having to commit to a particular audio rendering.  Cue Markers
	can be recorded live onto the timeline, or placed manually
	from the editor ruler, and they also appear in the
	mini-timeline in the Cue and Mix page, so you can see your
	song structure everywhere, even the mix window.
      </p>
      <p>
	Cue playback is continuous: you can even locate between cue
	markers, and the entire arrangement is calculated up to that
	point -- so even if you start your session with only a single
	drum clip, you can locate anywhere on the timeline and hear
	your clip playing!
      </p>
      <p>
	There is a Stop cue marker which stops all of your clip playback
	on the timeline.  Then you can re-start it with another cue
	marker later! And you can also mark individual clips as
	&#34;isolated&#34; which prevents them from launching from cue scenes,
	allowing you to fire those clips manually even if &#34;Play Cues&#34; is
	enabled.
      </p>

      <p>
	Ardour 7.0 is built around a completely new and totally
	different representation of time than previous
	versions. Internally the program has the concept of two
	different time &#34;domains&#34; -- audio time and musical time. Every
	representation of position and duration has a defined
	domain. When you move an object by 4 bars, it moves precisely
	4 bars, not the best representation of 4 bars in either
	samples or seconds. A parameter control point that is 4 beats
	after the start of a region is exactly 4 beats after the start
	of the region, not an approximation of that in audio time.
      </p>
      <p>
	For the most part, this major engineering project should be
	mostly invisible to users (other than in helping to fix bugs
	caused by inaccuracies converting between audio and musical
	time in earlier versions). We plan to build more functionality
	into Ardour in future versions based on this new time
	representation. That will include sample-rate independence for
	sessions, and also the ability to lock MIDI data to audio time
	positions when desired.

      <p>
	Ardour now has 3 &#34;ripple editing&#34; modes. Ripple editing describes what happens when you cut/delete material from a track, and later material moves earlier to &#34;fill the gap&#34;. 
	</p><dl>
	  <dt>Ripple Selected</dt>
	  <dd>In this mode, after deleting a region or time range, all selected tracks will ripple.</dd>
	  <dt>Ripple All</dt>
	  <dd>In this mode, all tracks will ripple in response to range deletion</dd>
	  <dt>Interview</dt>
	  <dd>In this mode, rippling will only occur if more than one
	    track is selected. Otherwise, we assume you are just
	    removing incidental noise like &#34;uhm&#34; and &#34;ah&#34; from one
	    track. You can just move the mouse down when selecting to
	    apply the edit to both/all tracks. This is particularly
	    useful when editing 1-on-1 interviews/discussions for
	    podcasts, etc.</dd>

      </p>
      <p>
	Mixer scenes allow you to quickly store/restore all
	<em>automatable</em> settings in the mixer window (track solo/mute/gain
	etc, plus all plugin parameters). You can compare 8 different
	mixes with a single click, as well as audition a &#34;mixer
	scene&#34; using a &#34;momentary&#34; mode. This takes plugin A/B&#39;ing to
	a new level, allowing you compare settings across as many
	plugins as you wish to, with a single click.
      </p>
      <p>
	You will find them at the lower left of the Mixer view, with View &gt; Show Mixer Lists
	enabled. <em>Note that mixer scenes do not save/restore the
	presence/absence of specific plugins.</em>

	<li>By default, copies of MIDI regions are now unlinked. If
	you want repeating MIDI material in your session, bounce the
	MIDI region to a cue slot and let it play from there. <em>If
	you actually use the linked-copy setting, be sure to set it
	for a new Session once using Ardour 7.0.</em>.</li>
	<li>Add new keyboard bindings for note length control
	(combinations
	of <code>,</code> <code>.</code>, <code>left-arrow</code>, <code>right-arrow</code>
	and various modifiers, which we hope you&#39;ll find trivial to
	remember once you&#39;ve used them for a short time).</li>
	<li>When transposing, expand MIDI streamview note range when/as necessary so that notes do not vanish.</li>
	<li>Scroll while in internal edit mode, with no note selection, will scroll the note range. Normal canvas scroll can be accessed in this mode via Primary+Tertiary-scroll (Ctrl+Shift on Linux/Windows, Cmd+Shift on macOS).</li>
	<li>Simple click on region in internal edit/draw modes selects region.</li>
	<li>Fix midi-note Copy+Paste and Duplicate actions.</li>
	<li>Provide a toolbar menu to explicitly select note-length, channel and velocity.</li>
	<li>MIDI Draw: note-length-auto means &#39;use the Grid for note-length&#39; (prior behavior).</li>
	<li>MIDI regions can now be combined, like audio
	  regions. Note, however, that there is no &#34;uncombine&#34; operation.</li>
	<li>MIDI regions can now be either opaque or transparent, just like audio region. An opaque region obscuring another causes MIDI events from the lower region to be ignored. Can be controlled just like audio region opacity.</li>
	<li>Edit operation to deinterlace MIDI (split a midi region into per-channel regions) added.</li>
	<li>Delete notes (in draw/edit modes) with the middle button.</li>
	<li>Ctrl+d (in edit mode) now duplicates selected notes.</li>
	<li>Much better visibility for MIDI not velocity bar.</li>
	<li>&#34;q&#34; will quantize selected notes if there are any, rather than the entire region (if there are not).</li>
	<li>Enforce a minimum length when drawing MIDI notes.</li>
	<li>Take snap enable state into account when drawing new notes.</li>
	<li>When drawing notes, the grid should be scaled to the zoom scale.</li>
	<li>When using unlinked MIDI region copies, the copies use a full-length version of the
	  underlying MIDI file. In earlier versions, the copy would get a truncated version of the
	  MIDI file. This allows you to lengthen the copy when appropriate, not just shorten it.</li>
	<li>When nudging notes, if nudge clock is zero, use main grid to determine distance.</li>

      <p>
	Ardour has long allowed stem exports (1 file per track) for audio, but 7.0 brings the arrival
	of stem exports for MIDI tracks also. If you use complex multi-region arrangements of MIDI,
	this is one way to generate a single SMF file for each track.
      </p>
      <p>
	When a synth is present on the MIDI track you have to <em>disable processing</em> to get raw MIDI data,
	otherwise stem-export will export the track&#39;s output, which may include MIDI filters or midi-to-audio synths.

	Once again, Ardour can be used to directly search and use nearly 600,000
	samples hosted by the Freesound project. Freesound changed their login
	process several years ago, but we have finally updated our code to
	follow those changes. You will need your own Freesound account, and to tell
	Ardour a special login code that Freesound will give you the first time
	you try to download within Ardour. After that, you can browse and import
	Freesound samples as if they were on your local hard drive.
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/freesound.png" alt="the import dialog showing the Freesound tab within Ardour"/></p><p>
	We&#39;ve also added a user-configurable size for the amount of locally cached Freesound
	samples, and a way to filter searches by license type.

	Thanks to some work carried out by Harrison to support new features in a specialized version of
	Mixbus, Ardour 7.0 sees support for I/O plugins: plugins that run outside the context of any
	track or bus. Pre-processor I/O plugins run before Ardour does any processing -- you could
	use a plugin there to pre-process physical input, or to receive data over a
	network. Post-processor I/O plugins run after Ardour has completed processing -- you could
	add room correction or per-monitor correction there, or use a plugin that delivers data to a
	network. This is not a substitute in any way for running plugins in busses (or tracks), but
	opens up new possibilities for I/O routing and processing.
