						<h3>Fewer moving parts</h3>
						<p>
							Caddy simplifies your infrastructure. It takes care of TLS certificate renewals, OCSP stapling, static file serving, reverse proxying, Kubernetes ingress, and more.
						</p>
						<p>
							Its modular architecture means you can do more with a single, static binary that compiles for any platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							Caddy runs great in containers because it has no dependencies—not even libc. Run Caddy practically anywhere.
						</p>

						<h3>Best-in-class security</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Caddy is the only web server to use HTTPS automatically and by default.</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Caddy obtains and renews TLS certificates for your sites automatically. It even staples OCSP responses. Its novel certificate management features are the most mature and reliable in its class.
						</p>
						<p>
							Written in Go, Caddy offers greater memory safety than servers written in C. A hardened TLS stack powered by the Go standard library serves a significant portion of all Internet traffic.

				<h3>General</h3>
				<p>
					Caddy 2 was boldly engineered to simplify your infrastructure and give you control over the edge of your compute platform.
				</p>


				<h4>Architecture</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Extensible</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can embed any Go application as a plugin, and has first-class support for plugins of plugins.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Minimal Global State</h5>
						<p>
							Global state is common in servers, but tends to be error-prone and a bottleneck, so Caddy 2 uses a novel design that limits global state.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Lightweight</h5>
						<p>
							For all its features, Caddy runs lightly and efficiently with relatively low memory footprint and high throughput.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Multi-core</h5>
						<p>
							When the going gets tough, Caddy gets going on more CPUs. Go&#39;s scheduler understands Go code, and goroutines are more lightweight than system threads.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Static Binary</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is a single executable file with no dependencies, not even libc. Literally just needs some metal and a kernel. Put Caddy in your PATH and run it. Done.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Cross-Platform</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, Android, Solaris, 32-bit, amd64, ARM, aarch64, mips64... almost anything to which Go compiles.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>


				<h4>Configuration</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>JSON Structure</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s native config format is JSON, so it is familiar and highly interoperable with existing systems and tools.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>REST API</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s configuration is received through a REST endpoint as a single JSON document, making it highly programmable.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Config Files Optional</h5>
						<p>
							You can use config files with Caddy&#39;s CLI, which converts them to API requests for you under the hood.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Config Adapters</h5>
						<p>
							Bring your own config! Config adapters translate various config formats (Caddyfile, TOML, NGINX, etc.) into Caddy&#39;s native JSON.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>The Caddyfile</h5>
						<p>
							An easy, intuitive way to configure your site. It&#39;s not scripting, and not hard to memorize. Rolls off the fingers. You&#39;ll really like it.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Unified Config</h5>
						<p>
							All configuration is contained within a single JSON document so there are fewer hidden factors affecting your config.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Partial Updates</h5>
						<p>
							When you have just small changes to make, Caddy&#39;s API lets you update just the relevant parts of its config.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Fine-Grained Control</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s native JSON exposes the actual fields allocated in memory by the running server to give you more control.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Export</h5>
						<p>
							You can export a live copy of Caddy&#39;s current configuration with a GET request to its API.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Efficient Reloads</h5>
						<p>
							Config updates are finely tuned for efficiency so you can reload config dozens of times per second.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Graceful Reloads</h5>
						<p>
							Config changes take effect without downtime or closing sockets—even on Windows.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Config Validation</h5>
						<p>
							You can use Caddy&#39;s CLI to preview and validate configurations before applying them.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>






				<h4>Basic Features</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>The Caddyfile</h5>
						<p>
							An easy, intuitive way to configure your site. It&#39;s not scripting, and not hard to memorize. Rolls off the fingers. You&#39;ll really like it.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Static Files</h5>
						<p>
							By default, Caddy will serve static files in the current working directory. It&#39;s so brilliantly simple and works fast.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Dynamic Sites</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can also be used to serve dynamic sites with templates, proxying, FastCGI, and by the use of plugins.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Command Line Interface</h5>
						<p>
							Customize how Caddy runs with its simple, cross-platform command line interface; especially great for quick, one-off server instances.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Plugins</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can be extended with plugins. All apps, Caddyfile directives, HTTP handlers, and other features are plugins! They&#39;re easy to write and get compiled in directly.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Multi-core</h5>
						<p>
							When the going gets tough, Caddy gets going on more CPUs. Go&#39;s scheduler understands Go code, and goroutines are more lightweight than system threads. So yeah, it&#39;s fast.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Embeddable</h5>
						<p>
							Writing another program or web service that could use a powerful web server or reverse proxy? Caddy can be used like a library in your Go program.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Caddyfile Validation</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can parse and verify your Caddyfile without actually running it.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Process Log</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can write a log of all its significant events, especially errors. Log to a file, stdout/stderr, or a local or remote system log!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Log Rolling</h5>
						<p>
							When log files get large, Caddy will automatically rotate them to conserve disk space.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<section>
				<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
				<p>
					Caddy&#39;s flagship features are security and privacy. Caddy is the first and only web server to enable HTTPS automatically and by default.
				</p>

				<h4>TLS</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>TLS 1.3</h5>
						<p>
							TLS 1.3 is the newest standard for transport security, which is faster and more secure than its predecessors.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Modern Cipher Suites</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy uses the best crypto technologies including AES-GCM, ChaCha, and ECC by default, balancing security and compatibility. You can customize which ciphers are allowed.
						</p>
					</div>
					<!-- <div class="feature">
						<h5>Man-in-the-Middle Detection</h5>
						<p>
							For HTTPS requests, Caddy can detect when the client's TLS connection is likely being intercepted by a proxy, giving you the ability to act accordingly.
						</p>
					</div> -->
					<div>
						<h5>Memory Safety</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is the only web server in its class that is impervious to bugs like Heartbleed and buffer overflows because it is written in the memory-safe language of Go.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Client Authentication</h5>
						<p>
							With TLS client auth, you can configure Caddy to allow only certain clients to connect to your service.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Hardened Stack</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is proudly written in Go, and its TLS stack is powered by the robust crypto/tls package in the Go standard library, trusted by the world&#39;s largest content distributors.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>PCI Compliant</h5>
						<p>
							Companies choose Caddy because its TLS configuration is PCI-compliant by default. It has even saved some companies hours before losing certification!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Scalable Storage</h5>
						<p>
							TLS assets are stored on disk, but the storage mechanism can be swapped out for custom implementations so you can deploy and coordinate a fleet of Caddy instances.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Key Rotation</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is cited as the <a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/forward-secrecy-imc16.pdf">only web server</a> to rotate TLS session ticket keys by default. This helps preserve forward secrecy, i.e. visitor privacy.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Server Name Indication</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy uses the TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI) to be able to host multiple sites on a single interface. Like most features, this just works.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https">automatic HTTPS</a> feature includes redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for you by default.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Certificates</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Auto Obtain</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy obtains certificates for you automatically using Let&#39;s Encrypt. Any ACME-compatible CA can be used. Caddy was the first web server to implement this technology.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Auto Renew</h5>
						<p>
							Never deal with certificates again! Certificates are automatically renewed in the background before they get close to expiring.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Dynamic Cert Loading</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is the only web server that can obtain certificates during a TLS handshake and use it right away.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Bring Your Own</h5>
						<p>
							If you still prefer to manage certificates yourself, you can give Caddy your certificate and key files (PEM format) like you&#39;re used to.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Bulk Cert Loading</h5>
						<p>
							If you manage many certificates yourself, you can give Caddy an entire folder to load certificates from.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Easy Self-Signed Certs</h5>
						<p>
							For easy local development and testing, Caddy can generate and manage self-signed certificates for you without any hassle.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>SAN Certificates</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy fully accepts SAN certificates for times when you may be managing your own SAN certificates and wish to use those instead.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Cluster Support</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can share managed certificates stored on disk with other instances and synchronize renewals in fleet deployments.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Scalable</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s certificate management scales well up to tens of thousands of sites and tens of thousands of certificates per instance.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Wildcards</h5>
						<p>
							When needed, Caddy can obtain and renew wildcard certificates for you when you have many related subdomains to serve.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>OCSP</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Stapling</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy staples OCSP responses to every qualifying certificate by default. Caddy&#39;s OCSP stapling is more robust against network failure than other web servers.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Caching</h5>
						<p>
							Every OCSP response is cached on disk to preserve integrity through restarts, in case the responder goes down or the network link is being attacked.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Must-Staple</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can be configured to obtain Must-Staple certificates, which requires that certificate to always have the OCSP response stapled.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Background Updates</h5>
						<p>
							Unlike other web servers, Caddy updates OCSP responses in the background, asynchronously of any requests, well before their expiration.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Pre-Validated</h5>
						<p>
							An OCSP response will not be stapled unless it checks out for validity first, to make sure it&#39;s something clients will accept.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Revocation Handling</h5>
						<p>
							If a managed certificate is discovered by OCSP to be revoked, Caddy will automatically try to replace the certificate.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>ACME Protocol</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>HTTP Challenge</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can solve the HTTP challenge to obtain certificates. You can also configure Caddy to proxy these challenges to other processes.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>TLS-ALPN Challenge</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy solves the TLS-ALPN challenge which happens on port 443 and does not require opening port 80 at all.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Fleet Coordination</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy coordinates the obtaining and renewing of certificates in cluster configurations for both HTTP and TLS-ALPN challenges!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>DNS Challenge</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy solves the DNS challenge which does not involve opening any ports on the machine. There are integrations for all major DNS providers!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Revocation</h5>
						<p>
							If one of your private keys becomes compromised, you can use Caddy to easily revoke the affected certificates.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Customizable CA</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is designed to be used with any ACME-compatible certificate authority, which you can customize with a single command line flag.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Robust to Failures</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is the only web server and only major ACME client that was not disrupted by CA changes and outages, or OCSP responder hiccups.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>HTTP Server</h3>
				<p>
					Caddy&#39;s HTTP server has a wide array of modern features, high performance, and is easy to deploy.
				</p>

				<h4>Site Features</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Directory Browsing</h5>
						<p>
							List files and folders with Caddy&#39;s attractive, practical design or according to your own custom template.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Virtual Hosts</h5>
						<p>
							Serve multiple sites from the same IP address with the Caddyfile.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Configurable Binding</h5>
						<p>
							You can select which network interfaces to which you bind the listener, giving you more access control over your site.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Markdown</h5>
						<p>
							Let Caddy render your Markdown files as HTML on-the-fly. You can embed your Markdown in a template and parse out front matter.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Templates</h5>
						<p>
							A powerful and improved alternative to Server-Side Includes, templates allow you to make semi-dynamic sites quickly and easily.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Custom Error Pages</h5>
						<p>
							Show user-friendly error pages when things go wrong, or write the error details to the browser for dev environments.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Logging</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy takes copious notes according to your favorite log format. Log errors and requests to a file, stdout/stderr, or a local or remote system log.
						</p>
					</div>
					<!-- <div class="feature">
						<h5>Debugging</h5>
						<p>
							Peer inside Caddy with Go's pprof and expvar functions, which allow you to profile the process and see exported variables.
						</p>
					</div> -->
					<!-- <div class="feature">
						<h5>Static Compressed Assets</h5>
						<p>
							When serving static files to a client that supports compression, Caddy will prefer serving the compressed equivalent if it exists on disk.
						</p>
					</div> -->
					<div>
						<h5>Request Size Limits</h5>
						<p>
							You can limit the size of request bodies that go through Caddy to prevent abuse of your network bandwidth.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Timeouts</h5>
						<p>
							Enabling timeouts can be a good idea when your server may be prone to slowloris attacks or you want to free up resources from slow networks.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Web Protocols</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>HTTP/1.1</h5>
						<p>
							Still commonly used in plaintext, development, and debug environments, Caddy has solid support for HTTP/1.1.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>HTTP/2</h5>
						<p>
							It&#39;s time for a faster web. Caddy uses HTTP/2 right out of the box. No thought required. HTTP/1.1 is still used when clients don&#39;t support HTTP/2.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>HTTP/3</h5>
						<p>
							With the IETF-standard-draft version of QUIC, sites load faster and connections aren&#39;t dropped when switching networks.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>WebSockets</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy supports making WebSocket connections directly to local programs&#39; stdin/stdout streams that work a little bit like CGI.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>IPv6</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy supports both IPv4 and IPv6. In fact, Caddy runs full well in an IPv6 environment without extra configuration.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>FastCGI</h5>
						<p>
							Serve your PHP site behind Caddy securely with just one simple line of configuration. You can even specify multiple backends.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>HTTP Spec</h4>
				<div>
					<!-- <div class="feature">
						<h5>HTTP/2 Server Push</h5>
						<p>
							Server push is when the server sends resources to the client before being asked for it, and it speeds up page loading.
						</p>
					</div> -->
					<div>
						<h5>Basic Authentication</h5>
						<p>
							Protect areas of your site with HTTP basic auth. It&#39;s simple to use and secure over HTTPS for most purposes.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Redirects</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can issue HTTP redirects with any 3xx status code, including redirects using <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags if you prefer.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Headers</h5>
						<p>
							Customize the response headers so that some headers are removed or others are added.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Reverse Proxy</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Basic Proxying</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy can act as a reverse proxy for HTTP requests. You can also proxy transparently (preserve the original Host header) with one line of config.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Load Balancing</h5>
						<p>
							Proxy to multiple backends using a load balancing policy of your choice: random, least connections, round robin, IP hash, or header.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>SSL Termination</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy is frequently used as a TLS terminator because of its powerful TLS features.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>WebSocket Proxy</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy&#39;s proxy middleware is capable of proxying websocket connections to backends as well.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Health Checks</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy marks backends in trouble as unhealthy, and you can configure health check paths, intervals, and timeouts for optimal performance.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Retries</h5>
						<p>
							When a request to a backend fails to connect, Caddy will try the request with other backends until one that is online accepts the connection.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Header Controls</h5>
						<p>
							By default, most headers will be carried through, but you can control which headers flow upstream and downstream.
						</p>
					</div>
					<!-- <div class="feature">
						<h5>Internal Requests</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy supports the X-Accel-Redirect (or X-Sendfile) header so you can protect resources from "external" requests.
						</p>
					</div> -->
					<div>
						<h5>Dynamic Backends</h5>
						<p>
							Proxy to arbitrary backends based on request parameters such as parts of the domain name or header values.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Amenities</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h5>Clean URIs</h5>
						<p>
							Elegantly serve files without needing the extension present in the URL. These look nicer to visitors and are easy to configure.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Rewrites</h5>
						<p>
							Caddy has powerful request URI rewriting capabilities that support regular expressions, conditionals, and dynamic values.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Response Status Codes</h5>
						<p>
							Send a certain status code for certain requests.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>Compression</h5>
						<p>
							Compress content on-the-fly using gzip, Zstandard, or brotli.
						</p>
					</div>
