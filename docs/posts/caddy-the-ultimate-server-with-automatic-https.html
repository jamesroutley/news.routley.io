					<b>By default, </b>Caddy <b>automatically obtains</b> and <b>renews</b> TLS certificates for <b>all your sites.</b>

				<div>
					<div>
						<h3>HTTPS/TLS for custom domains</h3>
						<p>
							The secret sauce of almost every white-label SaaS is Caddy&#39;s original On-Demand TLS feature. Grow your SaaS business by orders of magnitude with ease!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Dynamically provision certificates</h3>
						<p>
							With On-Demand TLS, only Caddy obtains, renews, and maintains certificates on-the-fly during TLS handshakes. Perfect for customer-owned domains.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Massively scale your TLS</h3>
						<p>
							Other web servers and scripted certificate tools fall over with hundreds of thousands of sites or thousands of instances. Caddy is designed to manage certificates reliably at this scale.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>All you need for TLS and PKI üîê</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy securely serves all sites with TLS by default. It can also manage your internal PKI for you across a fleet of servers and clients.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>On-line config API ‚ö°Ô∏è</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy&#39;s native configuration is a JSON document that you can export and manipulate with a RESTful config API.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>PCI, HIPAA, and NIST compliant ‚úÖ</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy&#39;s TLS defaults are secure and pass PCI, HIPAA, and NIST compliance requirements. Yes, defaults: no hassle required.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>HTTPS for localhost üè†</h3>
							<p>
								We mean it when we say Caddy serves every site on HTTPS. Even localhost and internal IPs are served with TLS using the intermediate of a fully-automated, self-managed CA that is automatically installed into most local trust stores.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Cluster coordination üåê</h3>
							<p>
								Simply configure multiple Caddy instances with the same storage, and they will automatically coordinate certificate management as a fleet and share resources such as keys and OCSP staples!
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Fewer moving parts ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
							<p>
								Simplify your infrastructure! Caddy saves money, increases developer productivity, and reduces problems in production. 
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

						<h2 id="on-demand-demo" lang="de">Experience it</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Discover Caddy&#39;s automagic HTTPS features with our hosted demo.</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Point DNS records for any subdomain named <b><code>caddydemo</code></b> to either:
						</p>
						<p>
							<code>
								<span>CNAME</span>
								<span>demo.caddyserver.com</span>
							</code>
						</p>
						<p>
							or:
						</p>
						<p>
							<code>
								<span>A</span>
								<span>138.68.4.62</span>
							</code>
							<code>
								<span>AAAA</span>
								<span>2604:a880:2:d0::9dd:9001</span>
							</code>
						</p>
						<p>
							Then <b>visit it</b> in your browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							You&#39;ll notice how Caddy <b>provisions a certificate</b> for your domain <b>automatically.</b>
						</p>
						<div>
							<p>
								<b>Not working?</b> Make sure to use a direct subdomain of a registered domain, not a &#34;sub-subdomain.&#34;
								Verify you have created the public DNS records shown above with the correct values.
								You may have to allow time for propagation. Consult your DNS provider&#39;s documentation or support for assistance.
								Your browser/client must set the TLS ServerName indication (most do).
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Example subdomains that could work:</b> <code>caddydemo.example.net</code>, <code>caddydemo.example.com.au</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								Caddy is capable of serving TLS for any domains and IPs. This demo is intentionally restricted.

					<h2 id="your-own-pki">Deploy your own PKI with Caddy</h2>
					<p>
						Not only is Caddy the industry leader in certificate automation, it also sports a fully-featured PKI suite for your own fully-automated internal PKI and private CAs.
					</p>
					<!-- <p>
						Caddy will serve your localhost and internal sites over HTTPS using its own CA. And you can create your own CA to issue certs across your infrastructure. It has a built-in ACME server, powered by Smallstep, to automate your private PKI reliably at scale.
					</p> -->
					<p>
						Powered by open source <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificates/">Smallstep libraries</a>, Caddy becomes a self-managing certificate authority.

							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Internal and localhost certificates</h3>
							<p>
								If you configure sites with local or internal addresses, Caddy will serve them over HTTPS using a locally-trusted certificate authority with short-lived, auto-renewing certificates. It even offers to install your unique root into your local trust stores for you.
							</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Make and use your own CAs</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy lets you define as many CAs as you need. Root and intermediate keys are generated automatically, and intermediates are renewed before they expire.
							</p>
							<p>
								Deploy an instance to act as an ACME server. Then other Caddy instances can use it for their certificates.

							<h3>Keep certificates renewed</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy is more than just a web server. For example, this config is all it takes to obtain and renew certificates for a set of domain names.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additional config can be written to wire up certificate maintenance events, which can then be used to integrate with external scripts and tooling.
							</p>
							<!-- <p>
								Caddy 2 is a <a href="/docs/extending-caddy">highly extensible</a>, self-hosted platform on which you can build, configure, and deploy long-running services ("apps").
							</p>
							<p>
								Caddy ships with apps for an <a href="/docs/modules/http">HTTPS server</a> (static files, reverse proxying, load balancing, etc.), <a href="/docs/modules/tls">TLS certificate manager</a>, and <a href="/docs/modules/pki">fully-managed internal PKI</a>. Caddy apps collaborate to make complex infrastructure just work with fewer moving parts.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>For example, the config shown here keeps your TLS certificates renewed for other programs to use;</b> no external tools or HTTP daemon required!
							</p>
							<p>
								Providing a unified configuration, on-line <a href="/docs/api">config API</a>, and <a href="/docs/json/">automatic documentation</a> for all apps, Caddy is nearly infinitely extensible. Thanks to its unique <a href="/docs/architecture">modular architecture</a>, we can offer unlimited features without bloating the code base.

								Make dynamic config changes through an <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/api">intuitive, programmable REST API</a> that offers ACID guarantees. It is also <b>safely scoped</b>, meaning that the URI path restricts changes, making it impossible to accidentally alter other parts of your config.
							</p>
							<!-- <ul>
								<li><b>Atomic:</b> Multiple changes in a single request are treated as a single unit; any failed change aborts all the other changes.</li>
								<li><b>Consistent:</b> No invalid configurations can be loaded; your server will never break if a problem is detected at config load.</li>
								<li><b>Isolated:</b> No config changes rely on another. (It helps that HTTP is a stateless protocol!)</li>
								<li><b>Durable:</b> Caddy automatically persists the current, valid configuration to disk and can safely resume it after a power cycle if the <code>--resume</code> flag is used.</li>

						Caddy is the only server in the world with its novel, modular architecture. At its core, Caddy is a configuration manager that runs apps like an HTTP server, internal certificate authority, TLS certificate manager, process supervisor, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						And because of its unique design, we can offer unlimited features without bloating the code base. Only compile in what you need.

							<p>
								Nearly every part of the config that &#34;does something&#34; is pluggable. Caddy offers unlimited capabilities in such a lean package.
							</p>

							<h3>Native CPU performance</h3>
							<p>
								No RPC calls or flimsy dependency management. Plugins are compiled into the static binary, making successful deployments certain and runtimes blazing fast.

							<h3>Easy to develop</h3>
							<p>
								Writing Caddy plugins is as easy as writing a Go package. It&#39;s a comfortable and familiar process for any Go programmer.

								<p>
									With <a href="https://frankenphp.dev">FrankenPHP</a>, Caddy acts as a PHP application server that delivers PHP pages about <a href="https://blog.laravel.com/octane-frankenphp">4x faster</a> than Swoole or RoadRunner: no need for php-fpm (FastCGI).
								</p>
								<p>
									Deploy your PHP application as a single static binary without needing to install PHP and php-fpm separately. Caddy with FrankenPHP is all you need for high-performing PHP apps!
								</p>
								<p><a href="https://frankenphp.dev" title="FrankenPHP"><img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/frankenphp-logo.svg" alt="FrankenPHP - Modern PHP app server"/></a></p><p>
									Benchmarks compare total response times using worker mode with Octane. FrankenPHP runs in-process with the server, so it&#39;s generally faster than FPM/mod_php in most cases. PHP execution is not accelerated.

					<h2 id="gold-standard">The <span>gold standard</span> web server</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy has the most robust TLS stack on the market. With stronger memory safety guarantees than OpenSSL (Apache &amp; NGINX) and more advanced certificate automation logic than any other server or utility, Caddy keeps your sites online through problems when other servers... won&#39;t.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caddy was the first server to fully automate public certificate management‚Äîso we&#39;ve been doing this longer than anyone. With more than 50 million certificates under management, Caddy has set the gold standard for other servers to live up to.
					</p>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>OCSP stapling saves the day</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy automatically staples OCSP responses and caches them to weather outages. In 2018, many popular sites went down for users of mainstream browsers because crucial OCSP infrastructure had an extended outage. Only Caddy staples and caches OCSP responses by default, so all Caddy sites were unaffected.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>On guard against revocation</h3>
							<p>
								In 2020, a mass certificate revocation event left many sysadmins scrambling to renew their certificates ahead of schedule. Caddy automatically renews certificates that get revoked, and all Caddy sites were unaffected. (This was before ARI existed.)
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Stands tall during audits</h3>
							<p>
								Companies have deployed Caddy in front of their site just hours before important audits‚Äîpotentially saving their compliance status‚Äîbecause of Caddy&#39;s safe defaults and &#34;batteries included&#34; approach.
							</p>

					<h2>Take everyone&#39;s word for it</h2>
					<p>
						We&#39;re biased. But Caddy is widely relied upon and praised by a diverse global user base because of its ease of use, secure defaults, powerful feature set, and business-changing cost reductions.
