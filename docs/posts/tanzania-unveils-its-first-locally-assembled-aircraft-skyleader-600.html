<p>This unveiling took place at the Tanzania International Manufacturers Expo 2023 (TIMEXPO) in the nation’s capital at the Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam.</p>

<p>David Grolic, the AAL director disclosed that his organization decided to take advantage of Tanzania’s favorable business climate, and willingness to adopt new technologies, by setting up the aircraft assembling outfit in the country.</p>
<p>“We conducted thorough research to understand the requirements of business travelers who frequently undertake long-distance trips. In response to the research, we decided to present an aircraft that would enable business people to travel more conveniently and attend various meetings outside of the region before returning to the city for other activities.” He said.</p>
<p>AAL stands as the only company of its kind in the East African country. It boasts the only aircraft manufactured with commercial intent.</p>


<p><strong>What’s Next For AAL?</strong></p>
<p>According to the company, they are already working on a new aircraft called Skyleader 500, which will be a follow-up to Skyleader 600. Skyleader 500 according to the company is set to be completed by next year, 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike the Skyleader 600 which is meant for business purposes, the impending Skyleader 500 is intended for argricultural use as well as other rural commersial activities</p>
<p>According to the AAL director, a team of Tanzanian and Czech workers are working with the AAL to manufacture the Skyleader 500. It goes without saying that this business venture has provided employment opportunities for locals in the country.</p>


<p>David Grolic also noted that these aircraft are affordable and paying for one is comparable to paying for a car. They also have low operational costs, consume little energy, and are easily maintainable.</p>
<p>The director noted that the initial plan revolves around domestic sales before eventually pivoting to selling to the international market.</p>
