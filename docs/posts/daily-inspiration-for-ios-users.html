    <h1>Daily inspiration for iOS users</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>8 years ago, I wrote about <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2015/09/11/daily-inspiration-for-android-users/">my setup for sending myself daily reminders</a>—usually short quotes and principles that I wanted to influence my thinking and decision-making. It looked like this:</p>

<p>For 8 years that system has held strong, serving me well through many transitions in life (changing jobs, having kids, buying a house, and more).</p>
<p>This year, when it was time to retire my Android phone, I decided to try out iOS. The story behind that experiment is a post in itself, but one outcome was that I needed a new way to get my daily reminders.</p>
<p>I found several iOS apps that could do it but the prices were baffling. I’m happy to pay for apps I value, but a $19.99/yr subscription for standalone software to rotate quotes? Yeesh.</p>
<p>It took some digging but I finally found an app that was perfect for my use-case. It’s called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/yapp-reminders/id1437096658">Yapp Reminders</a>, and it looks like this:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Just click + to add reminders to your list, then add the widget to your home screen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A new quote is randomly chosen as often as you want (daily, in my case). The default settings and styles are good and everything is stored on the phone. *<em>chefs-kiss</em>*</p>
<p>I noticed that it would send me alerts when the quote changed, which felt a bit noisy to me. Eventually, I learned that I could turn those off by disabling alerts in <code>Settings &gt; Yapp &gt; Notifications</code>:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Note: it&#39;s important to leave &#34;Allow Notifications&#34; enabled, otherwise the widget quote will stop rotating.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve been using this setup for the past 2 weeks and I love it. I even set it up on the family iPad so I could send similar reminders to the kids.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/books/#atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear highlights the power of taking <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/962694722702790659">one-time actions that pay off again and again</a>. That’s what this is: a little daily nudge, helping me become the person I want to be.</p>
