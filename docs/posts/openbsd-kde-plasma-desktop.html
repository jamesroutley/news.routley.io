    <h1>OpenBSD KDE Plasma Desktop</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Happy New Year, hackers! I started the new year 2024 with a personal milestone of mine.
<a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank">
    The KDE Plasma 5.27</a> is available on OpenBSD -current and will be part of the next release 7.5.
I’m sure not very many people would understand how large this work. It started
so many years ago that I don’t even know how long I’ve been working on it.
Definitely years and not just 1 or 2. I remember that before I joined the OpenBSD community,
Vadim Zhukov did a lot of work in the Qt/KDE area. In the early days, it was
good to have someone to talk to, or just to know “you’re not alone”. This has
not been the case for a long time.  I’ve been doing it alone for years, just
like Vadim did it alone for years. It’s probably the burden of the project, we
are a super small team of OpenBSD kernel and ports developers.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that last year kn@ - Klemens Nanni helped with a lot of
reviews and thus made it possible that we have KDE as packages.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to wonder as I write. What happens now? What happen next? Do I
have plans? Sure I could just continue to maintain the whole thing.
What will definitely be interesting is the KDE switch from Qt5 to Qt6. This
should not be a big challenge for OpenBSD. All dependencies like all Qt6
modules are ported. So this will just be a task of hard work.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts on what we could work on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L91" target="_blank">
    Fix KWin compositor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/meta/kde/pkg/README-plasma#L68" target="_blank">
    KDE Wayland</a></li>
<li><a href="https://networkmanager.dev/docs/libnm/latest/" target="_blank">
    NetworkManager</a> (It’s based on glib and GObject. I don’t like it)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sddm/sddm" target="_blank">
    SDDM - QML based X11 and Wayland display manager </a> - Does that really still make sense?</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/discover/" target="_blank">
    Discover</a> support for pkg_add(1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it is normal that after such a big achievement, a period of reflection
begins. Let us be surprised what 2024 will bring.</p>

<p>You can super easy install KDE Plasma and KDE Gear on OpenBSD:</p>
