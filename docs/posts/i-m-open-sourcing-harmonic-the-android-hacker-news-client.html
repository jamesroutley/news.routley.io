<p>It’s the end of weeek 1 at RC. So far, I’ve definitely been doing some technical work — but a lot of the heavy lifting has been social, emotional, logistical. Figuring out <em>how to learn</em>, when nobody’s on your back, and you’re free to do whatever you want. Harder than I might have thought!</p>

<p>To that end, I got an unexpected little gift from a creative idol of mine.</p>

<p>When I’m not doing techy things, I’m reading David Milch’s autobiography, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Lifes-Work-A-Memoir/dp/B09RN7ZZWJ/">Life’s Work</a>. Loving it. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s a fan of Deadwood, or NYPD Blue, or American literature, or anyone who’s interested in hearing a flawed genius talk about his absolutely bonkers life. (Come for the inside scoop about TV show casts — stay to hear about his stint at an LSD factory in Mexico).</p>

<p>Milch has a lot to say about people learning to trust their gifts, even when they feel afraid. That was the main thrust of a writing course he taught at Yale in the early aughts.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re trying to pick up an unfamiliar skill, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It’s like when you’re learning how to drive. You get in the car and you’re filled with fear. […] and the thing you might feel is: “<strong>I’m the one who can’t do it.</strong> I’m never going to learn because it’s too much, it’s too many things.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Too much” and “too many things”. Maybe that sounds like what learning tech can feel like?</p>

<p>And that sentence — “I’m the one who can’t do it.” — is what grabs me. I think Milch is getting at something really profound, there.</p>

<p>In the abstract, most adults know <em>basically</em> how it goes to learn a new thing. You start, you suck at it, you practice, you practice, you practice, at some point you arrive at some measure of competence. That’s a model most of us have in our heads, I believe.</p>

<p>But sometimes at the beginning of things, I let a sense of overwhelm in through the door. I lose sight of that suck-practice-competence model. I arrive at the task, I suck at it, and I project that suckiness — against all logic, intuition, and experience — into the future. I suck and I will always suck.</p>

<p>Happens to me still when I bump up against a tough bug. Flub an algo problem. Let a sentence from a tech book slide through me, without the slightest bit of comprehension.</p>

<p>“I have no talent for this. I’m not just dim, but exceptionally dim. <strong>I’m the one who can’t do it</strong>.”</p>

<p>And there’s a sense of narcissism in that, isn’t there?</p>

<p>Why on earth should I believe that practice wouldn’t make me better? Singularly incapable of learning? It’s a ridiculous idea on its face. And there’s a lot of evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the phrase “iterative binary search” was meaningless gibberish to me. Now it’s a first-order intuition when I’m grinding away at my Leetcodes. Almost automatic. “Hello world” was once impossible for me. But at this point I’ve taught things to programmers, who have taught those things to other programmers.</p>

<p>Clearly, there’s been a little progress.</p>

<p>The challenge is to remember that all learning is sort of like that. The skills that seem impossibly opaque are actually obtainable, given we let go of this narrow, constrained view of our capabilities.</p>

<p>Borrowing from Milch again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our ideas about what we are, and what we can do, or want — those can change.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s a big part of the spirit of RC. A necessary pre-requisite for the institution’s goal — to make us “dramatically better programmers” — is for us, individually, to believe that we can become dramatically better programmers.</p>

<p>That notion is endlessly re-inforced at RC. From the organization’s dictums, the facilitators, the people I’ve paired with. It’s been wonderful, that way. An encouraging, expansive place to pick up new ideas about who we are and what we can do.</p>

<p>Excited to see what comes in week 2!</p>
