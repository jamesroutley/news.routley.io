<h3>The Documentation Book</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html">book</a> teachs how to make awesome documentation for your crate. 

</p><p>The standard Rust distribution ships with a tool called rustdoc. Its job is to generate documentation for Rust projects.
     On a fundamental level, Rustdoc takes as an argument either a crate root or a Markdown file, and produces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

     <h3>A Dedicated Book on the Rust compiler</h3>
<p>When you want to familiarise yourself with the knobs available in the Rust compiler, this <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html">book</a> is the one.

</p><p>Rustc is the compiler for the Rust programming language the project provides. Compilers take your source code 
    and produce binary code, either as a library or executable. </p>

    <h3>Rust Error Codes Index</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html">one</a> has an in-depth explanations of the errors you may see from the Rust compiler.</p><h3>The Unstable Book </h3>


<p>The Unstable <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/the-unstable-book.html">Book</a> consists of 
    a number of chapters, each one organised by a &#34;feature flag.&#34; </p>

    content on the last day. </p><h3>Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists</h3>



<p>In this <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists"></a>series, the author will teach you basic
     and advanced Rust programming entirely by having you implement six linked lists.This series will teach you the following
      in the process:
</p><ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><p>The different pointer types in Rust</p></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><p>Ownership, borrowing, inherited mutability, interior mutability, Copy</p></li>

    It is a Rust port of Haskell&#39;s Criterion library. Criterion.rs benchmarks collect and store statistical information 
    from run to run and can automatically detect performance regressions and measure optimisations.</p>



<h3>Learn by Running Algorithms</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust/blob/master/DIRECTORY.md">TheAlgorithms/Rust</a> repository on Github has most of the
     basic algorithms written in Rust under the following  categories: Backtracking, Big Integer, Ciphers,
      Compression, Data Structures, Dynamic Programming, General, Geometry, Graph, Math, Searching, Sorting, and String. </p><h3>Using Unsafe for Fun and Profit</h3>

<p>Given Rust&#39;s popularity and position as a systems programming language, you&#39;ll probably reach a point where you want to integrate
     a Rust module into some existing application. <a href="https://michael-f-bryan.github.io/rust-ffi-guide/print.html">This guide</a> was created to fill the current gap in knowledge when it comes
      to doing more in-depth Foreign Function Interface (FFI) tasks than simply calling one or two functions from a C library.</p>




<h3>Futures Explained in 200 Lines of Rust</h3>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example-driven approach, exploring why they&#39;re designed the way
     they are and how they work. The <a href="https://cfsamson.github.io/books-futures-explained/print.html">book</a>
        
 also takes a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency in programming.</p>



<h3>Rust and WebAssembly</h3>

<p>This small <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/print.html">book</a> describes how to use Rust and WebAssembly together.</p><h3>Rust Fuzz Book</h3>

<p><a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/print.html">Fuzz testing</a> is a software testing technique used to find security and stability issues
     by providing pseudo-random data as input to the software.</p><h3>The Rust Performance Book</h3>

<p>This <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/print.html">book</a> contains many techniques to improve Rust 
    programs&#39; performance—speed and memory usage. The Compile Times section also contains some techniques that will 
    improve the compile times of Rust programs. Some techniques only require changing build configurations, but many require changing code.</p>

<h3> Secure Rust Guidelines</h3>

<p>Rust is a multi-paradigm language with a focus on memory safety. 
    This <a href="https://anssi-fr.github.io/rust-guide/print.html">guideline</a> will help you see how to follow those guidelines to make a program worthy of
     Rust’s benefits in memory-safe software development. 





</p><h3>The Rustonomicon- Digging into the Dark Side of Unsafe Rust </h3>

</p><h3>Tour of Rust</h3>

<p>This is meant to be a step-by-step guide through the features of the Rust programming language. 
    Rust is often considered a language with a steep learning curve. Still, the developer of this <a href="https://tourofrust.com/index.html">interactive
        online</a> learning platform hopes to convince you there&#39;s much to explore before we even get to the complex parts.</p>

    <p>Before winding down the list of freely available learning materials for Rust programming,
       I would love to share my favourite - the Rust Language Cheat Sheet. </p>

<p>I have never seen a <a href="https://cheats.rs/">Cheat Sheet</a> that is so neat while being detailed and  
    concise at the same time. The Cheat Sheet contains clickable links to “The Rust Programming Language” book, 
    Examples, Std Docs, Nomicon, and Reference.</p>


    <p>Finally, I encourage you to read <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/">this</a> blog post 
      by Eli Bendersky, which talks about how he went about learning Rust programming language.</p>
    
    
     <p>There is also a piece of <a href="https://github.com/jondot/rust-how-do-i-start">collaborative advices</a> for those who want
       to start learning to program in Rust as a noob.
       It is a Github <a href="https://github.com/jondot/rust-how-do-i-start">repo</a> so anyone can contribute to and improve the curated
        list of advices, which I found useful in my early days of newbieness. </p>

        <p> I couldn’t recommend these two more. </p>
