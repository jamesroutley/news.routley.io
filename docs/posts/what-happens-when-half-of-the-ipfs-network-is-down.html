    <h1>What happens when half of the IPFS network is down?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----> <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>It depends on what type of system/network you’re running. In 90% of networks, or networked systems, this is a grand-scale disaster. Alerts are popping up everywhere, engineers go far beyond “day-time work” to get things back to normal, customers are panicking and potentially leaving the platform and the customer care lines are on fire. Half of the network is a large fraction, but I would bet that the same would happen even when 10% or 20% of the network experiences an outage.</p> <p>It’s not like that when you run your services on a decentralized, distributed P2P network, such as IPFS! At the beginning of 2023, a critical component of the IPFS network, namely the public IPFS DHT, experienced a large-scale incident. <em>During this incident, <a href="https://github.com/protocol/network-measurements/blob/master/reports/2023/calendar-week-04/ipfs/plots/crawl-unresponsive.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60% of the IPFS DHT Server nodes became unresponsive<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</em> Interestingly, <strong>no content became unreachable and almost nothing in the network looked like the majority of the network was basically down</strong>.

Basically, when a node would try to write to one of the unresponsive nodes, the unresponsive node would terminate the connection immediately.</p> <p>Given that these nodes seemed to be functional, they occupied several places in other nodes’ routing tables, when in fact they shouldn’t have.</p> <p>The problem came down to a misconfiguration of the go-libp2p resource manager - a new feature that shipped with <code>kubo-v0.17</code>. The problematic configuration which was applied manually (i.e. was not based on the default values of <code>kubo-v0.17</code>) was set to such values that any attempt to interact with the nodes would be flagged as a resource exhaustion event and would trigger the corresponding “defense” mechanism. In practice, this materialized as a connection tear-down. It is worth noting that <code>kubo</code> is the most prevalent IPFS implementation using the public IPFS DHT with ~80% of nodes in the DHT being <code>kubo</code> nodes (see most recent <a href="https://github.com/protocol/network-measurements/tree/master/reports/2023/calendar-week-17/ipfs#agent-version-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stats<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>).</p> <p>Content was still findable through kubo, so no alarms were raised.

It was at this time that we had a physical meeting of our engineering teams and one of the items on the agenda was to figure out where this error was coming from.</p> <h2 id="❓-diagnosis-what-was-happening"><a href="#❓-diagnosis-what-was-happening">#</a> ❓ Diagnosis: what was happening?</h2> <p>We quickly realized that <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there was a resource manager issue where the remote node was hitting a limit and closing the connection<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>. After looking into the details of the resource manager and the error itself (i.e., <code>cannot reserve **in**bound connection</code>), we realized that the root cause of the issue was related to the remote node. It turned out that the resource manager was manually misconfigured by a very large percentage of nodes to values that were not in the default configuration by the “vanilla” version of the resource manager that shipped with <code>kubo-v0.17</code>.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, the GET and PUT operations were completing successfully, so our next step was to identify the scale of the problem. Our main goals were to figure out:</p> <ul><li>what percentage of nodes in the network were affected</li> <li>if there was a performance penalty in either the PUT or the GET operation, or both</li></ul> <p>Through a combination of crawling the network and attempting connections to all ~50k DHT Server nodes (i.e., those that store and serve provider records and content), we found that close to 60% of the network had been affected by the misconfiguration. Clearly this was a very large percentage of the network, which made it urgent to look into the performance impact. We followed the below methodology:</p> <ol><li><p>We wanted to figure out which buckets in the nodes’ routing tables did the affected nodes occupy. We found that they occupied the higher buckets of the nodes’ routing tables, which meant that most likely PUTs would get slower, but GETs should not be affected too much. This is because the DHT lookup from the GET operation terminates when it hits <em>one</em> of the 20 closest peers to the target key, while the PUT operation terminates when it has found <em>all</em> the 20 closest peers. Since a significant portion of the network was unresponsive, the PUT operation hit at least one unresponsive node, but the GET operation had good chances of finding at least one responsive node within the 20 closest.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.ipfs.tech/assets/img/output.f139e8e4.png" alt="output.png" loading="lazy"/></p></li> <li><p>After further investigation and given the very large percentage of nodes that were affected by the resource manager misconfiguration, we started looking into the impact of the incident to the GET performance.</p> <p>A GET request that hits one of the affected, unresponsive nodes would get the connection shut down by the remote, but would get stuck there until it timed out, at which point it would re-issue the request to another peer. The relatively high concurrency factor of the IPFS DHT (<code>alpha = 10</code>) helps in this case, as it means that for any given request up to 10 concurrent requests can be in flight. This helps a lot even with a high percentage of unresponsive nodes as it means that at least one of the 10 peers contacted will respond.</p> <blockquote><p>This is because the DHT lookup from the GET operation terminates when it hits one of the 20 closest peers to the target key, when the PUT operation terminates when it has found all the 20 closest peers.</p></blockquote> </li> <li><p>To quantify the impact, we crawled the network and gathered the PeerIDs of unresponsive nodes. We set up six kubo nodes in several locations around the globe and attempted to: i) publish content (PUT), and, ii) retrieve content (GET) for two cases: 1) when interacting with all nodes in the network, and, 2) when ignoring all responses from the unresponsive peers, whose PeerIDs we knew and were cross-checking with in real time.</p> <ul><li>The results we found were as follows:
<ul><li>The PUT operation was slowed down by approximately 10%</li> <li>The GET operation was also disrupted (in contrast to our initial assumption) and was slowed down by approximately 15%, at times reaching closer to 20%.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p>We also experimented with even higher concurrency factors, in particular with <code>alpha = 20</code>, as a potential mitigation strategy. We repeated the same experiment with one extra set of runs: the case where we interact with all nodes in the network (i.e., we do not ignore unresponsive peers), but have higher concurrency factor.</p> </li></ol> <h2 id="🚑-mitigation-how-we-stopped-the-bleeding"><a href="#🚑-mitigation-how-we-stopped-the-bleeding">#</a> 🚑 Mitigation: how we stopped the bleeding.</h2> <p>The team’s immediate focus became:</p> <ol><li><a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/libp2p-resource-management.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding/updating documentation on Kubo’s resource manager integration<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a></li> <li>Triaging and responding to user questions/issues (<a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>)</li> <li>Preparing a new kubo release (<code>v0.18.1</code>), where the default settings for the resource manager were set to more appropriate values.

In IPFS, we use a variety of channels including the Discord Server [<a href="https://discord.gg/ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">invite link<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>], Filecoin Slack [<a href="https://filecoin.io/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">invite link<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>] (mostly in <code>#engres-ip-stewards</code> channel), the <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discourse discussion forum<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>, and the <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>🚀 Last, but certainly not least, the decentralized, P2P nature of IPFS kept the network running with all important operations completing successfully (albeit slower than normal). It is exactly because of the structure of the network that there are no single points of failure and performance is not catastrophically disrupted even when more than half of the network nodes are essentially unresponsive.</p></div> <!----></div></div>
