The policy was intended to reduce emissions, support farmers, and cut U.S. dependence on energy imports.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">As a result of the mandate, corn cultivation grew 8.7% and expanded into 6.9 million additional acres of land between 2008 and 2016, the study found. That led to widespread changes in land use, including the tilling of cropland that would otherwise have been retired or enrolled in conservation programs and the planting of existing cropland with more corn, the study found.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Tilling fields releases carbon stored in soil, while other farming activities, like applying nitrogen fertilizers, also produce emissions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">A 2019 <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17597269.2018.1546488" target="_blank">study</a> from the USDA, which has been broadly cited by the biofuel industry, found that ethanol’s carbon intensity was 39% lower than gasoline, in part because of carbon sequestration associated with planting new cropland.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">But that research underestimated the emissions impact of land conversion, Lark said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">USDA did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the nation&#39;s biofuel policy, is considering changes to the program. Under the RFS, Congress set blending requirements through 2022, but not beyond, giving the EPA authority to impose reforms.
