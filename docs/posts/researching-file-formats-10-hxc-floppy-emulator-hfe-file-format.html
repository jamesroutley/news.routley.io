    <h1>Researching file formats 10: HxC Floppy Emulator HFE File Format</h1>

<p><span>03 Nov 2023</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>My starting point for this format was <a href="https://hxc2001.com/download/floppy_drive_emulator/SDCard_HxC_Floppy_Emulator_HFE_file_format.pdf">this PDF</a> (with a sweet logo). And I spent a lot of time <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=279138&amp;sid=33f74a30d3a0dfb1c2581a3129a99f80#p279138">deep in the forums</a> on this one.</p>

<p>It was nice to see a forum (and associated discords) be so active on the topic of floppy disk emulation – I had no idea, the reach. Maybe because it’s relatively simple and accessible to get into? Maybe because people really love games? I don’t know.</p>

<p>So, this format. This format has a 1.5-page PDF as a specification, which a lot of people question as being thorough enough to be a real format. It is pretty slim, yeah.</p>

<p>There’s also the question of versions: The decades-old PDF on the website is a version 1.1. There’s an unlisted version 1.0, allegedly a version 2, and there’s a more-commonly-used version 3 that is only documented in the source code (and that’s cannon – from the format author). Oh, and there’s a HFE stream format, too. So that was the big challenge with this format, a lack of clarity and the profound unhelpfulness at being told to “just look at the source code”, which, in my expert opinion, doesn’t have the answers that a well-written specification document would provide (especially when neither the source specification <em>nor</em> code is very clear).</p>

<p>Yeah, perhaps a short entry here – I don’t have too much to say on this one except if you want to know more, you’ll just have to read the source. ;)</p>

<p>The next two posts will also be about floppy emulation formats, stay tuned for MOOF and Kryoflux! But don’t get too excited, because I will still be grumpy about the whole format set.</p>
