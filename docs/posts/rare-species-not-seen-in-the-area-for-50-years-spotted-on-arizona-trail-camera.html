</div><p>To ensure her trail cameras would stay operational during the hot Arizona summer, researcher Kinley Ragan trekked to 23 of them.</p>


										      
																																	<p>At each, Ragan, a field research project manager with the Phoenix Zoo, checked the camera&#39;s batteries and SD card, as well as ensured the camera was angled at an optimal position, Ragan told McClatchy News in an Aug. 12 phone interview.</p>
<p>She was flipping through the last of 100 videos on one of the camera&#39;s SD cards during her July trip to the Atascosa Highlands area when something caught her eye.</p>
<p>&#34;At the very, very end, I saw (an) ocelot,&#34; Ragan said.</p>
<p>The June 12 footage shows an ocelot walk across the screen before stopping and standing on a rock.</p>
<p>&#34;I was in disbelief at first, watching the video over and over again,&#34; Ragan said in an Aug. 12 zoo news release, &#34;but soon a big smile spread across my face as the full impact of this discovery for the important region set in.&#34;</p>
<p>This was the first time an ocelot has been seen &#34;in the Atascosa Highlands region in at least 50 years,&#34; the zoo said.</p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s super exciting news,&#34; Ragan said, adding that the sighting leaves her &#34;hopeful.&#34;</p>
<h2>Wildlife study</h2>
<p>The zoo set up 50 cameras across the area in April as part of the Atascosa Complex Wildlife Study, Ragan said.</p>
<p>The area, &#34;which includes the Atascosa, Tumac√°cori, and Pajarito mountains,&#34; is understudied, the zoo said.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re looking to better understand medium and large mammals and how they&#39;re moving and existing within this important wildlife corridor,&#34; Ragan said.</p>
<p>While the team was hopeful one of the cameras, which will remain in place until October 2025, would pick up an ocelot, they were unsure.</p>
<p>&#34;There hadn&#39;t been research done there in 10 years and there hadn&#39;t been a record in 50 years,&#34; Ragan said. &#34;So we weren&#39;t sure, but we were really happy when we did get this record.&#34;</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>&#39;A new cat&#39;</h2>
<p>In the past decade, another ocelot, named Lil&#39; Jefe, has been spotted roaming in the state, the Arizona Republic reported.</p>
<p>The recently spotted feline, however, &#34;is a new cat not previously seen in the state,&#34; the zoo said.</p>
<p>&#34;(Arizona Game and Fish Department) has conducted a pelage spot analysis comparing this ocelot with the current known ocelot in the state, as well as previous ocelots and concludes that this is indeed a new ocelot,&#34; Tracy McCarthey with AZGFD said in the release.</p>
<p>Across their entire range, from South America to the United States, the ocelot population is decreasing, but they are listed as &#34;least concern&#34; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, according to Ragan.</p>
<p>&#34;However, in Arizona, they are critically endangered, and they&#39;re also endangered in Mexico,&#34; Ragan said.</p>
<p>Some threats to the species&#39; survival &#34;include habitat fragmentation and loss,&#34; according to the zoo.</p>
<p>While many associate the ocelot with &#34;rain forests and maybe South America or Central America,&#34; the felines do roam all the way north into Arizona and Texas, Ragan said.</p>
<p>&#34;They are known to be in these drier climates as well, just less common,&#34; Ragan said.</p>
<p>The cats, small to medium in size, are spotted, according to Ragan.</p>
<p>&#34;All their spots are unique to each individual,&#34; Ragan said, &#34;so you can identify an ocelot based on unique spot patterns.&#34;</p>
<h2>&#39;A lot more questions&#39;</h2>
<p>With the &#34;<a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+species/" rel="tag">rare species</a>,&#34; Ragan said she hopes the study can help better understand the animal.</p>
<p>Ragan said she plans to trek back out to check the remaining trail cameras at the end of August, when she may possibly get more answers.</p>
<p>&#34;We basically just have a lot more questions now,&#34; Ragan said. &#34;All great things, but more work to be done for sure.&#34;</p>
