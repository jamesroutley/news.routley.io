    <h1>Ask HN: What is the best jurisdiction for internationally distributed teams?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>This question is inspired by: &#34;How I would start my next startup in Germany without a GmbH (2020)&#34; (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31601638)<p>Say you want to set up a startup and the founders live in Germany, the US, Australia and Singapore. Your team will be fully remote from day one.</p><p>You are looking for a solution where</p><p>- the company is fully operational within days or weeks and can be set up without all founders having to come together in person</p><p>- day to day business can managed remotely (e.g. together with local tax advisor / lawyer)</p><p>- the jurisdiction has a solid good reputation</p><p>- the legal frameworks are understood and accepted by US / EU investors and VCs</p><p>- complying with all requirements around hiring employees is not too much of a burden</p><p>- official language of documents is English</p><p>- you have a good framework for rewarding employees with equity</p><p>Where would you incorporate and why?</p><p>I&#39;ve looked into the US (obviously..), UK, Cayman (I know YC allows Cayman legal entities), Hong Kong, Cyprus etc. and see at lot of pros and cons for each option.</p><p>If you&#39;ve gone through the process, can you share some insights and whether you&#39;d do it again this way?</p></div></div>
