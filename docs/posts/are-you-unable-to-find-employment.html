    <h1>Ask HN: Are you unable to find employment?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am seeing many anecdotal experiences shared online on various platforms stating that it is difficult to find employment in tech. I myself have had a difficult time landing an interview over the last year despite having two decades of experience.</p><p>I am attempting to gain some insight into the issue. My situation is somewhat unique in that I am self-taught without a CS degree. I&#39;m a very experienced, diligent worker, etc, but an algorithm doesn&#39;t care about this and so getting through the filters is difficult.</p><p>However I see many discussions being posted (primarily on X) stating that it is nearly impossible for people with CS degrees (especially white males) to get an interview let alone a job. There have been mass layoffs, less money being invested etc. 
Many people have claimed AI is taking jobs, or that there aren&#39;t as many jobs available, yet at the same time, Elon Musk and others claim there is an engineer shortage and we must increase the number of H-1B visas in order to fill this gap. When I apply to a position on linkedin I can see that even the most Jr positions have over 100 applicants.</p><p>I know that X can be slanted, and really anything posted online must be taken with a grain of salt - but I&#39;m seeing many people claiming to be in the same situation as myself, and most of them claim to be white males.</p><p>Furthermore, in the last two years I experienced two layoffs. In both situations it was white males let go in favor of Indian and KZ foreigners. Again - this is anecdotal and could be a coincidence, but its awfully telling that Vivek and Elon are calling American tech workers uncultured, lazy and stupid in the wake of these experiences and those that I&#39;ve read about online.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to start a war here on hackernews, but I&#39;m looking for people&#39;s personal experiences. Do they match up? Are you having a hard time finding employment? Have you been fired in favor of foreign workers? Is this racism / ageism / sexism at play or is that being overblown by political actors?</p></div></div></div>
