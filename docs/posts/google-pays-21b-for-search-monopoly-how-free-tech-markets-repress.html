    <h1>Google Pays $21B for Search Monopoly: How &#34;Free&#34; Tech Markets Repress</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Google has built a huge monopoly - one that is finally being investigated at by the US Department of Justice. It
now became public that Google paid $21 Billion in 2021 alone to keep its search engine market share of staggering 90%. This is just a glimpse
of how much your data and attention is worth to Google. It&#39;s about time that we take back our data!
</p><div><div><h2 id="google-search-monopoly-about-to-end">Google Search Monopoly About to End?</h2>
<p>If you have purchased a new technological device with an internet browser, it may come as no surprise when you first open a
browser to search and are greeted with the well-known multicolored G logo over a white background.</p>
<p><strong>Recent reports have shown that Google search
holds a startling 90% market share against all other search engines.</strong></p>
<p>This status has landed them in hot water and an ongoing
Department of Justice investigation into Google&#39;s business practices revealed that in 2021 <strong>Google paid Apple alone over
$18 Billion USD to be the default search engine in iOS</strong>, and a total of $21 Billion USD to other companies to make sure that
it came pre-installed across multiple browsers and devices.</p>
<p>That first initial search, even if it is for an alternative search
engine like DuckDuckGo, if launched through Google Search displays ads and in turn generates profits for Alphabet. This may
not seem like a big deal, but if every initial search generates revenue, the global market for that first single search is
immense. With margins like this at stake, it is clear why Google stoops to anti-competitive business practices in order
to stack the deck in their favor. In addition, most people will never change the pre-installed search engine.</p>
<p>This kind of practice isn&#39;t new to tech and in the early 1990&#39;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">US government took Microsoft to trial</a> with particular
emphasis on their antitrust behaviour in bundling Internet Explorer in their Windows operating system, claiming that this took steps to prevent
competition in the growing &#34;Browser Wars&#34;. If this practice warranted major litigation against Microsoft, then there is
no reason that Google&#39;s paid positioning of their product on third-party devices should justify the same type of inquiry.</p>
<p>Luckily, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Google_LLC_(2023)">United States vs Google LLC.</a>
case was opened in October 2020 and after three years we are finally seeing the
heads of Google having to testify in court and how they attempt to justify their business practices.</p>
<p>This is not the first investigation for Google, of course. In the EU, there&#39;s an ongoing debate whether
<a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/is-google-analytics-illegal">Google Analytics can be legally used by EU companies</a>; here it is not about
monopolistic issues, but whether using Google Analytics violates the European privacy regulation GDPR.</p>

<em>Everyone knows that Google is the No 1 search engine. But now we will find out that its not due to its great results, but simply because Alphabet pays to be the default.</em></p>
<h3 id="anti-competition-hurts-markets">Anti-Competition Hurts Markets</h3>
<p>Google operates primarily from its Googleplex epicenter in Mountain View, California. The business mantra of the United
States is that free markets are the only way the economy can continue to generate profits and allow for continued growth.
Unfortunately, Big Tech along with major companies operating within the Finance, Industry, and Real Estate (FIRE) industries
have discovered <strong>the advantages of abandoning free market competition in favor of pushing for shared monopoly markets, and so has Google</strong>. This is easy
to see in the field of smart phones. Which operating system would you like to purchase? <strong>You of course have choices as a consumer,
between two parties Apple or Android. Are you thirsty? Why not choose between a Pepsi or a Coke?!</strong> Yes, there are other great
alternatives like GrapheneOS (built on Android) but they can only operate on a donation model and, due to the dominant presence
of Google&#39;s Android, stand no chance to make headway against the tech giant.</p>
<p>There is a long standing practice in the tech industry of <strong>buying out competition</strong> instead of allowing them to grow. This
practice effectively snubs out market threats while not requiring the larger company to make any major changes in offering a
better product, major innovation, or lowering their prices. Google&#39;s monopoly style approach to business is not new, but
the step of actively bribing other hardware and software manufacturers to pushing their product stifles innovation and
prevents alternative search engines which may not have as deep pockets from being offered a seat at the table.</p>
<p>This moves beyond pushing to influence the behavior of other for-profit companies, even <strong>Firefox which is developed and
supported by the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit, ships with Google - the monopolist - as the default search provider</strong>.</p>
<p>You can of course
change this under the settings options - even when using Android or Google Chrome. But let&#39;s be honest: Who changes the default
search engine after
purchasing a new device?</p>
<p>However, if you think the fact that these options are available makes this court case
moot, you need to honestly ask yourself: would your less-technically capable family or friends know how to access the settings to
look for alternative search engine and replace Google with something else?</p>
<p><strong>There are also many alternative ringtones for iOS calls and message notifications, but
how often do you hear those default pings when your out and about?</strong></p>
<p>Just having the option to change the deaulft is something else entirely than offering a different default or making people
pick their preferences upon launching a new device.</p>

<h3 id="anti-competition-hurts-customers">Anti-Competition Hurts Customers</h3>
<p>Not only do these monopolistic practices harm the natural development of innovation within the tech industry, but
they also shift corporate goals with many startups not seeking to become their own large business themselves, but become
noticable enough that Google buys them out. In these cases Google has positioned themselves as a major customer whose
interests far outweigh those of the average personal customer who may be looking to purchase a product.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond providing a search function Google Search has turned you the customer into a product for advertising.</strong></p>
<p>Your data
does not stay with Google. You receive a nice list of potential dinner recipes while Google sells your personal data
to advertising agencies. This can include your sex, gender, age, location, not to mention any information gathered
from your search history. The internet should not be this way.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-of-competition-is-necessary-for-freedom-of-speech">Freedom of Competition is Necessary for Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>Google is a business, and its search function operates in a way that generates revenue, which can lead to users
becoming digitally isolated in what Eli Pariser termed a &#34;Filter Bubble&#34;. If you are logged into a Google account
while searching, the search results will be catered to your personal interest which can have devastating consequences.
This kind of algorithm can effectively split a populus and result in parallel echo chambers which prevent proper dialogue
over shared sources of information.</p>
<p>These practices not only put the customer at a disadvantage due to the vendor lock-in that they find themselves living in,
but it also has major impacts on the freedom of speech for internet users. If Google Search accounts for 90% of web searches
worldwide, than these users are subject to the content policies which best fit the philosophy and ultimate profit goals of
Alphabet. <strong>If a single corporate entity is solely responsible for the information that the public receives, there is a fine
line to how this information is presented without having negative consequences in the function of democratic societies.</strong></p>
<p>If
Google were to decide one day that some kind of story shouldn&#39;t be presented in search queries, that would mean 90% of
internet searches would not provide links to this information. This isn&#39;t a dystopian paranoia either, when presented
with such requests at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Google willingly bends over backwards to remove
historical information from searches that have been deemed harmful to the image of the CCP.</p>
<p>Not only does this type of practice and Google&#39;s monopoly harm our freedom of speech, even our language itself cannot escape the massive
presence of Google with the name itself becoming synonymous with &#34;to look up&#34; or &#34;search&#34;.</p>
<p>In the end, these issues would not magically go away if the US courts actually break up Google&#39;s monopolistic power. But at least
less-problematic alternative search engines would finally get a chance of becoming mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="break-free-of-big-tech">Break Free of Big Tech</h3>
<p>If you are looking to break free of Google&#39;s monopoly as a search engine, there are some great alternatives to
choose from. To name a quick few, we recommend you check out DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.</p>
<h4 id="duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</h4>
<p><img height="237" width="300" alt="Logo of DuckDuckGo search engine - a popular Google alternative" src="https://tutanota.com/blog/images/DuckDuckGo_logo.png"/></p><p>DuckDuckGo (DDG) has built itself to be a major player in the search engine space. They are now offered in the settings menus from many browsers by default
and can be set as your primary search engine. At DuckDuckGo your privacy matters and they cater their searches with this in mind. They also offer
their own browser with great built-in privacy tools and can also provide @duck.com email address aliases which play well with your secure Tutanota account.
I, myself, use DDG as my primary search engine and I can full-heartedly recommend them.</p>
<h4 id="ecosia">Ecosia</h4>
<p><img height="101" width="400" alt="Logo of Ecosia - a Google search alternative from Germany focussing on sustainability" src="https://tutanota.com/blog/images/Logo_Ecosia_2022.png"/></p><p>Ecosia is a German-based search engine which rose to fame with their eco-friendly image. Your searches are funded by ad revenue, but a chunk
of this revenue is spent planting trees, over 185 million at the time of writing, and promoting other climate friendly causes. The registered
B-Corp combines search results from Yahoo, Bing, and Wikipedia to provide you with accurate results while supporting a great cause.
They have also made their way to the status of being a major player and can be manually added as a default search engine in Chrome, Safari, and Brave Browser.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Only time will tell how the US judicial inquiry into Google&#39;s monopoly in the search market plays out, but we as consumers can
already take steps to push back against Google
and other Big Tech monopolies by utilizing some of the great privacy-first alternatives. Check out some of our search
engine recommendations, why not use LibreOffice instead of <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/microsoft-office-365-email-alternative">Microsoft&#39;s telemetry ridden office suite</a>, and of course
you can always exchange the <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/google-calendar-alternative">Google calendar with Tutanota</a> and drop Gmail by <a href="https://tutanota.com/">creating your secure Tutanota account</a>!</p>
