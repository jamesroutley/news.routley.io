    <h1>Dusa Programming Language (Finite-Choice Logic Programming)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Dusa is a logic programming language designed by
<a href="https://typesafety.net/rob/">Rob Simmons</a> and
<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/cmartens/">Chris Martens</a>,
the first implementation of finite-choice logic programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve heard of Datalog (as implemented in systems like
<a href="https://souffle-lang.github.io/program">Soufflé</a>), you may want to start by
reading about how <a href="https://dusa.rocks/docs/introductions/datalog/">Dusa is datalog</a>.</li>
<li>If you’ve heard of answer set programming (as implemented in systems
like <a href="https://potassco.org/">Potassco</a>), you may want to start by reading
about how <a href="https://dusa.rocks/docs/introductions/asp/">Dusa is answer set programming</a>.</li>
<li>If you have no familarity with either of these, that’s okay too! You may
want to start by reading about how
<a href="https://dusa.rocks/docs/introductions/graph/">Dusa is a graph exploration language</a>.
Then you can take a look at some of the other introductions, or
<a href="https://dusa.rocks/">fiddle with some of the default examples</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re interested in the mathematics of finite-choice logic programming,
the paper
<a href="https://popl25.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2025-popl-research-papers/13/Finite-Choice-Logic-Programming">Finite-Choice Logic Programming</a>
by Martens, Simmons, and Michael Arntzenius may be of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to use Dusa is in our <a href="https://dusa.rocks/">web editor</a>.
Dusa is also available as a command-line utility and JavaScript API via the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dusa">Node package manager</a>.</p> </div></div>
