She had told him she was living on ‘survival mode - I can’t think oh let’s do something nice’. This prompted the Labour leader to reflect in his speech on the importance of ‘the little things we love…days out, meals out, holidays’ and to warn against policy decisions that ‘whittle away at our joy’.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Two years on, another Labour Conference looms, with very different mood music.</strong> Commitments to boost economic growth fill every Government announcement, with Ministers repeatedly pledging that growth is ‘</span><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-09-16/debates/975343b0-43fd-4b46-83df-81b8eb73997c/WrittenStatements" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>the Government’s foremost priority</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">’. Every Ministerial decision is viewed through the prism of growth; policies thought capable of increasing GDP are backed, whatever the wider costs may be. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A particular weight is being placed on unrestricted building as an engine of growth, with </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-fv0z5t6sh"><span lang="EN-GB">Housing Secretary Steve Reed <u>pledging</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> this week to </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">‘tear down all the barriers to development’</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">.

Given that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has accused </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/chancellor-rachel-reeves-bill-house-of-lords-government-b2793853.html" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>snails</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-vows-to-go-further-and-faster-to-kickstart-economic-growth" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>bats and newts</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> as being ‘blockers’ and wanted the already nature-damaging </span><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/planning-and-infrastructure-england-bill" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>Planning and Infrastructure Bill</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> to go further, speculation is rife that these potentially-soon-to-be-torn down barriers could include the laws that protect wildlife.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Aside from being a colossal environmental mistake, such a step would mark a final break with the sentiments Keir Starmer expressed just two years ago. <strong>Environmental regulations don’t just protect wildlife; they safeguard people’s enjoyment of it</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The </span><a href="https://www.wcl.org.uk/docs/Link%20briefing%20on%20Habs%20Regs%20risks%20and%20opportunities%20Jan%202023.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">Habitats Regulations</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, our most effective and value for money nature laws, provide a good example. The regulations have protected some of our most precious and threatened wildlife for decades. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span lang="EN-GB">Walking amidst the butterflies in Epping Forest, spotting seals on Norfolk beaches, catching the flash of a kingfisher in the Fens – all these experiences, and so many more, are enjoyed because the Habitats Regulations are there. These and other environmental regulations are the guarantors of little, wild joys that enrich the lives of millions every day. </span><span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The public are crystal clear about how much they cherish these wild joys:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wcl.org.uk/docs/The%20economic%20costs%20of%20the%20Retained%20EU%20Law%20Bill%2018.01.22.pdf" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>Research</u> by Wildlife and Countryside Link</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and eftec has suggested that when people are asked to put a monetary value on the benefits provided by the Habitats Regulations, it comes to over £1 billion.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/blog/dom-higgins/nature-doorstep-right-not-luxury"><span lang="EN-GB">The Wildlife Trusts’ <u>work</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> shows rising public interest in the health aspect of these benefits, in how time spent in wildlife-rich boosts mental and physical wellbeing.</span></li>

These high numbers were shared across the political spectrum; in an age of division, our appreciation of nature brings people together.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>A hacking down of nature regulations would loosen the ties that bind us and cut into our shared budget for joy</strong>.</span></p>

          <div><div><h2><span lang="EN-GB">Environmental deregulation will not lead to economic growth</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Westminster lobbyists who keep up a constant drumbeat demanding cuts to ‘red tape’ make a professional virtue of short political memories. They overlook the fact that environmental deregulation has been tried repeatedly over the past two decades, with economic results that range from negligible to disastrous.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Liz Truss’s tenure as Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2014 to 2016 provides an illustrative example. She pursued an explicitly deregulatory agenda, boasting of cutting red tape by </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/elizabeth-truss-speech-at-national-farmers-union-conference" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>reducing farm inspections</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-environment-agency-cuts-sewage-water-pollution" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>trimming down regulators</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> overseen by Defra in order to ‘make savings as a department’. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Cuts included an £80 million</span><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/liz-truss-environment-agency-budget-cuts-resulted-in-doubled-sewage-discharge-labour-claims-12679570" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u> reduction</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> in the budget the Environment Agency relied on for sewage monitoring. The fact that regulations had been put in place and regulators given responsibilities by previous Parliaments for good reasons were disregarded; deregulation was the priority.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">With the benefit of a decade’s hindsight we can see how these decisions contributed to the sewage and agricultural pollution crisis in our rivers, a crisis that has shaken the fiscal foundations of the water sector and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/treasury-threatens-defra-with-4bn-bill-if-thames-water-nationalised" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>risks</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/treasury-threatens-defra-with-4bn-bill-if-thames-water-nationalised"><span lang="EN-GB">billions of pounds of taxpayer money</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> being used for bailouts. </span><span> </span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">Environmental crisis events can lead to serious economic disruption</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">With </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-ministers-cut-green-quangos-6vs8crrqz"><span lang="EN-GB">The Times </span></a><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-ministers-cut-green-quangos-6vs8crrqz" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>reporting</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> that the new Defra Secretary of State, Emma Reynolds, has been asked by the Chancellor to do more to ‘cut back on red tape’ and rein in the regulators in her department, the Truss era constitutes a warning beacon. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Regulations and their implementation can of course be improved, but previous all-out assaults on environmental regulation have failed to produce good economic results</strong>. ‘Green tape’ has an important economic function, to provide stability and prevent environmental crisis events which can cause serious economic disruption. As Liz Truss showed with water regulation, the short-term rush of deregulation can lead to a long and costly hangover.</span><span> </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>The Wildlife Trusts will be at Labour Conference next week to provide this warning. We will urge Emma Reynolds at Defra and Steve Reed at MHCLG not to heed the siren voices calling for the weakening of environmental regulations and regulators, and to reject the false premise that environmental sacrifice will magically conjure up economic growth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">With rumours that the Planning and Infrastructure Bill could be shortly amended to </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/history/article/plan-to-water-down-laws-protecting-national-parks-branded-outrageous-prwhvdm7l"><span lang="EN-GB">weaken protections for National Parks</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, making the Bill even more worrying for nature, this message is urgent. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Most of all, we will remind Ministers of the wisdom of their leader’s 2023 speech. The little joys in life matter, including the wild ones – the family days out in nature reserves, the picnics at scenic spots, the holidays in National Parks. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">An attack on nature regulations is an attack on the safeguards that make these happy days possible. With every diminishment of these wildlife-protecting, happiness-giving environmental regulations, a little bit more of our collective joy is whittled away. </span><span> </span></p>
