The company informed the senator’s office at the time that it obtained “netflow data from third parties in exchange for threat intelligence.” </p><p>Citing a source granted anonymity to speak candidly about industry practices, Motherboard reported that Team Cymru’s clients were given access to a dataset, through which they could “run queries against virtually any IP to pull the netflows to and from that IP over a given point in time.” </p><p>This reportedly includes the ability to follow traffic through virtual private networks (VPN), services used by some users to browse the internet more privately. </p><p>According to Wyden, public contracting records have confirmed the military’s use of a tool called Augury, which provides “petabytes” of network data “from over 500 collection points worldwide.” At least “100 billion new records,” are collected each day, including email and web browsing data.</p><p>Wyden said the tool is offered by the contractor Argonne Ridge Group, which shares “the same corporate address” as Team Cymru, with which Argonne also has “overlapping corporate officers.” He added that records show Argonne has secured contracts with U.S. Cyber Command, the Army, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Secret Service.</p><p>The Defense Intelligence Agency, Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also named in the letter. Wyden’s investigation of the government’s purchases is ongoing.</p><p>The revelations sparked concern from leading rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which told Gizmodo that greater transparency is needed to understand just how government agencies are using this information. </p><p>“Web-browsing records can reveal extremely sensitive information about who we are and what we’re reading online,” Patrick Toomey, Deputy Director of the ACLU National Security Project, said in an email to Gizmodo. “We need to know far more about how military and law enforcement agencies are exploiting their warrantless access to our private information.”</p><p>In an email, a Team Cymru spokesperson claimed that <!-- -->the news reports about its government contracts are “false and misleading,” and said the “allegations” concerning its software’s capabilities are<!-- --> “baseless.” (The spokesperson did not specify which claims they believe are false, nor provide any further details about its product to correct the record.)</p><p>Spokespersons for CBP and the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A military spokesperson is directing all questions to the DoD’s inspector general’s office. We are awaiting a response.</p><p>The news comes as several federal lawmakers are working to investigate the U.S. government’s acquisition of data that agencies would otherwise require a warrant to obtain. Last month, two top Democrats in the House of Representatives — Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Bennie Thompson — demanded the FBI and DHS disclose details of alleged data purchases that revealing internet browsing activity and users’ precise locations.<br/></p><p>While a Supreme Court decision in 2018 held that the government cannot acquire sensitive location data without a warrant, several government agencies are accused of choosing to interpret the decision narrowly, exempting data that — rather than being demanded — is commercially acquired. In other words, the government is <em>literally</em> buying its way around the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Federal agencies are not the only ones doing so. On Friday, Rep. Anna Eshoo asked the Federal Trade Commission to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://gizmodo.com/congresswoman-ftc-to-investigate-fog-data-science-softw-1849547432&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/congresswoman-ftc-to-investigate-fog-data-science-softw-1849547432">investigate newly revealed police software</a></span>, known as Fog Reveal, which allows law enforcement agencies to map the movements of Americans “months back in time.” That service relies not on netflow data, but location data culled from hundreds of consumer apps, purportedly for advertising purposes.</p><p>“Consumers do not realize that they are potentially nullifying their Fourth Amendment rights when they download and use free apps on their phones,” Eshoo said. “It would be hard to imagine consumers consenting to this if actually given the option, yet this is functionally what occurs.”</p><p><em>Update 9:45 p.m.: Added a comment from Team Cymru.</em></p></div></div>
