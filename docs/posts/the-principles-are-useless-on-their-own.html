        <p>I shared this on Twitter recently, and have had a bunch of people ask me for more details - so here they are!</p><p>Just a heads up that this is pretty image-heavy, in case you&#39;re on a limited data plan.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And itâ€™s done! An evening will spent ðŸ¥° <a href="https://t.co/8laW5muXSp">pic.twitter.com/8laW5muXSp</a></p>â€” Ellie Huxtable (@ellie_huxtable) <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable/status/1492989732002877443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2022</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>I&#39;ve always been the sort of person who struggles to do <em>anything</em> without some sort of music going on in the background. A long time ago this was with a little mp3 player, then an iPod, and eventually on to a phone with Spotify. </p><p>I realised something not so long ago - I was being very lazy. I&#39;d often just play my weekly/daily mix, or some playlist I made up a long time ago. I&#39;d never really <strong>think</strong> about what music I liked + what music I wanted to listen to. I think this is in part due to the fact that almost any music was available - which made choosing even more difficult.</p><p>Anyway. Over the weekend I took apart a 5.5th gen iPod Classic (or iPod Video) and made it suit 2022 a little better :D </p><p>I won&#39;t be detailing precisely how I did it. I mostly followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPod_5th_Generation_%28Video%29">iFixit</a>, and fumbled my way through the rest. Almost all of the cables can be removed by lifting a little black lever, and are equally as easy to replace. I&#39;d recommend ordering some iPod tools :)</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1472.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1472.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1472.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1472.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1472.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Example connections, can you spot the little lever?</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-ipod">The iPod</h2><p>I went with a 5.5 for a few reasons. Firstly, the front is plastic. I was going to be replacing the front anyway, so it might as well be easy to open!</p><p>Secondly, and most importantly - the DAC. This generation of iPod was the last to feature the &#34;wolfson DAC&#34;, which is very well known for being <a href="https://www.macintoshhowto.com/ipod/which-ipod-has-the-best-audio-quality.html/2">of fantastic quality</a>.</p><p>Something else to be aware of is that different models of this iPod had different amounts of memory. The 80GB has 64mb of memory, while smaller capacities have only 32mb. I went with the 80GB :)</p><h3 id="the-components">The components</h3><p>I ordered a bunch of components for this, as I knew pretty much exactly what I wanted. The vast majority of them were found on eBay, where there is a LOT of choice. If there&#39;s anything specific, I&#39;ll link it</p><h3 id="opening">Opening </h3><p>Opening the iPod was made fairly simple with the iPod tools. After working my way around the casing, it just popped open. iFixit had good instructions there!</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1467.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1467.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1467.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1467.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1467.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Two halfs of the iPod, perhaps not opened for 16 years?</figcaption></figure><h3 id="storage">Storage</h3><p>First and foremost, storage. 80GB is definitely not enough for what I want. The original iPod also used a HDD - ideally I&#39;d be swapping this out for something solid state. </p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/camphoto_1483920592.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/camphoto_1483920592.jpg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/camphoto_1483920592.jpg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/camphoto_1483920592.jpg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/camphoto_1483920592.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The old HDD, look how big it is! It was surrounded in rubber vibration-dampening stuff</figcaption></figure><p>There&#39;s a lot of choice here, but I went with an <a href="https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-quad/">iFlash Quad</a>. This lets you use up to four SD cards! There&#39;s no real performance difference here compared to other storage options, as it&#39;s pretty limited regardless. In addition, SD cards use less power + put out less heat than the comparable SSDs.</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1483.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1483.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1483.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1483.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1483.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The iFlash, complete with 2x512GB SD cards</figcaption></figure><p>This is also thinner than the HDD, allowing you to fit a larger battery or other mods into the chassis.</p><p>Something to be aware of is that the original iPod firmware can struggle with the larger capacity drives, so you will probably need something like <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>. Bear in mind that Rockbox can have issues with the iFlash hardware, so you may need to run a daily build (or transfer your music<a href="https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/Main/IpodFAQ#How_do_I_start_the_original_Apple_Firmware_63"> while booted into the original firmware</a>)</p><h3 id="battery">Battery</h3><p>You can find a LOT of batteries on eBay and other places online, so I won&#39;t really say much about that here. I went with a 3000mah :)</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1481.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1481.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1481.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1481.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1481.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The old battery! It&#39;s pretty small.</figcaption></figure><p>The battery is one of the first things you need to unplug, as otherwise you can&#39;t fully open the iPod. Attemping to open without unplugging will result in broken cables!</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1465.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1465.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1465.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1465.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1465.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The battery cable, plugged in</figcaption></figure><h3 id="front-casing">Front casing</h3><p>I bought a clear front casing for mine, as I like seeing the guts of my gadgets! Installing this was more fiddly than I expected. Once taken apart, there were six super tiny screws along the edge of the chassis that needed removing. From there, the front comes off - the iPod scroll wheel is actually just resting in place. So if you&#39;re not careful, it kinda flops about! As does the display</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1477.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1477.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1477.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1477.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1477.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The front casing, separated from the frame. You can see the tiny screw holes there</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1480.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1480.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1480.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1480.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1480.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Sans front, and sans screen. I was originally going to do some more mods, but then decided to leave the logic board in place. You can also see the teeny screws in the background</figcaption></figure><h3 id="rear-casing">Rear casing</h3><p>A small detail I wanted to change was the capacity written on the back. After all, it&#39;s not 80GB any more. Also found on eBay, I bought a new rear casing</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/camphoto_351212254.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/camphoto_351212254.jpg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/camphoto_351212254.jpg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/camphoto_351212254.jpg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/camphoto_351212254.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Spot the 1TB!</figcaption></figure><p>The issue with this is that the headphone jack and hold switch also needed transferring across. This wasn&#39;t too difficult in the end, though a little fiddly + I had to be very careful with the cables as they are fragile</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1482.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1482.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1482.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1482.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1482.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The headphone jack and hold switch, in their old back casing</figcaption></figure><h3 id="moment-of-truth">Moment of truth</h3><p>After I&#39;d put everything back together, I was worried it&#39;d not boot. Or that it would boot, but input/sound wouldn&#39;t work.</p><p>Switching it on resulted in this screen:</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1487.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1487.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1487.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1487.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1487.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>plz restore :(</figcaption></figure><p>So, I restored it on iTunes, and it worked! I followed up by installing <a href="https://rockbox.org">Rockbox</a>, and then the theme called &#34;<a href="https://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=53574.0">FreshOS</a>&#34; which gives it a nice clean look (in my opinion). Rockbox has a nice installer which makes this super easy.</p><p>In addition, I no longer need to use iTunes! The iPod mounts as external storage, and the files can just be copied across. Easy.</p><p>Rockbox also means I can <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable/status/1493172771790245890?s=20&amp;t=C9L2RYcRdfT7aPmvmQqJmw">play doom</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable/status/1492989855101509634?s=20&amp;t=C9L2RYcRdfT7aPmvmQqJmw">control my Macbooks volume from the iPod</a> (you know, a very useful thing to do...)</p><p>Anyway, if you have any questions please do feel free to get in touch <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_huxtable">on Twitter</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1493-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1493-1.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1493-1.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1493-1.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1493-1.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>The Rockbox + FreshOS home screenÂ </figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/2022/02/IMG_1496.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/IMG_1496.jpeg 600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/IMG_1496.jpeg 1000w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/IMG_1496.jpeg 1600w, https://ellie.wtf/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/IMG_1496.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>With some music playing</figcaption></figure>
