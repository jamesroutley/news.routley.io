There are no written rules about what a national flag should look like. That is why we can observe truly original designs with different number of stripes, colours and additional elements. However, all of them share one characteristic: they have a rectangular shape . Well, actually not all of them. There is a sovereign country whose flag doesn&#39;t follow the pattern: Nepal . If you have played Kobadoo Flags  before you are probably familiar with it. This beautiful flag is a combination of two pennons  used in the past by rival branches of the ruling dynasty . The red colour is a  symbol of bravery  of Nepali people and it is also the colour of Nepal&#39;s national flower: rhododendron . The blue border represents   peace  and   harmony. The crescent moon on the top pennon symbolizes the coldness near Himalayas and the pure spirit  of Nepali people; whereas the sun represents the heat of the southern provinces and the  fierceness  of the locals.

Working memory is a part of executive functions of our brain. It is a cognitive system that is used when we are keeping information in short-term memory and processing and manipulating that stored information. Working memory improves from childhood and usually reaches its peak in mid-twenties, then it slowly declines with age. How can you train your working memory? Working memory capacities can be improved through repetition and training. This is based on  brain’s  neuroplasticity , which is the brain’s capability to adapt to the environment it is in. The effect by some programs ( Cogmed / Robomemo ) has shown to be effective compared to a placebo group. By training working memory you could possibly learn new skills.  For example those who want to learn new flags of the world, keep playing the game  Kobadoo Flags , and play it repeatedly. Eventually you might see that you will also learn some new flags just by playing a game and possibly reach higher levels.   A study in children [ 1 ]
