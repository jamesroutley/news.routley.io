    <h1>What Is Vim?</h1>

The answer seems fairly obvious - an editor. To some an obscure way to interact with your computer, to others the only way.
</p>

<p>
However, there is something very special about Vim that no other editor has:
</p>

<p>
There&#39;s a Vim mode in every single mainstream code editor out there.
No matter if VSCode, JetBrains, Emacs, Sublime, Zed - they all let you enable Vim mode.
</p>



<p>
To flip this around, imagine you would remove the functionality that Vim mode in VSCode gives you from Neovim.
This is an academic example, but what would you be left with? A slightly obscure configuration language that&#39;s competing with a new Lua API, leaving you with a very fragmented way of setting up your editor.
You would have a language server client that requires a lot of manual configuration to set up, and a decision for you to make which third-party package manager is currently the &#34;best&#34;.
While it&#39;ll be a snappy editor, comparing this to VSCode it doesn&#39;t seem particularly appealing.
</p>



<p>
I think Vim at its core is something else: It&#39;s a language to talk to your computer.
The more you use Vim, the more its grammar and structure becomes clear, it&#39;s pretty simple
</p>

<div>
<pre>diw --&gt; delete inner word
cap --&gt; change a paragraph
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>verb adjective object</b>, that&#39;s it. Sometimes you may add a count before the verb - simple.
Its simplicity means it&#39;s a) not too hard to remember for a person, but also b) great for a computer to interpret, compared with for example English which is verbose, has many special cases and many ways to express the same thing.
</p>



<p>
Vim is an efficient language to tell your editor what to do.
</p>



<p>
Now with all this, what then is the (Neo)vim editor?
It&#39;s the most complete, consistent implementation of the Vim language.
If you like its editor parts, you should continue using it.
</p>

<p>
But if you like the way you talk to Vim, but are unhappy with some other part,
that means it&#39;s worth checking out Zed, VSCode, Emacs or any of the others.
</p>

<p>
You can speak the language you like, but can easily swap out the infrastructure around it that makes a code editor/IDE complete.
