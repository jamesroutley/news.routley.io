<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0d424625-f4f8-4646-9f6e-927c8cbe0e3e"><em>Financial Times</em> reports</a> that Apple has stepped up its preparations for the handover of the CEO role from Tim Cook. Here are the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-steps-up-tim-cook-s-succession-efforts">Apple steps up Tim Cook’s succession efforts</h2>



<p>According to the FT’s sources, Apple’s board and senior executives have “recently intensified” the company’s succession planning for its top role.</p>



<p>The <em>FT</em> adds that although Apple’s Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is the most likely to take the reins of the company, “no final decisions have been made”.</p>



<p>While the report doesn’t mention why Apple is accelerating its succession efforts, it notes that the move is not tied to the company’s performance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People close to Apple say the long-planned transition is not related to the company’s current performance, ahead of what is expected to be a blockbuster end-of-year sales period for the iPhone.</p>



<p>(…)</p>



<p>The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the critical holiday period.”</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Their sources also cautioned that “although preparations have intensified, the timing of any announcement could change”.</p>



<p>This report lands just hours after former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/14/apple-ex-coo-jeff-williams-now-officially-retired/">spent his last day at Apple</a>, following the retirement announcement <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/08/apple-coo-jeff-williams-stepping-down-later-this-month/">he made in July</a>.</p>



<p>Williams had already handed operational leadership to Sabih Khan earlier this year, and his remaining responsibilities were <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/09/apple-folds-health-and-fitness-into-services-splits-apple-watch-oversight/">recently redistributed</a> among other top executives, Ternus among them.</p>



<p>Apple has also recently gone through a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/03/apple-cfo-luca-maestri/">CFO transition</a>, with longtime finance chief Luca Maestri stepping down and handing the role to Kevan Parekh, who previously served as the company’s vice president of Financial Planning and Analysis.</p>
