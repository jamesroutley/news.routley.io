    <h1>BBC gives up on Threads, sticks with Mastodon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-body"><time datetime="2023-10-03T02:19:21Z" pubdate="" itemprop="datePublished" content="2023-10-03 02:19:21 +0000 UTC">October 3, 2023</time><div><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/LxUHCO5k.jpeg" alt="BBC News icon"/></p>

<p>So numerous brands are giving up on <a href="https://threads.net">Threads</a> by <a href="https://instagram.com">Instagram</a>, allegedly due to lack of engagement (ironically, most of them are still using <a href="https://x.com">X</a>, formally known as <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>).</p>

<p>What makes this news more interesting is the fact that the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) has abandoned its Threads account but is still maintaining its self-hosted Mastodon accounts online.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nfl">National Football League</a> hasn&#39;t posted anything in six weeks, before the start of the regular season. This is the nation&#39;s most popular sports league, and it has completely abandoned Meta&#39;s new platform. Even with its 1.9 million followers.</p>

<p>Among news publishers, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) <a href="https://www.threads.net/@bbc">stopped posting</a>to Threads 11 weeks ago, not long after the launch. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@cbsnews">CBS News</a> hasn&#39;t posted in five weeks. (<a href="https://ktla.com/news/some-major-brands-are-giving-up-on-threads-as-engagement-craters/">KTLA5</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier in the year (at the end of July), the BBC announced that they were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub">engaging in a six-month experiment</a> with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, &amp; even self-hosted their content on their custom domain: <a href="https://social.bbc/">Social.bbc</a> (how cool is that!).</p>

<p>While accounts like <a href="https://darnell.day/@/BBC5Live@social.bbc">@<span>BBC5Live@social.bbc</span></a> &amp; <a href="https://darnell.day/@/BBCRadio4@social.bbc">@<span>BBCRadio4@social.bbc</span></a> remain relatively active, <a href="https://darnell.day/@/bbc@threads.net">@<span>bbc@threads.net</span></a> appears abandoned, despite boasting far higher engagement levels on <a href="https://meta.com">Meta</a>’s Twitter rival (now called X).</p>

<p>But why would the BBC abandon Threads while maintaining a presence on Mastodon as well as other social media platforms‽ There are three possible theories:</p>
<ul><li><p>BBC might be weary of posting content to Threads after Meta <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-facebook-instagram-news-block-canada-wildfire/">geo-banned Canadian news outlets</a> after Canadian legislators passed a “news tax” law (<strong>note:</strong> the law is silly, but I digress).</p></li>

<li><p>BBC prefers to control its social narrative, &amp; will redirect followers from Threads to their Mastodon accounts once Threads joins the Fediverse.</p></li>

<li><p>BBC thinks Threads is a waste of time &amp; resources as Threads lacks a public API to help automate posting news to their account.</p></li></ul>

<p>Could the BBC eventually shut down their Mastodon account by the time 2024 arrives‽ Sure. But I suspect that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-seeing-record-user-engagement-the-data-tells-a-different-story/">with X dying</a>, Threads stagnating, &amp; Meta raging, the BBC might keep their Mastodon account active to avoid having their voice limited online.</p>
