The code was made public from December 2017 through September 2022. While Toyota says they have invalidated the key, any exposure this long could mean multiple malicious actors had already acquired access. </p><p>This incident adds Toyota to the list of companies that have had similar exposures; a list that includes <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/samsung-and-nvidia-are-the-latest-companies-to-involuntarily-go-open-source-potentially-leaking-company-secrets/">Samsung, Nvidia</a>, and <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/security-threats-from-the-twitch-leak/">Twitch</a>, just to name a few. While this breach at Toyota is currently understood as fairly limited, compared to the ​​6,695 secrets exposed in the Samsung case, the growing number of companies experiencing such issues is still a very disturbing trend. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>Data exposures on public Git repositories are a particularly troubling topic. Code intended for tightly controlled private repos are very often pushed to public repos owned by employees or contractors, outside the security control of their GitHub organizations.</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.gitguardian.com/content/images/2022/10/Attack-Graphics-MJACK.png" alt="Toyota Data Breach Explained " loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://blog.gitguardian.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/Attack-Graphics-MJACK.png 600w, https://blog.gitguardian.com/content/images/2022/10/Attack-Graphics-MJACK.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Toyota Data Breach Graphic </figcaption></figure><h2 id="t-connect"></h2><p>In 2014, Toyota introduced a new telematics service called T-Connect to customers, offering interactive voice response and allowing drivers to connect to third-party apps. <a href="https://toyota.jp/tconnectservice/">Toyota </a>advertises it as their “connected services that provide safe, secure, comfortable, and convenient services through vehicle communication.” </p><h3 id="a-subcontractor-and-a-public-repo">A Subcontractor And A Public Repo</h3><p>In December 2017, while working with an unnamed (so far) subcontractor, a portion of the source code for T-Connect was uploaded to a public GitHub repository. Inside the repo there was a hardcoded access key for the data server that manages customer info. Anyone who found that credential could access the server, gaining access for 296,019 customers.</p><p>It was not until September 15, 2022, that anyone noticed this repo was public and that customer data was potentially exposed. Toyota has since made the repo private and has invalidated and replaced any affected connection credentials.  </p><h2 id="how-bad-is-this-security-breach">How Bad Is this Security Breach?</h2><p>While customer identification numbers and emails have potentially been exposed, customer names, credit card data, and phone numbers were not stored in the exposed database, and are therefore not at risk.  Toyota has begun outreach to affected customers. As part of this outreach, the company has set up a special form on its site to let customers check to see if their data was part of the exposure.  </p><h2 id="how-can-people-protect-themselves">How can people protect themselves</h2><p>Toyota does warn customers that although there has not been any unauthorized use of their personal information detected, all affected users should be on the lookout for spam emails and phishing attacks.  </p><p>This incident serves as a good reminder that with all emails it is important to only follow links in emails from trusted sources. When in doubt about the validity of an email, you should inspect the header to make sure the email domain is legitimate and use the hover preview for any link to ensure the URL is not redirecting you to a potentially dangerous site.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>Attackers can use context along with stolen emails to create more convincing phishing campaigns. For example, knowing they are a Toyota customer can make them appear more trustworthy.</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="how-can-devs-prevent-this-from-happening-again">How can devs prevent this from happening again?</h2><p>There are two security missteps at the heart of this latest incident at Toyota:</p><ol><li>Code intended to be private was pushed to a public repository.</li><li>A credential for a DB server holding customer data was hardcoded into the repo. </li></ol><p>Git is an awesome version control system, used by over 93% of developers, and is at the heart of modern CI/CD pipelines. One of the benefits of Git is that everyone has a complete copy of the project they are working on. That full copy access also means each developer can, in turn, push their copy to unauthorized places, such as public repositories. While it might not be possible to prevent a contractor from pushing code wherever they want, it is possible to detect when code or IP has been pushed somewhere it should not be. This is a serious issue affecting the software industry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfq_3OdAeWM&amp;t=532s">that we have previously reported on</a>.  </p><h2 id="before-you-go">Before you go</h2><p>Want to learn more about the problem of hardcoded credentials?
