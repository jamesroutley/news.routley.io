The product also recommends adding more sugar to taste.

Additional protein could cause dehydration by putting a strain on kidneys, and children with poor digestion could also have difficulty processing high levels of protein.</p><figure id="22122c59-e6d7-4b1a-b068-6e928f3437ea" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="A packet of Cadbury’s Bournvita biscuits on a canned drinks display" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c76d139305be797d5a268166c5fabc664729e1/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="333.75" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Food corporations have encouraged snacking in markets where it was previously rare, often marketing high-fat and sugary foods at children.</span> Photograph: Amrit Dhillon</figcaption></figure><p>Ashish Verma, another Govindpuri store owner, says <a href="https://pediasure.com/what-is-pediasure#:~:text=PediaSure%20has%20been%20clinically%20shown,bottles%20of%20PediaSure%20a%20day.&amp;text=Over%20half%20of%20the%20children,weight%2Dfor%2Dheight%20percentiles.&amp;text=They%20reached%20improved%20height%20and%20weight%2Dfor%2Dheight." data-link-name="in body link">PediaSure, a protein shake which claims to help growth</a>, immune functions and brain development, is also popular with parents.</p><p>“Parents want energy bars and beverages that will keep their children strong and healthy.

The WHO’s new guidance on marketing unhealthy foods says poor diets were responsible for about 8 million deaths linked to NCDs in 2019.</p><figure id="3ddb138f-d668-4bdc-a880-72651593bccb" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="People stand outside a shop in the street in India" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e880b27be3943cab243cb64fa2fb01145d67ddbf/0_0_4000_3000/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="333.75" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Sunita devi stands outside the local shop with her son, Ajit, (left, in the doorway) and other customers.</span> Photograph: Amrit Dhillon</figcaption></figure><p>“When you get undernutrition as an infant it stunts you for life, it affects your body composition and it increases the amount of fat around the heart and liver, which we call visceral fat, and that’s the most dangerous fat,” says Popkin, because of the fat’s link to problems such as insulin resistance, which is the cause of <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/body/visceral-fat.html" data-link-name="in body link">type 2 diabetes</a>.</p><p>“So when you see countries like India, Nepal and African countries, where you see an increasing amount of these products fed to infants, let alone two- to four-year-olds, you’re just feeding their obesity and enhancing their desire for sweetness – and it carries over to later life.”</p><p>According to Popkin, widespread snacking is a relatively new trend that was pushed through the marketing of multinational food companies during the 20th century in high-income countries, to the point where it has become normal.</p><p>Those markets, he says, have become saturated and so the companies began looking at the rest of the world.</p><p>“Industry was marketing it, pushing it, making it available, making the prices attractive, giving it away in schools, at sporting events.
