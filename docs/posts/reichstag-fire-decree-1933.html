    <h1>Reichstag Fire Decree (1933)</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of the People and the State is also known as the Reichstag Fire Decree. It was passed on February 28, 1933.</p>
<p>On February 27, 1933, 24-year-old Dutch militant Marinus van der Lubbe <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/11083/en">set fire to the German parliament</a> (Reichstag), causing extensive damage to the building that had long been the symbol of German unity. The government falsely portrayed the incident as part of a Communist plot to overthrow the state in response to Adolf Hitler&#39;s appointment as Reich Chancellor by President Paul von Hindenburg on January 30, 1933.</p>
<p>On February 4, Hitler&#39;s cabinet had restricted the press and authorized the police to ban political meetings and marches. Nazi leaders then exploited the Reichstag fire to gain President von Hindenburg&#39;s approval for a more extreme measure called the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State.</p>
<p>Popularly known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, the regulations suspended important provisions of the German constitution, especially those safeguarding individual rights and due process of law. The decree permitted the restriction of the right to assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, among other rights, and it removed all restraints on police investigations. With the decree in place, the regime was free to arrest and incarcerate political opponents without specific charge, dissolve political organizations, and suppress publications. It also gave the central government the authority to overrule state and local laws and overthrow state and local governments. This law became a permanent feature of the Nazi police state.</p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>(Translated from <em>Reichsgesetzblatt </em>I, 1933, p. 83.)</p>

<p><strong>Article 4</strong></p>

In addition the sentence may include confiscation of property.</p>
<p>Whoever provokes or incites an act contrary to public welfare is to be punished with a penitentiary sentence, under mitigating circumstances, with imprisonment of not less than three months.</p>
<p><strong>Article 5</strong></p>
<p>Insofar as a more severe punishment has not been previously provided for, the following are punishable with death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment not to exceed 15 years:</p>
<p>1. Anyone who undertakes to kill the Reich President or a member or a commissioner of the Reich Government or of a state government, or provokes such a killing, or agrees to commit it, or accepts such an offer, or conspires with another for such a murder;</p>
<p>2. Anyone who under Paragraph 115(2) of the Criminal Code (serious rioting) or under Paragraph 125(2) of the Criminal Code (serious disturbance of the peace) commits the act with arms or cooperates consciously and intentionally with an armed person;</p>
<p>3. Anyone who commits a kidnapping under Paragraph 239 of the Criminal Code with the intention of making use of the kidnapped person as a hostage in the political struggle.</p>
