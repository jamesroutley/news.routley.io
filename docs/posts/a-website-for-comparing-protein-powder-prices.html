  <div><p>Asheville is in crisis right now.
They&#39;re without drinking water, faucets run dry, and it&#39;s difficult to <em>flush toilets</em>.
As of yesterday, the hospital has water (via tanker trucks), but 80% of the public water system is still without running water.</p>
<p>Things are really bad.
Lots of infrastructure has been washed away.
Even when water is back, there has been tremendous damage done that will take a long time to recover from and rebuild.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5138093/helene-asheville-nc-drinking-water">the only national news story</a> my friend from Asheville had seen which covered the water situation specifically.
It&#39;s hard for me to understand why this is not covered more broadly.
And my heart aches for those in and around the Asheville area.</p>
<p>As I&#39;m far away, I can&#39;t do a lot to help.
But I can donate money, which my friend said is the <em>only</em> donation that would help right now if you aren&#39;t in the area.
She specifically pointed me to these two ways to donate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.belovedasheville.com/get-involved/">Beloved Asheville</a>: a respected community organization in Asheville, this is a great place to send money to help. (If you&#39;re closer to that area, it does look like they have specific things they&#39;re asking for as well, but this feels like an &#34;if you can help this way, you&#39;d already know&#34; situation.)</li>
<li><a href="https://mutualaiddisasterrelief.org/donate/">Mutual Aid Disaster Relief</a>: there&#39;s a local Asheville chapter which is doing work to help. Also an organization to support for broad disaster recovery in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve donated money.
I hope you will, too, for this and for the many other crises that affect us.
Let&#39;s help each other.</p>
