Many startups fail despite identifying a real problem and building a product that solves that problem. This explains why, so you can avoid their fate.

</figcaption></figure><p>Sam Altman is the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, and before that ran the Y-Combinator accelerator, and is therefore one of the world’s most experienced experts on startups. He previously co-founded Loopt—a location-based, mobile social-network app. Oh look, those are <em>all</em> the keywords of 2005, when it was founded. It raised $30M and failed. When asked what happened, he said:</p><blockquote>
<p>The market wasn’t there. You can’t force a market. You can have an idea, and as a startup part of your job is to be ahead of it, and sometimes you’re right about that, and sometimes you’re not.</p><p>Sometimes you make Loopt, and sometimes you make OpenAI. You just keep trying.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/customer-development/" data-title="The Iterative-Hypothesis customer development method" data-desc="A simple but effective system, used to vet what is now a Unicorn, for generating insights about how your potential customers think, what they need, and what they’ll buy." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/customer-development/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/customer-development/thumbnail-704w.webp">given the example</a> of website security, which I know is a real problem plaguing millions of websites whose owners think “those mean hackers won’t attack lil’ ol’ <em>me</em>; I’m nobody!” False. Hackers indeed don’t care about lil’ ol’ <em>you</em>, but they do want to gain control of your lil’ ol’ <em>server</em>, so they can do their nefarious things, like spamming, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/the-global-ppc-click-fraud-report-2020-21/391493/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">advertisement-click-fraud</a>, <a href="https://itnext.io/how-companies-are-hacked-via-malicious-javascript-code-12aa82560bdc?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">remote-controlling</a> your visitors’ browsers, or just bouncing off to yet another server as a way of covering their tracks. Everyone has the problem, but millions of people don’t <em>think</em> they have the problem, so they’re not searching for website security software, and certainly not buying it.</p><p>“Security” is a case of ignorance, but the other version of this challenge is when the customer knows they have the problem, but genuinely does not care. This could be because this problem is the ninth-most-important priority on their list, and they can only give attention to their top three… and this item will never bubble up to the top three. An example I see a lot in WP Engine’s space is accessibility. Given lip-service by many marketing departments and product managers, it rarely makes the priority list for the public website or the product. Some companies choose to care, or are mandated by governments or contracts. This author chooses to care. But the fact is, though everyone agrees they have the “problem” of a non-accessible website or product, most don’t have the will to act.</p><p>Sometimes “willing and able” is a matter of market-timing. A famous example is Instacart: Successful after 80% of Americans carried a smart phone, unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">WebVan</a> which was exactly the same idea, solving the same problem in much the same way, but the market wasn’t ready for it.</p><p>A lot of great ideas, attacking real problems, fail to become successful companies, because the target market doesn’t know they’re even in the market. Because they’re not.</p><p><strong>Can you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule.</strong> Some founders are not only the first-and-best sales-person, but also natural evangelists. More, they’re on a mission to educate the world about their passion. They don’t see a lack of interest as a barrier, but as an opportunity to change minds. That is a difficult, expensive, and slow path, but it is a path, and one that could result in zealous, loyal customers and a fulfilling existence. But you really have to want that path, doing that work with those consequences, if you’re going to enter a market that you also have to create.</p><p><b><i>☞ If you&#39;re enjoying this, please <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/subscribe/" target="_blank">subscribe</a> and share this article! ☜</i></b>

<li><em>“You have a great product! I’d have to get [someone else’s] approval for this though, and they don’t understand all this.”</em></li><li><em>“This is nice, I would use it, but they’re carefully watching all expenditures and the truth is I can manage without it.”</em></li><li><em>“I’d love to, but our budget is closed for the year and I can’t start a new project.”</em></li><li><em>“This is pretty cool, but our internal team who manages [the problem] says they don’t need help. They might be just trying to save their jobs, but it is what it is.”</em></li></ul><p>We’ve all heard these objections. Some are normal; you can’t win every sale. But sometimes the target customer agrees they have the problem, yet doesn’t have the money to solve it.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.capitalfactory.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">Capital Factory</a>, there’s a constant stream of kids coming out of college with a startup that “sells ______ to college students.” It’s easy to find “problems”—restaurants and bars want to advertise to students, students don’t want to spend much on food, students need books and supplies, and so on. The founders explain they “had the problem themselves, so they <em>really</em> understand it.”</p><p>That’s probably true. The deal-breaker is that college kids have no money, and don’t spend what little money they have on SaaS products. And businesses that cater to college kids have to charge low prices (because college kids have no money), and therefore don’t have budgets for oddball new ideas. In fourteen years, none of these startups worked, even though arguably most of the “problems” existed.</p><p>You might think a large company will definitely allocate budget for a known problem, but here again the answer is often in the negative. Budgets are applied to the top few most-important problems of the year; if this is a problem, but not a top one, it won’t get attention. Large companies have to allocate more than money—they have compliance teams who have to approve, they compare multiple vendors, they run pilot programs, and all of this won’t be set in motion unless it’s a top problem.</p><p>Large companies have internal teams that are already tasked with the problem, which might means there’s no additional budget for outside solutions. Those teams often fight against outside tools, because they makes their jobs obsolete, or at least converts them into vendor-managers instead of innovators. You want to target companies who outsource this particular problem to outside vendors.</p><p>Once you get over the hurdle of there being a budget at all, is the budget large enough? I’m always shocked how little people will pay for productivity applications like to-do lists and note-taking. These are applications you might use dozens of times per day, as much as email. The slightest increase in efficiency or even simple delight will have a massive impact on the customer’s life, every day. And yet people complain that the Pro version of <a href="https://bear.app/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">Bear App</a> is a whopping $15/year, or that <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&amp;utm_medium=post" target="_blank">Remember the Milk</a> is $40/year, or how they’ve been paying €29/year for Evernote for eleven years, but a change to €43 is so devastating that they will completely change to another application that has 1/10th the functionality and no tech support:</p><figure>

</figcaption></figure><p>This can be for legal reasons, like being locked into a long-term contract or government fiat. This can be for convenience, as in the Workday example which at WP Engine caused us to cancel several other SaaS products because “now it’s all in one system, which we’re paying for anyway, so this is simpler and safer to manage.” This can be because of other forms of lock-in, like difficulty in extracting and moving existing data, having to retrain thousands of employees, or having to re-implement a variety of cross-systems integrations that people rely on for their workflows, data, reports, and governance.</p><p>Notice that <strong>all these forces have nothing to do with your product or its price</strong>. They are so powerful, they overwhelm a product that is solving the problem the best, at the best price. That’s why they cannot be ignored, and why founders are surprised when their genuinely-great product in the definitely-extant market where customer are definitely paying for solutions, is still too difficult to sell.</p><p>On the bright side, this is a prompt for your strategy. How will your strategy create these sorts of “lock-ins” that will prevent your <em>competitors</em> from kicking <em>you</em> out of <em>your</em> customers?</p><p>A final way that customers might not be able to buy right now, is when the product is needed at a specific moment in time, but not before or after that moment. Websites for events and occasions are an example, as are tools that solve temporary problems like sophisticated code profilers or load-testing tools. Because Smart Bear was in the developer tools market, I know a number of founders of products in the latter two spaces; all of them struggled to maintain even small companies, exactly because people didn’t proactively need the product (i.e. “Don’t have the problem”), but then suddenly did (i.e. “Willing to buy, but only <em>right now</em>”), and then didn’t any more (i.e. “No longer willing to buy”).</p><p><strong>Can you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule.</strong> If there’s a legal contract, you can offer to pay the penalty for them breaking their contract (so long as that isn’t so expensive that you can never be profitable). If it’s hard to migrate, you can offer to do the migration as a service, perhaps even for free (this is common in WP Engine’s market). If you’re fighting the all-in-one enterprise systems like Workday, you can focus instead on a target market that cannot afford Workday and sees Workday as overly complex and cold, so that Workday isn’t even a competitor. If timing is important, you might offer a way to buy that is cheap or even free while not using it, so you’re “right there as soon as you need us again.” But you have to really have answers for these challenges, and be ready to walk that path.</p><h2 id="eager-do-they-want-to-buy-from-you-specifically">Eager: Do they want to buy from you, specifically?

</figcaption></figure><p>The first hurdle is <strong>trust</strong>: Do they trust not only that the product works, but that your company will be around for many years to come, that you will maintain a high pace of development, that you won’t have security issues, that your customer service will truly help them when inevitable problems arise, and that you can scale as the customer’s needs scale?</p><p>The second hurdle is <strong>differentiation</strong>. This doesn’t just mean “you have something unique.” You might have a feature that no one else has, but if only 10% of the market cares about that feature, that’s not enough. Worse, your competitor will have some feature <em>you</em> don’t have, and what if 30% of the market cares about <em>that</em> one? This is a topic that requires another article for full treatment (which is forthcoming!).</p><p><b><i>☞ If you&#39;re enjoying this, please <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/subscribe/" target="_blank">subscribe</a> and share this article! ☜</i></b>
</p><p>A special difficulty comes when the product over-serves a large segment of the market. This means that, for example, you have ten features, but most of the market really cares about three of them. You might have all sorts of differentiation in the latter seven, but that won’t sway most people. Picking something simpler or cheaper is the rational choice, even though your “feature comparison matrix” shows that you’re a much more complete solution.</p><p>A sales team can combat both of these challenges. The job isn’t just to schedule calls, cajole potential customers into action, and press for the close; the job also to build trust in your organization and talk around competitive points, positioning so that the customer wants to buy from the mixed bag of plusses-and-minuses that every product contains.</p><p>The best way to overcome these challenges are the “Love” and “Utility” types of <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/" data-title="When customers are “willing” to pay" data-desc="This fresh take on “Willingness-to-Pay” analyzes three types of customer motivation, leading to superior strategies for growth that also better the world." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/willingness-to-pay/thumbnail-704w.webp">willingness-to-pay</a>.</p><p><strong>Can you be successful anyway? Yes, there’s an exception to every rule.</strong> Trust can be side-stepped by building a type of product that doesn’t require much trust. Or trust can be built by mitigation, for example open-source means the customer can shift to another vendor or take over the code base in a worst-case scenario. Differentiation is harder. Sometimes you’re competing on price, which isn’t ideal for the bottom-line or for the quality of customer, but can work very well. In a large market, differentiation can come from specializing in a niche. In a small market, you might not have many viable competitors, lessening the importance of differentiation. A company mission that is “bigger than all of us” can also be a distinguishing reason to buy, although typically more for consumer products where that’s an allowable purchase-criterium. Still, it difficult to survive when you’re no different from more mature, feature-rich, stable, innovative alternatives.</p><h2 id="enduring-will-they-still-be-paying-or-paying-it-forward-a-year-from-now">Enduring: Will they still be paying (or paying-it-forward) a year from now?
</h2><p>I cannot count the number of indie developers who grow to $15k MRR and start slowing down because their cancellation rate is 7%. Many don’t think this is a problem; many of the rest believe that 5% would be a success. It’s not.</p><p><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/" data-title="Selecting the right product metrics" data-desc="A novel system for selecting and presenting product KPIs, satisfying not only the product team, but also stakeholders, executives, and customers." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/thumbnail-704w.webp">Financials and SaaS metrics</a> aren’t even the primary reason why this is fatal. The problem is that the customers don’t want the product. 5%/mo cancellation means only half the customers will still be customers a year from now, which means you’re not building a sustainable business.</p><p>The reasons can vary. Perhaps they needed the product temporarily; they might have loved it, but “the problem” disappears. More often, the product didn’t work well enough—insufficient features, too many bugs, didn’t integrate with some other system, too expensive for the end result, turns out the problem is not important enough.</p><p>The financial reality is illuminating too. The challenge is that top-line growth is linear for many companies, and <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/" data-title="The Elephant in the room: The myth of exponential hypergrowth" data-desc="Even Facebook and Slack did not grow “exponentially,” as frequently described. Here is the correct model that you can use to understand and affect growth." data-image-src1="https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/thumbnail-352w.webp" data-image-src2="https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/thumbnail-704w.webp">quadratic (<em>not</em> exponential)</a> even with hyper-growth companies. But cancellation <em>is</em> exponential—that’s why it’s measured as a percent of the current customer base. Exponentials grow faster than lines or quadratics, therefore cancellation “catches up” faster than you can add new customers. Growth fades, and finally ceases, as one customer cancels for every new customer who signs up.</p><p>With $15k MRR, adding $2k/mo of new customers—a healthy 15% <em>per month</em> growth rate—a 7% cancellation rate means already half of that growth is negated by customers leaving. The company barely got started and already its growth is being decimated. At that rate, only one year later, having grown to about $27k MRR, the company has stopped growing completely, despite spending time and money on marketing and sales. Don’t forget—those new customers cost money to attract, sell, and on-board with tech support, but all the value of that expense is negated by an equal number of customers walking out the door.</p><figure>

They’re successful anyway because (a) the ones that do stay tend to grow forever and non-linearly, (b) the market is enormous and still growing fast, so they won’t run out of new customers anytime soon, and (c) customers cancel because their own business didn’t succeed, not because Shopify’s product is problematic. If the problem really is the product, I don’t believe there is an exception. The product has to be work well for some segment of the market. The rest can be mitigated if other factors of the market, strategy, and business model can overcome this massive weakness with even-more-massive advantages.</p><p><b><i>☞ If you&#39;re enjoying this, please <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/subscribe/" target="_blank">subscribe</a> and share this article! ☜</i></b>
