        <h3><b>About WWLLN</b></h3>
        <p>The World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN - pronounced &#39;woollen&#39;), is a network of very low frequency (VLF) radio lightning
          sensors operated by the University of Washington in Seattle.
          Most ground-based observations in the 3 - 30 kHz VLF band are dominated by impulsive signals from lightning
          discharges called “sferics”.
          Significant radiated electromagnetic power exists from a few hertz to several hundred megahertz, with the bulk
          of the energy radiated at VLF.
          With our world wide network of lightning sensors, we are producing regular maps of lightning activity over the
          entire Earth.
          
        </p>

        <h4><b>How it works</b></h4>
        
        <p>
          We welcome offers of hosting a new WWLLN lightning sensor. All hosts receive all the world-wide data for their
          own research.
          In return, each host provides the computer and meets any local expenses like power, Internet, and maintenance.
          However, do not think that a sensor on your own campus is going to give you lightning location data on its
          own. Only the whole network does that.
        </p>
        <p><i>&#34;Please contact us if you are interested in hosting a WWLLN lightning sensor.&#34;</i></p> 
        <p>
          Each lightning stroke location requires the time of group arrival (TOGA) from a least 5 WWLLN sensors.
          These sensors may be several thousand km distant from the stroke.
          The geographical arrangement of the sensors is important: a lightning stroke which is enclosed by sensors is
          much more accurately located than one which is not so enclosed.
          Clearly a uniform spacing of sensors around the Earth is the ideal.
          Since the Earth is round, there are no edges: every lightning stroke is surrounded by sensors, but not
          necessarily by the sensors which sense it.
          Typically only about 15 to 30% of strokes detected by one sensor are detected by 5 or more.
          These strokes are usually the stronger ones. Recent research indicates our detection efficiency for strokes
          about 30 kA is approximately 30% globally.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To cover the whole world by sensors spaced uniformly about 1000 km apart would require roughly 500 sensors.
          If spaced 3000 km apart, we would need “only” around 50 to 60 sensors. Presently we have over 70 WWLLN
          sensors.
          We are always on the look out for more sensor sites.
