    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone else receiving unsolicited Datadog marketing spam?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I keep getting &#39;reaching out&#39; and &#39;just following up&#39; (because I haven&#39;t replied) spam from Craig Cummins &#39;DevSecOps Enablement&#39; at Datadog.</p><p>One of them even said something like &#39;you may be wondering why you are getting this, do not worry, I got your email from our internal CRM&#39; -- ..ok that&#39;s fine then?! No mention of how it got <i>there</i>. No idea why Cummins thinks it&#39;s how he specifically got my email address to use in a work capacity that might be a concern, or why &#39;from my employer&#39; would be a useful answer.</p><p>It&#39;s incessant, and sure it has an &#39;unsubscribe&#39; link but of course I never subscribed to your &#39;tell me how paying for Datadog might benefit me&#39; spam, I shouldn&#39;t have to unsubscribe.</p><p>I assume many others here are getting this crap too?</p><p>If you happen to work at Datadog, I&#39;d suggest telling the relevant teams that this sort of thing is only going to make people <i>not</i> use Datadog&#39;s services. (Or frankly, just tell Craig Cummins if that&#39;s a real employee&#39;s name - it&#39;s always him.) It&#39;s <i>terrible</i> for &#39;developer relations&#39;.</p></div></div></div>
