    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In March 2025 I received an email asking about PuTTY’s “logo” –
      the icon used by the Windows executable. The sender wanted to
      know where it had come from, and how it had evolved over
      time.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I receive an email asking a question, and by the time
      I’ve finished answering it, I realise it’s worth turning into a
      blog post. This time I knew it was going to be one of those
      before I even started typing, because there’s a graphic design
      angle to the question <em>and</em> a technical angle. So I had a
      lot to say.</p>
    <p>PuTTY’s icon designs date from the late 1990s and early 2000s.
      They’ve never had a major <em>stylistic</em> redesign, but over
      the years, the icons have had to be re-rendered under various
      constraints, which made for a technical challenge as well.</p>
    <h2 id="drawing">Hand-drawn era</h2>
    <p>When I first started drawing PuTTY icons, I didn’t know I was
      going to need lots of them at different sizes. So I didn’t start
      off with any automation – I just drew each one by hand in the
      MSVC icon editor.</p>
    <h3 id="original">PuTTY itself</h3>
    <p>Expanded to a visible size, here’s the earliest version of the
      original PuTTY icon that I still have in my source control. That
      means it was current in early 1999; my source control doesn’t go
      all the way back to the very project start in the summer of
      1996, but if it did, I expect this was <em>probably</em> the
      same icon I originally drew. I’d have drawn one quite early,
      because Windows GUI programs look pretty unhelpful without an
      icon.</p>

      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PuTTY icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It’s 32 × 32 pixels, and uses a limited palette of primary
      colours and shades of grey. That’s because I started the project
      in the mid-1990s, when non-truecolour displays were very common.
      There was a fixed 16-colour palette recommended for use in
      icons, consisting of the obvious primary and secondary colours
      and dim versions of them, plus a couple of spare shades of grey.
      That way all the icons in the entire GUI could reuse the same 16
      palette entries and not run the display out of colours. So this
      icon is drawn using that palette.</p>
    <p>Providing a plain black-and-white version was another standard
      recommendation at the time. But I can’t remember why – I
      certainly never actually <em>saw</em> a computer running Win95
      or later with a B&amp;W display! My best guess is that the
      recommendation was intended for use with the “Win32s” extension
      that would let 32-bit programs at least <em>try</em> to run on
      Windows 3.1 (on suitable underlying hardware). Probably Windows
      3 still supported black and white displays.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I thought about the design very much. I just
      dashed it off because I needed <em>some</em> kind of an icon.
      The two computers are drawn in a style that was common in the
      ’90s: a system box sitting under a CRT monitor, with a floppy
      disk drive visible at the right-hand end. They’re connected with
      a lightning bolt to suggest electrical communication between
      them. I didn’t <em>believe</em> I was being very original: I had
      the vague idea that several icons of this kind already existed
      (although I’ve never been able to find any specific example of
      what I was thinking of), so in my head, it fit with the general
      iconography of the day, and seemed as if it would be immediately
      understandable.</p>
    <p>I can’t remember why the lightning bolt was <em>yellow</em>.
      With hindsight that seems the strangest thing about it; cyan
      would have been a more obvious choice for electricity. Possibly
      it was just to contrast more with the blue screens of the
      computers.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which … I can’t remember why the screens were blue,
      either. I <em>think</em> I just intended it as a neutral-ish
      sort of colour which wasn’t black, so that it was clear that the
      screens were turned on. I’m pretty sure the blue <em>wasn’t</em>
      an allusion to the Windows Blue Screen of Death – that wouldn’t
      make sense, because in a typical use of PuTTY, only <em>one</em>
      end of the connection is running Windows, and neither end has
      crashed!</p>
    <p>Looking back, I suppose I might also have considered making the
      two computers look different from each other, on the theory that
      the client machine might be sitting on someone’s desk, and the
      server might be in a rack in a datacentre? But I was a student
      when I started writing PuTTY, and <em>my</em> Linux server you
      could remotely log into was on my desk and not in a rack. So I
      think that just never even occurred to me.</p>
    <h3 id="pscp">PSCP (and PSFTP): file transfer</h3>
    <p>In 1999, a contributor sent an SCP implementation, and PSCP was
      born. I decided to draw it an icon of its own.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t especially important for PSCP to have an icon at all.
      You don’t run it <em>from</em> a GUI (it’s useless without
      command-line arguments), so it doesn’t need an icon for you to
      find it in Explorer or identify it in the Start Menu. And it
      doesn’t put up GUI windows, so it wouldn’t need an icon to
      identify those in the taskbar either. But I drew an icon anyway.
      I can’t remember why. Maybe it was just for completeness, or I
      felt like doing a bit of drawing, or something.</p>
    <p>I made the PSCP icon by modifying the existing PuTTY icon,
      replacing one of the two computers with a piece of paper with
      variable-length lines on it, suggesting a written document:</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/pscp-original.png" alt="[pscp-original.png]"/>

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PSCP icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I kept the lightning bolt connecting the remaining computer to
      that document, the theory being that you use PSCP to remotely
      access documents. (In some fairly vague sense.)</p>
    <p>Later on, we gained a second file transfer tool, PSFTP, and I
      reused the same icon for that, on the basis that they’re both
      file transfer tools and the icon doesn’t really say anything
      specific to one of them. PSFTP is still a command-line
      application, but unlike PSCP, it’s possible to run
      it <em>from</em> the GUI (by clicking on it in Explorer or the
      Start Menu), because it has an interactive prompt, so if you
      don’t run it with any command-line arguments, you can tell it at
      the prompt where to connect to. So PSFTP put the same icon to a
      more practical use than PSCP did.</p>
    <p>(On the other hand, giving two tools the same icon means you
      have to check carefully which one you’re dragging around in
      Explorer! Perhaps it would have been better to make the PSCP and
      PSFTP icons different in some way. But I couldn’t easily think
      of a visual depiction of the ways the two tools differ.)</p>
    <h3 id="pageant">Pageant: SSH agent</h3>
    <p>Pageant, our SSH agent, was the next tool in the suite that
      needed an icon.</p>
    <p>My original idea for an icon depicting an SSH agent was to draw
      the face of a <em>secret</em> agent – in the stereotypical
      outfit from the sillier end of spy fiction, with a wide-brimmed
      hat and a turned-up collar.</p>
    <p>But I’m terrible at drawing faces. After a few failed attempts,
      I realised that Pageant would never get released <em>at all</em>
      if I waited until I’d drawn the icon I wanted. So instead I took
      the secret agent’s hat – the only part which I <em>had</em>
      drawn to my satisfaction – and simply sat it on top of a larger
      version of the computer from the original PuTTY icon, at a
      rakish angle.</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/pageant-original.png" alt="[pageant-original.png]"/>
        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original Pageant icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I’d intended that as a placeholder, planning to come back and
      have another try later at drawing my original idea of a human
      secret agent. But then I realised the icon I’d already drawn was
      simply <em>better!</em> It fits visually with the rest of the
      suite by reusing the same computer design; it’s more appropriate
      because the ‘agent’ in question <em>is</em> computerised rather
      than human. And most importantly of all, a computer wearing a
      hat turned out to be cute. So I kept it.</p>
    <p>On the technical side: Pageant’s original icon <em>didn’t</em>
      come with a black and white version. I don’t remember why not;
      perhaps, with Windows 3 a few more years in the past, it just
      didn’t seem important enough any more. But on the other hand,
      Pageant introduced a new requirement: I had to draw
      a <em>small</em> version of the icon. Up to this point I’d just
      drawn everything at the (then) standard icon size of 32 × 32;
      but Pageant puts an icon in the System Tray on the taskbar, so
      it needed a smaller 16 × 16 icon to fit there. If you just let
      Windows scale down the 32 × 32 version, it didn’t do such a good
      job of it.</p>
    <figure>

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>Half-size version of the original Pageant icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Drawing a small version of the same computer logo was a
      challenge, especially while still using that 16-colour fixed
      palette. You can see that I’ve done some tricks with the darker
      palette entries, ‘hand-antialiasing’ the hatband, and replacing
      the internal black outline at the bottom of the computer monitor
      with a dark grey one to try to make it less prominent – as if
      the original 1-pixel black outline had been scaled down to half
      a pixel.</p>
    <p>(But the <em>external</em> outline is still solid black, so
      that it separates the entire icon clearly from whatever
      background colour it’s shown on. The taskbar is grey, and so is
      most of the icon, so that’s still important!)</p>
    <h3 id="puttygen">PuTTYgen: key generator</h3>
    <p>After that came PuTTYgen. I drew another “computer + lightning
      bolt + object” icon, this time with the other object being a key
      – a weak visual pun, since PuTTYgen generates and works with
      cryptographic keys.</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/puttygen-original.png" alt="[puttygen-original.png]"/>
        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The original PuTTYgen icon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The lightning bolt indicating network communication was
      particularly inappropriate in this tool. It was already fairly
      tenuous in PSCP, but PuTTYgen doesn’t do any network
      communication <em>at all</em>, so the lightning bolt was
      completely inaccurate. I really put it in there for visual
      consistency with the rest of the icons: it’s there to signal
      “this is a tool from the same suite as PuTTY”.</p>
    <p>(I’m still not <em>very</em> happy with the drawing of the
      key.)</p>
    <p>This icon is the other way up from the PSCP one: here, I’ve
      kept the computer in the lower left corner from the main PuTTY
      icon, and replaced the top right one with a different weird
      object, whereas in PSCP, I kept the top right computer and
      replaced the <em>other</em> one with an object. I don’t remember
      having any particular reason for that – perhaps I just didn’t
      even bother to check which way round I’d drawn the previous
      icon! But I’m not too unhappy with it, because it makes the two
      icons more different from each other, so easier to tell
      apart.</p>
    <h3 id="config">Configuration dialog box</h3>
    <p>The next icon we needed wasn’t for a separate tool at all: it
      was for PuTTY’s configuration dialog box.</p>
    <p>The taskbar entry for the config box had the boring “default”
      icon, just representing a generic window frame, that Windows
      uses for any window that doesn’t supply a better one. I’d
      decided that looked ugly.</p>
    <p>Rather than just reuse the main PuTTY icon unmodified, I drew
      an icon to specifically represent configuration or modification,
      by overlaying a large spanner on top:</p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <p><img src="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/putty-icons/puttycfg-original.png" alt="[puttycfg-original.png]"/>

        </p>
      </div>
      <figcaption>The PuTTY configuration dialog icon, in colour and in
        monochrome</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For this icon I went back to including a monochrome version. I
      can’t remember why. Perhaps it was just that I was modifying an
      existing icon which <em>did</em> have a monochrome version!</p>
    <h2 id="script">Scripted era</h2>
    <p>Nothing else happened in this area until 2007.</p>
    <p>That was about when people started to complain that the 32 × 32
      pixel icons had started to look nasty. Displays had become
      bigger, and Windows was defaulting to displaying 48 × 48 icons
      instead of 32 × 32. So if your application only had a 32 × 32 icon,
      Windows would stretch it.</p>
    <p>It wouldn’t have looked great if a 32 × 32 icon had been
      magnified by an exact factor of 2 to 64 × 64, copying each input
      pixel the same number of times. But 48 isn’t even a multiple of
      32, so instead Windows had to stretch my
      icons <em>unevenly</em>, which looked even worse.</p>
    <p>Rather than hand-draw another full set of icons, I decided to
      get more ambitious. So I wrote a piece of code that drew all the
      components of each icon image in a programmatic way, so that I
      could run the script to auto-generate a full set of icons for
      every tool. That eliminated the inconsistency about which icons
      had tiny versions, and which ones had black and white versions:
      now <em>all</em> the icons had <em>all</em> versions.</p>
    <p>The hard part of that was the tiny 16 × 16 icons. I’d only
      drawn one of those so far, for Pageant. Now I had to try to
      capture the artistic judgment I’d used for the
      “hand-antialiasing” in that icon, and try to make a piece of
      software do the same thing for <em>all</em> the graphical
      components of the icon suite.</p>
    <p>I remember that being pretty hard work, but in the end I
      managed to make something I was happy with. After
      that, <em>every</em> icon had 48 × 48, 32 × 32 and 16 × 16
      icons.</p>

    <p>I stopped short of trying to make the program
      recreate <em>every</em> decision I’d made in the original
      drawing. I made quite a few of those decisions in a hurry
      without much thought, after all. So I just got the script to a
      point I was happy <em>enough</em> with. And I took the
      opportunity to improve on a few things: for
      example, <em>all</em> versions of the Pageant hatband are now
      antialiased, not just the tiny version.</p>
    <p>But there are other ways that the scripted icons
      don’t <em>exactly</em> match the original hand-drawn versions.
      The radio buttons below should let you flip back and forth
      between two example icons in the original and script-generated
      versions:</p>

    <p>The actual PuTTY icon is a pretty close match – only a small
      number of pixels changed. But the Pageant icon is quite
      different: apart from the deliberate change of the antialiased
      hatband, the computer in the icon isn’t even the
      same <em>size!</em> I can’t remember if that was a pure accident
      (maybe I didn’t flip back and forth between the two versions of
      that icon while I was writing the script), or a deliberate style
      change.</p>
    <p>(Of course, if I’d <em>wanted</em> to change the size of the
      computer, it would have been easier to do it using the script
      than redrawing by hand. So it would have made sense for it to be
      a deliberate change, now that the opportunity was available. But
      I don’t remember that it <em>was</em> deliberate.)</p>
    <p>As I said earlier, I made sure the script could generate a full
      set of black-and-white icons too, just in case. In 2007 I think
      it was even less likely that anyone would still be running
      Windows (or anything else) on a B&amp;W display, but one of the
      nice things about having this stuff done by a script is that you
      can get it to do a lot of hard work for you just in case. So now
      I have a full set of black and white icons too, even at the new
      size of 48 pixels:</p>

    <p>In 2002 I had ported a lot of the PuTTY code to Linux. I wrote
      a Linux version of the full GUI PuTTY application, and also
      reused part of the code as an X11 terminal
      emulator <code>pterm</code> which you could use in place of
      existing ones like <code>xterm</code>.</p>
    <p>Linux GUI applications can also have icons if they want to: an
      X11 program can set a property on its window, containing a
      bitmap to be used as its icon. Window managers vary
      in <em>what</em> they use this for – they might minimise the
      whole window to an icon in Windows 3.1 style, or display the
      icon in a taskbar entry in the style of more modern Windows, or
      display the icon somewhere in the application’s window frame, or
      anything else they can think of.</p>
    <p>I hadn’t done anything about this in 2002, partly because as
      far as I knew the toolkit library I was using (GTK 1) didn’t
      support setting an icon on the window, and also because it would
      have been a pain to provide the same icons in multiple bitmap
      file formats.</p>
    <p>But now that I was generating the icons from a script, it was
      suddenly much easier to make the script output multiple file
      formats. Also I found out that GTK 1 <em>did</em> let you set an
      icon property after all. (In any case, I already knew GTK 2
      could do that, and was planning an upgrade to that.) So, for
      both reasons, it was now practical to provide icons for the X11
      versions of the PuTTY tools.</p>
    <p>So I had to draw an icon for <code>pterm</code>, which didn’t
      already have one!</p>
    <p>This time, I really did run out of imagination.
      Since <code>pterm</code> doesn’t do any network communication, I
      simply drew an icon consisting of <em>just one</em> copy of the
      same computer logo seen in all the other icons, expanding it to
      the full size of the icon image. (A little bigger than it was for
      Pageant, since this time it didn’t have to fit under a hat.)</p>
    <p><code>pterm</code> also has a configuration dialog box, so I
      made a separate icon for that, reusing the same spanner overlay
      from PuTTY proper.</p>

    </figure>
    <p><em>Much</em> later, in 2021, it became possible to write a
      version of <code>pterm</code> that would run on Windows, and act
      as an alternative GUI container for an ordinary
      Windows <code>cmd.exe</code> or Powershell session. This icon
      became the one for Windows pterm as well, once that
      happened.</p>
    <h3 id="installer">Installer</h3>
    <p>The flexible icon-drawing script also let me support true
      colour icons as an extra output mode, so I wasn’t limited to the
      old 16-colour palette any more.</p>
    <p>That came in handy when I needed an icon for the
      PuTTY <em>installer</em>. I thought it would be nice to draw a
      cardboard box as part of that icon, with the flaps open at the
      top and a lightning bolt coming out of it pointing at a
      computer, suggesting “PuTTY is zapping out of this box on to
      your machine”. Cardboard boxes are brown, and brown wasn’t in
      the 16-colour icon palette – but now we weren’t limited to that
      palette any more, so I could draw a true-colour icon
      using <em>actual</em> brown!</p>
    <p>But I still wanted to support the 16-colour icons, because I
      never like to throw away backwards compatibility if I can avoid
      it. And I noticed that you could make <em>several</em>
      acceptable shades of brown by taking two different colours in
      the old Windows 16-colour icon palette, and mixing them 50:50.
      All my mixes involved the dark red (<span><code>#800000</code></span>); I got three
      different browns, or brown-enough colours, by mixing it with
      black (<span><code>#000000</code></span>), dark yellow
      (<span><code>#808000</code></span>), and full yellow
      (<span><code>#ffff00</code></span>).</p>
    <p>So I made the cardboard box out of those three 50-50 mixes,
      using them all to show that different parts of the box were at
      different angles to the light. That way, in the true-colour icon
      I could use a single colour that was the mean of the two old
      colours, and in the 16-colour version I halftoned it by
      alternating pixels of the <em>actual</em> two old colours.</p>

    <h2 id="svg">SVG revamp</h2>
    <p>My icon-drawing script works well at the ordinary 32 × 32 and
      48 × 48 sizes, and scales <em>down</em> to 16 × 16 reasonably
      well, but it doesn’t work so well when you start
      scaling <em>up</em>.</p>
    <p>So, if anyone needs <em>really big</em> versions of the icons,
      generating them by just running the same script with a bigger
      image size won’t produce very nice output. In one of my failed
      attempts to port PuTTY to the Mac, I found that MacOS wanted a
      128 × 128 icon to use in the dock, and the output of my script
      at that size was definitely not great.</p>
    <p>I’ve more or less given up on that Mac port now, but I thought
      that a fully scalable version of all the icons might still be a
      useful thing to have around. For one thing, it allows using them
      in contexts other than GUI icons. (Gratuitous merch, anyone?
      T-shirts? Laptop decals? 🙂)</p>
    <p>So, partly “just in case” but also for fun, I’ve been working
      on a second icon-drawing script. It mimics the same “thought
      processes” of the original script, but it outputs SVG files
      instead of bitmaps – keeping the artwork still as close as
      possible to the original style.</p>
    <p>As of now, these are my best efforts at the SVG versions:</p>

    <p>For the tiny icons, I still think my original script is doing a
      better rendering job, because SVG has no idea at all how best to
      do that antialiasing. But for <em>large</em> icons, especially
      in true colour, I think my recommendation is going to be to base
      them on these SVGs – just render to a big bitmap.</p>
    <h2 id="eof">That’s all, folks!</h2>
    <p>That’s the history and the current state of the PuTTY icon set.</p>
    <p>People sometimes object to the entire 1990s styling, and
      volunteer to design us a complete set of replacements in a
      different style. We’ve never liked any of them enough to adopt
      them. I think that’s probably <em>because</em> the 1990s styling
      is part of what makes PuTTY what it is – “reassuringly
      old-fashioned”. I don’t know if there’s <em>any</em> major
      redesign that we’d really be on board with.</p>
    <p>So I expect by now we’re likely to keep these icons, or
      something basically the same, for the whole lifetime of the
      project!</p>
