    <h1>The cursed universes of Dana Sibera</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p><em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens/" target="_blank">The Kickstarter for Shift Happens</a> still has 10 days to go.</em></p>

<p><em>And now for something completely different…</em></p>

<p>At first, <a href="https://mastodon.online/@NanoRaptor@bitbang.social" target="_blank">Dana Sibera</a>’s explorations might feel like just strange hypotheticals, visual madlibs, bored evenings in Photoshop. Here’s one example. A Mac IIsi made of marble. Why not?</p>
<p><img alt="Macintosh IIsi in Marble.

<p>A “landscape” PowerBook G4? Sure.</p>

<p>The #1 adjective others seem to put under <a href="https://mastodon.online/@NanoRaptor@bitbang.social" target="_blank">her creations routinely and casually shared on Mastodon</a> is <em>cursed.</em> Sibera seems to think likewise. “They are terrible for the most part, but better out of my head than in,” she wrote when I asked.</p>
<p>And sure, there are some truly cursed objects in Sibera’s collection:</p>
<p><img alt="Dual USB-C" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/dd70a59b-0726-4d77-adca-22481776e7d1.jpg"/>

<p>But the more you look at those strange concoctions, the more they are hinting at fascinating alternate universes that perhaps aren’t cursed at all. </p>
<p>Maybe there’s a parallel world where the design team at Apple decided that Newton should follow the same visual cues as the older, bigger machines:</p>
<p><img alt="Newton MessagePad 2000" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/f2b43619-e084-46a0-bc95-ee25b4ce9ac9.jpg"/>

<p>Or a universe where PowerBook got to reuse <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/10/20-macs-for-2020-11-macintosh-portable/" target="_blank">Macintosh Portable</a>’s styling:</p>
<p><img alt="Macintosh PowerPortable, with touchbar" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/4213f953-bf9c-418d-9d02-de7f968744c6.jpeg"/>
<small>Macintosh PowerPortable, with touchbar · <a href="https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1253652101416148992">Source</a></small></p>
<p>Or one where, some time later, early PowerBook livery got to continue well into the MacBook Air era:</p>
<p><img alt="Offspring of a PowerBook 100 and MacBook Air" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/f4e87ffe-b234-484b-9082-2c017246102c.jpeg"/>

<p>Maybe “foldables” don’t have to refer exclusively to phones?</p>
<p><img alt="The Titanium Powerbook G4 W" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/20a25632-d25a-4b39-aad5-a39be3d6c701.jpg"/>

<p>Maybe the Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Anniversary_Macintosh">20th Anniversary Mac</a> could have been released three years earlier?</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Seventeenth Anniversary Macintosh" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/b5ea0dc1-0b1a-4967-aeeb-e6d26aa14c32.jpg"/> 
<small>Apple Seventeenth Anniversary Macintosh. Of all the machines that have visited me from those nowhere places, this is the one I desire the most</small></p>
<p>Or Apple’s 16-bit version of a “keyboard computer,” a form factor so popular in the 1980s, could have actually happened?</p>
<p><img alt="The Macintosh Performa 110" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/388c4f30-f737-48b9-ab6e-f8ee4cd70674.jpg"/>
<small>The Macintosh Performa 110 was received poorly on release due to limited internal expandability, but just months later a speed bump to a 50Mhz 68030 and 24-bit colour at 832x624 cemented it as the most popular all-in-one classic gaming Mac · <a href="https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1420722306465206276">Source</a></small></p>
<p>Some of those explorations are beautiful and enthralling, like this imaginary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer" target="_blank">IBM PC 5150</a> in a tower case that matches the angular visual language of the rest of the machine’s components:</p>
<p><img alt="IBM 5150T" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/04a06f04-c425-4361-a112-132db2e51c4f.jpg"/>
<small>IBM 5150T · <a href="https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1282660168392536069">Source</a></small></p>
<p>Or, lastly, the handsome NeXTbook – a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">NeXT</a> laptop we never got to see, complete with a thoughtful set of arrow keys:</p>
<p><img alt="NeXTbook Turbo Color" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/82b9c460-da78-4c13-96bd-08b98beab832.jpg"/>

<p>Some of the images might be cursed, but one of the enduring qualities of Sibera’s work is also how <em>clever</em> a lot of it feels.</p>
<p>I like when she pokes fun at Apple’s (and design as a whole’s) pretentiousness…</p>
<p><img alt="Power Macintosh 9500-180MP" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/9fd3f9ed-4138-4f76-9911-26a598c034bf.jpg"/>

<p><img alt="30-inch PowerBook G4" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/cef16b13-1052-48ee-b386-7a0a8e40f1ec.jpg"/>

<p>These “mock-ups that mock” all feel great to me, a perfect antidote to the pretentious Jonny Ive white-room videos of the previous decade.</p>
<p>And where fun and cleverness intersect is where things get really interesting. Early “What You See Is What You Get” computers from Xerox had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto" target="_blank">screens based on pieces of paper</a>, so it stands to reason one could imagine an alternate timeline where we <em>just kept doing that:</em></p>
<p><img alt="PowerBook 190P" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d500e808-1d2c-4726-ae4f-ce5b64e6330e.jpg"/>

<p>This iPod Micro is a great commentary on both the longevity of arrow keys and perhaps the fact that sometimes creativity can be… overrated. I mean, wouldn’t you actually want this? Wouldn’t this have been better than the tiny click wheel?</p>
<p><img alt="iPod Micro" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/7c1c9412-0d24-4664-8cd6-dce38ba6c034.jpg"/>

<p>This mock-up below is obviously a joke, but in the 1980s, as electric typewriter manufacturers fought for survival in the world suddenly filled with home and office computers, there was at least one device that looked pretty much like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Apple PowerColorStylewriter 2284" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/49541b74-ac9b-4ebb-8236-b7ecf4c5e348.jpg"/>

<p>This hypothetical CRT iMac is extra funny if you know of what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac" target="_blank">eMac</a> was:</p>
<p><img alt="iMac 27&#34; CRT" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/2b23c0df-810e-4280-89ee-e56f2ca57e80.jpg"/>

<p>This is cute, sure, but if you ever wanted to play Wolfenstein 3D or Duke Nukem 3D on a computer that wasn’t capable enough, you will recognize this pattern immediately:</p>
<p><img alt="Canon Innova Book 10C" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/a286b7f1-2ad6-45e8-9fcf-687d0b2948d3.jpg"/>

<p>And, this is hilarious on its own, but doubly so if you know anything about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing" target="_blank">time-sharing</a> or the 1970s IBM computers that <a href="https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/1173830823931301888" target="_blank">split one screen between two users</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="The PowerBook 150s" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d0b84833-0d21-425c-9bc9-5f6d662e0cd0.jpg"/>
<small>The PowerBook 150s, designed to be used by two students at once in collaborative edu environments, was the last release of the PowerBook 100 line, and soon found to be more powerful than expected. Its unique ability to run two separate OS instances made it popular with sysadmins. · <a href="https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1606005972471730176">Source</a></small></p>

<p>Hidden within these photoshops (and occasionally renders) are great observations about how the world of technology actually functions.</p>
<p>An Apple Watch running Mac OS reminds us how many debates raged inside Apple about exactly what operating system should power iPhone and then Apple Watch – and how calling it “Mac OS X” early on was pretty confusing:</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Watch with Mac OS 9 and 640x870 colour portrait display" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/8422cffc-a4a6-4b56-b5a7-e60c6072cedc.jpg"/>

<p>This strange mock-up is not a Model M with a CRT…</p>
<p><img alt="Model M CRT" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d43ae629-bcb4-4fe7-a9e2-24b028681f04.jpg"/></p>
<p>…it’s an iMac! It’s an iMac if iMac was built at a very specific moment of time by a specific group of people working at Apple’s chief competitor, IBM. (In order words: it’s not about the idea, it’s about its execution.)</p>
<p>And this is really what your iPhone keyboard looks under the hood – the letter keys enlarging and shrinking themselves quietly and invisibly to accommodate your fingers:</p>
<p><img alt="Apple KeyChange Keyboard" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d2252c53-9391-4527-b5a7-eb4c1c89cfb4.jpg"/>

All versions of this innovative keyboard have keys resized to approximate their frequency of use in the keyboard’s language, allowing for smoother and more accurate typing. · <a href="https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1373589868446633984">Source</a></small></p>
<p>The explorations are fascinating because they’re a peek behind the curtain. You know a lot of these actually existed: maybe as ideas in people’s heads, sketches in designers’ notebooks, or as prototypes destroyed without ever being seen in public.</p>
<p>The beauty of <a href="https://mastodon.online/@NanoRaptor@bitbang.social" target="_blank">Sibera’s posts</a> (and something I am utterly ruining in this newsletter) is that they are not presented as “gee, I wonder what would a PowerBook G5 look like.” No, the descriptions appear as if the products actually existed – literal fake news – with realistic product names thrown in for good measure. (I encourage you to click through to the posts to see people’s reactions!)</p>
<p>Because you just <em>know</em> Apple wanted to release a 17” G3 notebook and you will know forever be annoyed that some part of our multiverse got to enjoy it:</p>
<p><img alt="Macintosh PowerBook G3 17&#34;" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d9a9c047-558a-447e-9d2c-6e46e3deb061.jpg"/>

<p><img alt="The Colour Classic V" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/65f7e8f4-2c2c-4320-a774-4a5c7fd5e3d2.jpg"/>

<p>You know Apple <em>must</em> have discussed using Zip disks as software delivery medium:</p>
<p><img alt="Mac system software from non-floppy-but-zip land" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/a949c216-eeb5-493f-be60-d2e377a08746.jpg"/>

<p><img alt="The Seventeenth Anniversary Macintosh vinyl" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/59940075-ca69-4467-8566-e7db417c3bab.jpg"/>

<p>There must have been a layout like this sketched out – or built! – somewhere:</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/f4808a31-6b9a-486f-93d3-45f2c5183ea5.jpg"/></p>
<p>And you know that some people wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Adjustable_Keyboard" target="_blank">Apple Adjustable</a> – that one sole Apple “ergonomic” keyboard that disappeared from the market so quickly – to be so much more.</p>
<p><img alt="Apple Adjustable Keyboard zen garden edition" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/d86cd5f9-f5ff-4c85-8a52-9e3f0d82db8b.jpg"/>

<p>Which brings us to keyboards. Sibera spends a lot of time imagining alternate keyboards, too. Here are some of my favorites.</p>
<p>This is Apple IIGS with… a built-in keyboard:</p>
<p><img alt="Apple IIgs" src="https://buttondown-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/3fa1a694-086f-447d-a338-a418bdb954e6.jpg"/>

<p>And, once IBM added F11 and F12 to the Model M and the whole keyboard universe moved from ten to twelve function keys, there were extra third-party appendages you could buy and bolt onto your older keyboard to get them. They didn’t look as cursed, of course. Or did they?</p>

<p>What does this all have to do with my book?</p>
<p>On the surface, nothing at all. None of Sibera’s work is in the book – the only “hypotheticals” and prototypes I put in Shift Happens are of “real” machines and prototypes.</p>
<p>But then, my book has two currents. The main line of history with inventions that ended up shaping the keyboards of today – the Remington, the Underwood, the Selectric, the Model M, the iPhone – is always surrounded by the fringes, the <a href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/a-love-letter-to-the-in-betweeners/" target="_blank">in-betweeners</a>, the one-offs. It’s so much fun looking at the stuff that didn’t make it, and ponder why. Because it is not always because the idea itself was bad.</p>
<p>Sibera’s work – that collection almost always anachronistic, and sometimes even <em>anarchic</em> – seems to be a love letter to those, even if by accident. Perhaps the idea here is simple: sometimes you have to see what <em>hasn’t</em> happened to learn more about the things that have.</p>
<p>I enjoy seeing them so much. The images I put in this newsletter are just a fraction of <a href="https://mastodon.online/@NanoRaptor@bitbang.social" target="_blank">Sibera’s output</a>. I hope one day this will be collated more properly – in a gallery, perhaps, or a book itself. They’re worth inspection and introspection.</p>

<p>But maybe I don’t have to overanalyze this, and just… I don’t know. Enjoy the ride?</p>
<p>Because this, this is <em>fun.</em> Wouldn’t you buy this in an instant, no matter how impractical it seems?</p>
