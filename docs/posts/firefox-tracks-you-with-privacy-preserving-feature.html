Similar to </span><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/google-sandbox-online-tracking-instead-privacy" title="https://noyb.eu/en/google-sandbox-online-tracking-instead-privacy"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Google’s (failed) Privacy Sandbox</span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, this turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites. The idea: instead of placing traditional tracking cookies, websites have to ask Firefox to store information about people’s ad interactions in order to receive the bundled data of multiple users.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><strong>Less invasive is still invasive.</strong> In this sense, </span><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution" title="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Mozilla claims</span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> that the development of “privacy preserving attribution” improves user privacy by allowing ad performance to be measured without individual websites collecting personal data. In reality, part of the tracking is now done directly in Firefox. While this may be less invasive than unlimited tracking, which is still the norm in the US, it still interferes with user rights under the EU’s GDPR. In reality, this tracking option doesn’t replace cookies either, but is simply an alternative - additional - way for websites to target advertising.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at </span><em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">: </span><em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“Mozilla has just bought into the narrative that the advertising industry has a right to track users by turning Firefox into an ad measurement tool. While Mozilla may have had good intentions, it is very unlikely that &#39;privacy preserving attribution&#39; will replace cookies and other tracking tools. It is just a new, additional means of tracking users.”</span></em></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><strong>Tracking by default, no information.</strong> To make matters worse, Mozilla has turned on its “privacy preserving attribution” by default. Users have not been informed about this move, nor have they been asked for their consent to be tracked by Firefox. The feature isn’t even mentioned in Mozilla’s data protection policies. The only way for users to turn it off is to find the opt-out function in a sub-menu of the browser’s settings. Irritatingly, </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@Schouten_B/112784434152717689" title="https://mastodon.social/@Schouten_B/112784434152717689"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">a Mozilla developer justifies the move</span></a><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> by claiming that users can’t make an informed decision.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at </span><em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">: </span><em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“It’s a shame that an organisation like Mozilla believes that users are too dumb to say yes or no. Users should be able to make a choice and the feature should have been turned off by default.”</span></em></p><p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><strong>Millions of European users are affected.</strong> </span><em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> asks the Austrian data protection authority (DSB) to investigate Mozilla’s behaviour. Mozilla should properly inform the complainant and other users about its data processing activities – and effectively switch to an opt-in system. In addition, the company should delete all unlawfully processed data. </span></p></div>
