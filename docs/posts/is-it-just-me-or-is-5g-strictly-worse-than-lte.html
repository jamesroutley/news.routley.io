    <h1>Ask HN: Is it just me or is 5G strictly worse than LTE?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I feel like signal is lower in general, and I run into a lot more cases where connections seem to hang entirely. In theory 5G should offer a lot more bandwidth, but I don&#39;t remember ever being bandwidth-limited on LTE. 20Mbps is plenty on my phone. Same for latency. I&#39;m not playing FPS games on my phone.</p><p>5G seems worse, but I used to work on a physical layer wireless technology and it might be placebo knowing that the higher frequencies used for 5G don&#39;t go as far or penetrate as effectively.</p></div></div></div>
