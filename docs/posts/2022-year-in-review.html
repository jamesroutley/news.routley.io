			    <p>I am not even sure what happened this year. A heck of a lot. A heck of a lot in the last three months, even.</p>
<p>Most of the year is wrapped up in <a href="https://thewebivore.com/what-happened-next/">What happened next</a>, although recently I am now on the market for a new day job.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve had three years in one year. This year I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lived in three different places, moving once in May and again in November</li>
<li>Went on a fair number of trips: Miami, Upstate NY, Kentucky (x3), Seattle, Palm Springs, DC</li>
<li>Ended a relationship</li>
<li>Started contracting to test out working with computers, made me want a day job</li>
<li>Interviews/job hunting</li>
<li>Accepted a day job</li>
<li>Bought a house</li>
<li>Got a <a href="https://www.birdsofpreyartistry.com/combo-brows/">brow tattoo</a> (my first tattoo!)</li>
<li>Rehomed one of my cats. After I started the day job, it wasn’t working out and she needed a home with more attention</li>
<li>Now looking for another job</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest difference since <a href="https://thewebivore.com/what-happened-next/">last month’s post</a> is that this first day job didn’t work out, so I’m actively interviewing for engineering leadership roles. Remote-only, working in software product engineering. If you’d like to chat with me, please reach out (no listings or recruiters please).</p>
<p>September –  December has been wild. I [unintentionally] started a job and went under contract to buy a house <em>the same day.</em> I moved three days after I closed on my house, hiring packers for the first time (weirdly emotional to have other people pack all your stuff). The dance studio had its annual showcase and I performed and made appearances in every number as a stagehand.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, me and the day job parted ways. Now I’m in some interesting conversations about what’s next with the day job. I still love dancing and teaching, and choreographed two routines appearing in tomorrow’s 2023 Mummers Parade!</p>
<p>For 2023, I have honestly no idea what is going to happen.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve had so much change and growth this year that I’m a bit “plans? lol” about the whole idea of “next year.” Even so, I’ve got anti-winter in Argentina in a few weeks (where I’ll spend some quality time working on my tango), and I’m booking camping for the spring/summer ASAP.</p>
<p>2023 will turn out how it’s meant to turn out.</p>
