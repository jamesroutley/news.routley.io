But with the support of environmental groups nationwide, and an early $500 million from Bloomberg, the campaign managed to shut down more than half of the nation’s coal plants by 2022, <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/michael-bloomberg-pumps-500-million-into-bid-close-all-us-coal-plants-2023-09-20/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/michael-bloomberg-pumps-500-million-into-bid-close-all-us-coal-plants-2023-09-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters reported</a></span>. </p><p>Bloomberg had long championed environmental and climate causes.
