Which you can read, right here…</p><p>—</p><p>Well… a former boss told me this story about his time at a giant US telco, back in the mid/late 1990s.</p><p>People up-high initiated some major org restructure. In the course of housekeeping, he / his team found an absolutely giant shell script (10K LoC types, IIRC).</p><p>It was called DISASTER. Yes, in all caps.</p><p>There was no documentation, obviously. So they asked around and found nobody knew anything inside the org. And then some old timer said to contact &#34;Bill&#34;, a retired old timer to ask if he knew anything. The moment &#34;Bill&#34; heard that someone was planning to trash the script he yelled &#34;Don&#39;t do that!!!&#34;.</p><p>It turned out that the script was the only thing that knew how to bootstrap the Telco&#39;s entire system from scratch in the event of a total continent-wide disaster/outage. Right from finding switches and network equipment/hardware to recover/restart, in what sequence etc.</p><p>The script was authored sometime in the 1980s.</p><p>—</p><blockquote><p>What are folks’ views on systems so large where cold-starting the whole system is almost impossible?</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;d be surprised if there existed a system where cold-starting it is <em>impossible</em>.</p><p>I&#39;d agree it would be impossible to restore it to its former shape and state.</p><p>Evolution, for example, has shown itself to be surprisingly resilient, having come back from near-zero not just once, but several times.</p><p>It&#39;s a very interesting line of questioning.</p><p>Consider what would it take to reboot civilization as we know it? It <em>is</em> a system, make no mistake.</p><p>One insight that bowls me over is, we would need to recover the ability to make precision screws (as in precision threading).</p><p>So much of the modern world depends on our mastery over materials (to make a precision screw, you need a precision-machined harder material—diamond / titanium—to work on a softer material—steel), and our ability to turn rotary motion to linear motion (it&#39;s stupidly difficult to reliably precision-machine a harder material without even more precise linear + rotary motion—lathe/CNC machine). Hence, a bootstrap problem.</p><p>In fact, I&#39;d recommend looking <em>way</em> outside software to see how people think about recovering from catastrophic losses / shutdowns. Electric grid systems, supply chains, political succession, military planning, medicine and so forth.</p><p>One of the common lessons is to compartmentalise, so that at least something can be restored. Another is to have some sort of self-diagnosis going on so that one can do something at least while the whole thing is going down. A third is to have a seed of a backup—memory and know-how—from which to restore the atomic parts of the thing.</p><p>None of this works if there is no disaster plan, btw. Even though nothing will go as planned, it&#39;s important to have the memory and expertise that did the planning, becuase that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be able to think through the as-yet- unknown-unknowns, when the inevitable FUBAR situation suddenly happens later.</p><p>Apropos long-range planet-scale disaster planning + execution, H.E.B.&#39;s story is one of the more interesting stories I came across:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/heb-prepared-coronavirus-pandemic/">Inside the Story of How H-E-B Planned for the Pandemic</a></p><p>The grocer started communicating with its Chinese counterparts in January and was running tabletop simulations a few weeks later. (But nothing prepared it for the rush on toilet paper.)</p><p>— By Dan Solomon and Paula Forbes, March 26, 2020, Texas Monthly</p></blockquote><p>—</p><p>Another colleague in the chat remarked up-thread (apropos cold reboot thinking):</p><blockquote><p>I have seen this at &lt;Indian eCommerce Giant&gt; and at &lt;a FAANG&gt;. Most of it is related to cached data. Cold starts with empty caches causes too much load on databases. And then the failures cascade.</p><p>— Another M&#39;colleague in the Slackroom.</p></blockquote><p>Not at all ironically, I&#39;ve seen this at home. Thanks to the Indian Navy background, we keep semi-annually-revised &#34;death files&#34; at home. A very practical, not at all morbid (despite the name), response to the uncertainty of the human organism&#39;s uptime.</p><p>On the occurrence of the inevitable, one can&#39;t restore the family system to it&#39;s former state, but one can restore a lot of mechanical functionality.</p><p>The same thinking applies — backups/nominations, succession planning and transfers of ownership and control, post-hoc admin action items etc.</p><p>—</p><blockquote><p>What are folks’ views on systems so large where cold-starting the whole system is almost impossible?</p></blockquote><p>Suffice to say, I think of it as systems so <em>complex</em> where cold-starting is highly improbable, and restoring to former state is impossible (because, entropy).</p><p>Ask a heart surgeon trying to save a person&#39;s life. They literally cold-reboot people!</p><p>I can be convinced to argue that—barring a few exceptions, like the Internet and the WWW—the software systems we create are <em>tame</em> complexity-wise, compared to organic / social systems.</p><p>In abstract terms, many Google-likes and Apple-likes and Amazon-likes are possible. i.e. if you hard-stopped one of those, odds are you can re-create things that behave like those. You are guaranteed to never get back exactly Google, or Apple, or Aamzon. But you can ground-up create verisimilar entities. They&#39;ve happened, in fact (Yahoo, Nokia, Baidu, Yandex, Alibaba, Samsung, etc.).</p><p>The Internet/WWW is orders of magnitude harder to recreate. But maybe also orders of magnitude harder to prevent permanently…</p><p>To prevent the Internet from happening—the entire computer industry for that matter—we&#39;d have to go back very far in history and punch people in the face just before they got excellent insights. Like electromagnetism, fourier transforms, quantum mechanics, and so forth—and that&#39;s just the electrical engineering parts.</p><p>And it still wouldn&#39;t guarantee the prevention of some kind of planet-scale Inter-networked communication system. (Due to the fallacy of the &#34;Great man&#34; hypothesis.)</p><p>Tying electrical + quantum mechanical engineering back up-thread to the point about precision screws, and rotory control, hard drives present themselves as an interesting case study…</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/23/hard-disk-drives-have-made-precision-engineering-commonplace/">Hard Disk Drives Have Made Precision Engineering Commonplace</a></p><p>Modern-day hard disk drives (HDDs) hold the interesting juxtaposition of being simultaneously the pinnacle of mass-produced, high-precision mechanical engineering, as well as the most scorned storage…</p></blockquote><p>And at this point I realised…</p><blockquote><p>Hey, I just wrote a blog post :p :)</p></blockquote><p>and stopped the wall-of-texting. <em>But</em> you and I can keep riffing, if you like long-running email conversations…</p></section></article></div></div>
