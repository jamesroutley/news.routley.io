<h2 id="_abstract">Abstract</h2>
<div>
<p>The release notes for FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE contain a summary of
the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 13-STABLE
development line. This document lists applicable security
advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as
significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief
remarks on upgrading are also presented.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD
13.2-RELEASE. It describes recently added, changed, or deleted
features of FreeBSD. It also provides some notes on upgrading from
previous versions of FreeBSD.</p>
<p>The release distribution to which these release notes apply
represents the latest point along the 13-STABLE development branch
since 13-STABLE was created. Information regarding pre-built,
binary release distributions along this branch can be found at
<a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/">https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>.</p>
<p>The release distribution to which these release notes apply
represents a point along the 13-STABLE development branch between
13.1-RELEASE and the future 13.3-RELEASE. Information regarding
pre-built, binary release distributions along this branch can be
found at <a href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/">https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/</a>.</p>

<p>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
installing FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with
&#34;late-breaking&#34; information discovered late in the release cycle or
after the release. Typically, it contains information on known
bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation. An
up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE can be found
on the FreeBSD Web site.</p>
<p>This document describes the most user-visible new or changed
features in FreeBSD since 13.1-RELEASE. In general, changes
described here are unique to the 13-STABLE branch unless
specifically marked as MERGED features.</p>
<p>Typical release note items document recent security advisories
issued after 13.1-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new
commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software
upgrades. They may also list changes to major ports/packages or
release engineering practices. Clearly the release notes cannot
list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this
document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible
changes, and major architectural improvements.</p>

<h2 id="upgrade">Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD</h2>
<div>
<p>Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the
various security branches) are supported using the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
freebsd-update(8)</a> utility. The binary upgrade procedure will
update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC
kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release. The
<a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=freebsd-update&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
freebsd-update(8)</a> utility requires that the host being upgraded
have Internet connectivity.</p>
<p>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD
base system from source code) from previous versions are supported,
according to the instructions in <span>/usr/src/UPDATING</span>.</p>
<p>Users of all PowerPC architectures, after successful kernel and
world installation, must run <code>kldxref /boot/kernel</code>
manually.</p>
<div>

<p>After installing the new userland software, running daemons are
still from the previous version. After installing the user-level
components with the second invocation of freebsd-update, or via an
upgrade from source with <code>installworld</code>, the system
should be rebooted to start everything with the new software. For
example, older versions of <code>sshd</code> failed to process
incoming connections correctly after the new <span>/usr/sbin/sshd</span> was installed; rebooting started a
new <code>sshd</code> and other daemons.</p>

<div>
<p>This section covers changes and additions to userland
applications, contributed software, and system utilities.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="userland-config">Userland Configuration Changes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=growfs&amp;sektion=7&amp;format=html">
growfs(7)</a> startup script will now add a swap partition while
expanding the root file system if possible, and if one did not
previously exist. This is primarily useful when installing on an SD
card using a raw image. A new <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;format=html">
rc.conf(5)</a> variable has been added,
<code>growfs_swap_size</code>, which can control the addition if
necessary. See <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=growfs&amp;sektion=7&amp;format=html">
growfs(7)</a> for details.</p>
<p>The <code>zfskeys</code> startup script supports autoloading of
keys stored on ZFS. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=2411090f6940">2411090f6940</a>
(Sponsored by Klara Inc.)</p>
<p>A new RC script, <code>zpoolreguid</code> has been added, which
will assign a new GUID to one or more zpools, useful for
virtualization environments when sharing datasets.</p>
<p>The <code>hostid</code> startup script will now generate a
random (version 4) UUID if there is no <span>/etc/hostid</span> file and no valid UUID from hardware.
Also, if there is no <span>/etc/machine-id</span>
file, the <code>hostid_save</code> script will store a compact
version of the hostid (one without hyphens) in <span>/etc/machine-id</span>. This file is used by libraries
such as GLib. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=17333d92643d">17333d92643d</a>

<a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=71d88613d129">71d88613d129</a></p>
<p>It is now possible to add default routes for FIBs other than the
primary by using the <code>defaultrouter_fibN</code> and
<code>ipv6_defaultrouter_fibN</code> <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;format=html">

<h3 id="userland-programs">Userland Application Changes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
bhyve(8)</a> utility has gained virtio-input device emulation
support. This will be used to inject keyboard/mouse input events
into a guest. The command line syntax is: <code>-s
&lt;slot&gt;,virtio-input,/dev/input/eventX</code>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=6192776124c5">6192776124c5</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kdump&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
kdump(1)</a> utility has gained support for decoding Linux system
calls.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=killall&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
killall(1)</a> utility now allows sending signals to processes with
their controlling terminal on <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pts&amp;sektion=4&amp;format=html">
pts(4)</a> using the syntax <code>-t pts/N</code>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=a76fa7bb6cb7">a76fa7bb6cb7</a></p>
<p>An <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nproc&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
nproc(1)</a> utility has been added, compatible with the Linux
program of the same name.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=timeout&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
timeout(1)</a> utility has been moved from <span>/usr/bin</span> to <span>/bin</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pciconf&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
pciconf(8)</a> utility has added support for decoding ACS extended
capability. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=dde4103a465b">dde4103a465b</a>
(Sponsored by Chelsio Communications)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=procstat&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
procstat(1)</a> utility can now print information about advisory
locks on files with the newly added <code>advlock</code> command.
<a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=f9daaf452a8a">f9daaf452a8a</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pwd_mkdb&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
pwd_mkdb(8)</a> utility no longer copies comments from <span>/etc/master.passwd</span> to <span>/etc/passwd</span>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=3e955733117d">3e955733117d</a></p>

<p>Metric aliasing has been changed in <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=prometheus_sysctl_exporter&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
prometheus_sysctl_exporter(8)</a> to avoid confusing Prometheus
server due to conflicting metric names. The
<code>tcp_log_bucket</code> UMA zone has been renamed to
<code>tcp_log_id_bucket</code>, and <code>tcp_log_node</code> was
renamed to <code>tcp_log_id_node</code> for consistency. Sysctl
variables with <code>(LEGACY)</code> in their descriptions are no
longer being exported, these are used by ZFS sysctls that have been
replaced by others, many of which alias to the same Prometheus
metric name (like <code>vfs.zfs.arc_max</code> and
<code>vfs.zfs.arc.max</code>). <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=e4f508d5a211">e4f508d5a211</a>

a random UUID, version 4. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=8fd1953b7eb2">8fd1953b7eb2</a></p>
<p>When invoked by <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">

<div>
<h3 id="kernel-general">General Kernel Changes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">
bhyve(8)</a> hypervisor and kernel module <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vmm&amp;sektion=4&amp;format=html">
vmm(4)</a> now support more than 16 vCPUs in a guest. By default
bhyve permits each guest to create the same number of vCPUs as the
count of physical CPUs on the host. This limit can be adjusted via
the loader tunable <code>hw.vmm.maxcpu</code>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=3e02f8809aec">3e02f8809aec</a></p>
<p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is enabled for 64-bit
executables by default. It can be disabled as needed if
applications fail unexpectedly, for example with segmentation
faults. To disable for a single invocation, use the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=proccontrol&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
proccontrol(1)</a> command: <code>proccontrol -m aslr -s disable
command</code>. To disable ASLR for all invocations of a binary,
use the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=elfctl&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">
elfctl(1)</a> command: <code>elfctl -e +noaslr file</code>.
Problems should be reported via the problem reporting system,
<a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org">https://bugs.freebsd.org</a>, or posting to the
<code>freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org</code> mailing list. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=10192e77cfac">10192e77cfac</a>

<p>A workaround has been implemented for an apparent hardware page
invalidation problem on Intel Alder Lake (twelfth generation) and
probably Raptor Lake (thirteenth generation) hybrid CPUs. The bug
can lead to file system corruption with UFS and MSDOSFS, and
probably other memory corruption. The slower cores (E-cores)
automatically use a slower method of page invalidation with the
workaround. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=567cc4e6bfd9">567cc4e6bfd9</a>

<p>A new kernel configuration knob is available,
<code>SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG</code>, which controls splitting of kernel
and module debug data into separate standalone files. This
interacts with the <code>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code> option,
which operates differently than in 13.0-RELEASE and 13.1-RELEASE,
but similarly to prior releases; it now controls only installation
of the debug data. The defaults are
<code>WITH_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code> and
<code>WITH_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG</code>, allowing the kernel and
modules without debug data to be installed in <span>/boot</span>, and standalone debugging files to be
installed in <span>/usr/lib/debug</span>, as was
done by default in releases before 13.0-RELEASE. Using
<code>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code> and
<code>WITH_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG</code>, standalone debugging files
are generated but not installed, as when using
<code>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code> in releases before
13.0-RELEASE. Finally, using <code>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code>
and <code>WITHOUT_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG</code> installs the kernel and
modules with built-in debugging information in <span>/boot</span>, as in 13.1-RELEASE using
<code>WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS</code>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=0c4d13c521aa">0c4d13c521aa</a>

<p>On the PowerPC, a radix pmap in pseries is supported for ISA
3.0. This should make pseries significantly faster on POWER9
instances, as fewer hypercalls are needed to manage pmap now.
<a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=c74c77531248">c74c77531248</a></p>

<p>In order to facilitate ABI compatibility of <code>stable</code>
branches, the CPU affinity system calls are now more tolerant of
CPU sets that are smaller than used by the kernel. This will
facilitate increases to the size of the kernel set,
<code>MAXCPU</code>. <a href="https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=72bc1e6806cc">72bc1e6806cc</a></p>

<p>vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object) support has been nearly

socket to exchange configuration information between user space and
kernel. It is used by third-party routing programs and by the
<a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=linux&amp;sektion=4&amp;format=html">
linux(4)</a> ABI. The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=netlink&amp;sektion=4&amp;format=html">
netlink(4)</a> protocol is not included in the GENERIC
configuration in 13.2-RELEASE, but is available as a kernel module.

<h3 id="future-releases-cputype">Default <code>CPUTYPE</code>
Change</h3>
<p>Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default <code>CPUTYPE</code> for
the i386 architecture will change from <code>486</code> to
<code>686</code>.</p>
<p>This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a
686-class CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by
the FreeBSD Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.x will continue to
support older CPUs, however users needing this functionality will
need to build their own releases for official support.</p>
<p>As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the
embedded market, the general end-user impact is expected to be
minimal, as new hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and
much of the deployed base of such systems is nearing retirement
age, statistically.</p>
<p>There were several factors taken into account for this change.
For example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can
be emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland.
Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their
inception.</p>
<p>As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using
the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the
<code>COMPAT_FREEBSD32</code> option in the kernel, this change
ensures better coverage and user experience. This also aligns with
what the majority of Linux® distributions have been doing for quite
some time.</p>
<p>This is expected to be the final bump of the default
<code>CPUTYPE</code> in i386.</p>
