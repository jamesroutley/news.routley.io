<h3>Downloading</h3>



<p>The sheet is available as an xlsb (Excel binary) file in the <a href="https://github.com/ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Releases section</a> of the github repo. You should be able to download and run this file in Excel for Mac or PC.</p>



<h3>Using</h3>



<p>If you’re quickly trying to orient yourself to the spreadsheet this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjD2n_e9E3w">walk through video</a> may be helpful though it is not oriented to beginners. For beginners, it’s recommended to start with the lesson videos.</p>



<p>Please realize the implementation is just enough to run very small workloads:</p>



<ul>
<li>Full GPT2 small (124M parameters) model including byte pair encoding, embeddings, multi-headed attention, and multi-layer perceptron stages</li>



<li>Inference/forward pass only (no training)</li>



<li>Context is limited to 10 tokens in length</li>



<li>10 characters per word limit</li>



<li>Zero temperature output only</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>This sheet is very big.</strong> Unfortunately, it is not unusual for Excel to lock up (but only on a Mac) while using this spreadsheet. It is highly recommended to use the manual calculation mode in Excel and the Windows version of Excel (either on a Windows directory or via Parallels on a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>



<h3>What about Google Sheets?</h3>



<p>This project actually started on Google Sheets but the full 124M model was too big and switched to Excel. I’m still exploring ways to make this work in Google Sheets but it is unlikely to fit into a single file as it can with Excel.</p>



<h3>Why can’t I chat with it like ChatGPT? It doesn’t match the output of ChatGPT?</h3>



<p>Aside from the minuscule context length, it also lacks the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that turn a large language model into a chatbot.</p>



<h3>Why is it called Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need</h3>



<p>The name is a play on the title of the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a> paper which first described the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer machine learning architecture</a> that underlies ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and many of the latest Generative AI tools.</p>
