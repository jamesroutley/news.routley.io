    <h1>Palantir Is Extending Its Reach Even Further into Government</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>“We are teaming up with Accenture Federal Services to accelerate AI across the U.S. Government, working to address federal agencies’ highest-priority operational challenges,” Palantir posted to X last month.</p><p>&#34;What makes this partnership so uniquely powerful is Accenture’s expertise working with the federal government and our ability to bring commercial capabilities to government solutions, combined with Palantir’s deep experience in government software,&#34; Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, said in a press release. “Together, we will harness the ever-growing power of AI to help the federal government succeed in its critical mission to modernize and reinvent its operations—with stronger data flows, transparency and resilience—to better serve warfighters, citizens and all its stakeholders.”</p><p>Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>While Palantir has become a major government contractor in its own right, partnering with contracting giants could enable the software company to scale at a much faster rate, leveraging long-standing relationships these larger contractors have with virtually every federal agency. “It&#39;s actually a pretty savvy business decision on the part of both Palantir, then also what you would call a traditional, more legacy-oriented, like defense or just government contractors,” says Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law at George Washington University. “If they’re newer to certain areas and others have that footprint, that’s how it would benefit Palantir.”</p><p>Last week, Palantir and Deloitte announced a partnership that includes what they call the “Enterprise Operating System” (EOS) to unify data across organizations. At government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and reportedly at the Social Security Administration (SSA), Palantir is already working to combine agency datasets, allowing what were previously disparate datasets to communicate with one another more easily.</p><p>&#34;Deloitte shares Palantir&#39;s commitment to decisive action and a dedication to delivering meaningful, lasting results for commercial and government clients,&#34; said Jason Girzadas, Deloitte US CEO, said in a press release announcing the partnership. &#34;Expanding our preferred relationship at this pivotal moment provides our clients with Palantir&#39;s latest advances in AI, combined with Deloitte&#39;s engineering scale and deep sector experience.&#34;</p><p>Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Palantir struck some of these deals prior to Trump taking office as well. In December of last year, <a data-offer-url="https://www.boozallen.com/menu/media-center/q3-2025/partnership-to-accelerate-defense-mission-innovation.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.boozallen.com/menu/media-center/q3-2025/partnership-to-accelerate-defense-mission-innovation.html&#34;}" href="https://www.boozallen.com/menu/media-center/q3-2025/partnership-to-accelerate-defense-mission-innovation.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Booz Allen partnered with Palantir</a> specifically, working together on building out defense IT infrastructure.</p><p>“To have one company monopolize and become the gatekeeper of software in the government, to become an ‘app factory,’ for the government, in a sense, where they&#39;re in every agency, they&#39;re part of the defense complex and the intelligence complex, brings huge concerns regarding fairness, regarding competition, and puts Palantir in a very unique position that maybe has never existed,” says Juan Sebastián Pinto, a former Palantir employee and critic of the company.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
