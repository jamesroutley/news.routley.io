    <h1>Bitwarden Backup Utility</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><astro-slot> <div> <div> <p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/bitwarden_backup.webp" alt="Bitwarden Backup Utility&#39;s cover image" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="400" height="400"/> </p> </div> <p> Bitwarden, a popular open source and free password manager, does a great job of securely storing passwords and other personal data in their cloud, well-encrypted and accessible. However, their option to export your vault (to maintain a local/physical backup) is to export it as a .json file, leaving data in a very human-unfriendly format. So, I made a program that converts the json to a more human readable html file, which one can print onto physical paper. In addition, I&#39;ve integrated automatic favicon/icon fetching, QR code generation, databreach checks and more.
