# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime &#34;panic at the disco&#34; in production is dope
# - &#34;something broke&#34; is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, &#34;used by kubernetes&#34;
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - no official documentation (other than a specification for implementers) is totally fine
# - you need a super safe way to &#34;execute this code&#34;

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say &#34;executable yaml&#34;?? 🍿

# 🚨 Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway 🚨
# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write &#34;true&#34; or &#34;false.&#34;
# You have to wrap &#34;NO&#34; in quotes to get the expected result.
NI: Nicaragua
NL: Netherlands
NO: Norway # 💣!

# YAML knows that, when you have something that looks like the time of day,
# what you _really_ wanted is the time of seconds since midnight
timeOfDay:
  whatYouWrote: 04:30 # And when you parse this file and serialize it again, you get ...
  whatYouSurelyMeant: 16200 # Have fun debugging this one!
  whatYouShouldHaveWritten: !!str 04:30

# YAML is the super best way to encode Octal (tm) and learning the hard way that Kubernetes uses YAML 1.1
# is a DevOps rite of passage. Below YAML 1.2 a large integer is automatically converted to octal.
- YAML 1.1 uses `0666` notation.
- YAML 1.2 uses `0o666` notation
	
# 🤢 I have recently been learning GitHub Actions
#
# I just made 8 commits/pushes in one hour, and the last commit message, in its entirety, was:
#
# &#34;I don&#39;t really like yml&#34;

# Speaking of CI, did you know that 8-character SHAs could be all numbers?
# If the system that parses `my.flaky_version` is typed, it will happily explode 2% of the time.
my:
	# this will be a string ~98% of the time
	flaky_version: ${GIT_SHORT_SHA}
	# this will be a string ~100% of the time
	string_version: &#34;${GIT_SHORT_SHA}&#34;

#
# &#34;Today we’re going to look at some general problems with the YAML format&#34;
# 👉 https://arp242.net/yaml-config.html 👈
#
# &#34;We replaced 1,000 lines of YAML with 10 structs and people started contributing again&#34;

#
# &#34;What if you used the same language and tools you use to define your app to define your infrastructure?&#34;
# 👉 https://twitter.com/ellism/status/1008728148131733504 👈
#
# &#34;A YAML file is almost always still &#39;valid&#39; even if it is trunca&#34;
# 👉 https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1057316977457324032 👈
#
# &#34;the bug was that the YAML parser ignored the negative signs ... so negative GPS coordinates became positive ones&#34;
# 👉 https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1063470541464461312 👈
#
# &#34;Every YAML parser is a custom YAML parser&#34;

# &#34;There are 63 different ways to write multi-line strings in YAML&#34;

# 📖 Footnotes 📖
# [1] You can do comments in json by `{&#34;//&#34;: &#34;A way to use comments in json&#34;}` but it&#39;s icky.

# and finally, here&#39;s some ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ feedback from reddit.com:
- I need to burn the very motherboard this site runs from. It’s that awful.
- This is the worst website I&#39;ve ever seen
- I agree with the author in principle but that website is inexcusable. I&#39;m going to add YAML config to my projects on Monday just to spite that horrific &#34;website&#34;.
- Wtf is this website and why does it repeatedly pop up my phone&#39;s keyboard
	- This Website is a giant editable textfield
		- Why?!?
			- Because it’s a good idea to demonstrate good standards while standing on one’s soapbox
				- The author of THAT website wants to tell the rest of us how to program.
- While I agree with the spirit of the website (fuck yaml), the design decisions of the author are questionable to say the least.
- The good news (I realised) was that you can select all the text of the site, and then delete it. Problem solved.
- Fuck this website. Maybe if this person stopped bitching about yaml their website wouldn&#39;t blow.
- Yeah, I’m not going to take advice on best practices from a guy whose website is a giant editable text field with unclickable hyperlinks.

# ps. By design, this website is as usable as YAML. 💕
