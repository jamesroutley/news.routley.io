<p>
  The late <a href="https://multicians.org/multicians.html#Bensoussan" title="Multician: Designer (GE/CISL): File manager, Initialization, AIM, NSS.">André Bensoussan</a> worked with me on the Multics operating system at Honeywell in Cambridge. 
  We were working on a <a href="https://multicians.org/mgn.html#NSS" title="glossary: New Storage System. MR 4.0 included a rewritten storage...">major change</a> to the file system, 
  which required a subsystem, the <a href="https://multicians.org/mgv.html#VTOC" title="glossary: Volume Table of Contents. Region of a physical volume...">VTOC</a> manager, 
  to manage file description information. 
  It had to transport the file information between disk and memory,
  manage a shared memory buffer pool, 
  and manage space on disk for the information. 
  In other words, it was a small virtual memory manager.
</p>

<p>
  André took on the job of design, implementation, and test of the VTOC manager.
  He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams. 
  I was the project coordinator, 
  so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were going. 
  &#34;Still designing,&#34; he&#39;d say. 
  He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful and symmetrical as well as capturing all the state information.
  I was getting nervous about the schedule, 
  so I was glad when he finally began writing code.
  He wrote in pencil, at his desk, instead of using a terminal.
  He declined offers of typing help, and just kept writing away in pencil.
  He rewrote parts, copied things over, erased and rewrote.
</p>

<p>
  Finally André took his neat final pencil copy to a terminal and typed the whole program in.
  His first compilation attempt failed; he corrected three typos, tried again, and the code compiled. 
  We bound it into the system and tried it out, and it worked the first time.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, <a href="https://multicians.org/vtoc_man.html" title="PL/I source of the Multics storage system VTOC manager.">the VTOC manager</a> worked perfectly from then on.
  Only one bug was ever found in it, and that was my fault: 
  André had asked me the calling sequence for an error procedure, 
  and I&#39;d guessed instead of looking it up, so it crashed the first time it hit an error. 
  Beyond that the program was perfect.
</p>

<p>
  How did André do this, with no tool but a pencil?
