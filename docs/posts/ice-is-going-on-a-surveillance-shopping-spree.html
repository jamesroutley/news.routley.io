    <h1>ICE Is Going on a Surveillance Shopping Spree</h1>

    <div><div><div><p><span>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new budget under the current administration, and they are going on a surveillance tech shopping spree. Standing at </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"><span>$28.7 billion dollars for the year 2025 (nearly triple their 2024 budget)</span></a><span> and at least another $56.25 billion over the next three years, ICE&#39;s budget would be the envy of many national militaries around the world. Indeed, this budget would put ICE as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_highest_military_expenditures"><span>14th most well-funded military in the world, right between Ukraine and Israel</span></a><span>.  </span></p>
<p><span>There are many different agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that deal with immigration, as well as non-immigration related agencies such as Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ICE is specifically the enforcement arm of the U.S. immigration apparatus. Their stated mission is to “[p]rotect America through criminal investigations and enforcing immigration laws to preserve national security and public safety.” </span></p>
<p><span>Of course, ICE doesn’t just end up targeting, </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/ice-wants-go-after-dissenters-well-immigrants"><span>surveilling</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will"><span>harassing</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/06/vancouver-ice-alleged-crushing-legs/"><span>assaulting</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/woman-says-she-was-detained-by-ice-in-minneapolis-for-being-a-citizen-observer/"><span>detaining</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/estados-unidos-nuevas-investigaciones-revelan-violaciones-de-derechos-humanos-en-los-centros-de-detencion-de-alligator-alcatraz-y-krome-en-florida/"><span>torturing</span></a><span> people who are undocumented immigrants. They have </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will"><span>targeted people</span></a><span> on </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/30/tacoma-hillsboro-victor-cruz-ice-immigration-oregon-law-enforcement/"><span>work permits</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/ice-kidnapped-my-neighbor-in-broad-daylight-the-aftermath-left-me-reeling/"><span>asylum seekers</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/ice-lawsuit-violent-assault"><span>permanent residents</span></a><span> (people holding “green cards”), </span><a href="https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/ice-arrest-cedar-riverside-minneapolis-somali-man/"><span>naturalized citizens</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/i-m-citizen-ice-wrongfully-detained-me-21244415.php"><span>even citizens by birth.</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><span>While the NSA and FBI might be the first agencies that come to mind when thinking about surveillance in the U.S., ICE should not be discounted. ICE has always engaged in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/ice-releases-documents-detailing-electronic-surveillance-problems-and-then-demands"><span>surveillance</span></a><span> and intelligence-gathering as part of their mission. A </span><a href="https://americandragnet.org/"><span>2022 report</span></a><span> by Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology found the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>ICE had scanned the driver’s license photos of 1 in 3 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE had access to the driver’s license data of 3 in 4 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE was tracking the movements of drivers in cities home to 3 in 4 adults.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE could locate 3 in 4 adults through their utility records.</span></li>
<li><span>​​ICE built its surveillance dragnet by tapping data from private companies and state and local bureaucracies.</span></li>
<li><span>ICE spent approximately $2.8 billion between 2008 and 2021 on new surveillance, data collection and data-sharing programs. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With a budget for 2025 that is 10 times the size of the agency’s total surveillance spending over the last 13 years, ICE is going on a shopping spree, creating one of the largest, most comprehensive domestic surveillance machines in history. </span></p>
<h2><span>How We Got Here</span></h2>
<p><span>The entire surveillance industry has been allowed to grow and flourish under both Democratic and Republican regimes. For example, President Obama dramatically expanded ICE from its more limited origins, while at the same time narrowing its focus to undocumented people accused of crimes. Under the first and second Trump administrations, ICE ramped up its operations significantly, increasing raids in major cities far from the southern border and casting a much wider net on potential targets. ICE has most recently expanded its partnerships with sheriffs across the U.S., and deported more than 1.5 million people cumulatively under the Trump administrations (600,000 of those were just during the first year of Trump’s second term </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/10/thanks-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-more-25-million-illegal-aliens-left-us"><span>according to DHS statistics</span></a><span>), not including the 1.6 million people DHS claims have “self-deported.” More horrifying is that in just the last year of the current administration, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251217221208/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_in_the_second_Trump_administration"><span>4,250 people</span></a><span> detained by ICE </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2025/03/17/ice-has-disappeared-48-new-mexico-residents-attorneys-say/"><span>have</span></a> <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article312042943.html"><span>gone</span></a> <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/could-ice-have-lost-3000-immigrant-arrestees-in-chicago/3844220/"><span>missing</span></a><span>, and 31 have died </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline"><span>in custody</span></a><span> or while </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-farmworker-dies-immigration-raid-rcna218467"><span>being detained</span></a><span>. In contrast, </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting"><span>24 people died in ICE custody during the entirety of the Biden administration</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>ICE also has openly stated that they plan to spy on the American public, looking for </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/"><span>any signs of left-wing dissent</span></a><span> against their domestic military-like presence. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a</span><a href="https://pod.wave.co/podcast/the-glenn-beck-program/glenns-tough-message-to-the-ice-shooters-mom-guests-todd-lyons-dr-jay-bhattacharya-92525"> <span>recent interview</span></a><span> that his agency “was dedicated to the mission of going after” Antifa and left-wing gun clubs. </span></p>
<p><span>On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with.</span></p>
<p><span>On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with. A surveillance-industrial complex and a democratic society are fundamentally incompatible, regardless of your political party. </span></p>
<p><span>EFF recently </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/homeland-security-spending-trail-how-follow-money-through-us-government-databases"><span>published a guide</span></a><span> to using government databases to dig up homeland security spending and compiled our own </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-border-homeland-security-tech-vendors-dataset"><span>dataset</span></a><span> of companies selling tech to DHS components. In 2025, ICE entered new contracts with several private companies for location surveillance, social media surveillance, face surveillance, spyware, and phone surveillance. Let’s dig into each.</span></p>
<h2><span>Phone Surveillance Tools </span></h2>
<p><span>One common surveillance tactic of immigration officials is to get physical access to a person’s phone, either while the person is detained at a border crossing, or while they are under arrest. </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/29/ice-doesnt-want-you-to-know-why-they-bought-a-phone-cracking-system/"><span>ICE renewed an $11 million contract</span></a><span> with a company called Cellebrite, which helps ICE unlock phones and then can take a </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/forensic-extraction-tools"><span>complete image of all the data on the phone</span></a><span>, including apps, location history, photos, notes, call records, text messages, and even Signal and WhatsApp messages. ICE also signed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/ice-unit-signs-new-3-million-contract-for-phone-hacking-tech/"><span>$3 million contract</span></a><span> with Cellebrite’s main competitor Magnet Forensics, makers of the Graykey device for unlocking phones. DHS has had contracts with Cellebrite since 2008, but the number of phones they search has risen dramatically each year, reaching a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/phone-searches-at-the-us-border-hit-a-record-high/"><span>new high of 14,899 devices searched</span></a><span> by ICE’s sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between April and June of 2025. </span></p>
<p><span>If ICE can’t get physical access to your phone, that won’t stop them from trying to gain access to your data. They have also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/ice-reactivates-contract-with-spyware-maker-paragon/"><span>resumed a $2 million contract with the spyware manufacturer, Paragon</span></a><span>. Paragon makes the Graphite spyware, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/paragon-spyware-used-to-target-citizens-across-europe-says-italian-government/"><span>which made headlines in 2025</span></a><span> for being found on the phones of several dozen members of Italian civil society. Graphite is able to harvest messages from multiple different encrypted chat apps such as Signal and WhatsApp without the user ever knowing. </span></p>
<p><span>Our concern with ICE buying this software is the likelihood that it will be used against undocumented people and immigrants who are here legally, as well as U.S. citizens who have spoken up against ICE or who work with immigrant communities. Malware such as Graphite can be used to read encrypted messages as they are sent, other forms of spyware can also download files, photos, location history, record phone calls, and even discretely turn on your microphone to record you. </span></p>
<h3><span>How to Protect Yourself </span></h3>
<p><span>The most effective way to protect yourself from smartphone surveillance would be to not have a phone. But that’s not realistic advice in modern society. Fortunately, for most people there are other ways you can make it harder for ICE to spy on your digital life. </span></p>
<p><span>The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. Installing security updates makes it harder to use </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/mobile-phones-malware#malware"><span>malware against you</span></a><span> and makes it less likely for Cellebrite to break into your phone. Likewise, both iPhone (</span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-enable-lockdown-mode-on-iphone"><span>Lockdown Mode</span></a><span>) and Android (</span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#enable-advanced-protection"><span>Advanced Protection</span></a><span>) offer special modes that lock your phone down and can help protect against some malware.</span></p>
<p><span>The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. </span></p>
<p><span>Having your phone’s software up to date and locked with a strong alphanumeric password will offer some protection against Cellebrite, depending on your model of phone. However, the strongest protection is simply to keep your phone turned off, which puts it in “before first unlock” mode and has been typically harder for law enforcement to bypass. This is good to do if you are at a protest and expect to be arrested, if you are crossing a border, or if you are expecting to encounter ICE. Keeping your phone on airplane mode should be enough to protect against cell-site simulators, but turning your phone off will offer extra protection against cell-site simulators and Cellebrite devices. If you aren’t able to turn your phone off, it’s a good idea to at least turn off </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/attending-protest#remove-fingerprint-or-face-unlock"><span>face/fingerprint unlock</span></a><span> to make it harder for police to force you to unlock your phone. While EFF continues to fight to strengthen our legal protections against compelling people to decrypt their devices, there is currently less protection against compelled face and fingerprint unlocking than there is against compelled password disclosure.</span></p>
<h2><span>Internet Surveillance </span></h2>
<p><span>ICE has also spent $5 million to acquire at least two location and social media surveillance tools: Webloc and Tangles, </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-to-buy-tool-that-tracks-locations-of-hundreds-of-millions-of-phones-every-day/"><span>from a company called Pen Link</span></a><span>, an established player in the open source intelligence space. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-lapd-is-using-controversial-mass-surveillance-tracking-software/"><span>Webloc gathers the locations of millions of phones</span></a><span> by gathering data from mobile data brokers and linking it together with other information about users. Tangles is a social media surveillance tool which combines web scraping with access to social media application programming interfaces. These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account. Tangles is able to link together a <span>person’s</span> posting history, posts, and comments containing keywords, location history, tags, social graph, and photos with those of their friends and family. Penlink then sells this information to law enforcement, allowing law enforcement to avoid the need for a warrant. This means ICE can look up historic and current locations of many people all across the U.S. without ever having to get a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span>These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account.</span></p>
<p><span>ICE also has established contracts with other social media scanning and AI analysis companies, such as </span><a href="https://perma.cc/K7CJ-S5YK"><span>a $4.2 million contract with a company called Fivecast</span></a><span> for the social media surveillance and AI analysis tool ONYX. </span><a href="https://perma.cc/K7CJ-S5YK"><span>According to Fivecast</span></a><span>, ONYX can conduct “automated, continuous and targeted collection of multimedia data” from all major “news streams, search engines, social media, marketplaces, the dark web, etc.” ONYX can build what it calls “digital footprints” from biographical data and curated datasets spanning numerous platforms, and “track shifts in sentiment and emotion” and identify the level of risk associated with an individual. </span></p>
<p><span>Another contract is with ShadowDragon for their product Social Net, </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/the-200-sites-an-ice-surveillance-contractor-is-monitoring/"><span>which is able to monitor publicly available data from over 200 websites</span></a><span>. In an </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/ICE%20ShadowDragon%20Justification%20for%20Exception%20to%20Fair%20Opp..pdf"><span>acquisition document from 2022</span></a><span>, ICE confirmed that ShadowDragon allowed the agency to search “100+ social networking sites,” noting that “[p]ersistent access to Facebook and Twitter provided by ShadowDragon SocialNet is of the utmost importance as they are the most prominent social media platforms.”</span></p>
<p><span>ICE has also indicated that they intend to </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26331575-forecast-record-acquisition-planning-forecast-system/"><span>spend between 20 and 50 million dollars</span></a><span> on building and staffing a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/"><span>24/7 social media monitoring office with at least 30 full time agents</span></a><span> to comb every major social media website for leads that could generate enforcement raids. </span></p>
<h3><span>How to protect yourself </span></h3>
<p><span>For U.S. citizens, making your account private on social media is a good place to start. You might also consider having accounts under a pseudonym, or deleting your social media accounts altogether. For more information, </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/protecting-yourself-social-networks"><span>check out our guide to protecting yourself on social media</span></a><span>. Unfortunately, people immigrating to the U.S. might be subject to greater scrutiny, including </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/g-s1-73572/us-resumes-visas-foreign-students-access-social-media"><span>mandatory social media checks</span></a><span>, and should consult with an immigration attorney before taking any action. For people traveling to the U.S., new rules will soon likely require them to reveal </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-to-inspect-tourists-social-media-history-from-past-5-years-.html"><span>five years of social media history and 10 years of past email addresses</span></a><span> to immigration officials. </span></p>
<h2><span>Street-Level Surveillance </span></h2>
<p><span>But it’s not just your digital habits ICE wants to surveil; they also want to spy on you in the physical world. ICE has contracts with multiple automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies and is able to follow the driving habits of a large percentage of Americans. ICE uses this data to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-adds-random-person-to-group-chat-exposes-details-of-manhunt-in-real-time/"><span>track down specific people</span></a><span> anywhere in the country. ICE has a </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/records-reveal-ice-using-mass-surveillance-database-track-people-aid-local-law"><span>$6 million contract through a Thomson Reuters subsidiary to access ALPR data from Motorola Solutions</span></a><span>. ICE has also persuaded local law enforcement officers to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/"><span>run searches on their behalf through Flock Safety&#39;s massive network</span></a><span> of ALPR data. CBP, including Border Patrol, also operates a </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd"><span>network</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-identify-automated-license-plate-readers-us-mexico-border"><span>covert ALPR systems</span></a><span> in many areas. </span></p>
<p><span>ICE has also invested in biometric surveillance tools, such as </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-supercharged-facial-recognition-app-of-200-million-images/"><span>face recognition software called Mobile Fortify</span></a><span> to scan the faces of people they stop to determine if they are here legally. Mobile Fortify checks the pictures it takes against a database of 200 million photos for a match (the source of the photos is unknown). Additionally, ICE has a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/08/ice-to-pay-10-million-for-clearview-facial-recognition-to-investigate-agent-assaults/"><span>$10 million contract with Clearview AI</span></a><span> for face recognition. ICE has also contracted with </span><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202508/ices-biometric-surveillance-reach-expands-with-bi2-iris-scanning-tech"><span>iris scanning company BI2 technologies</span></a><span> for even more invasive biometric surveillance. ICE agents have also been </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/border-patrol-agent-recorded-raid-with-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses/"><span>spotted wearing Meta’s Ray-Ban video recording</span></a><span> </span><span>sunglasses. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/ice-bought-vehicles-equipped-with-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-phones/"><span>ICE has acquired trucks equipped</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers"><span>cell-site simulators (AKA Stingrays)</span></a><span> from a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (likely the cell-site simulators were manufactured by another company). This is not the first time ICE has bought this technology. According to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/"><span>ICE deployed cell-site simulators at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019</span></a><span>, and ICE more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, </span><a href="http://buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/this-is-how-many-times-the-department-of-homeland-security"><span>according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News</span></a><span>. Cell-site simulators can be used to track down a specific person in real time, with more granularity than a phone company or tools like Webloc can provide, though Webloc has the distinct advantage of being used without a warrant and not requiring agents to be in the vicinity of the person being tracked. </span></p>
<h3><span>How to protect yourself </span></h3>
<p><span>Taking public transit or bicycling is a great way to keep yourself off ALPR databases, but an even better way is to go to your local city council meetings and demand the city cancels contracts with ALPR companies, like people have done in Flagstaff, Arizona; Eugene, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado, among others. </span></p>
<p><span>If you are at a protest, putting your phone on airplane mode could help protect you from cell-site simulators and from apps on your phone disclosing your location, but might leave you vulnerable to advanced targeted attacks. For more advanced protection, turning your phone completely off protects against all radio based attacks, and also makes it harder for tools like Cellebrite to break into your phone as discussed above. But each individual will need to weigh their need for security from advanced radio based attacks against their need to document potential abuses through photo or video. For more information about protecting yourself at a protest, </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/attending-protest"><span>head over to SSD</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>There is nothing you can do to change your face, which is why we need more stringent privacy laws such as </span><a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/campaigns/biometric-information-privacy-act-bipa"><span>Illinois<span>’</span> Biometric Information Privacy Act</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><span>Tying All the Data Together </span></h2>
<p><span>Last but not least, ICE uses tools to combine and search all this data along with the data on Americans they have acquired from private companies, the IRS, TSA, and other government databases. </span></p>
<p><span>To search all this data, ICE uses ImmigrationOS, a system that came from a </span><a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/ice-immigrationos-palantir-ai-track-immigrants/"><span>$30-million contract with Palantir</span></a><span>. What Palantir does is hard to explain, even for people who work there, but essentially they are plumbers. Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. Palantir links data from different databases, like IRS data, immigration records, and private databases, and enables ICE to view all of this data about a specific person in one place. </span></p>
<p><span>Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. </span></p>
<p><span>The true civil liberties nightmare of Palantir is that they enable governments to link data that should have never been linked. There are </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/eff-us-court-appeals-protect-taxpayer-privacy"><span>good civil liberties reasons</span></a><span> why IRS data was never linked with immigration data and was never linked with social media data, but Palantir breaks those firewalls. Palantir has labeled themselves as a progressive, human rights centric company historically, but their recent actions have given them away as just another tech company enabling surveillance nightmares.</span></p>
<h2><span>Threat Modeling When ICE Is Your Adversary </span></h2>
<p><span> Understanding the capabilities and limits of ICE and how to threat model helps you and your community fight back, remain powerful, and protect yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most important things you can do is to not spread rumors and misinformation. Rumors like “ICE has malware so now everyone&#39;s phones are compromised” or “Palantir knows what you are doing all the time” or “Signal is broken” don’t help your community. It’s more useful to spread facts, ways to protect yourself, and ways to fight back. For information about how to create a </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan"><span>security plan</span></a><span> for yourself or your community, and other tips to protect yourself, read our </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/"><span>Surveillance Self-Defense guides</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><span>How EFF Is Fighting Back</span></h2>
<p><span>One way to fight back against ICE is in the courts. EFF currently has a lawsuit against ICE over their pressure on Apple and Google to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-demands-answers-about-ice-spotting-app-takedowns"><span>take down ICE spotting apps, like ICEBlock</span></a><span>. We also represent multiple labor unions </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/labor-unions-eff-sue-trump-administration-stop-surveillance-free-speech-online"><span>suing ICE over their social media surveillance practices</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>We have also demanded the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/eff-aclu-sfpd-stop-illegally-sharing-data-ice-and-anti-abortion-states?language=es"><span>San Francisco Police Department stop sharing data illegally with ICE</span></a><span>, and issued a statement condemning the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/eff-statement-ice-use-paragon-solutions-malware"><span>collaboration between ICE and the malware provider Paragon</span></a><span>. We also continue to maintain our </span><a href="https://rayhunter.eff.org"><span>Rayhunter</span></a><span> project for detecting cell-site simulators. </span></p>
<p><span>Other civil liberties organizations are also suing ICE. </span><a href="https://www.aclunc.org/news/dhs-withdraws-subpoena-seeking-unmask-instagram-users-who-posted-about-ice-raids"><span>ACLU has sued ICE over a subpoena to Meta</span></a><span> attempting to identify the owner of an account providing advice to protestors, and another coalition of groups has thus far </span><a href="https://democracyforward.org/updates/court-orders-irs-to-stop-sharing-confidential-taxpayer-information-with-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/"><span>successfully sued the IRS to stop sharing taxpayer data with ICE</span></a><span>. </span></p>
