<p>For a long time I have been thinking on how can one apply the ideal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy">homotopy</a> to statistics and machine learning. The idea is: for many modeling situations, a single model doesn’t tell the story. One wants to use trajectory of fits. Examples of this include the Lasso showing regularization trade-offs, and also fitting a classification model with different data prevalences. All of these individual models are different, but they also are a continuously parameterized family.</p>
<center></center>
<p>I have a really neat new example called <a href="https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/Model_Homotopy/LinRebal.ipynb">“Surely That Can’t Change Sign Back and Forth”</a>. In this example I show in even a linear regression we can expect a fit coefficient to change signs as many times as the number of variables minus 1! This contradicts a plausible intuition that when you interpolate continuously (by weights) that the fit coefficients also somewhat interpolate.</p>
