Richard Hofstadter’s quip that it ought to be called the “New York Review of Each Other’s Books” is the most enduring line on the topic.<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a></p><p>Using metadata from all 59 years of the NYRB archives—spanning some 1,228 issues containing 17,268 articles about 31,579 books—I measured just how much of a “Review of Each Other’s Books” it has been.<a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" rel="">2</a> </p><p>In short, my view is that Hofstadter was right. A hefty portion of the books reviewed in the NYRB have been contributors’ books. Furthermore, most of the contributors have had their own books reviewed.</p><p>But there are a number of different ways of adding the numbers up. Each says something slightly different about the intersection between contributors and the reviewed. I look at:</p><ul><li><p>The proportion of reviews of books written by prior, recent and contemporaneous  contributors</p></li><li><p>The proportion of articles written by contemporaneously-reviewed contributors</p></li><li><p>The relationship between the number of reviews a contributor has written and the chances the contributor has had a book reviewed</p></li></ul><p>If you are not familiar with the NYRB, you should know it is a tabloid-sized magazine that comes out about every two weeks.<a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" rel="">3</a> Each issue features a series of longish reviews of mostly books and freestanding essays. What gets reviewed generally ranges from the highbrow<a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" rel="">4</a> to the upper-middlebrow.<a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" rel="">5</a> Instead of having a formal writing staff, the editors turn to outside contributors, some more frequently than others. Back in the early days of the magazine, its roster of writers read as a Who’s Who of New York Intellectuals.<a id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" rel="">6</a> </p><p>In the inaugural <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/issues/1963/02/01/" rel="">February 1963 issue</a> of the NYRB, seven contributors both wrote reviews and had their own books reviewed, thus beginning a grand tradition at the magazine.<a id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" rel="">7</a> </p><p>Clearly, people contributing and getting reviewed in the same issue falls under the umbrella of a “Review of Each Other’s books, but how do you count it more broadly?</p><p>The low-hanging fruit here is the “each other’s books” part.  You can look at each book that’s been reviewed and ask: Has the person who wrote this book contributed to the NYRB before? </p><p>By this measure, as of the April 21, 2022 issue, 27% of all NYRB book reviews have reviewed works by writers who had <em>previously</em> contributed to the magazine.<a id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" rel="">8</a></p><p>In some 112 issues half or more book reviews reviewed prior contributor’s books. In the most extreme example, all but one review in the February 16, 1995 issue featured a past contributor’s book. If you count letter writers as contributors (which I do not), every single review in that issue featured a past contributor’s book.</p><p>You can chart how this has changed over time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9430276/"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png" width="1456" height="1049" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1049,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:193354,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:&#34;https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9430276/&#34;}" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6307763c-54da-4e31-bf6a-c1f3488a41ee_1582x1140.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a><figcaption>You can click on this an all other charts tor an interactive version</figcaption></figure></div><p>Sort of predictably, the shape of this chart partly reflects the fact that the number of prior subscribers grew over time.

You find that on average 20% of NYRB book reviews have reviewed the books of people who contributed in the ten years prior to the reviews, meanwhile the number only goes down to 10% when you limit yourself to looking at books by contributors of the past year.</p><p>There is still a slight problem with the years-before measures: excluding people who contributed soon after they got reviewed. For example, in the first issue of the NYRB Robert L. Heilbroner and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.’s books were reviewed. Heilbroner and Schlessinger then contributed to the second issue. We’re missing them in our counts, though I think you should count them.</p><p>This gets me to my third measure: contemporaneous reviewing. Instead of determining whether a book’s author contributed in the <em>past</em> year you ask: did the person who wrote this book contribute in the <em>past </em>year <strong>or </strong><em>will</em> they contribute in the <em>next</em> year?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9615905/"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png" width="1456" height="1049" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1049,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:340092,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:&#34;https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9615905/&#34;}" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2bc235-d2bc-4cc9-8f47-b11d95963366_1580x1138.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a></figure></div><p>Since you’re looking at bands of time that are twice as wide, the numbers go up, but they don’t double.
