    <h1>Freenginx: Core Nginx Developer Announces Fork of Popular Web Server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Recently, a former employee of F5 and main contributor of the Nginx project announced the fork <a href="http://freenginx.org/">Freenginx</a> of the popular web server. The new project was started to <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html">address a security dispute</a> and wants to be a drop-in replacement of Nginx, run by developers rather than corporate entities. <a href="http://mdounin.ru/">Maxim Dounin</a>, formerly principal software engineer at F5, provides insights into the fork:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently decided that they know better how to run open-source projects. In particular, they decided to interfere with the security policy Nginx has used for years, ignoring both the policy and the developers&#39; position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="http://sysoev.ru/en/">Igor Sysoev</a> and currently maintained by F5, Nginx is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. According to the <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/january-2024-web-server-survey/">Web Server Survey</a>, even two decades after its initial launch, Ngnix remains the leading web server serving 23.21% of all sites. In a popular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373327">thread</a> on Hacker News, user <em>sevg</em> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373804">points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that there are only two active &#34;core&#34; devs, Maxim Dounin (the OP) and Roman Arutyunyan. Maxim is the biggest contributor that is still active. Maxim and Roman account for basically 99% of the current development. So this is a pretty impactful fork.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his announcement on the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel">nginx-devel mailing list</a>, Dounin highlights the <a href="https://freenginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2024-February/000007.html">initial dispute</a> that prompted Nginx to issue a security patch addressing two critical vulnerabilities. He adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am no longer able to control which changes are made in Nginx within F5, and I no longer see Nginx as a free and open-source project developed and maintained for the public good. As such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in Nginx development as run by F5. Instead, I am starting an alternative project, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freenginx is not the first fork and drop-in replacement for Nginx: <a href="https://github.com/webserver-llc/angie">Angie</a> was created by other Russian Nginx developers when F5 left Russia in 2020 and it is currently managed by the Russian company <a href="https://wbsrv.ru/">Web Server</a>. Diogo Baeder, lead backend developer at DeepOpinion, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7164034851187113984-YnaE/?">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nginx is an incredible software and platform, but I was wondering if it wouldn&#39;t be time to just bite the bullet and create a more modern solution based on Rust. Having a solution that follows a similar model, &#34;understands&#34; the Nginx configuration language, and reaches similar performance levels, but with the memory safety and wide community adoption of Rust could lead to an amazing new project - perhaps even doing to Nginx what Nginx did to Apache HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vincentz Petzholtz, network engineer and architect, is less optimistic and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincentz-berlin_announcing-freenginxorg-activity-7164343754835931136-_GEM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">adds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a fork is all you can do when a project is taken into a difficult direction. In the end, the users will vote with the adoption and install-base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first release version is <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/download.html?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=inline-mention&amp;utm_campaign=platform">Freenginx-1.25.4</a> under the same BSD license as Nginx. Dounin has provided access to a read-only <a href="http://freenginx.org/hg/nginx">Mercurial repository</a>, discarding for now the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/YIFSHIYSKDFBYZ2QRA3WF6SRPGIBDBKI.html">option to migrate to GitHub</a>. The project started a new <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/support.html">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
