<p>Today, on “Giving Tuesday”, <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl and Raku Foundation
(TPRF)</a> is extremely pleased to announce <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2024-duckduckgo-charitable-donations">a
donation of $25,000 from
DuckDuckGo</a>.
Since 2011, DuckDuckGo has <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/donations">donated over 6 million
dollars</a> to organizations that align with
their “vision of raising the standard of trust online”.</p>

<p>TPRF is dedicated to
advancing the Perl and Raku programming languages through open-source
development, community engagement, and outreach to ensure their ongoing growth,
relevance, and accessibility. This support from DuckDuckGo will allow TPRF to
continue to do things like fund core Perl development, fund grants for
projects which are important to the community and otherwise to support the
community where it can.</p>

<p>Every donation sends a message that this work matters. On the occasion of this
gift, The Perl and Raku Foundation is deeply grateful to
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> not only for its generosity but also for
its confidence in TPRF’s mission.</p>

<p>To learn more about TPRF’s current activities and goals for the future, please see
 <a href="https://www.perl.com/media/tprf/tprf-prospectus-2024.pdf">the TPRF 2024 prospectus</a></p>

<p>If your organization is interested in becoming a TPRF donor, please <a href="mailto:olaf@perlfoundation.org">reach out
to me</a>. I’d be more than happy to set up a
call so that we can discuss how a donor relationship with TPRF can
benefit your organization.</p>
