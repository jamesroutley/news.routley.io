    <h1>Ask HN: At a peak of my dev career, I hate my life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>As I write this post, my neighbors from above, probably college students, are having a party of their lifetime, laughing, kicking and screaming. I&#39;m not even mad at them, just full of envy.<p>The last time I had fun like this was in college. I was broke, renting a big flat with a bunch of roommates, but young, healthy, and full of enthusiasm (and booze). Finding friends in my teens and 20s was as easy as going out literally anywhere. When I eventually went to work, I thought my life would only get better. And I made a good career, but in the process, steadily drifted off into isolation.</p><p>These days I work either from home, or at best in a mostly empty office. I tried to meet new people at hobbies and dance lessons, but guess what - they&#39;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive/aging women looking for husbands, etc.</p><p>All the &#34;normal&#34; people I knew in the past are now changing diapers and working to pay off their mortgages, which I guess is a kind of consolation. Still, I&#39;m only in my 30s, and it feels like my life is pretty much done. Doing things by myself is boring and depressing, and getting into a group of &#34;normal&#34; friends, of both genders, to hang out and laugh with, seems like an impossible goal.</p><p>In case someone has any advice beyond finding a hobby, going to therapy, approaching random strangers, it would be greatly appreciated. I don&#39;t have any skills other than coding, so quitting the career would be a major financial hit. On the other hand, I feel that finding a non-coding job would be ultimately the best way to find new social groups, and get out of the apathy</p></td></div></div>
