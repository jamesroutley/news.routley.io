    <h1>My new deadline: 20 years to give away virtually all my wealth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I first began thinking about how to give away my wealth, I did what I always do when I start a new project: I read a lot of books. I read books about great philanthropists and their foundations to inform my decisions about how exactly to give back. And I read books about global health to help me better understand the problems I wanted to solve.</p><p>One of the best things I read was an 1889 essay by Andrew Carnegie called <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/publications/the-gospel-of-wealth/" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gospel of Wealth</em></a>. It makes the case that the wealthy have a responsibility to return their resources to society, a radical idea at the time that laid the groundwork for philanthropy as we know it today.</p>
<p>In the essay’s most famous line, Carnegie argues that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” I have spent a lot of time thinking about that quote lately. People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that &#34;he died rich&#34; will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people.</p>
<p>That is why I have decided to give my money back to society much faster than I had originally planned. <strong>I will give away virtually all my wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years</strong> <strong>to the cause of saving and improving lives around the world.</strong> And on December 31, 2045, the foundation will close its doors permanently.</p>

<p>This is a change from our original plans. When Melinda and I started the Gates Foundation in 2000, we included a clause in the foundation’s very first charter: The organization would sunset several decades after our deaths. A few years ago, I began to rethink that approach. More recently, with the input from our board, I now believe we can achieve the foundation’s goals on a shorter timeline, especially if we double down on key investments and provide more certainty to our partners.</p>
<p>During the first 25 years of the Gates Foundation—powered in part by the generosity of Warren Buffett—we gave away more than $100 billion. Over the next two decades, we will double our giving. The exact amount will depend on the markets and inflation, but I expect the foundation will spend more than $200 billion between now and 2045. This figure includes the balance of the endowment and my future contributions. </p>
<p>This decision comes at a moment of reflection for me. In addition to celebrating the foundation’s 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary, this year also marks several other milestones: It would have been the year my dad, who helped me start the foundation, turned 100; Microsoft is turning 50; and I turn 70 in October.</p>

<p>This means that I have officially reached an age when many people are retired. While I respect anyone’s decision to spend their days playing pickleball, that life isn’t quite for me—at least not full time. I’m lucky to wake up every day energized to go to work. And I look forward to filling my days with strategy reviews, meetings with partners, and learning trips for as long as I can.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation’s mission remains rooted in the idea that where you are born should not determine your opportunities. I am excited to see how our next chapter continues to move the world closer to a future where everyone everywhere has the chance to live a healthy and productive life.</p>


<p>I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished in our first 25 years.</p>
<p>We were central to the creation of <a href="https://www.gavi.org/" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavi </a>and the <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Fund</a>, both of which transformed the way the world procures and delivers lifesaving tools like vaccines and anti-retrovirals. Together, these two groups have saved more than 80 million lives so far. Along with <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotary International</a>, we have been a key partner in reviving the effort to eradicate polio. We supported the creation of a new vaccine for rotavirus that has helped reduce the number of children who die from diarrhea each year by 75 percent. Every step of the way, we brought together other foundations, non-profits, governments, multilateral agencies, and the private sector as partners to solve big problems—as we will continue to do for the next twenty years.</p>

<p>Over the next twenty years, the Gates Foundation will aim to save and improve as many lives as possible. By accelerating our giving, my hope is we can put the world on a path to ending preventable deaths of moms and babies and lifting millions of people out of poverty. I believe we can leave the next generation better off and better prepared to fight the next set of challenges.</p>
<p>The work of making the world better is and always has been a group effort. I am proud of everything the foundation accomplished during its first 25 years, but I also know that none of it would have been possible without fantastic partners.</p>
<p>Progress depends on so many people around the globe: Brilliant scientists who discover new breakthroughs. Private companies that step up to develop life-saving tools and medicines. Other philanthropists whose generosity fuels progress. Healthcare workers who make sure innovations get to the people who need them. Governments, nonprofits, and multilateral organizations that build new systems to bring solutions to scale. Each part plays an essential role in driving the world forward, and it is an honor to support their efforts.</p>

<p>Of course, although the Gates Foundation is by far the most significant piece of my giving, it is not the only way I give back. I have invested considerable time and money into both energy innovation and Alzheimer’s R&amp;D. Today’s announcement does not change my approach to those areas.</p>
<p>Expanding access to affordable energy is essential to building a future where every person can both survive <em>and</em> thrive. The bulk of my spending in this area is through <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/work/accelerate-climate-innovation/reader/breakthrough-energy-summit-2024" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breakthrough Energy</a>, which invests in companies with promising ideas to generate more energy while reducing emissions. I also started a company called <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/work/accelerate-climate-innovation/reader/wyoming-terrapower-groundbreaking" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TerraPower</a> to bring safe, clean, next-generation nuclear technology to life. Both of these ventures will earn profits if successful, and I will reinvest any money I make through them back in the foundation, as I already do today.</p>
<p>I support a number of efforts to <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/work/cure-alzheimer-s" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fight Alzheimer’s disease</a> and other related dementias. Alzheimer’s is a growing crisis here in the United States, and as life expectancies go up, it threatens to become a massive burden to both families and healthcare systems around the world. Fortunately, scientists are currently making amazing progress to slow and even stop the progress of this disease. I expect to keep supporting their efforts as long as it’s necessary.</p>
<p>The success in both areas will determine exactly how much money is given to the foundation since any profits they earn will be part of my overall gift.</p>


<h3>What the Gates Foundation hopes to accomplish</h3>
<p>Over the next twenty years, the foundation will work together with our partners to make as much progress towards our vision of a more equitable world as possible.</p>
<p>The truth is, there have never been more opportunities to help people live healthier, more prosperous lives. Advances in technology are happening faster than ever, especially with artificial intelligence on the rise. Even with all the challenges that the world faces, I’m optimistic about our ability to make progress—because each breakthrough is yet another chance to make someone’s life better.</p>
<p>Over the next twenty years, the foundation’s funding will be guided by three key aspirations:</p>

<p>In 1990, 12 million children under the age of 5 died. By 2019, that number had fallen to 5 million. I believe the world possesses the knowledge to cut that figure in half again and get even closer to ending all preventable child deaths.</p>

<p>We now understand the essential role nutrition—and especially the gut microbiome—plays in not only helping kids survive but thrive. We’ve made huge advances in maternal health, making sure that new and expectant mothers have the support they need to deliver healthy babies. We have new, life-saving vaccines and medicines, and we know how to get them to the people who need them most thanks to organizations like Gavi and the Global Fund. The innovation is there, the ability to measure progress is stronger than ever, and the world has the tools it needs to put all children on a good path.</p>

<p>Today, the list of human diseases the world has eradicated has just one entry: smallpox. Within the next couple years, I expect to add polio and Guinea worm to the list. (When we eradicate the latter, it will be a testament to the late <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/remembering-president-jimmy-carter" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Jimmy Carter’s</a> leadership.) I’m optimistic that, by the time the foundation shuts down, we can also add malaria and measles. Malaria is particularly tricky, but we’ve got lots of new tools in the pipeline, including ways of reducing mosquito populations. That is probably the key tool that, as it gets perfected and approved and rolled out, gives us a chance to eradicate malaria.</p>

<p>In 2000, the year that we started the foundation, 1.8 million people died from HIV/AIDS. By 2023, advances in treatment and preventatives cut that number to 630,000. I believe that figure will be reduced dramatically in the decades ahead, thanks to incredible new innovations in the pipeline—including a <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Year-Ahead-2023" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single-shot gene therapy</a> that could reduce the amount of virus in your body so much that it effectively cures you. This would be massively beneficial to anybody who has HIV, including in the rich world. The same technology is also being used to treat sickle cell disease, an excruciating and deadly illness.</p>
<p>We’re also making huge progress on tuberculosis, which still kills more people than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined. Last year, a historic phase 3 trial began that could be the first new TB vaccine in over 100 years.</p>
<p>The key to maximizing the impacts of these innovations will be lowering their costs to make them affordable everywhere, and I expect the Gates Foundation will play a big role in making that happen. Health inequities are the reason the Gates Foundation exists. And the true test of our success will be whether we can ensure these life-saving interventions reach the people who need them most—particularly in Africa, South Asia, and across the Global South.  </p>

<p>To reach their full potential, people need access to opportunity. That’s why our foundation focuses on more than just health.  </p>
<p>Education is key. Frustratingly, progress in education is less dramatic than in health—there is no vaccine to improve the school system—but improving education remains our foundation’s top priority in the United States. Our focus is on helping public schools ensure that all students can get ahead—especially those who typically face the greatest barriers, including Black and Latino students, and children from low-income backgrounds. At the K-12 level, that means boosting math instruction and ensuring teachers have the training and support they need—including access to new AI tools that allow them to focus on what matters most in the classroom. Given the importance of a post-secondary degree or credential for success nowadays, we’re funding initiatives to increase graduation rates, too. </p>

<p>As I mentioned, having access to a high-quality nutrition source is key to keeping kids’ development on track. Smallholder farmers form the backbones of local economies and food supplies, and they play a key role in making that happen. One of the main ways the foundation helps farmers is through the development of <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-CGIAR-is-feeding-our-future" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new, more resilient seeds</a> that yield more crops even under difficult conditions. This work is even more important in a warming world, since<strong> </strong>no<strong> </strong>one suffers more from climate change than farmers who live near the equator. Despite that, I’m hopeful that we can help make smallholder farmers more productive than ever over the next two decades. Some of the crops our partners are developing even contain more nutrients—a win-win for both <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/African-Smallholder-Farmers-Adaptation-and-Innovation" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate adaptation</a> and preventing malnutrition.</p>
<p>We’ll also continue supporting digital public infrastructure, so more people have access to the financial and social services that foster inclusive economies and open, competitive markets. And we’ll continue supporting new uses of artificial intelligence, which can accelerate the quality and reach of services from health to education to agriculture.</p>
<p>Underpinning all our work—on health, agriculture, education, and beyond—is a focus on gender equality. Half the world’s smallholder farmers are women, and women stand to gain the most when they have access to education, health care, and financial services. Left to their own devices, systems often leave women behind. But done right, they can help women lift up their families and their communities.   </p>

<p>The United States, United Kingdom, France, and other countries around the world are cutting their aid budgets by tens of billions of dollars. And no philanthropic organization—even one the size of the Gates Foundation—can make up the gulf in funding that’s emerging right now. The reality is, we will not eradicate polio without funding from the United States.</p>
<p>While it&#39;s been amazing to see African governments step up, it’s still not enough, especially at a moment when many African countries are spending so much money servicing their debts that they cannot invest in the health of their own people—a vicious cycle that makes economic growth impossible.</p>
<p>It&#39;s unclear whether the world’s richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people. But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty. There are just too many opportunities to lift people up for us not to take them.</p>


<h3>The last chapter of my career</h3>
<p><strong>Next week, I will participate in the foundation’s annual employee meeting, which is always one of my favorite days of the year. Although it’s been many years since I left Microsoft, I am still a CEO at heart, and I don’t make any decisions about my money without considering the impact. </strong></p>
<p>I feel confident putting the remainder of my wealth into the Gates Foundation, because I know how brilliant and dedicated the people responsible for using that money are—and I can’t wait to celebrate them.</p>
<p>I&#39;m inspired by my colleagues at the foundation, many of whom have foregone more lucrative careers in the private sector to use their talents for the greater good. They possess what Andrew Carnegie called “precious generosity,” and the world is better off for it.</p>
<p>I am lucky to have been surrounded by many generous people throughout my life. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/meet-bill/source-code/reader/my-first-memoir-source-code" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my memoir <em>Source Code</em></a>, my parents were my first and biggest influences. My mom introduced me to the idea of giving back. She was a big believer in the idea of “to whom much is given much is expected,” and she taught me that I was just a steward of any wealth I gained.</p>

<p>Dad was a giant in every sense of the word, and he, more than anyone else, shaped the values of the foundation as its first leader. He was collaborative, judicious, and serious about learning—three qualities that shape our approach to everything we do. Every year, the most important internal recognition we hand out is called the Bill Sr. Award, which goes to the staff member who most exemplifies the values that he stood for. Everything we have accomplished—and will accomplish—is a testament to his vision of a better world.</p>
<p>As an adult, one of my biggest influences has been Warren Buffett, who remains the ultimate model of generosity. He was the first one who introduced me to the idea of giving everything away, and he’s been incredibly generous to the foundation over the decades. <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Remembering-Chuck-Feeney" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Feeney</a> remains a big hero of mine, and his philosophy of “giving while living” has shaped how I think about philanthropy.</p>

<p>I hope other wealthy people consider how much they can accelerate progress for the world’s poorest if they increased the pace and scale of their giving, because it is such a profoundly impactful way to give back to society. I feel fulfilled every day I go to work at the foundation. It forces me to learn new things, and I get to work with incredible people out in the field who really understand how to maximize the impact of new tools.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement almost certainly marks the beginning of the last chapter of my career, and I’m okay with that. I have come a long way since I was just a kid starting a software company with my friend from middle school. As Microsoft turns 50 years old, it feels right that I celebrate the milestone by committing to give away the resources I earned through the company.</p>

<p>A lot can happen over the course of twenty years. I want to make sure the world moves forward during that time. The clock starts now—and I can’t wait to make the most of it.</p></div></div>
