    <h1>Intuitive introverts lead the most successful teams: study</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unwritten law of leadership states the loudest voices in the room are not always the wisest. Some of history’s most notable and successful leaders were known introverts who wrangled loads of information for sizable teams: Abraham Lincoln, Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few. New research from the University of Delaware found introverted leaders who rely on intuition to handle this large bundle of information lead the most successful teams.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10596011221121461" target="_blank">research</a>, co-authored by professor <a href="https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/media-experts/expert/?username=dustinj.sleesman" target="_blank">Dustin Sleesman</a>, explored the concept of intuition and when it&#39;s helpful for leaders who are in charge of large teams. Sleesman and his co-authors from Michigan State University studied more than 3,000 U.S. Air Force captains at a military base in Alabama. As part of their leadership training, the captains participated in a team-based battlefield simulation, which gave the researchers an opportunity to observe and analyze their behavior.</p><p>Sleesman and his co-authors accurately predicted that teams performed better when their leaders were armed with high amounts of information. But they made two interesting findings they didn&#39;t expect: </p><p>• Introverted leaders led more successful teams when intuitively handling large amounts of information.</p><p>• Intuitive leaders, in general, led more successful teams when they had to handle a lot of information.</p><p>&#34;Introverted people tend to be more reflective, more introspective, they tend to be more observational than extroverted leaders,&#34; Sleesman said. &#34;So pairing intuition with introversion tended to be very effective for team performance.&#34;</p><p>Sleesman, an associate professor of management in UD&#39;s <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/" target="_blank">Lerner College of Business &amp; Economics</a>, studies the psychology of decision-making, negotiation and conflict resolution, as well as team effectiveness.
