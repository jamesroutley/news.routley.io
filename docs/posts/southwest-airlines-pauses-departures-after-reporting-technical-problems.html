More than 1,849 flights, or 44% of Southwest&#39;s schedule, were delayed as of 2 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.</p><p>&#34;Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost,&#34; Southwest said in a statement. &#34;Southwest Teams worked quickly to minimize flight disruptions.&#34;</p><p>Southwest&#39;s stock was down more than 1% in afternoon trading.</p><p>Airlines or the FAA will occasionally pause departures, particularly at certain airports, to avoid bottlenecks for parking on the ground.</p><p>Southwest had a meltdown over the year-end holidays, which drove thousands of flight cancellations and resulted in an $800 million pretax hit for the <a href="https://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2023/01-26-2023-114537893" target="_blank">fourth quarter</a>.
