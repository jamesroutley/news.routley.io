    <h1>U.S. chip revival plan chooses sites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="U.S. Chip Revival Plan Chooses Sites"><div><p>Last week the organization tasked with running the the <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/chips-rd-programs/" target="_blank">biggest chunk</a> of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chips-act" target="_blank">U.S. CHIPS Act’s</a> US $13 billion R&amp;D program made some significant strides: The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/chips/research-development-programs/national-semiconductor-technology-center" target="_blank">National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC)</a>  released a strategic plan and selected the sites of two of three planned facilities and released a new strategic plan. The locations of the two sites—a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-sunnyvale-ca-expected-location-second" target="_blank"><u>“design and collaboration” center</u></a> in Sunnyvale, Calif., and a lab devoted to advancing the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/10/biden-harris-administration-announces-ny-creates-albany-nanotech-complex" target="_blank"><u>leading edge of chipmaking</u></a>, in Albany, N.Y.—build on an existing ecosystem at each location, experts say. The location of the third planned center—a chip prototyping and packaging site that could be especially <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics" target="_self"><u>critical for speeding semiconductor startups</u></a>—is still a matter of speculation.</p><p>“The NSTC represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the U.S. to accelerate the pace of innovation in semiconductor technology,” <a href="https://natcast.org/leadership" target="_blank"><u>Deirdre Hanford</u></a>, CEO of Natcast, the nonprofit that runs the NSTC centers, said in a <a href="https://natcast.org/biden-harris-announces-second-chips-flagship-facility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a>. According to the strategic plan, which covers 2025 to 2027, the NSTC is meant to accomplish three goals: extend U.S. technology leadership, reduce the time and cost to prototype, and build and sustain a semiconductor workforce development ecosystem. The three centers are meant to do a mix of all three. </p><h2>New York gets extreme ultraviolet lithography</h2><p>NSTC plans to direct $825 million into the Albany project. The site will be dedicated to extreme ultraviolet lithography, a technology that’s essential to making the most advanced logic chips. The <a href="https://ny-creates.org/ny-creates-campus-complex/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Albany Nanotech Complex</u></a>, which has already seen more than $25 billion in investments from the state and industry partners over two decades, will form the heart of the future NSTC center. It already has an<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/euv" target="_self"><u> EUV lithography</u></a> machine on site and has begun an expansion to install a next-generation version, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-na-euv" target="_self"><u>high-NA EUV</u></a>, which promises to produce even finer chip features. Working with a tool recently installed in Europe, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a>, a long-time tenant of the Albany research facility, reported record yields of <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/new-euv-patterning-yield-benchmarks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>copper interconnects built every 21 nanometers</u></a>, a pitch several nanometers tighter than possible with ordinary <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-na-euv">EUV</a>. </p><p>“It’s fulfilling to see that this ecosystem can be taken to the national and global level through CHIPS Act funding,” said <a href="https://research.ibm.com/people/mukesh-khare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mukesh Khare</u></a>, general manager of IBM’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> division, speaking from the future site of the NSTC EUV center. “It’s the right time, and we have all the ingredients.”</p><p>While only a few companies are capable of manufacturing cutting edge logic using EUV, the impact of the NSTC center will be much broader, Khare argues. It will extend down as far as early-stage startups with ideas or materials for improving the chipmaking process “An EUV R&amp;D center doesn’t mean just one machine,” says Khare. “It needs so many machines around it… It’s a very large ecosystem.”</p><h2>Silicon Valley lands the design center</h2><p>The design center is tasked with conducting advanced research in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-design" target="_self"><u>chip design</u></a>, electronic design automation (EDA), chip and system architectures, and<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/security" target="_self"><u> hardware security</u></a>. It will also host the NSTC’s design enablement gateway—a program that provides NSTC members with a secure, cloud-based access to design tools, reference processes and designs, and shared data sets, with the goal of reducing the time and cost of design. Additionally, it will house workforce development, member convening, and administration functions. </p><p>Situating the design center in Silicon Valley, with its concentration of research universities, venture capital, and workforce, seems like the obvious choice to many experts. “I can’t think of a better place,” says Patrick Soheili, co-founder of interconnect technology startup Eliyan, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijeet-chakraborty-1a21931/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Abhijeet Chakraborty</u></a>, vice president of engineering in the technology and product group at Silicon Valley-based <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Synopsys</u></a>, a leading maker of EDA software, sees Silicon Valley’s expansive tech ecosystem as one of its main advantages in landing the NSTC’s design center. The region concentrates companies and researchers involved in the whole spectrum of the industry from semiconductor process technology to cloud software.</p><p>Access to such a broad range of industries is increasingly important for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-design">chip design</a> startups, he says. “To design a chip or component these days you need to go from concept to design to validation in an environment that takes care of the entire stack,” he says. It’s prohibitively expensive for a startup to do that alone, so one of Chakraborty’s hopes for the design center is that it will help startups access the design kits and other data needed to operate in this new environment.</p><h2>Packaging and prototyping still to come</h2><p>A third promised center for prototyping and packaging is still to come. “The big question is where does the packaging and prototyping go?” says Mark Granahan, cofounder and CEO of Pennsylvania-based <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics" target="_blank">power semiconductor startup Ideal Semiconductor</a>. “To me that’s a great opportunity.” He points out that because there is so little packaging technology infrastructure in the United States, any ambitious state or region should have a shot at hosting such a center. One of the original intentions of the act, after all, was to expand the number of regions of the country that are involved in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>But that hasn’t stopped some already tech-heavy regions from wanting it. “Oregon offers the strongest ecosystem for such a facility,” a spokesperson for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Intel</u></a>, whose technology development is done there. “The state is uniquely positioned to contribute to the success of the NSTC and help drive technological advancements in the U.S. semiconductor industry.”</p><p>As NSTC makes progress, Granahan’s concern is that bureaucracy will expand with it and slow efforts to boost the U.S. chip industry. Already the layers of control are multiplying. The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/chips" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chips Office</u></a> at the National Institute of Standards and Technology executes the Act. The NSTC is administered by the nonprofit <a href="https://natcast.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Natcast</u></a>, which directs the EUV center, which is in a facility run by another nonprofit, <a href="https://ny-creates.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NY CREATES</u></a>. “We want these things to be agile and make local decisions.”</p></div></div></div>
