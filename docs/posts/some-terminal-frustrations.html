    <h1>Some terminal frustrations</h1>
    
    <p>A few weeks ago I ran a terminal survey (you can <a href="https://jvns.ca/terminal-survey/results-bsky.html">read the results here</a>) and at the end I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most frustrating thing about using the terminal for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1600 people answered, and I decided to spend a few days categorizing all the
responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/classificator">tool</a> to make it faster to categorize
everything.</p>
<p>As with all of my surveys the methodology isn&rsquo;t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.</p>
<p>Here are the top categories of frustrations!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for <strong>21+ years</strong></li>
<li>95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 years</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments aren&rsquo;t coming from total beginners.</p>
<p>Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I&rsquo;m mostly writing this up for myself because
I&rsquo;m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-syntax-115">remembering syntax (115)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggles remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etc</li>
<li>the syntax for redirects</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just so many little &ldquo;trivia&rdquo; details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I&rsquo;ll sometimes forget where it&rsquo;s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="switching-terminals-is-hard-91">switching terminals is hard (91)</h3>
<p>People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)</li>
<li>systems which don&rsquo;t have their preferred text editor (&ldquo;no vim&rdquo; or &ldquo;only vim&rdquo;)</li>
<li>different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)</li>
<li>no tab completion</li>
<li>a shell they aren&rsquo;t used to (&ldquo;the subtle differences between zsh and bash&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="color-85">color (85)</h3>
<p>Lots of problems with color, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background color</li>
<li>finding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)</li>
<li>color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etc</li>
<li>not liking the defaults</li>
<li>not wanting color at all and struggling to turn it off</li>
</ul>
<p>This comment felt relatable to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I&rsquo;m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-84">keyboard shortcuts (84)</h3>
<p>Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.</p>
<p>Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>Ctrl-W</code> in a browser-based terminal and closing the window</li>
<li>the terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
<code>Ctrl-Shift-</code>, no <code>Super</code>, no <code>Hyper</code>, lots of <code>ctrl-</code> shortcuts aren&rsquo;t
possible like <code>Ctrl-,</code>)</li>
<li>the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code> for something else)</li>
<li>issues using emacs in the terminal</li>
<li>backspace not working (2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-copy-and-paste-issues-75">other copy and paste issues (75)</h3>
<p>Aside from &ldquo;the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different&rdquo;, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying over SSH</li>
<li>how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different ways</li>
<li>dealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
&ldquo;middle click&rdquo; clipboard on Linux, tmux&rsquo;s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing them</li>
<li>random spaces added when copying from the terminal</li>
<li>pasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying way</li>
<li>wanting a way to copy text without using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discoverability-55">discoverability (55)</h3>
<p>There were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I&rsquo;ve been told by random people over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="steep-learning-curve-44">steep learning curve (44)</h3>
<p>A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don&rsquo;t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="history-42">history  (42)</h3>
<p>Some issues with shell history:</p>
<ul>
<li>history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)</li>
<li>limits that are too short (4)</li>
<li>history not being restored when terminal tabs are restored</li>
<li>losing history because the terminal crashed</li>
<li>not knowing how to search history</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
&ldquo;history&rdquo; on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type &ldquo;history 0&rdquo; to get
any useful length of history.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bad-documentation-37">bad documentation (37)</h3>
<p>People talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation being generally opaque</li>
<li>lack of examples in man pages</li>
<li>programs which don&rsquo;t have man pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflow</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scrollback-36">scrollback (36)</h3>
<p>A few issues with scrollback:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback history</li>
<li>resizing the terminal messes up the scrollback</li>
<li>lack of timestamps</li>
<li>GUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs&rsquo; outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-feels-outdated-33">&ldquo;it feels outdated&rdquo; (33)</h3>
<p>Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shell-scripting-32">shell scripting (32)</h3>
<p>Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There&rsquo;s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="more-issues">more issues</h3>
<p>Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:</p>
<ul>
<li>(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or &ndash;help?</li>
<li>(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems</li>
<li>(23) performance (e.g. &ldquo;my shell takes too long to start&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)</li>
<li>(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (&ldquo;The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) terminfo issues (&ldquo;Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)</li>
<li>(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)</li>
<li>(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)</li>
<li>(15) typos &amp; slow typing</li>
<li>(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing <code>Ctrl-S</code>, <code>cat</code>ing a binary, etc)</li>
<li>(12) quoting/escaping in the shell</li>
<li>(11) various Windows/PowerShell issues</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="n-a-122">n/a (122)</h3>
<p>There were also 122 answers to the effect of &ldquo;nothing really&rdquo; or &ldquo;only that I
can&rsquo;t do EVERYTHING in the terminal&rdquo;</p>
<p>One example comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ve found work arounds for most/all frustrations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembering syntax &amp; history (often the thing you need to remember is something you&rsquo;ve run before!)</li>
<li>discoverability &amp; the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers&rsquo; skills.</p>
