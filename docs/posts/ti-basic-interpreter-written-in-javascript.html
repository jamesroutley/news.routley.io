<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>

<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series">TI-84 graphing calculator</a>,
you might know that you can program it with code that looks like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input</li>
</ul>


<p>Well, this project aims to implement that language in JavaScript
so that it can run in the browser.
Try changing the input above to see this output change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Output</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>

<p>I wrote a lot of programs in TI-Basic a long time ago,
and I’d like to be able to preserve and look back on them.
You can see my collection at
<a href="https://github.com/davidtorosyan/ti84-entertainment">ti84-entertainment</a>;
I hope to show all of those off here some day.</p>

<h2 id="and-it-works">And it works?</h2>

<p>Kinda. Check out the <a href="https://www.davidtorosyan.com/ti-js/tests">tests</a> to see what’s supported,
or experiment in the <a href="https://www.davidtorosyan.com/ti-js/playground">playground</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-this">Can I use this?</h2>

<p>Sure, check out the <a href="https://github.com/davidtorosyan/ti-js">README</a> on GitHub
for instructions.
Note that it’s still in prerelease and isn’t even versioned yet.
Also maybe reach out and tell me why you want to!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>I’ve got some of TI-Basic implemented, but there’s more to be done.
As certain milestones are hit I’ll update this page.</p>

<h2 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h2>
