    <h1>Cohost to shut down at end of 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>also the August 2024 financial update, but I’m trying not to bury the lede.<!-- --></em></p>
<!-- --><p>Hi everyone,<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We have come to the decision to cease operations of cohost and anti software software club due to lack of funding and burnout. As of today, none of us are being paid for our labor<!-- --><sup>1<!-- --></sup>; all of our money in the bank, and any money coming in from people who buy our merch or don’t cancel cohost plus, is going towards servers and operations — paying the bills so we can turn the lights off with as little disruption as possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>cohost will become read-only on Tuesday, October 1st. At this time, we will make best-effort attempts to keep the servers online through the end of 2024.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Development focus has immediately shifted to data export. We have offered minimal data export for GDPR compliance for a while now, but this is a barebones system that doesn’t meet our quality standards. We will be improving this system over the next few weeks and will issue full data exports for all users when the site goes read-only. We will continue to offer downloads of your data export through the end of the read-only period.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>When the read-only period concludes, we will delete all of your data from our servers without a backup.  Even now we want to reiterate that we think “data brokerage” and other common practices of the software industry are inimical to who we are as people, and we would never consider selling your data to others or asserting any rights to stuff you posted under any circumstance.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Majority control of the cohost source code will be transferred to the person who funded the majority of our operations, as per the terms of the funding documents we signed with them; Colin and I will retain small stakes so we have some input on what happens to it, at their request.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><hr aria-label="Footnotes"/>

<!-- --><li id="user-content-user-content-fn-1">
<!-- --><p>on that note, we’re looking for new jobs. we’ll each be posting about that bit individually. <!-- --></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --></div><div><hr/>
<!-- --><p>So, what happened? If you’ve read our financial updates, you know that we have never been profitable. This isn’t surprising, even with a team of four; social media is a notoriously unprofitable industry. We had planned to bring in new revenue with eggbux (our tipping and subscription product) but policy changes from Stripe forced us to cancel earlier this year.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Since then, we’ve struggled to fill the revenue and morale gap. Colin and I have been doing this for five years, Aidan for three, Kara for nearly two. We’ve been at or over capacity on moderation, engineering, and general operations nearly this entire time. We have all been on-call 24/7/365 since we launched two and a half years ago. The day-to-day needs of just running the site meant developing alternative funding options wasn’t possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>MAU and MRR are down across the year. We’ve managed to build a social media platform that many of our users love, but we just don’t have enough users and we don’t have the resources to safely scale up. It’s important to know when to call it quits.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re grateful for all the incredible things y’all have created on cohost. We’re grateful for eggbug. We’re grateful that we were able to try and show a better path for social media, even if it didn’t work out exactly as we would have liked.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re going to do our best to keep things online through the end of the year with the money we have, but we might need additional funding to keep things up until then. If you would be able to contribute funds if necessary, please e-mail us at <!-- --><a href="mailto:corp@antisoftware.club">corp@antisoftware.club<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Thank you all for having used cohost. We’ll see you around. <!-- --><img src="https://cohost.org/static/17aa2d48956926005de9.png" alt=":eggbug:" title=":eggbug:"/></p>

<!-- --><ul>
<!-- --><li>Immediately: self-service account deletions are available in the <!-- --><a href="https://cohost.org/rc/user/settings" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">settings page<!-- --></a>. account sign-up and activation is no longer available. Please note that <!-- --><strong>if you delete your account before receiving a data export, you will not receive one;<!-- --></strong> there won’t be any data left for us to export.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>October 1, 2024: cohost will become read-only. all cohost plus subscriptions will be cancelled. account deletions will remain available.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>starting October 1, 2024: we will begin processing data exports for all users. we expect this process to take some time. once your export is ready, you will receive an e-mail with a link to download it. data export downloads will remain available until the servers shut down on December 31.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>December 31, 2024: cohost will go fully offline. all user data will be deleted on our way out the door.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>January 1, 2025: we will set <!-- --><a href="http://cohost.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cohost.org<!-- --></a> to redirect to the wayback machine<!-- --><sup>1<!-- --></sup> to prevent link rot. this is something we will be paying for out of pocket since ASSC will no longer be an operating concern, but it’s max $100 per year total so it’s fine.<!-- --></li>
