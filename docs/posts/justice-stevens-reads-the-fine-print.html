    <h1>Justice Stevens reads the fine print</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><p>Before law school, I’d never been on a cruise. Though David Foster Wallace’s famous <a href="https://washcoll.instructure.com/files/68635661/download?download_frd=1">jour­nal­istic argu­ment</a> against cruising had damp­ened my interest, first-year civil proce­dure utterly demol­ished it thanks to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/499/585"><i>Carnival Cruise Lines vs. Shute</i></a>, 499 U.S. 585 <span>(1991).</span></p><p>First, some legal context. (Along with my usual proviso: though I am a lawyer, I am not <i>your</i> lawyer, and please do not take anything in this piece as legal advice.) Suppose a passenger boards a cruise at a port in the United States. The boat then sails from one desti­na­tion to another, often among multiple coun­tries, through inter­na­tional waters. This raises two ques­tions: <i>what law applies</i> to the boat and people on it, and <i>where can they bring a legal claim</i> if <span>needed?</span></p><p>For the boat itself, there is a long and boring answer pertaining to the maritime law of the country where the ship is <a href="https://professionalmariner.com/americans-pay-for-cruise-industrys-flags-of-convenience/">flagged</a>. In the same way that busi­nesses often incor­po­rate in Delaware due to its compar­a­tively lenient rules, cruise ships tend to be regis­tered under foreign flags to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/opinion/25george.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">avoid expen­sive US laws</a> (e.g., little things like taxa­tion, wage &amp; labor regu­la­tions, worker safety, <span>etc.)</span></p><p>If you’ve ever wondered why there aren’t more cruise ships touring the Hawaiian islands—or why a west-coast US cruise always includes a stop in Mexico or Canada—it’s because under <a href="https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=3363">US federal law</a>, a ship that only visits US ports must itself be flagged in the US. This is so econom­i­cally imprac­tical that there is <a href="https://www.ncl.com/cruise-ship/pride-of-america">only one</a> ship so <span>flagged.</span></p><p>But for the passen­gers, the answer is simple: the ticket is a contract, and these provi­sions are part of the <a href="https://www.carnival.com/popups/bookingengine/reservation-terms-and-conditions.aspx">contract terms</a>. The <i>choice of law</i> provi­sion deter­mines which juris­dic­tion’s laws apply; the <i>choice of forum</i> provi­sion deter­mines where cases can be heard. And the two may have nothing to do with one another. For instance, the <a href="https://www.carnival.com/popups/bookingengine/reservation-terms-and-conditions.aspx">current Carnival terms</a> adopt the “federal maritime law of the United States” and specify that all claims must be brought in federal court in Miami–Dade County, Florida (where Carnival is head­quar­tered, <span>natu­rally).</span></p><p>Bringing us to <i>Carnival Cruise Lines vs. Shute</i>. Eulala Shute was a resi­dent of Wash­ington state. During her Carnival cruise, she “suffered injuries when she slipped on a deck mat” while sailing in “inter­na­tional waters off the Mexican coast”. Contrary to the choice-of-forum provi­sion in her ticket—printed, of course, in tiny type on the back—Shute filed an injury claim against Carnival in Wash­ington. The court granted summary judg­ment in favor of Carnival because Shute’s ticket contract required her to file her claim in Miami, and she had <span>not.</span></p><p>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed. It found that requiring Shute to liti­gate in Miami was unrea­son­ably incon­ve­nient, so the choice-of-forum provi­sion was <span>invalid.</span></p><p>Corpo­rate America squealed in agony. The Ninth Circuit deci­sion would’ve had the prece­den­tial effect of essen­tially forbid­ding contrac­tual choice-of-forum provi­sions signed by resi­dents of the Ninth Circuit, which <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/information/circuit-map/">covers about 20%</a> of the US <span>popu­la­tion.</span></p><p>Thus the deci­sion was appealed to the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed again, restoring the judg­ment in favor of Carnival. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/499/585">The majority opinion</a> gave more weight to the fact that Shute volun­tarily agreed to the choice-of-forum provi­sion. Though the provi­sion made liti­ga­tion less conve­nient for her, her incon­ve­nience was offset by other fore­see­able bene­fits. For instance, by consol­i­dating liti­ga­tion in one place, Carnival could handle injury claims at lower cost, thereby allowing it to keep ticket prices lower. (Today, Carnival remains famous for its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-disaster-timeline-in-photos-2013-3#a-fleet-of-tugboats-fought-the-fire-and-pulled-the-ship-to-shore-but-not-before-8-passengers-and-14-crew-members-were-injured-3">cheap fares</a> and infa­mous for its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-disaster-timeline-in-photos-2013-3">ship disas­ters</a>.)</p><p>Justice John Paul Stevens, however, was not persuaded. He filed a dissent. What was his leading objec­tion? The typog­raphy of the <span>ticket:</span></p><blockquote>The [majority opinion] prefaces its legal analysis with a factual statement that implies that a purchaser of a Carnival Cruise Lines passenger ticket is fully and fairly notified about the existence of the choice of forum clause … only the most meticulous passenger is likely to become aware of the forum-selection provision. I have therefore appended to this opinion a facsimile of the relevant text, using the type size that actually appears in the ticket itself.</blockquote><p>And so we arrive at one of the greatest flexes ever by an <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-iii">Article III</a> judge. If you visit a law library, get volume 499 of the United States Reports from the shelf, and open the back cover, you will find the copy of the Carnival ticket—actual size, accu­rately folded—that has since been glued into every copy by order of Justice <span>Stevens.</span></p><p><img src="https://matthewbutterick.com/img/shute.jpg"/></p><p>Did he need to do this to make his point? No. Was it arguably a snippy and expen­sive gesture for a dissent? Perhaps. Never­the­less, I salute Justice Stevens for his empa­thetic <i>cri de coeur</i> against the lawyerly <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/point-size.html">abuse of fine print</a>.</p></div></div>
