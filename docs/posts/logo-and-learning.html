              <p>The Logo philosophy of education is best described as
                Constructivism, a theory of learning formulated by Jean Piaget.
                Constructivism conceives of learning as a process in which
                learners create knowledge in their minds as they interact with
                things and people in the world around them. Seymour Papert, who
                was part of the team that first developed Logo, and is often
                referred to as the &#34;father of Logo,&#34; worked closely with Piaget
                at the Center for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva from 1958 to
                1963 before moving to the United States where he was the
                co-founder of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  So it is not
                surprising that Logo has roots in Piaget&#39;s work. Logo is
                designed to be an environment in which Piagetian learning can
                occur and is supported.</p>
              <p> Papert&#39;s widely read and highly influential book <a href="https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/resources/books.html#mindstorms"><i>Mindstorms
                    </i></a>was published in 1981, just around the time that
                microcomputers were starting to find their way in to classrooms.
                The book begins with an affirmation of the importance of making
                a personal connection with one&#39;s own learning and ends with an
                examination of the social context in which learning occurs. In
                the intervening chapters, learning in a computer culture is
                situated in the context of Piaget&#39;s work and in the field of
                artificial intelligence. A significant part of the book is
                devoted to the idea of a &#34;mathland&#34; – an environment in which
                people can learn mathematics naturally as they learn to speak
                their native language without formal instruction. Turtle
                Geometry is a part of this mathland, a mathematics that is more
                accessible to young learners than the familiar forms of geometry
                taught in schools. </p>

              <p>Papert and his colleagues in the Epistemology and Learning
                Group at the MIT Media Lab developed the concept of
                Constructionism, which extended the Constructivism of Piaget to
                include the idea that a good way to support the building of
                knowledge in one&#39;s head is to build something in the real world
                – a computer program, a robot, a drawing, a story, or a musical
                composition. Constructionism is both a theory of learning and a
                strategy of education that guides teaching and the design of
                learning environments.</p>
