    <h1>Feed score update: new hostname in effect today</h1>
    
    
<p>
Right, so, one of the things that can happen when you&#39;re trying to  
collect fresh data on the behaviors of something dynamic is that you get
bogged down under the load of what happened previously.  With the feed
reader score project, this is what&#39;s been happening.  A lot of clients 
were started up and pointed at it, and we gathered a lot of behavioral 
data.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that some of them are not changing, and having a few 
dozen of them call back every five minutes is not doing anyone any 
favors.  So, I did what I promised I would do, and I updated the 
hostname.
</p>
<p>
If you are participating in the test and want to continue, go back to 
the original mail from me you got with the code(s), and load the 
instruction page.  There, you will find the very slightly changed base 
hostname that can be used to construct your new unique feed URL.  The 
keys are the same.
</p>
<p>
This also gives us the benefit of seeing what a fresh start looks like 
with the latest batch of feed reader software.  Many of them have done a 
lot of excellent work these past six months, and they deserve to leave 
the historical baggage behind.  I want to see where they are now, and 
this is how we get there.
</p>
<p>
For anyone wondering, I was looking at some of the reports before I 
cleared things out a few minutes ago.  Some of the problem spots that I 
had mentioned in multiple report posts were still there.  A lot of this 
was just people running old versions when they really need to upgrade.  
Some of it was just nobody at the wheel for the various clown services.
</p>
<p>
Seeing a whole bunch of unchanged behavior just reinforced the need to 
do a fresh start on this stuff.  The people who have invested in 
improving their software deserve it.
</p>
<p>
Once there&#39;s a fresh set of data built up, I guess I&#39;ll write up another 
summary.
</p>
<p>
Oh, side note for anyone keeping track: this is not the &#34;wildcard DNS&#34; 
thing that I 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/12/17/packets/">mentioned</a>
a few weeks back that would be needed to track down the *really* goofy 
stuff that polls all kinds of extra crap paths.  That would require 
(more) actual work, and I&#39;m not ready to do that just yet.  (Plus, for 
that kind of effort, I might want to charge for it.  Just saying.)
