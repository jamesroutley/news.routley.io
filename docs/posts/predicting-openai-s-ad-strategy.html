<em>The World is Ads</em></p>
<p>Here we go again, the tech press is having another AI doom cycle.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve primarily written this as a response to an NYT analyst painting a completely unsubstantiated, baseless, speculative, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbG4P-AYzzA">outrageous, EGREGIOUS, preposterous</a> &#34;grim picture&#34; on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/opinion/openai-ai-bubble-financing.html">OpenAI going bust</a>.</p>
<p>Mate come on. OpenAI is not dying, they&#39;re not running out of money. Yes, they&#39;re creating possibly the craziest circular economy and defying every economics law since Adam Smith published &#39;The Wealth of Nations&#39;. $1T in commitments is genuinely insane. But I doubt they&#39;re looking to be acquired; honestly by who? you don&#39;t raise $40 BILLION at $260 BILLION VALUATION to get acquired. It&#39;s all for the $1T IPO.</p>
<p>But it seems that the pinnacle of human intelligence: the greatest, smartest, brightest minds have all come together to... build us another ad engine. What happened to superintelligence and AGI?</p>
<p>See if OpenAI was not a direct threat to the current ad giants would Google be advertising Gemini every chance they get? Don&#39;t forget they&#39;re also capitalising on their brand new high-intent ad funnel by <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/">launching ads on Gemini</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-vp-says-ads-arent-coming-to-gemini-yet-why-2026-1">AI overview</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s crunch the numbers.</p>
<h2>Quick Recap of OpenAI&#39;s 2025</h2>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, OpenAI is burning <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/where-is-openais-money-going/">$8-12B in 2025</a>.
Compute infrastructure is obviously not cheap when serving 190M people daily.</p>
<h2>Predicting OpenAI&#39;s Ad Strategy</h2>
<p>So let&#39;s try to model their expected ARPU (annual revenue per user) by understanding what OpenAI is actually building and how it compares to existing ad platforms.</p>
<p>The ad products they&#39;ve confirmed thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">Ads at bottom of answers</a> when there&#39;s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Rollout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 2026: Limited beta with select advertisers</li>
<li>Q2-Q3 2026: Expanded to ChatGPT Search for free-tier users</li>
<li>Q4 2026: Sidebar sponsored content + affiliate features</li>
<li>2027: Full international expansion, self-serve platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing starts &#34;in the coming weeks&#34; for logged-in adults in the U.S. on free and Go tiers.
Ads will be &#34;clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer.&#34; Users can learn why they&#39;re seeing an ad or dismiss it.</p>
<p>Their principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer independence: Ads don&#39;t influence ChatGPT&#39;s answers</li>
<li>Conversation privacy: Conversations stay private from advertisers, data never sold</li>
<li>Choice and control: Users can turn off personalization and clear ad data</li>
<li>Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers won&#39;t have ads</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ossa-ma.github.io/images/xtodoubt.png" alt="We&#39;ll see about that"/></p>
<p>They also mentioned a possibility of conversational ads where you can ask follow-up questions about products directly.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue targets:</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">Reports suggest</a> OpenAI is targeting $1B in ad revenue for 2026, scaling to $25B by 2029, though OpenAI hasn&#39;t confirmed these numbers publicly.
We can use these as the conservative benchmark, but knowing the sheer product talent at OpenAI, the funding and hunger. I think they&#39;re blow past this.</p>
<p>Personal speculations on integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-serve platform: Advertisers bid for placements, super super super likely, exactly what Google does, probably their biggest revenue stream.</li>
<li>Affiliate commissions: Built-in checkouts so users can buy products inside ChatGPT, OpenAI takes commission, similar to their Shopify collab.</li>
<li>Sidebar sponsored content: When users ask about topics with market potential, sponsored info appears in a sidebar marked &#34;Sponsored&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let&#39;s compare this to existing ad platforms:</p>
<h3>Google: Intent + Vertical Integration = Highest Revenue</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/142918?hl=en">Auction-based system</a> where advertisers bid on keywords. Ads appear in search results based on bid + quality score.</li>
<li>Why it works: High intent (search queries) + owns the entire vertical stack (ad tech, auction system, targeting, decades of optimization)</li>
<li>Ad revenue: [$212.4B in ad revenue in the first 3 quarters of 2025]<a href="https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/">https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/</a> (8.4% growth from 2024&#39;s $273.4B)</li>
<li>Google doesn&#39;t report ARPU so we need to calculate it: ARPU = $296.2B (projected) ÷ 5.01B = $59.12 per user annually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meta: No Intent + Vertical Integration = High ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://strikesocial.com/blog/facebook-feed-ads-meta-placements-efficiency/">Newsfeed ads</a> delivered via auction. Meta&#39;s Andromeda AI evaluates bid + predicted action rate + ad quality to determine placement.</li>
<li>Why it works: Passive scrolling = low purchase intent, but on a massive scale + owns targeting infrastructure + <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">Andromeda AI</a></li>
<li>ARPU: <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/32591/fb-arpu">$68.44 in North America</a>, <a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/metrics/average-revenue-per-user/">$49.63 globally</a> (Q1 2025)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">$160B in 2024</a> (97.3% of total revenue)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Twitter/X: Engagement + No Vertical Stack = Low ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://www.asclique.com/blog/twitter-advertising-guide-2025/">Auction-based promoted tweets</a> in timeline. Advertisers only pay when users complete actions (click, follow, engage).</li>
<li>Why it works: Timeline engagement, <a href="https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/x-twitter-ads-statistics-you-should-know/">CPC ~$0.18</a>, but doesn&#39;t own vertical stack and does it on a smaller scale</li>
<li>ARPU: ~$5.54 ($2.3B revenue ÷ <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">415M MAU</a>)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">~$2.3B in 2025</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>ChatGPT: High Intent + No Vertical Stack = Where Does It Sit?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intent level: High. <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/">2.5B prompts daily</a> includes product research, recommendations, comparisons. More intent than Meta&#39;s passive scrolling, comparable to Google search.</li>
<li>Vertical integration: None. Yet.</li>
<li>Scale: 1B WAU by Feb 2026, but free users only (~950M at 95% free tier).</li>
</ul>
<p>So where should ChatGPT&#39;s ARPU sit?</p>
<p>It sits with Search, not Social.</p>
<p>Which puts it between X ($5.54) and Meta ($49.63). OpenAI has better intent than Meta but worse infrastructure. They have more scale than X but no vertical integration.
When a user asks ChatGPT &#34;Help me plan a 5-day trip to Kyoto&#34; or &#34;Best CRM for small business,&#34; that is High Intent. That is a Google-level query, not a Facebook-level scroll.</p>
<p>We already have a benchmark for this: <strong>Perplexity</strong>.</p>
<p>In late 2024/2025, reports confirmed Perplexity was charging <a href="https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/perplexity-ai-for-marketing-should-you-advertise-on-ai-search">CPMs exceeding $50</a>.
This is comparable to premium video or high-end search, and miles above the ~$2-6 CPMs seen on social feeds.</p>
<p>If Perplexity can command $50+ CPMs with a smaller user base, OpenAI’s &#34;High Agency&#34; product team will likely floor their pricing there.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bullish Target ARPU Trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2026: $5.50 (The &#34;Perplexity Floor&#34;) - Even with a clumsy beta and low fill rate, high-intent queries command premium pricing. If they serve just one ad every 20 queries at a Perplexity-level CPM, they hit this number effortlessly.</li>
<li>2027: $18.00 - The launch of a self-serve ad manager (like Meta/Google) allows millions of SMBs to bid. Competition drives price.</li>
<li>2028: $30.00 - This is where &#34;Ads&#34; become &#34;Actions.&#34; OpenAI won&#39;t just show an ad for a flight; they will book it. Taking a cut of the transaction (CPA model) yields 10x the revenue of showing a banner.</li>
<li>2029: $50.00 (Suuuuuuuper bullish case) - Approaching Google’s ~$60 ARPU. By now, the infrastructure is mature, and &#34;Conversational Commerce&#34; is the standard. This is what Softbank is praying will happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#39;re forgetting that OpenAI have a serious serious product team, I don&#39;t doubt for once they&#39;ll be fully capable of building out the stack and integrating ads til they occupy your entire subconscious.</p>
<p>In fact they hired Fidji Simo as their &#34;CEO of Applications&#34;, a newly created role that puts her in charge of their entire revenue engine.
Fidji is a Meta powerhouse who spent a decade at Facebook working on the Facebook App and... ads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leading Monetization of the Facebook App, with a focus on mobile advertising that represents the vast majority of Facebook&#39;s revenue. Launched new ad products such as Video Ads, Lead Ads, Instant Experiences, Carousel ads, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Launched and grew video advertising to be a large portion of Facebook&#39;s revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Being Realistic About Competition</h2>
<p>ChatGPT will hit <a href="https://www.sentisight.ai/when-chatgpt-reaches-1-billion-weekly-users/">1B WAU by February 2026</a>.</p>
<p>But 1.5-1.8B free users by 2028? That assumes zero competition impact from anyone, certainly not the looming giant Gemini. Unrealistic.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s estimate growth super conservatively accounting for competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>2026: 950M free users (1B WAU × 95% free tier)</li>
<li>2027: 1.1B free users (slower growth as market saturates)</li>
<li>2028: 1.2-1.3B free users (competition from Google, Claude)</li>
<li>2029: 1.4B free users (mature market, multi-player landscape)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main revenue growth comes from ARPU scaling not just user growth.</p>
<h2>Predicting 2026</h2>
<p>Crunching all the numbers from &#34;High Intent&#34; model, 2026 looks different.</p>
<p>Base revenue from subscriptions + enterprise + API: $25-30B</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.contentgrip.com/openai-chatgpt-subscription-strategy/">35M paying subscribers</a>: $8.4B minimum (conservatively assuming all at $20/mo Plus tier)</li>
<li>Definitely higher with Pro ($200/mo) and Enterprise (custom pricing)</li>
<li>Enterprise/API: <a href="https://www.finout.io/blog/openai-pricing-in-2026">$2.3B in 2025 → $17.4B by mid-2027</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ad revenue (year 1): ~$5.2B</p>
<ul>
<li>950M free users x $5.50 ARPU</li>
<li>ChatGPT does 2.5B prompts daily this is what advertisers would class as both higher engagement and higher intent than passive scrolling (although you can fit more ads in a scroll than a chat)</li>
<li>Reality Check: This assumes they monetise typical search queries at rates Perplexity has already proven possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total 2026 Revenue: ~$30-35B.</p>
<h2>Projecting 2027-2029</h2>
<p>These projections use <a href="https://futuresearch.ai/openai-revenue-forecast/">futuresearch.ai&#39;s base forecast</a> ($39B median for mid-2027, no ads) + advertising overlay from <a href="https://almcorp.com/blog/openai-chatgpt-advertising-strategy-2026/">internal OpenAI docs</a> + conservative user growth.</p>
<p><strong>2027:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $39B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $19.8B (1.1B free users × $18 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $58.8B</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2028:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $55-60B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $36-39B (1.2-1.3B free users × $30 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $91-99B</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2029:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $70-80B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $70B (1.4B free users × $50 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $140-150B</li>
</ul>
<h2>The World is Ads</h2>
<p>Ads were the key to unlocking profitability, you must&#39;ve seen it coming, thanks to you not skipping that 3 minute health insurance ad - you, yes you helped us achieve AGI!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mission alignment: Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The A in AGI stands for Ads! It&#39;s all ads!! Ads that you can&#39;t even block because they are BAKED into the streamed probabilistic word selector purposefully skewed to output the highest bidder&#39;s marketing copy.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, if they&#39;re turning to ads it likely means AGI is not on the horizon. Your job is safe!</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>It&#39;s 4:41AM in London, I&#39;m knackered. Idek if I&#39;m gonna post this because I love AI and do agree that some things are a necessary evil to achieve a greater goal (AGI).</em>
