CNBC&#39;s David Faber reported Friday that the fundraising effort had failed and that SVB was exploring a potential sale. But Faber also reported the sale process was becoming difficult because of the rapid outflow of deposits from the bank.</p><p>At midday Friday, regulators said they were shutting down the bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would take over insured deposits. Regional bank shares had recovered some of their morning losses, but news of SVB&#39;s failure sent them tumbling again.</p></div><div><div role="button" tabindex="0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256" aria-labelledby="title desc" role="img" focusable="false" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><title>Stock Chart Icon</title><desc>Stock chart icon</desc><g transform="translate(1.4065934065934016 1.4065934065934016) scale(2.81 2.81)"><path d="M 87.994 0 H 69.342 c -1.787 0 -2.682 2.16 -1.418 3.424 l 5.795 5.795 l -33.82 33.82 L 28.056 31.196 l -3.174 -3.174 c -1.074 -1.074 -2.815 -1.074 -3.889 0 L 0.805 48.209 c -1.074 1.074 -1.074 2.815 0 3.889 l 3.174 3.174 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 15.069 -15.069 l 14.994 14.994 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 1.614 -1.614 c 0.083 -0.066 0.17 -0.125 0.247 -0.202 l 37.1 -37.1 l 5.795 5.795 C 87.84 23.34 90 22.445 90 20.658 V 2.006 C 90 0.898 89.102 0 87.994 0 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 65.626 37.8 v 49.45 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 23.518 L 65.626 37.8 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 47.115 56.312 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 42.03 L 47.115 56.312 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 39.876 60.503 c -1.937 0 -3.757 -0.754 -5.127 -2.124 l -6.146 -6.145 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 59.844 C 41.952 60.271 40.933 60.503 39.876 60.503 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 22.937 46.567 L 11.051 58.453 c -0.298 0.298 -0.621 0.562 -0.959 0.8 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 48.004 L 22.937 46.567 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path></g></svg><p><img src="https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg" alt="hide content"/></p></div><p>SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF, 1-day</p></div><div><p>First Republic fell as low as $45 per share during Friday&#39;s session, a decline of more than 50%. However, the bank may actually get some benefit from SVB&#39;s demise, as it was one of the financial institutions that saw <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/fintech-brex-got-billions-of-dollars-in-silicon-valley-bank-deposits-thursday.html">heightened inflows</a> on Thursday. The stock closed Friday at $81.76 per share. </p><p>While SVB&#39;s situation is somewhat unique because of its funding base focused on tech startups, other banks with large bond portfolios could face similar issues if they were forced to sell those bonds before maturity in order to raise funds. Treasurys have fallen in value the last 12 months as the Federal Reserve hiked rates eight times.</p><p>Those bond sales could incur losses like what has occurred with Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>Still, Wall Street analysts believe that the issues at SVB are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/svb-financial-issues-are-unlikely-to-spread-to-other-banks-wall-street-analysts-say.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1678454863">unlikely to spread to the broader banking sector</a>. Shares of large banks saw smaller declines or even rose on Friday.</p><p>What&#39;s more, most of the assets sold by SVB were Treasurys, which are not at risk of default and will keep their value at maturity. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 involved mortgage-backed securities that collapsed in value from housing loan defaults.</p></div></div></div>
