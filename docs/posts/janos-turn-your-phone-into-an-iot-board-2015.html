      JanOS is an operating system designed to run on the chipset of
      mobile phones. It runs without a screen, and allows you to access
      all phone functionality, from calling to the camera, through
      JavaScript APIs.

  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>
    Current development boards for Internet of Things solutions have
    one big problem: they are very expensive.
    Boards like the Raspberry Pi or Arduino have a limited feature set
    and simple extensions, like a GSM shield, can cost $80.
    That is a shockingly high price when a full smartphone can be available
    for just $30.
    Why not break out the mainboard from a mobile phone and use that to
    develop embedded projects? Cheaper and more powerful.

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I attach sensors or LEDs?</strong>
    Most phones have some
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output">GPIO ports</a>
    that you can use to attach extra
    electronics to the board, like a LED light.
    We wrote a 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ee.telenor.io/gonzo/hardware/2015/02/10/gpio.html">blog post</a> 
    describing the process of
    attaching and controlling a LED on the GeeksPhone Keon.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Does it run native code?</strong>
    You can compile any C/C++ binary for the ARM architecture using
    the Android NDK / toolchains, and
    use the <a href="http://janos.io/api-reference/exec.html">mozOs.exec</a> API to invoke the binary from
    JanOS. <a href="http://janos.io/articles/cross-compile.html">Here&#39;s an example</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What about power efficiency?</strong>
    This depends on the mobile phone you use as a base.
    General idle consumption over 2G is 5 - 10 mA per hour.
    You can use a digital USB ammeter to measure the actual consumption.

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Do I need a battery?</strong>
    So far all phones we encountered need a battery connected for most
    things (booting, searching for WiFi networks, etc.).
    It&#39;s quite easy to solder a battery to the board though.
    If you use soldering wire you can position it
    <a href="http://janos.io/img/gonzo-worked-open.jpg">behind the board</a>
    without much hassle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Is there a debugger?</strong>
    You can use the
    <a href="http://janos.io/articles/first-app.html#debugger">WebIDE</a>,
    which is part of the Firefox Developer Tools to connect to your device
    and debug it.
