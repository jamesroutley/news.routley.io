    <h1>Ask HN: How ready for daily driving is Asahi Linux?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Been lurking the GitHub issues, Twitter and blog but haven&#39;t really gained a full perspective.</p><p>I&#39;m in the market for a new laptop, currently using a Carbon X1 which I&#39;m generally very happy with. I&#39;m only interested in laptops that I&#39;d run Linux on, but been trying some of the late Apple MacBooks and like the hardware, just the software seems to get in the way sometimes.</p><p>So came across Asahi Linux project, which seems to be usable for daily work, minus some missing things.</p><p>But does anyone use Asahi Linux daily here and can talk about their experience?</p></div></div></div>
