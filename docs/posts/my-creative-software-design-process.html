<p>One of the things I&#39;m happiest about since <a href="https://the.scapegoat.dev/finding-my-way-back-to-open-source/">slowly recovering from burnout</a> is leveraging my slightly manic creative energy and <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Wiki/Writing/%F0%9F%A7%A0++Notetaking">obsessive note taking</a> to do <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/ZK/Structure+Notes/2+-+Software/2i0+-+Prototypes/SK+-+2i0+-++2022-08-13+-+Building+prototypes+for+software+architecture">software design</a>. I spend a lot of time in grasshopper-mode, bouncing from idea to idea, weaving threads together, writing everything down in my sketchbooks, trying to capture as much details as I can so that I will be able to retrace my steps. I usually fill one 60 page sketchbook every month or so. This habit came from when I was learning how to draw, where I kept <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Wiki/Creativity/Sketchbooks#My+own+sketchbooks">sketchbooks</a> both for my sketches and for various notes about the engineering I was doing.</p>
<p>Later on (often months later), I&#39;ll review these sketches and try to extract actual design patterns and software features that are directly related to what I want to build. Again, I document everything precisely, although I&#39;ll usually try to do this work digitally in <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel">my obsidian vault</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="A sketchbook spread full of scribbles about the idea of a context manager for my LLM framework geppetto" src="https://media.hachyderm.io/media_attachments/files/110/854/408/493/718/459/original/5af68fbc4b840caf.png"/></p>
<p>After filling a sketchbook page (the spread I&#39;m sharing is from June 3rd), I&#39;ll sit down during my daily/weekly coffee shop session and start annotating it with a different colored pen. I&#39;ll go over the old notes, make new ones and connecting things with pretty arrows. I&#39;ll start transposing these ideas into the relevant notes in my vault, often creating new ones in the process. Once I feel that I am through making a filled-out square once I&#39;ve properly digitized the analog content.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Public/My+Obsidian+workflow">my obsidian workflow</a>, which I modify as things get messy, but is always <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/ZK/Claims/5+-+Life+-+Productivity/ZK+-+2023-07-30+-+Making+a+workflow+fun+is+the+best+way+to+make+it+stick">optimized for fun</a>, I started keeping <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Notes/Sketchbooks/SKETCHBOOK+-+2023-05-29+-+weinheim+sketchbook">index notes for sketchbooks</a> (I used to keep indexes on the front cover (a technique inspired by <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Notes/Books/BOOK+-+How+to+make+a+complete+map+of+every+thought+you+think+-+Lion+Kimbro">Lion Kimbro</a>, but never ended up really using them). I create a new note for each sketchbook and cross-link all the relevant subjects and notes to their individual pages.</p>
<p>For software design and project ideas, I used to use <a href="https://github.com/go-go-golems/glazed/blob/main/doc/rfcs/done/05_2022-11-19_glaze-cli-tool.md">Markdown files</a>  (trying to follow the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Writing/Published/2022/04/20220426+-+Quick+tip+Tuesday+Writing+RFCs+for+fun+and+profit">RFC workflow</a> I was using professionally) and <a href="https://github.com/go-go-golems/glazed/issues">GitHub issues</a>, but it felt too disconnected. Now I do the work in my Obsidian vault. I usually start with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Logs/2023/08/2023-08-08">my daily note</a> and refactor my rambling writing into individual notes. These notes will then later on be linked from the relevant Github issues. That way I can trace a freature from GitHub pull request to Obsidian notes all the way back to the original analog sketchbook.</p>
<h2 id="example-brainstorming-a-llm-context-manager">Example: brainstorming a LLM context manager</h2>
<p>Today&#39;s spread is about building a prompt context manager for my LLM framework <a href="https://github.com/go-go-golems/geppetto">Geppetto</a> (something I&#39;ve already made a <a href="https://github.com/go-go-golems/geppetto/blob/main/pkg/context/context.go">really rough stand-in proxy</a> for, and have already been <a href="https://github.com/go-go-golems/geppetto/blob/main/pkg/context/context.go">iterating on</a> since probably february). I first created a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Projects/GO+GO+GOLEMS/Ideas/IDEA+-+GO+GO+GOLEMS+-+2023-08%E2%80%9305+-+Prompt+Context+Manager">dedicated &#34;IDEA&#34; note</a> to capture the brainstorming digitally. I go over the notes from june, group them into coherent units (this is where the abundance of notes really helps, there&#39;s nothing worse than just having a few keywords such as &#34;pipeline templates&#34; with no context). I transpose these ideas into the vault, linking them to existing ideas, potentially separating them out into their own projects, creating <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Wiki/Writing/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> claims, adding literature references.</p>
<p>In today&#39;s session I ended up gathering over a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Projects/GO+GO+GOLEMS/Ideas/IDEA+-+GO+GO+GOLEMS+-+2023-08%E2%80%9305+-+Prompt+Context+Manager">dozen context manager ideas</a>, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Projects/GO+GO+GOLEMS/Ideas/IDEA+-+GO+GO+GOLEMS+-+Idea+repository">3 new tool ideas</a>, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Projects/GO+GO+GOLEMS/PROJ+-+GO+GO+GOLEMS+-+OAK">features for existing projects</a>, and refined <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/ZK/Structure+Notes/2+-+Software/2n0+-+Large+language+models/SK+-+2n3+-+LLMS+for+UX+Design">a</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Projects/GO+GO+GOLEMS/PROJ+-+GO+GO+GOLEMS+-+GLAZED#Adding+plugins">few</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Logs/2023/08/2023-08-08#Claude+for+comments+on+code">maturing</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/ZK/Structure+Notes/2+-+Software/2n0+-+Large+language+models/SK+-+2n8+-+LLMs+and+DSLs">concepts</a>, all from this one sketchbook page.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the final annotated page:</p>
<p><img alt="Sketchbook page 8, the first page of the spread, now thoroughly annotated in pink ink." src="https://media.hachyderm.io/media_attachments/files/110/854/456/155/877/087/original/f53997044fe3604b.png"/></p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-end-goal">What&#39;s the end goal?</h2>
<p>Will I build all this? Hopefully, but not as they are now. I constantly rework these ideas with the aim to unify them, to create simpler, denser abstractions that enable them to be built almost trivially.</p>
<p>As you can see in my vault and GitHub, hundreds if not thousands of hours of thinking have gone into this already, aside from writing code. It&#39;s really fun, and the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn21-80-go-go-golems-computers-should-compute">emerging ecosystem</a> lets me do cool stuff with just a few hours of coding. It needs patience and accepting that I&#39;ll never be able to work through every thought, as worthwhile as it might be. I&#39;ve already spent around 10 hours digitizing this sketchbook, and I&#39;m only on page 8 of 60!</p>
<p>The process produces a constant stream of ideas I can incorporate into my growing personal knowledge management system and software projects. It is a lot of work but leveraging my creative energy in this way has been hugely beneficial for recovering from burnout (and hopefully creating some useful software).</p>
