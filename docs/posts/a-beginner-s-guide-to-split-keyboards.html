    <h1>A beginner&#39;s guide to split keyboards</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you’ve heard of split keyboards and want to buy one, but don’t know where to start? You’ve come to the right place! There are many offerings these days which can be overwhelming, so this guide aims to provide a high level overview of the landscape so you can figure out which path you want to take.</p><blockquote><p>The intent of this guide is not to tell you which specific keyboard you should buy, but rather to equip you with the knowledge to find one that works for yourself.</p><p>The content in this post is mainly a consolidation of content that exists in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/">r/ErgoMechKeyboards</a>, but organized in a way that is hopefully helpful for beginners.</p><p>Also, it should be noted that regardless of how ergonomic your setup is, it’s important to take frequent breaks from being in front of a computer when possible, and to get up and move around. If you’re suffering from acute muscular pain (e.g. from keyboard use, or other), consider also seeing a physiotherapist or other healthcare practitioner for professional help.</p></blockquote><h2 id="why-use-a-split-keyboard"><a href="#why-use-a-split-keyboard">Why Use a Split Keyboard?</a></h2><p>There’s already many other resources that talk about the benefits of a split keyboard, but the gist is that by separating the left and right halves of the keys, your hands can rest in a more <strong>natural position</strong> instead of being forced together like on a traditional keyboard. This reduces outward wrist bending (aka <strong>ulnar deviation</strong>), shoulder tension, etc. The goal isn’t to magically fix posture overnight, but to remove some of the physical constraints imposed by a standard keyboard so your body can settle into something more relaxed during long sessions at the computer.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/why-split.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/why-split.png"/></a></p><p>Exaggerated depiction of how a split keyboard can help promote a more neutral, comfortable typing position. (Source: <a href="https://candid.technology/keyboards-and-wrist-rest-a-writers-guide-to-comfortable-typing/">Candid Technology</a>)</p></div><h2 id="types-of-keyboards"><a href="#types-of-keyboards">Types of Keyboards</a></h2><p>There are three main categories of keyboards, which define the overall positions of the keys.</p><ul><li><strong>Row-staggered</strong>: Keys are aligned in rows, like a traditional keyboard. This is what you’re already used to.</li><li><strong>Column-staggered</strong>: Keys are aligned in columns. This better matches finger anatomy and is very common in ergonomic splits.</li><li><strong>Ortholinear</strong>: Uniform grid, no stagger. Visually pleasing, but less common in ergonomic splits.</li></ul><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/layout-comparison.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/layout-comparison.png"/></a></p><p>Comparison of keyboard layouts.</p></div><p>For people interested in ergonomics, most transition from row staggered to column staggered. Ortholinear was popular for a time and still has a cult following (e.g. with the Planck), but is not as popular for ergonomic keyboards. Majority of the split keyboards shown in this post will be <strong>column staggered</strong>.</p><p>A common question is whether learning to type on a non-row staggered keyboard will impact your ability to type on a traditional keyboard. If you switch between the two somewhat regularly, the answer is no - the brain appears to be great at compartmentalizing muscle memory for different devices! In my first month or so of learning to type on a column stagger keyboard, it took me a few minutes to get used to a regular keyboard again in that session. But now, I can use either a traditional or split without issue or “ramp up” time.</p><h2 id="the-big-question-how-much-time-do-you-have"><a href="#the-big-question-how-much-time-do-you-have">The Big Question: How Much Time Do You Have?</a></h2><p>Despite the promised land of ergonomic benefits being a mere credit card purchase away, it is not without its dark side. There is unfortunately an <strong>inevitable learning curve,</strong> and it can be a steep one.</p><p>Re-training years, if not decades, of muscle memory for typing on a traditional keyboard is tough work, and can have its frustrating moments. It’s common to take at least a week or two of lots of typing practice to get accustomed to the new layout. For me, it took about a month of heavy use to be comfortable typing at a productive level for work, and that’s in a profession that involves a significant amount of daily typing (i.e. software development).</p><p>If you’re practicing with something like <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a>, the default mode of typing lowercase words is only half the battle. Getting familiar with a keyboard involves other things, like:</p><ul><li>Using numbers, punctuation, and symbols</li><li>Selecting/manipulating text (arrow keys) with shift or by word, home/end</li><li>Application-specific hot keys (e.g. browser fwd/back, tab cycling, closing tabs/Windows, window management, Excel motions, etc)</li></ul><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/monkeytype.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/monkeytype.png"/></a></p><p>The typing progression with my first split keyboard, over the course of 3 months.</p></div><p>If at this point you’re questioning the time investment required for this whole endeavour, fear not! <strong>There’s a keyboard for everyone,</strong> and not all require this steep learning curve.</p><p>These keyboards keep a row-staggered layout, so you can keep that well-trained muscle memory. You still get the biggest ergonomic win of splitting your hands apart, but without a massive cognitive load of retraining your fingers and brain for typing on a radically new layout.</p><p>Some examples of traditional keyboards with a slight split in them:</p><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/logitech-sculpt.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/logitech-sculpt.png"/></a></p><p>Logitech ERGO K860, which is similar to the previously popular, but now discontinued Microsoft Sculpt.

If you do want to use more advanced features like layers and combos, you can use software like <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner Elements</a> (macOS), <a href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd">keyd</a> (Linux), or <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata">Kanata</a> (cross-platform) to add this functionality, similar to how I modified a regular keyboard’s keymap <a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2025/11/remapping-standard-keyboard/">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re in this group, you can stop reading here! You can also find other similar keyboards using the (basic) search term “ergonomic keyboard” to see what’s currently available on the market.</p><p>If you do have the time and motivation, then welcome to the rabbit hole of features, geometries, and customizability!</p><p>Most keyboards in this category will have columnar stagger and multiple thumb keys (in place of a single spacebar), which are the main drivers for relearning how to type. The benefit of thumb keys is they let the thumbs handle high-frequency actions so the pinkies aren’t overworked reaching for shift and modifiers. However, keep in mind that it’s possible for <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/thumb-ergo/index.html">thumbs to get overuse injuries</a> as well!</p><h2 id="features"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2><h3 id="number-of-keys"><a href="#number-of-keys">Number of Keys</a></h3><p>When shopping for split keyboards, you’ll notice they can have a wide range of number of keys. A standard US keyboard has 104 keys (or 105 keys for those outside the US), but many have half that or even less!</p><p>The rationale for having fewer keys is to keep your fingers as close to home row as possible, minimizing the amount of hand movement while typing. The tradeoff to fewer keys is complexity - instead of just reaching over to press a number, multiple keys will need to be pressed to achieve the same result.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/layers-corne.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/layers-corne.png"/></a></p><p>Holding the left thumb key activates the second layer, which contains symbols and numbers.</p></div><p>There’s <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/40-percent-ergo/index.html">some discussion</a> of whether smaller layouts are actually better for ergonomics, but some find enjoyment in seeing how few keys one actually needs. This is ultimately a personal choice, but if you’re just starting out, it’s always better to have more keys and not use them, than to not have them and want them. You can also always try smaller layouts on a larger keyboard, like I did when <a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2025/07/36-key-layout/">experimenting with a 36 key layout</a>.</p><p>Here’s a few examples of keyboards showing the range of key counts:</p><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/kinesis-advantage360.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/kinesis-advantage360.png"/></a></p><p>Kinesis Advantage360, a “maximalist” split keyboard with 76 keys.

For 36 key keyboards, the <a href="https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku">Miryoku</a> keymap is a good place to start.</p><h3 id="what-about-using-a-non-qwerty-layout"><a href="#what-about-using-a-non-qwerty-layout">What About Using a Non-QWERTY Layout?</a></h3><p>Some choose to also change to an alternative layout like Dvorak, Colemak or other, since QWERTY is not designed with ergonomics in mind. However, learning a new layout requires even more time, and I personally haven’t gone down this route since the benefits of a column stagger and split keyboard are sufficient enough for me (and I reckon most people as well).</p><p>However, if you’re curious to learn more, there are many other layouts aside from the popular Dvorak layout, which each have their own advantages depending on the metrics important to you (e.g. <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/glossary/index.html#same-finger-bigram-sfb">same-finger bigrams (SFBs)</a>, <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/glossary/index.html#lateral-stretch-bigram-lsb">lateral stretch bigrams (LSBs)</a>, <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/glossary/index.html#scissor">scissors</a>, <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/glossary/index.html#redirect">redirects</a>, <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/glossary/index.html#roll">rolls</a>, etc.).

Aside from watching review videos on YouTube, there are also some great web tools to help since this will also depend on your own hand geometry.</p><blockquote><p>Personally, I found the amount of column stagger doesn’t make a huge difference (except for maybe the pinky column), whereas the thumb cluster matters a bit more since an overly tucked or stretched thumb is more noticeably uncomfortable.</p></blockquote><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/yal-tools-ergo-keyboards.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/yal-tools-ergo-keyboards.png"/></a></p><p>Searchable collection of ergonomic keyboards.

Generally, the smaller the keyboard, the cheaper it will be since fewer keys = fewer switches/keycaps + smaller PCB.</p><p>In the <strong>upper budget range</strong>, companies like <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/">Kinesis</a>, <a href="https://www.zsa.io">ZSA</a>, and <a href="https://dygma.com/">Dygma</a> make specialized, closed-source keyboards but offer premium devices and support.
There are also more boutique options like <a href="https://www.moergo.com/">MoErgo</a> and <a href="https://bastardkb.com/">Bastard Keyboards</a> that offer high quality products. These keyboards will usually have their own custom software to program them, which usually easier to use than the open-source software versions.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/zsa-voyager-product.png"><img src="https://www.justinmklam.com/posts/2026/02/beginners-guide-split-keyboards/zsa-voyager-product.png"/></a></p><p>Premium keyboard with a premium website.

They typically sell both pre-assembled boards and kits that require soldering, but are offered at a more affordable price point. Many of the keyboards offered at these vendors are based on or variants of open-sourced designs.</p><p>Although you do get a <em>much</em> nicer keyboard in the above price ranges, cheaper options exist on sites like Amazon and Aliexpress for those on <strong>low budgets</strong>. The experience or physical product may not be as refined (e.g. 3D printed cases are often used), but it’ll still be functional and at least let you try it out without breaking the bank.

Here’s a list of popular* keyboards for each budget (as of Feb 2026):</p><blockquote><p>*The keyboards listed below are from my personal perspective, based on what I see mentioned and recommended around Reddit.
