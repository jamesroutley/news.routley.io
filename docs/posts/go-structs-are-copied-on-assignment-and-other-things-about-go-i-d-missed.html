    <h1>Go structs are copied on assignment (and other things about Go I&#39;d missed)</h1>
    
    

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing Go pretty casually for years &ndash; the backends for all of my
playgrounds (<a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com/">nginx</a>, <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">dns</a>, <a href="https://memory-spy.wizardzines.com/">memory</a>, <a href="https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/">more DNS</a>) are written in Go, but many of those projects are just a few hundred lines and I don&rsquo;t come back to those codebases much.</p>

<p>I thought I more or less understood the basics of the language, but this week
I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot more Go than usual while working on some upgrades to
<a href="https://messwithdns.net">Mess with DNS</a>, and ran into a bug that revealed I
was missing a very basic concept!</p>

<p>Then I posted about this on Mastodon and someone linked me to this very cool
site (and book) called <a href="https://100go.co">100 Go Mistakes and How To Avoid Them</a> by <a href="https://teivah.dev/">Teiva Harsanyi</a>. It just came out in 2022 so it&rsquo;s relatively new.</p>

<p>I decided to read through the site to see what <em>else</em> I was missing, and found
a couple of other misconceptions I had about Go. I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the
mistakes that jumped out to me the most, but really the whole
<a href="https://100go.co/">100 Go Mistakes</a> site is great and I&rsquo;d recommend reading it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the initial mistake that started me on this journey:</p>

<h3 id="mistake-1-not-understanding-that-structs-are-copied-on-assignment">mistake 1: not understanding that structs are copied on assignment</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a struct:</p>

<pre><code>type Thing struct {
    Name string
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this code:</p>

<pre><code>thing := Thing{&quot;record&quot;}
other_thing := thing
other_thing.Name = &quot;banana&quot;
fmt.Println(thing)
</code></pre>

<p>This prints &ldquo;record&rdquo; and not &ldquo;banana&rdquo; (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/kUeP2ocFtXw">play.go.dev link</a>), because <code>thing</code> is copied when you
assign it to <code>other_thing</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-this-caused-me-ranges">the problem this caused me: ranges</h3>

<p>The bug I spent 2 hours of my life debugging last week was effectively this code (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/85FnGG86UBP">play.go.dev link</a>):</p>

<pre><code>type Thing struct {
  Name string
}
func findThing(things []Thing, name string) *Thing {
  for _, thing := range things {
    if thing.Name == name {
      return &amp;thing
    }
  }
  return nil
}

func main() {
  things := []Thing{Thing{&quot;record&quot;}, Thing{&quot;banana&quot;}}
  thing := findThing(things, &quot;record&quot;)
  thing.Name = &quot;gramaphone&quot;
  fmt.Println(things)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This prints out <code>[{record} {banana}]</code> &ndash; because <code>findThing</code> returned a copy, we didn&rsquo;t change the name in the original array.</p>

<p>This mistake is <a href="https://100go.co/#ignoring-that-elements-are-copied-in-range-loops-30">#30 in 100 Go Mistakes</a>.</p>

<p>I fixed the bug by changing it to something like this (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/CKZCRUwv_nG">play.go.dev link</a>), which returns a
reference to the item in the array we&rsquo;re looking for instead of a copy.</p>

<pre><code>func findThing(things []Thing, name string) *Thing {
  for i := range things {
    if things[i].Name == name {
      return &amp;things[i]
    }
  }
  return nil
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="why-didn-t-i-realize-this">why didn&rsquo;t I realize this?</h3>

<p>When I learned that I was mistaken about how assignment worked in Go I was
really taken aback, like &ndash; it&rsquo;s such a basic fact about the language works!
If I was wrong about that then what ELSE am I wrong about in Go????</p>

<p>My best guess for what happened is:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard for my whole life that when you define a function,
you need to think about whether its arguments are passed by <strong>reference</strong> or
by <strong>value</strong></li>
<li>So I&rsquo;d thought about this in Go, and I knew that if you pass a struct as a
value to a function, it gets copied &ndash; if you want to pass a reference then
you have to pass a pointer</li>
<li>But somehow it never occurred to me that you need to think about the same
thing for <strong>assignments</strong>, perhaps because in most of the other languages I
use (Python, JS, Java) I think everything is a reference anyway. Except for
in Rust, where you do have values that you make copies of but I think most of the time I had to run <code>.clone()</code> explicitly.
(though apparently structs will be automatically copied on assignment if the struct implements the <code>Copy</code> trait)</li>
<li>Also obviously I just don&rsquo;t write that much Go so I guess it&rsquo;s never come
up.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mistake-2-side-effects-appending-slices-25-https-100go-co-unexpected-side-effects-using-slice-append-25">mistake 2: side effects appending slices (<a href="https://100go.co/#unexpected-side-effects-using-slice-append-25">#25</a>)</h3>

<p>When you subset a slice with <code>x[2:3]</code>, the original slice and the sub-slice
share the same backing array, so if you append to the new slice, it can
unintentionally change the old slice:</p>

<p>For example, this code prints <code>[1 2 3 555 5]</code> (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/qssfM_NSXJD">code on play.go.dev</a>)</p>

<pre><code>x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
y := x[2:3]
y = append(y, 555)
fmt.Println(x)
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this has ever actually happened to me, but it&rsquo;s alarming and I&rsquo;m
very happy to know about it.</p>

<p>Apparently you can avoid this problem by changing <code>y := x[2:3]</code> to <code>y :=
x[2:3:3]</code>, which restricts the new slice&rsquo;s capacity so that appending to it
will re-allocate a new slice. Here&rsquo;s some <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/aE78JUL4-Iv">code on play.go.dev</a> that does that.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-3-not-understanding-the-different-types-of-method-receivers-42">mistake 3: not understanding the different types of method receivers (#42)</h3>

<p>This one isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; exactly, but it&rsquo;s been a source of confusion for me
and it&rsquo;s pretty simple so I&rsquo;m glad to have it cleared up.</p>

<p>In Go you can declare methods in 2 different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>func (t Thing) Function()</code> (a &ldquo;value receiver&rdquo;)</li>
<li><code>func (t *Thing) Function()</code> (a &ldquo;pointer receiver&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding now is that basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want the method to mutate the struct <code>t</code>, you need a pointer receiver.</li>
<li>If you want to make sure the method <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> mutate the struct <code>t</code>, use a value receiver.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://100go.co/#not-knowing-which-type-of-receiver-to-use-42">Explanation #42</a> has a
bunch of other interesting details though. There&rsquo;s definitely still something
I&rsquo;m missing about value vs pointer receivers (I got a compile error related to
them a couple of times in the last week that I still don&rsquo;t understand), but
hopefully I&rsquo;ll run into that error again soon and I can figure it out.</p>

<h3 id="more-interesting-things-i-noticed">more interesting things I noticed</h3>

<p>Some more notes from 100 Go Mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>apparently you can <a href="https://100go.co/#never-using-named-result-parameters-43">name the outputs of your function (#43)</a>, though that can have <a href="https://100go.co/#unintended-side-effects-with-named-result-parameters-44">issues (#44)</a> and I&rsquo;m not sure I want to</li>
<li><a href="https://100go.co/#not-exploring-all-the-go-testing-features-90">apparently you can put tests in a different package (#90)</a> to
ensure that you only use the package&rsquo;s public interfaces, which seems really
useful</li>
<li>there are a lots of notes about how to use contexts, channels, goroutines,
mutexes, sync.WaitGroup, etc. I&rsquo;m sure I have something to learn about all of
those but today is not the day I&rsquo;m going to learn them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also there are some things that have tripped me up in the past, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://100go.co/#forgetting-the-return-statement-after-replying-to-an-http-request-80">forgetting the return statement after replying to an HTTP request (#80)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://100go.co/#not-using-testing-utility-packages-httptest-and-iotest-88">not realizing the httptest package exists (#88)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="this-100-common-mistakes-format-is-great">this &ldquo;100 common mistakes&rdquo; format is great</h3>

<p>I really appreciated this &ldquo;100 common mistakes&rdquo; format &ndash; it made it really
easy for me to skim through the mistakes and very quickly mentally classify
them into:</p>

<ol>
<li>yep, I know that</li>
<li>not interested in that one right now</li>
<li>WOW WAIT I DID NOT KNOW THAT, THAT IS VERY USEFUL!!!!</li>
</ol>

<p>It looks like &ldquo;100 Common Mistakes&rdquo; is a series of books from Manning and they
also have &ldquo;100 Java Mistakes&rdquo; and an upcoming &ldquo;100 SQL Server Mistakes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Also I enjoyed what I&rsquo;ve read of <a href="https://effectivepython.com/">Effective Python</a> by Brett Slatkin, which has a similar &ldquo;here are a bunch of
short Python style tips&rdquo; structure where you can quickly skim it and take
what&rsquo;s useful to you. There&rsquo;s also Effective C++, Effective Java, and probably
more.</p>

<h3 id="some-other-go-resources">some other Go resources</h3>

<p>other resources I&rsquo;ve appreciated:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go by example</a> for basic syntax</li>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/play/">go.dev/play</a></li>
<li>obviously <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">https://pkg.go.dev</a> for documentation about literally everything</li>
<li><a href="https://staticcheck.dev/">staticcheck</a> seems like a useful linter &ndash; for
example I just started using it to tell me when I&rsquo;ve forgotten to handle an
error</li>
<li>apparently <a href="https://golangci-lint.run/">golangci-lint</a> includes a bunch of different linters</li>
</ul>
