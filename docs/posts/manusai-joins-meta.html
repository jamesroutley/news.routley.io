Through continuous product iteration, we’ve been working hard to make these capabilities more reliable and useful across a growing range of real-world use cases. In just a few months, our agent has processed more than 147 Trillion tokens and powered the creation of over 80 Million virtual computers.</span></span></span></p></div><div><p><span data-slate-node="text"><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span data-slate-string="true">We believe in the potential of autonomous agents, and this development reinforces Manus’s role as an execution layer — turning advanced AI capabilities into scalable, reliable systems that can carry out end-to-end work in real-world settings.</span></span></span></p></div><div><p><span data-slate-node="text"><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span data-slate-string="true">Our top priority is ensuring that this change won’t be disruptive for our customers. We will continue to sell and operate our product subscription service through our app and website. The company will continue to operate from Singapore.</span></span></span></p></div><div><p><span data-slate-node="text"><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span data-slate-string="true">Our solution is driving value for millions of users worldwide today. With time, we hope to expand this subscription to the millions of businesses and billions of people on Meta’s platforms.</span></span></span></p></div><div><p><span data-slate-node="text"><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span data-slate-string="true">“Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,” said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus. “We’re excited about what the future holds with Meta and Manus working together and we will continue to iterate the product and serve users that have defined Manus from the beginning.”</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
