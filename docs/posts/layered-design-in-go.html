    <h1>Layered Design in Go</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post will describe how I design my programs in Go. I needed this
for work, and while I searched for a link, nothing <em>quite</em> fits my
coding practices out there. The word “Layered” can pull up some fairly
close descriptions, but I want to lay out what I do.</p>
<h2 id="deriving-some-requirements">Deriving Some Requirements</h2>
<p>Go has a rule that I believe is underappreciated in its utility and
whose implications are often not fully grasped, which is: Packages may
not circularly reference each other. It is strictly forbidden. A
compile error.</p>
<p>Packages are also the primary way of hiding information within Go,
through the mechanism of <a href="https://go.dev/tour/basics/3">exported and unexported fields and
identifiers in the package</a>. Some people
will pile everything into a single package, and while I’m not quite
ready to call this unconditionally a bad idea, it does involve
sacrificing all ability to use information hiding to maintain
invariants, and that is a heck of a tool to put down. At any sort of
scale, you’d better have some concept of the discipline you’re going
to replace that with.</p>
<p>So for the purposes of this discussion, I’m going to discard the
“one large package approach”.</p>
<p>We also know that Go uses a package named <code>main</code> that contains a
function named <code>main</code> to define the entry point for a given
executable. The resulting package import structure is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic
graph</a>, where
the packages are the nodes and the imports are the directed edges, and
there is a distinguished “top node” for each executable.</p>
<p>So how do I deal with this requirement in Go?</p>
<h2 id="layered-design-in-go">Layered Design In Go</h2>
<p>This is a portion of a package hierarchy extracted from a real
project, with many of the names substituted and rubbed off, but the
relationships are approximately correct:</p>

    <img src="https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/go_layered_design/initial_mess.png" alt="a mess of boxes and lines that, with my apologies, really can&#39;t be captured in an alt text. sorry. hope the rest of the text makes sense to you."/>
    
        <figcaption>A sample set of packages</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>All imports of external modules are automatically not part of a loop
in the base package, so we can just look at the import patterns of the
application currently being written. Since loops are forbidden that
implies there must be packages that do not import any other package in
the application. Pull those out and put them on the bottom:</p>

        <figcaption>The packages that reference nothing separated.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>There is now a set of packages in the remaining set that only
reference the packages we just pulled out and put on the bottom. Put
them in their own layer:</p>

    <img src="https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/go_layered_design/layer_2.png" alt=""/>
    
        <figcaption>The packages that reference only the lower layer sorted out.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>You can repeat this process until you’ve layered everything by the
depth of the import stack:</p>



<figure>

    <img src="https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/go_layered_design/layer_full.png" alt=""/>
    
        <figcaption>The layers.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>All package imports now point downwards, though it can be hard to
tell.</p>
<p>If you look at the bottom, you see very basic things, like
“the package that provides metrics to everything else”,
“the package that refines the logging for our system”, and
“a set data structure”.</p>
<p>These are composed up into slightly higher level functionality that
uses logging, metrics, etc. and puts together things like header
functionality, or information about users (imagine permissions or
metadata are stored here).</p>
<p>Throughout this post I will refer “higher level packages”; in this
case, it literally refers to the way packages will appear “higher” on
this graph than any package it imports. It is not the definition of
“higher” we often use to mean “higher level of abstraction”; yes,
if a package offers a “higher level of abstraction” it will generally
of necessity also be a “higher level package”, but a
“higher level package” is often just a package that is using the lower
level package, not an abstraction, e.g., a “crawler” may have
<code>net/http</code> show up as a “lower level package” but a crawler is not any
sort of abstraction around <code>net/http</code> so much as it is just an
application that is using <code>net/http</code>.</p>
<p>These things are then composed into higher layer objects, and so
forth, and so forth, until you finally get to the desired application
functionality.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-descriptive-not-prescriptive">This Is Descriptive, Not Prescriptive</h3>
<p>If you are the sort of person who reads things about software
architecture, you are used to people making prescriptive statements
about design. For instance, one such statement I found in another
article about layered design in Go has the prescriptive statement that
layers should be organized into very formal layers, and that no layer
should ever reach down more than one level to import a package. That
is not a requirement imposed by Go, it is a <em>prescriptive</em> statement
by the author. You can see in my graph above I don’t agree with that
particular prescription, as I have imports that reach down multiple
levels.</p>
<p>However, the previous section is not prescriptive. It may sound like
prescriptions you’ve heard before, but it’s actually <em>required</em>. You
can graph <em>all</em> Go modules in the layers I described. It’s a
mathematical consequence of the rules for how packages are allowed to
import each other. It is descriptive of the reality in Go.</p>
<p>Which means that any other prescriptive design for a Go program <em>must</em>
sit on top of this structure. It has no choice. It may not be
necessary, but it is certainly <em>convenient</em> in MVC design for the
Model, View, and Controller to be able to mutually reference each
other, at least a little. In Go, that’s not an option, if you want
them separate from each other. You can do MVC, but you must do “MVC on
top of Go layering”. If you slam all of the MVC stuff into one package
for convenience, or for it to work at all, you’re increasing the odds
that you’ll still end up with circular loops between the packages
implementing other related Models or Views or Controllers.</p>
<p>You can “hexagonal architecture”, but you <em>must</em> do it on top of Go
layering.</p>
<p>You can do any design methodology you want, but it must always rigidly
fit the layered design described in the previous section, because it
is not an option.</p>
<p>They do not all go on top of this design constraint equally well.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-best-prescription">So What’s The Best Prescription?</h3>
<p>Naturally, this raises the question of what’s the best methodology to
sit on top of this.</p>
<p>My personal contention is that the answer is “none”. This is a
perfectly sensible and adequate design methodology on its own.</p>
<p>It harmonizes well with a lot of the points I make in <a href="https://jerf.org/iri/blogbooks/functional-programming-lessons-in-imperative-code/">Functional
Programming Lessons in Imperative
Code</a>. Particularly
the section about <a href="https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/fp_lessons_purity/">purifiable
subcomponents</a> and
the ability to compose multiple component’s purifications together. If
you design a shim for the metrics for testing the metrics in a pure
manner, you can then use that to design the purification for the
bodypart2 above. Then you can use that to design the purification for
the body package, which can then be fed into the classify package, and
through all that, you can get classification tests that don’t have to
depend on any external state, despite the fact it is sitting on top of
a lot of other packages.</p>
<p>Sometimes a purification component will “absorb” the tree under it, so
for instance, the contentmodel module may absorb all metrics and
other packages into itself so the contentmodel can ignore all that and
just use the test shim provided by the contentmodel package. Other
times it may be necessary to have multiple shims related to the
packages being imported. They’re already coupled by the import, so
this is not additional coupling. Generally it’s a bit of both in my
experience.</p>
<p>Any codebase can be decomposed this way with enough work. The work can
be nontrivial, but it gets a lot easier as you practice.</p>
<p>My favorite advantage of this methodology is that for any package you point
at, there is a well-defined and limited number of packages you need to
understand in order to understand the package you are looking at, even
considering the transitive closure of imports. It is effectively
impossible to write code that requires you to understand the entire
rest of the code base to understand it, because you can’t circularly
loop in all the important code in the entire code base
accidentally.</p>
<p>As code scales up, this strongly affords a style in which packages
generally use only and exactly what they need, because otherwise they
become too likely to participate in a circular import loop at some
point.</p>
<h3 id="local-prescriptions">Local Prescriptions</h3>
<p>That’s not to say that there aren’t high level designs that can be
helpful. Web handlers can use some higher level design
patterns. Database-heavy applications may bring in some higher level
patterns. The code base I extracted the diagram I used earlier from
has a plugin-based architecture in which a particular data structure
is flowed through a uniform plugin interface which has a few dozen
implementations on it. However, these can be used in just the parts of
the code base that make sense.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a particularly good idea to try to force any other
architecture on Go programs at the top level. Isolate them to parts of
the codebase where they make sense. At the very least, if one is going
to impose an architecture on to a code base, it needs to be one that
came from a world that has a similar circular import restriction,
whether imposed by the language or self-imposed, as I think
methodologies that implicitly incorporate the ability to have circular
imports in them tend to scale up poorly in Go.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-circular-dependencies">Avoiding Circular Dependencies</h2>
<p>If circular dependencies are impossible in Go, how do we deal with them?</p>
<p>There are multiple solutions, depending on exactly what your code base
is trying to express. I’ll go over some of them below, but first,
there’s a step to do first: When a circular dependency arises in your
code base, you must <em>deeply analyze</em> it and figure out <em>exactly</em> where
the circular dependency arises from.</p>
<p>I will not be so dogmatic as to say that every language should be
programmed without circular import loops, but I do think they are
something that should be <em>minimized</em> in every language. Pervasive
circular loops in a code base eventually make it impossible to
understand the code base without understanding the code base. This
poses… logical difficulties. Fortunately, the real situation is
never so stark as that, and one can eventually work one’s way up to
understanding even such a code base, but it is going to be a much more
difficult task for the pervasive circularity. So the techniques
discussed below are generally useful, even if you aren’t being
<em>forced</em> into using them. For non-Go languages, for the word
“package”, read
“whatever your primary information hiding mechanism is”, be it
classes, modules, or some other word.</p>
<p>It is not enough to say
“this package is circularly depending on that package”. It isn’t even
enough to say that this data structure is depending on that one. It
isn’t even enough to say that this method depends on that method. You
need to trace it down to what bits and pieces of a structure, specific
functionality the code is embodying. Break it down as finely as
possible, because as you ponder how to fix it, you may well be
breaking the code up along the lines you discover.</p>
<p>In general, when you come across a circular import error in the
compiler, it will be because you added some new code that created some
new dependency that turned out to be circular. In the discussions
below, I will refer to this as the “new circular code”. Upon analysis,
you should also be able to identify some particular set of variables
and bits of code that are the most modifiable aspect of the circular
dependency, which I will call the “breakable link” in the discussions
below.</p>
<p>Packages aren’t allowed to circularly reference each other, but
generally what is causing the circularity is much smaller than the
entire package.</p>
<p>Generally, if you can do one of these refactorings, you should,
because the resulting code will increase in conceptual clarity and
have a stronger design. It often as a side effect ends up reducing the
size of an interface of a package as it moves bits out of the exported
public interface that turn out not to belong there. Often if you
listen to the code, it tells you that it is wanting these things.</p>
<p>These are listed in roughly the order you should prefer them:</p>
<h3 id="move-the-functionality">Move The Functionality</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the most common in my experience, but it is
also the most important when it can be done. Sometimes after you
analyze the situation, you will find that the bit that is causing
circularity is simply in the wrong place. It probably belongs in the
same location as the new circular code.</p>
<p>This may involve slicing apart an existing conglomeration of
functionality. It could be three fields in a larger struct that turn
out to still belong together, but not to belong to the larger struct
at all. You may be slicing out bits of code and a field here and a
field there. It won’t just be about moving entire types around.</p>
<p>This will hold true for all the techniques below, so I’m not going to
mention this again and again. I just can’t emphasize enough that this
does not simply involve moving entire types around. You can even have
cases where you need to split something that looks like an atomic
field in half, though that’s rare. You need to get very granular.</p>
<p>In the rough and tumble of greenfield implementation, I find this
happens a lot initially as I am feeling out the correct
structure. Once past that phase though, this becomes rare. Still, if
you can do it, this is the best move, not just because it breaks the
circularity, but because it has the strongest outcome on the package
conceptual clarity I was talking about. A wholesale removing of the
concept that didn’t belong in the breakable link into the place it
belongs is, in the long term, a huge win for the code base.</p>

<p>If a package is reaching for something that lives in another package
that results in a circular dependency, consider moving that thing into
a new third package that both can import.</p>
<p>This happens for me most often when I was banging away, implementing
some particular functionality, and I needed some particular type,
let’s say <code>Username</code>, and since nothing else yet needed it, I just
dropped it into the package that needed it. As the program grows,
eventually something else wants to reference the <code>Username</code> in such a
way that it causes circularity. But <code>Username</code> should generally be
just a validated string of some sort. It can almost certainly be moved
into its own package.</p>
<p>The most likely reason you’re reluctant to do this… ok, well,
honestly, the <em>most</em> likely reason is that fundamental laziness we all
share and just not wanting to make the change at all… but the
<em>second</em> most likely reason you’re reluctant to do this is that having
an entire package for a single type like this feels like bad
design.</p>
<p>However, I suggest that you learn to just do it anyhow, because in my
experience, the <em>vast</em> majority of the time, if you could see how that
new package is going to evolve, it will turn out that this new type is
not going to live there alone forever, and indeed, probably not for
very long at all. Of all the times I’ve done this, I think only once
or twice have I ended up with a package that ended up with just one
type in it by the time the program finally “settled”. Try to think
about packages not just as snapshots in time but in terms of their
evolution through time. It is almost always the case that rather than
an isolated type or value, what you have is the first exemplar of some
new non-trivial concept your package will shortly start to embody in a
more complicated and complete sense.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-third-package-that-composes-the-circular-packages">A New Third Package That Composes The Circular Packages</h3>
<p>This is much like the previous case, but moves in the other
direction. If you have two packages circularly depending on each other
for some purpose, you may be able to extract out the dependency and
turn it into something that uses the two packages to achieve the task
that requires the circularity.</p>
<p>I use this less often after I got used to designing architectures
natively in Go. However, before then, I naturally brought in my old
inheritance-based object oriented architecture, and that makes it easy
to expect architectures that deeply depend on circularity to come into
play.</p>
<p>Consider this perfectly sensible example from the ORM world. You have
a <code>Category</code> in a package, representing a category table in the DB, and
a <code>BlogPost</code> in a package. Each has a many-to-many relationship with
the other, and as such the <code>.Save()</code> operation for each ends up
depending on other, creating a circularity.</p>
<p>What I do in these cases is usually make <code>Category</code> and <code>BlogPost</code>
effectively dumber; I break away from them the idea that they know how
to “save” themselves. I create a <code>Category</code> and a <code>BlogPost</code> that are
just the data structures they represent. A higher package can tie them
together through a many-to-many relationship, and a yet higher package
will be the thing that “knows” how to load them from the DB and save
any changes. That top-level package may get assistance from the
lower-level values through various custom interface methods like
<code>UnmarshalFromDB</code> or something.</p>
<p>(This doesn’t work terribly well with ORMs, but, well, this is
technically one of the many many reasons I tend to avoid them. I don’t
like the way they make every object have to “know” about the DB in
order to have one in hand. This is one of the more common
manifestations of the whole <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/07/19/you-wanted-banana/">you wanted a banana but what you
got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire
jungle</a>
problem. The layered design in Go is hostile to this approach because
the more of the jungle you end up with the more likely you have a
circular dependency, with odds rapidly approaching one. Go almost
forces you to have <code>Banana</code>s and <code>Gorilla</code>s that can be in isolation,
and expressing relationships in higher level packages… but it
doesn’t fully force it, and you can still fight it. You won’t have a
good time of it, though.)</p>
<h3 id="interface-to-break-the-dependency">Interface To Break The Dependency</h3>
<p>If a circular dependency results from taking some type that one of the
circular bits of code is going to call methods on, and the circularity
comes from the reference to the concrete type itself, you can break
the circularity by having one of the places involved in the circular
reference take an interface instead. That is, if you have something
like</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> (<span>ur</span> <span>UserRef</span>) <span>MyUserIsAdmin</span>(<span>adminDB</span> <span>users</span>.<span>DBList</span>) <span>bool</span> {
</span></span><span><span>     <span>return</span> <span>adminDB</span>.<span>Exists</span>(<span>ur</span>.<span>User</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and that is somehow a circular reference, you could consider:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>type</span> <span>UserList</span> <span>interface</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>Exists</span>(<span>username</span> <span>string</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> (<span>ur</span> <span>UserRef</span>) <span>MyUserIsAdmin</span>(<span>adminDB</span> <span>UserList</span>) <span>bool</span> {
</span></span><span><span>     <span>return</span> <span>adminDB</span>.<span>Exists</span>(<span>ur</span>.<span>User</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is not always a full solution. If the interface needs values from
that package as arguments or returns them as parameters this may still
leave a circular reference behind. However, even in these cases,
interfaces can still be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>You may need to create a new method that an interface can
implement. A common instance of this in Go is if the circular
reference is trying to get an exported field of some other struct. It
is fine to take that field, unexport it, and wrap it behind a method,
just so you can then use an interface to break the circular reference
chain.</p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that this is further down the list for a
reason. While interfaces may loosen the relationship between the two
packages enough to avoid being a circular dependency, it still creates
a relationship of a sort between them. While my example above
intrinsically lacks context, as is the way of little example snippets,
it would still suggest to me that there’s probably an improper mixing
of the concept of “user” and “admin” potentially going on here that is
the root cause of the circularity. Taking the time to slice packages
apart into clean pieces that do not have intermixed concepts will
still produce superior results.</p>
<p>In many cases I start pulling this out as a project matures, and it
has nearly attained the correct degree of separation. Sometimes you
get that last minute
“oh wait, these things need to be connected after all”, and this can
be a good tool to go ahead and spend some of that design capital you
have accrued through being more careful earlier in the design process.</p>
<h3 id="copy-the-dependency">Copy The Dependency</h3>
<p>One of the <a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/">proverbs of the Go
community</a> is
“A little copying is better than a little dependency.” This is usually
referenced in the context of not bringing in a large library just to
use a few line’s worth of code out of it, but it can apply to your own
code base too. If you’re importing an entire separate package for a
particular tiny snippet of code, and that code really does belong
there, maybe it would just be enough to have a copy of the lines in
the circular package as well.</p>
<p>This is also lower on the list for a reason. Do this every time you
have a problem and you will have the joy of rediscovering for yourself
the concept of “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. However, in my experience,
about the half the time I find myself backed into this particular
solution to circular dependency, as the code evolves it turns out this
was <a href="https://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2024/dry_strong/">false sharing and false
DRY</a> and the two
copies end up non-trivially, and correctly, diverging anyhow,
indicating they weren’t really the same thing after all.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-they-shouldnt-be-two-separate-packages">Maybe They Shouldn’t Be Two Separate Packages</h3>
<p>Finally, if none of the preceding solutions seem viable, even if you
put the effort in, perhaps because the circularity is just too
substantial, the answer may be that the code is telling you that this
is one package after all.</p>
<p>I rather like breaking things into lots of packages, for lots of
reasons, but every once in a while it’s true that I do get a bit too
zealous and I try to break something apart that just doesn’t work
separately. If this is happening to you <em>all the time</em>, you may still
need more practice and not be doing the work necessary to have a good
design, but this should happen at least sometimes in my opinion, or
you’re not trying hard enough to break things up.</p>
<p>The larger the resulting combined package would be, the more you
should fight for some other solution for breaking circular
dependencies, but as with all things in engineering, it’s ultimately a
cost/benefits decision.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-difference-between-this-and-anything-else">So What’s The Difference Between This And Anything Else?</h2>
<p>I admit I struggle to describe how this differs from other design
methodologies, mostly because I’ve been doing this for too long so I’m
too close to the problem, and after a while honestly all the
methodologies sort of blur together into one vague blob of good design
practices and the Quality Without A Name. Should this get to some link
aggregator site, let me issue my own criticism in advance of anyone
else that I am well aware there is still a certain fogginess to this
entire post, in that I have not succeeded in providing a simple recipe
that you can follow every time and I am myself dissatisfied with my
own description of the benefits, despite the fact I believe I have
experienced substantial benefits from taking this approach over
years. Consider this an attempt to write my way to that level of
clarity, and one that is not done yet.</p>
<p>However, this approach does produce at least one thing distinctly
different from many other designs, which is that every package ends up
being <em>something useful</em> on its own terms. For instance, consider a
standard web framework with a standard ORM design. ORMs make it very
easy to introduce the want-banana-get-jungle problem described
above. Even architectures heavy on dependency injection can still end
up making it so every service requires effectively every possible
dependency and thus even though in principle everything is
“purifiable”, nothing is actually usable in isolation because
you still have to provide every service that exists in the system, because
nothing stops this from happening if you can have circular
references. In principle you can use things if you only provide their
dependencies, but if “providing their dependencies” still involves
providing every service in the system, it still is not truly
severable.</p>
<p>This architecture tends to force you to narrow things down to just
what they need and nothing else. If you have a system for classifying
emails, it will generally just need an email and the relevant
classification services you may need for an email; it won’t need the users
and whether those users are admins and what the users are admins over
and the forums that the users are admins over and the top posts of the
forums the users are admins over. If the email classification needs to
reach back up to something about those details, it’ll be isolated into
interfaces that can be mocked or stubbed or whathaveyou. If you just
need a user’s name, you will generally find yourself being forced to
do that over an interface for “yielding a name” rather than pulling in
the entire package for a user, and all of its dependencies.</p>
<p>Many methodologies might metaphorically object that their entire point
is to produce useful things that stand on their own, but it’s really
easy for them to <em>in practice</em> still require jungles in order to have
bananas. This methodology tends to produce <em>practically</em> useful things
in isolation.</p>
<p>On such occasions as I have had to split bits and pieces off into
microservices from what was previously a monolith, it has been an
almost mechanical process, simply following the dependencies,
providing them, and ending up with a functioning service. Every once
in a while I have to trim something I lazily bundled together a bit,
but the system has already been pushed far in that direction so it’s
not a shock to the code base. I find this is a fantastic way to design
“monolithic microservice” codebases, where the microservices can
indeed be pulled out later in very practical amounts of work if that
is desirable.</p>
<p>One of the things I would not call part of this design methodology in
general, but something that is a good idea for any Go package
regardless of what is is doing, is to try to minimize the amount of
exported stuff coming from the package. Use godoc to see what is being
exported… after all, you write documentation on your code anyhow,
right?… and when a package is sort of wrapping up, audit each
exported symbol to see if you <em>really</em> need to export it. The thinner
the public interface, the better this works. It is better to
overzealously keep things unexported, because it is really easy to
re-export something it turns out you should have simply by renaming (a
rename operation your IDE should support and which is guaranteed by
its nature to be isolated within your one package even if you do it
manually) then to unexport something previously exported. (Your IDE
should tell you if a symbol you are trying to unexport is still being
used if you use its rename functionality.)</p>
<p>Still, I don’t deny that if you read this and either don’t feel like
you have a good grasp of what I’m really talking about, or how it
differs from other methodologies, or indeed whether or not it is
really possible and practical, there is an irreducible degree to which
you just need to try it out for yourself, even in a language other
than Go. (Although if you try it in something other than Go, you
<em>need</em> circular imports to be some sort of compile or build failure
for this to work. They get sneaky!) I would recommend a greenfield
project; it is possible but really quite tedious and at times
difficult to tear apart an existing system written against another
methodology and pull it into this one, though I think that’s just a
general rearchitecting truth and not a particular problem with this.</p>
