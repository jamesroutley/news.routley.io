    <h1>Core Versus Crust</h1>

<p>The art of a great painting is not in any one idea, nor in a multitude of separate tricks for placing all those pigment spots, but in the great network of relationships among its parts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the collection of data and code that comprise a digital resource are by themselves as valueless as aimless, scattered daubs of paint. What counts is what we make of them, in operational and functional phases of processes in systems.</p>
<p>The value of a FAIR resource lies not in some small, precious core, but in its vast, constructed crust.</p>
<p>A fierce belief in conceptual cores – in spirits, souls, or essences – may insinuate a helplessness to improve. To seek virtue in such cores may be as wrongly aimed a search as seeking art in canvas cloths by scraping off the painter’s work.</p>
