    <h1>My Struggle with Doom Scrolling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It&#39;s been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable <em>scrolling</em> addiction.</p>
<h2>Fighting the interconnected reality</h2>
<p>There are simply too many means to escapism in one&#39;s electronic devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
</li>
<li>
Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc
</li>
<li>
All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone
</li>
<li>
You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn&#39;t people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so.</p>
<h2>Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Let&#39;s experiment.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delete content apps
<ul>
<li>
Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit
</li>
<li>
Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB
</li>
<li>
Messaging: Gmail, Slack
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete the browser from the phone
<ul>
<li>
Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone
</li>
<li>
Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop
<ul>
<li>
I used to have &#34;Arc&#34; browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some early-stage issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it&#39;s not a frequent problem.
</li>
<li>
I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to.
</li>
<li>Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems
<ul>
<li>
I didn&#39;t even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app.
</li>
<li>
In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn&#39;t have a browser anymore.
</li>
<li>
Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser.
</li>
<li>
Some quick, simple tasks don&#39;t need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Without the Email app, it&#39;s difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up.
</li>
<li>
Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don&#39;t really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I&#39;m behind my desk and I&#39;m not busy with focused, deep work.
</li>
<li>
Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I&#39;ve tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all.
</li>
<li>Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone.
<ul>
<li>
Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part
</li>
<li>
To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Later modifications</h4>
<p>To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal launch UI to break my habits:
<ul>
<li>
The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons
</li>
<li>This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view
<ul>
<li>
For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it&#39;s difficult for me to open it directly.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites
<ul>
<li>
An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new browser instead of Chrome
<ul>
<li>
Doing this helped me break some old habits I&#39;ve formed over the years with a browser I&#39;m used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I&#39;m seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can&#39;t lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what&#39;s available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play &#34;Spelling Bee,&#34; a game I enjoy and it has a daily &#34;end&#34; state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn&#39;t much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It&#39;s been a while that I&#39;m able to choose to read when I&#39;m looking for something to do besides work and chores.</p>
<p>I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I&#39;m happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I&#39;m doing what I need to do.</p>
