    <h1>Whistleblower Josh Dean of Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems and one of the first whistleblowers to allege Spirit leadership had ignored manufacturing defects on the 737 MAX, died Tuesday morning after a struggle with a sudden, fast-spreading infection. </p><p>Known as Josh, Dean lived in Wichita, Kan., where Spirit is based. He was 45, had been in good health and was noted for having a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>He died after two weeks in critical condition, his aunt Carol Parsons said.</p><p>Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said: “Our thoughts are with Josh Dean’s family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones.”</p><p>Dean had given a deposition in a Spirit shareholder lawsuit and also filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit.</p><p>Spirit fired Dean in April 2023, and he had filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging his termination was in retaliation for raising concerns related to aviation safety.</p>
<p>Parsons said Dean became ill and went to the hospital because he was having trouble breathing just over two weeks ago. He was intubated and developed pneumonia and then a serious bacterial infection, MRSA.</p><p>His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was airlifted from Wichita to a hospital in Oklahoma City, Parsons said. There he was put on an ECMO machine, which circulates and oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body, taking over heart and lung function when a patient’s organs don’t work on their own.</p><p>His mother posted a message Friday on Facebook relating all those details and saying that Dean was “fighting for his life.”</p><p>He was heavily sedated and put on dialysis. A CT scan indicated he had suffered a stroke, his mom’s post said.</p><p>By the end, doctors were considering amputating both hands and both feet. “It was brutal what he went through,” Parsons said. “Heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Dean was represented by a law firm in South Carolina that also represented Boeing whistleblower John “Mitch” Barnett. </p><p>Barnett was <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-787-whistleblower-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/">found dead in an apparent suicide in March</a>. He was in the midst of giving depositions alleging Boeing retaliated against him for complaints about quality lapses when he was found dead from a gunshot wound in Charleston, S.C., where Boeing has its 787 manufacturing facility. </p><p>The Charleston County Coroner’s Office reported Barnett’s death appeared to be “from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” Almost two months later, the police investigation into his death is still ongoing.</p><p>Brian Knowles, one of Dean’s lawyers, said he didn’t want to speculate about the close timing and circumstances of the two deaths.</p><p>“Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” Knowles said. “It’s a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family.”</p><p>Dean, a mechanical engineer, began working at Spirit in 2019. He was laid off the next year following pandemic-related job cuts and returned to Spirit in May 2021 as a quality auditor.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Dean said he found a serious manufacturing defect: mechanics improperly drilling holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of the MAX. When he flagged this issue with management, he said nothing was done. </p><p>Focused on those defects, he said he missed during that same audit <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-737-max-production-hit-by-a-new-defect-in-supplier-part/">a separate manufacturing flaw in the fittings that attach the vertical tail fin to the fuselage</a>. When that was discovered in April and caused a delivery pause at Boeing’s Renton plant, Dean was fired.</p><p>Then in August, Spirit announced <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-cfo-says-latest-737-max-defect-will-impact-deliveries-and-profits/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-cfo-says-latest-737-max-defect-will-impact-deliveries-and-profits/">the discovery of improperly drilled holes in the MAX’s aft pressure bulkhead</a>, a flaw that was present in MAXs built as early as 2019. This caused another delivery halt in Renton.</p>      <p>With that discovery, Dean filed a safety complaint with the FAA. He said Spirit had used him as a scapegoat and had lied to the FAA about the aft pressure bulkhead defects.</p><p>“After I was fired, Spirit AeroSystems [initially] did nothing to inform the FAA, and the public” about their knowledge of the aft pressure bulkhead defects, he wrote in his complaint.</p><p>In November, the FAA sent Dean a letter stating that it had completed an investigation of the safety issues he had flagged. The letter cloaks the outcome though it seems to confirm that his allegations had substance.</p>
<p>“The investigation determined that your allegations were appropriately addressed under an FAA-approved safety program,” the FAA wrote. “However, due to the privacy provisions of those programs, specific details cannot be released.” </p><p>That same month, Dean filed his aviation whistleblower complaint with the Department of Labor, alleging wrongful termination and “gross misconduct of senior level Spirit AeroSystems Quality Managers.” </p><p>That case was still pending.</p><p>After he left Spirit, Dean took a job for a short time at Boeing Wichita, then left to work for another company.</p><p>The shareholder lawsuit alleging that Spirit management withheld information on the quality flaws and harmed stockholders was filed in December. Supporting the suit, Dean provided a deposition detailing his allegations.</p><p>After a panel blew off a Boeing 737 MAX plane in January, bringing new attention to the quality lapses at Spirit, one of Dean’s former Spirit colleagues <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/with-boeing-in-hot-seat-claims-against-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-take-shape/">confirmed some of Dean’s allegations</a>.</p>
