    <h1>Mastodon.technology Shutdown</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear mastodon.technology community,</p><p>I have sad news that I have decided to shut down the mastodon.technology instance. In accordance with the <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/introducing-the-mastodon-server-covenant/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>, the server will be shut down no earlier than December 1, 2022.</p><p>The server is currently having problems with intermittent availability. The cause of the problems is unknown. I want to give you as much time as possible to download your data and migrate to a new server.</p><p>Migrating will be hampered by the current problems we’re experiencing. I wish this was easier, but this is the best I can do.</p><p>It’s been five and a half years that I’ve ran this instance and I never saw it ending. I think this was irresponsible of me and has led to the current state of intermittent unavailability. I’ve failed to think ahead and have put my user’s data at risk, and I am sorry.</p><h2 id="why-now"><a href="#why-now" aria-label="why now permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Why Now?</h2><p>A member of my family was very recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. I am doing everything I can to support them.</p><p>Last week, with yet more Elon Musk and Twitter news, the fediverse generally experienced extra traffic with an influx of new users. I woke up to mastodon.technology downtime alerts. In the midst of supporting my family, I had to ssh into a server and fiddle with settings.</p><p>I am exhausted.</p><p>This made me realize how little joy I’ve been getting from being an admin. How I’ve come to resent the work I have volunteered to do. I’ve donated countless hours to running the instance, solving both technical and moderation problems, and I’ve always put the instance above my own needs. But I can’t put the instance above the needs of my family.</p><p>The server has also gotten too large and too complex for me to administer. I’ve always been keen to learn the next new skill I need to be an effective admin. But I just don’t have it in me anymore. The monitoring that I have in place is insufficient to solve the current problems and I have zero bandwidth to invest in learning the skills to diagnose and fix the issue.</p><p>In a sense, this is both a personal and technical problem. I wish I could continue, but I can’t.</p><h2 id="why-not-transfer-to-a-new-admin"><a href="#why-not-transfer-to-a-new-admin" aria-label="why not transfer to a new admin permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Why Not Transfer to a New Admin?</h2><p>Users have put their trust in me with their data. Choosing a new admin would require a massive amount of trust, since they’d have access to over a half decade of user data. Not just data from my local users, but from users they have interacted with.</p><p>Choosing and vetting such a new admin would be a lot of work, not to mention the messy process of transferring each piece of infrastructure to them.</p><p>If I had started this process six months ago, this might be possible. But I missed that window.</p><h2 id="what-next"><a href="#what-next" aria-label="what next permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>What next?</h2><p>By November 1, 2022, the instance will be put into a readonly mode: posting new local content to the server will be disabled while it continues to federate. This announcement post will be shown everywhere I can to spread news.</p><p>The Patreon will also be disabled by November 1, 2022.</p><p>Users will be able to download their data and migrate to a new server until at least December 1, 2022 (notwithstanding the availability issues).</p><hr/><p>I wish I had done this sooner. I wish I had been more realistic about what I could put into the server. I wish I had kept the instance much smaller, to avoid these problems. I have a lot of regrets.</p><p>But I’m also glad I did this. For over five years, I’ve provided a space for technology people to meet and socialize away from corporate social media. I’ve enforced a strict Code of Conduct that has fostered a really positive community. I’ve made a lot of friends.</p><p>I would do things differently next time, but I would still do this again. As I said: I wish I could continue, but I can’t.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Ash</p></div></div>
