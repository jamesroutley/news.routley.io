    <h1>Help HN: Starlink Signup failed, no recourse</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>On october 27th, when I first heard about Starlink for RV&#39;s, I immediately signed up at starlink.com and paid €480. I filled in my email and my phone number, but to date I have not received a confirmation of receipt from Starlink. The payment was a direct transfer.</p><p>I have gone through the (not great) starlink support pages, and one can apparently only contact starlink through an account that becomes available through the confirmation email. Naturally I have none. It also states that if that confirmation email wasn&#39;t confirmed, the order would be cancelled after 7 days (it hasn&#39;t). There was no email in my Spam folder.</p><p>Now it&#39;s been over 3 weeks. I am a customer but as far as starlink is concerned, I am not. They obviously did their utmost best to not need a helpdesk, having generous procedures in place for when things fail. There is no one to talk to, not even a silly bot. This is all great when it works, but when you fall on the side where things don&#39;t work as intended, as I do now, it doesn&#39;t exactly feel great. It feels like a scam, it&#39;s indistinguishable.</p><p>There is also a potential for a scam. If I somehow filled in a slightly wrong email address someone else could, in theory, have taken over my account, and could have redirected the shipment. The point is, I&#39;ll never know, and I was not made aware of such risk while signing up. Indeed the signup experience was strangely feed-forward, without an email-confirmation step. In the end it felt like I was supposed to dump €480 into a void, with nothing to show for, except a bank transfer. I was forced to rely on the reputation of the brand, only.</p><p>I think the above is a relevant data-point to many of you (non-scammers), because it represents an extreme case, even beyond Google, one where not only the non-fallability of software artifacts is presumed, but also the non-fallability of the organizational process that led to its 100% no-contact design.</p><p>That&#39;s sure to have some relevance to the community, but of course I just want someone to talk to and solve what could have been the smallest of issues. Any advice on how to proceed next is appreciated.</p><p>Edit:</p><p>- as commenters have mentioned, there is a reset option, by email or phone. AFAIK neither works.</p><p>- I&#39;m pretty sure I filled in everything correctly, and at the correct site. Never had this kind of problem.</p></div></td></div></div>
