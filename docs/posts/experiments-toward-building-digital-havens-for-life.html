<p>As a kid I passed a lot of time in my own head. I went to a Quaker school for the first couple of grades where they
would regularly gather us all for meeting and have us sit quietly. If the spirit moved you to speak you were encouraged
to stand up and do so to the group. I would sit there and get lost in my own thoughts, but every so often someone would
stand and speak out. It always felt like an unwelcome shock. But after we settled back into silence there would be a new
kink in the path of my thinking and I usually enjoyed seeing where it led me.</p>

<p>Our driveway was an old gravel road half a mile long. After switching to a regular public school I would walk it each
day and have a different kind of meeting experience. Either walking quietly with my brothers or alone. I’d feel the air
and the light, smell the dirt and see the leaves rustle or hear snow and ice crunch. Nature and the environment around
me filled in for the spirit in other people in keeping my thinking from going stale.</p>

<p>I love science fiction and thinking about the far future. Why are we here and where is it all headed? My favorite
stories replace or extend the laws of the world we know and then play out the consequences. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babylon_(story)">Tower of
Babylon</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation_(short_story)">Exhalation</a> by Ted Chiang both replace familiar rules and then
play out where that leads. It’s easy to change rules at random, but I think it takes some genius to figure out how to
change the rules so that an interesting story emerges from their faithful application.</p>

<p>Greg Egan is a science fiction author who extends or fills in between the laws we know. I cherish his work because it
always makes me feel like I’m stretching my mind like dough. And because it convinces me that it is possible to at least
imagine a future where humans keep learning but don’t use that as leverage to destroy themselves or the world around
them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I keep asking myself, though: where do we go from here? History can’t guide us. Evolution can’t guide us. The C-Z
charter says understand and respect the universe . . . but in what form? On what scale? With what kind of senses, what
kind of minds? We can become anything at all — and that space of possible futures dwarfs the galaxy. Can we explore it
without losing our way? Fleshers used to spin fantasies about aliens arriving to ‘conquer’ Earth, to steal their
‘precious’ physical resources, to wipe them out for fear of ‘competition’… as if a species capable of making the
journey wouldn’t have had the power, or the wit, or the imagination, to rid itself of obsolete biological imperatives.
Conquering the galaxy is what bacteria with spaceships would do — knowing no better, having no choice.”
– <cite>Excerpt From Diaspora by Greg Egan</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was refreshing myself about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft">von Neumann probes</a> and came
across a paper from Carl Sagan and William Newman called
“<a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983QJRAS..24..113S">The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence</a>”. It
makes the point that civilizations which develop sufficiently such that they can send out machines to dominate the
universe might necessarily pick up a level of intelligence and maturity that they decide it is in their interest not to
do so.</p>

<p>If scientific and technological progress actually leads inward towards a more empathic relationship to the universe I
wonder what that means for the concept of a technological singularity. Maybe instead of the popularly discussed type of
singularity that is loud like a bomb going off this one is more like ripples being lost among ocean waves? We learn how
to fade into the background noise and just think and observe, staying in touch with the real world instead of sealing
ourselves in bubbles of our own design until we go stale and cease to meaningfully live.</p>

<p>I enjoy imagining humanity heading in that direction. What could it look like along the way?</p>



<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>A surface like a comb in a bee hive made up of innumerable cells matted with light-bearing fibers. A faint glow resolves
to a turbulent sea of superpositioned messages propagating cell-to-cell when slowed a million-fold. At the edges new
cells mature and come online to add fresh computational safety margin for the substrate’s inhabitants. Damaged and dying
cells are left high and dry, moving a shoreline in rule space separating the inner world from the outer one.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-grid-comms-anim.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>I spent a short fixed block of time during the summer of 2021 exploring building this concept. What is recounted here is
much more a collection of a few experiments than a fleshed out implementation of anything.</p>

<p>The rough idea I had was to work out how to make a digital optical communication system in isolation without worrying
about how it looked. In parallel I would come up with ways to map that design to a physical design that looked the way I
wanted. Then I could try doing both parts for one cell. And later scale it up to a larger network. After that I’d figure
out how to use the network to run some kind of distributed simulation that would let simple agents occupy an
environment.</p>

<p>The optical communications network didn’t need to be efficient. It just needed to let messages be passed along and
eventually reach their intended destination. I rummaged through my parts bins and decided that the walls of the cells
would have LEDs for transmitting data and photoresistors for receiving it. Code running on an 8 bit ATtiny
microcontroller would  handle converting messages to and from pulses of light. I decided I would hand-wave away the
details of this process at the beginning and just trust I’d be able to solve it somehow in software later.</p>

<p>Light would be carried from the LEDs on one wall to the photodetectors on others via light guides which I would 3D print
in resin. I had used this trick on some product development projects in the past so I knew it could work in principle.</p>

<p>I wanted the whole assembly to look like it was grown. Which would mean most parts would have to be unique even if they
behaved the same. I didn’t want to design each cell by hand so I needed to come up with some sort of generative
algorithm for each subsystem. There would be constraints in both directions, between the physical fame, the light
guides, and the electronics. The electronics were going to be the most difficult part because no matter what I did to
them I had to ensure they would still function afterwards. If the circuit was too complicated it wouldn’t be practical
to achieve that. But if it was too simple it wouldn’t help sell the overall narrative of the artifact.</p>

<p>I settled on a specific scope- I’d start with a regular hexagonal grid for the frame. But the walls of each cell and the
mat of 3D printed light guides in the center would be entirely unique per cell, created using a generative approach. I
would define the electrical net for the computation and communications circuit and then just modify its layout
generatively for the inner face of each cell wall. Then I would take the resulting locations of the LEDs and
photodetectors as fixed constraints fed into the generation of a 3D model for the light guides to print.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-steps.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I worked backwards again by first working out a generative system for the light guides in SideFX Houdini. Input
consisted of the points where the LEDs and photoresistors would be on each wall. Later these would be fed in from the
result of whatever PCB generative system I came up with. For each LED I chose random photoresistors from the other walls
and created a line from the LED to each of them. Then I set up a force-directed iterative solver which pushed them apart
from each other (in a Solver node: resample -&gt; apply force -&gt; move).</p>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-force-growth-pathing.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>Here’s an animation showing that iterative process. You can see it pushing the light guides apart but it’s not fully
avoiding intersections between them. I was hoping this would be “good enough” and not compromise the optical
communication too much. Maybe the unintentional cross channel mixing would need to be compensated for in software. Or
those fibers could be left unused. Intersections were also structurally convenient- providing a way to hold the 3D print
together for installation.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-wall-test-pcb.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Getting back to the electronics I decided to work on the light emission part first. I wanted to have a single layer PCB
design, which meant having a circuit topology which required no overlaps. I also wanted to maximize the number of LEDs
that I could drive from the limited number of pins on the ATtiny. So I looked at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing">Charlieplexing</a>, which is a technique for driving lots of LEDs from few
pins using the common ability of microcontroller pins to be in 3 different states: 1) high impedance input
(disconnected) 2) driven to ground 3) driven to the system logic voltage. Full Charlieplexing wouldn’t have been
possible with a 1 layer design so I pruned it until I had a 1 layer design which drove 18 LEDs from 6
I/O pins.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-cell-pcbs.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I designed a simple frame that I could also cut out on my Othermill from copper-clad FR1 and solder together.</p>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/light-hive-cell-test.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>Soldered together and programmed with a simple pin state cycling program I got the proof of concept I was after. Now I
had a basic working single layer PCB design which could programmatically control 18 LEDs. I could only read one
photoresistor but I decided I would focus on light transmission first and come back to receiving light signals later.</p>

<h2 id="growing-pcbs">Growing PCBs</h2>

<p>Now my plan was to get the circuit net into Houdini, do some simple force-directed iterative manipulation on it, and
then get it back out as a PCB that I could fabricate. If I could come up with a reliable pipeline for that then I would
have a way to organically randomize the PCB design for each inner face. I would just have to keep extending it after I
went back and designed the full circuit which also included light reception.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/grown-pcb-topo.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>To import the circuit topology I laid it out as a mesh in Blender with each LED as a vertex and edges representing
electrical connections.</p>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/grown-pcb-line-growth-test.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>In Houdini I adapted the same approach that I had used for the light guides. The basic idea is to lengthen the edges
while creating new points if they get longer than a threshold distance. By combining that with forces to push the
vertices apart and around you end up with a simple but very flexible generative growth system.</p>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/grown-pcb-growing.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>I fed the circuit topology into it and played around with the forces until I got some results that I liked. I attached
some extra data to the vertices so I could keep track of which ones represented LEDs and which were added to grow the
traces.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/grown-pcb-in-kicad.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Then I wrote some Python code to transform the mesh into traces for KiCad. It’s easy to do this because the formats used
by KiCad for schematics and PCBs are fairly well documented s-expressions. And you can just load them into your
clipboard and then paste them directly into KiCad. I pasted the raw geometry in and then I added some traces to allow
me to connect to it more easily for testing, as well as an outline with mounting holes.</p>

<video src="/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/grown-pcb-stalks.mp4" loop="" autoplay="" controls="" muted=""></video>

<p>I got an idea for generating the light guides differently that I wanted to try. Basically just some particle systems
generating volumes and booleaned with fixed mating geometry created based on the locations of the LEDs.</p>

<p>Everything assembled together and lit up looked neat, but the light didn’t do what I was hoping it would in the resin.
Shortly after I got sucked into a different project so this is where the chain of experiments ended.</p>




<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFoL7ofDY9o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Fast forward to 2023 and I was in batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> and I found some activation
energy to jump back into similar generative hardware systems design. I also wanted to get more fluent in Rust. So this
time I looked more at tools I could use to prototype the software that would run on a distributed/amorphous computer
like the light hive described above. I didn’t want to do purely abstract modeling, because at the end of the day I
aspire to build beautiful artifacts in the real world. So I tried prototyping a semi-interactive design toolkit for
myself which would let me use generative techniques to build up a virtual sculpture that could actually run code like
the real instantiation would.</p>

<p>I love Houdini for prototyping procedural/generative systems so I decided I would just build some external parts that
would plug into Houdini and reconfigure/reload themselves when changes were made to the design. I want the
sculptures/artifacts to be interactive so I needed a GUI for interacting with the simulation. I ended up building that
as a web app which used React Three Fiber to render the 3D model generated from Houdini and reload it when it changed.
The Houdini scene annotated the geometry in a specific way so each individual part was labeled and could be updated to
reflect changes to the state of the simulation. For example, a part could change color if its virtual LED lit up. And if
I clicked on a part of the sculpture in the 3D scene that could generate a signal that would eventually reach a virtual
input within the simulation so the virtual microcontrollers could react to it.</p>

<p>To simulate the virtual computer network I built a tool I called <a href="https://github.com/jmpinit/mycochip/">mycochip</a> in
Rust. I used simavr mainly because I’m nostalgic for the AVR architecture, it’s very simple, and I know it like the back
of my hand. The network configuration (e.g. number, type, and connectivity of the nodes) could be defined using YAML
generated from the Houdini scene. Inputs and outputs from the simulated AVRs could be streamed over sockets in Protocol
Buffer messages.</p>

<p>A Node.js server hosted the web app, connected to the running mycochip simulation, and watched for updates to any of the
scene files like the 3D models. Clicking on a part of the sculpture connected to a sensor in the browser would cause an
event to get sent to Node.js over a WebSocket and then on to the relevant microcontroller running in mycochip. Real AVR
code could then react to the input and send messages to other connected AVRs. The state of any connected outputs on the
AVRs would be synced back out to the web app.</p>

<p>If you would like to see it in action then take a look at the YouTube video embedded above.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/eye-stalk-sculpture-full-wireframe.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I made this prototype sculpture in a few hours as a quick demo but I ended up liking the way it turned out. The way I
imagine it, the central stalks would be made of glass. The real imaginary system would be buried under the ground with
just the tips of these stalks poking out to see the sky. I had
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now">the 10k year Long Now Foundation Clock</a> design in mind while
working on it. The glass stalks would concentrate light and carry it down to buried clusters of computers so the virtual
inhabitants could observe the sky or maybe receive communications from orbiting colonies.</p>

<p><img src="https://tangled.sh/assets/experiments-toward-building-digital-havens-for-life/eye-stalk-steps.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The way it is built up in Houdini is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A spline provides a base curve for each of the three clusters.</li>
  <li>Points are scattered for the stalk tips and then swept along the base curve with a scale that was varied using an
adjustment curve I set by hand.</li>
  <li>A surface is created and distorted using a cloth physics simulation. Points are scattered on it for the compute
nodes. The points are connected to the ends of the stalks.</li>
  <li>The stalks are swept with a circular cross-section to give them volume.</li>
  <li>Spheres are booleaned onto the ends.</li>
  <li>The distorted surface comes back…</li>
  <li>…and is used to align models for the compute nodes toward the ends of the stalks.</li>
  <li>The full cluster is complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the video you can see how the system can be easily adjusted after it’s set up to try out different arrangements or
entirely different ideas.</p>
