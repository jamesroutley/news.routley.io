		<p>American Airlines has been clamping down on websites that work with AAdvantage member data for their customers.  They <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/american-airlines-wont-let-you-track-your-aadvantage-account-with-award-wallet-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made Award Wallet stop tracking member accounts</a> and they sent a cease and desist letter to Red Ventures, which owns <i>The Points Guy</i>, over its TPG app which – among other things – lets customers track their frequent flyer program balances.</p>
<p>The app didn’t have authorized access to American AAdvantage accounts.  Instead, as I understand it, it had been ‘screen scraping’ accounts for members, who provide their login credentials.  American sought to stop the practice, and so Red Ventures first sued American Airlines seeking declaratory relief.  And now <a href="https://www.law.com/radar/card/american-airlines-inc-et-al-v-red-ventures-llc-43285940-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Airlines and its loyalty subsidiary have countersued</a> in the Northern District of Texas.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Attorneys led by] Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher .. accuse[..] The Point Guy of accessing AAdvantage members accounts through its mobile application in alleged violation of American’s terms and conditions. The suit further contends that The Point Guy’s app displays American’s trademarks and copyrights without permission or licensing. </p></blockquote>
<p>An American Airlines spokesperson offers,</p>
<blockquote><p>Red Ventures is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information. We have been in discussions with Red Ventures, hoping to amicably resolve the issues, and we were surprised when Red Ventures filed its lawsuit last Tuesday. We take customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously, and want to make sure it is protected and secure.</p></blockquote>
<p>When American Airlines <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/american-airlines-wont-let-you-track-your-aadvantage-account-with-award-wallet-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced Award Wallet to stop tracking AAdvantage accounts</a> two things seemed clear: </p>
<ol><li>The issue wasn’t security, since Award Wallet and American had a security protocol in place, and access via an API. The <i>Points Guy</i> app wasn’t doing the same thing, but American has a path to address any security concerns while allowing members to manage their accounts as they choose.<br/>
</li><li>The interest was monetization of customer eyeballs, an American Airlines source shared that they wanted customers checking accounts at AA.com where they could be marketed to.</li></ol>
<p>I spoke with Brian Kelly, who founded <i>The Points Guy</i> and Brian shared he views the crucial issue as “a consumer should have the right to track their points.”  </p>
<p>He noted that on April 1, 2022 American will start expiring miles again, so he finds the move against sites which help members keep track of their miles to be curiously timed, although I don’t believe that’s a motivation in the way pushing members to AAdvantage marketing channels appears to be.</p>
<p>Brian shared that they haven’t received cease and desist letters from any other loyalty program – including United and Delta which have pushed back on other third parties accessing their data.</p>
<p>I’d actually love to see the question of whether American AAdvantage website terms and conditions preclude third party access to the site, or use of account credentials supplied to them by the members themselves, litigated to a conclusion.  The parent company of <i>The Points Guy</i> certainly has the resources to prosecute this if they ultimately follow that path.  </p>
<p>Red Ventures owns CNet, Lonely Planet, Bankrate and numerous other websites and reportedly over 3000 employees and a valuation in excess of $11 billion, making its CEO Ric Elias – a passenger on US Airways 1549 – worth over $2 billion personally.  And they’ve taken an aggressive stance by filing suit <i>first</i>.</p>

					<p>What do the AAdvantage terms and conditions state?  Typically, programs state that the data belongs to the program.  The property right belongs to the program and the member has a limited-use license.  As such, the program grants access of ITS data to the member.  But, the program does not allow its data to be shared by the member with a third party.  A program could justifiably state that a violation of this provision is grounds for forfeiture of points and closure of one’s account.</p>
<p>Don’t believe it?  Just take a look at AMEX MR terms and conditions.  Amex owns the points.  The cardholder has NO property rights in the points.</p>

				<p>Even after all these years, I do not understand why someone allows a third party to access to their loyalty programs.  Is it seriously that burdensome to beam up a website directly and check the status of your points and miles?  Do people not realize that a problem with their points/miles will be twice as difficult to solve if there are 3 parties involved?  When someone uses your points to buy $250K of Amazon gift cards over a two-week period, do you really want to deal with your ‘wallet’ people as well as the bank, airline or hotel?  Working directly with Chase, it was all handled in ten days with minimal angst.  Why do people want a third party involved in their loyalty programs?  I just don’t get it.</p><!-- .comment-content -->

				<p>To those wondering why anyone would need a 3rd party tool to track your miles instead of checking it your self. Well… you must be new to this game of collecting points and miles. I play the game in 4+ player mode… often 6+… that’s my family of 4 plus my parents and one in law. That’s 7 AA accounts to track. I’m type of user a tool like AwardWallet and Mint is intended for. My AwardWallet is tracking 68 accounts and don’t get me started on Mint. That’s Not including AA and United accounts. At least I can track some of Delta accounts through Amex logins.</p><!-- .comment-content -->

					<p>Ditto. My AwardWallet is tracking 48 accounts, of which roughly half belong to my immediate family. It is a PITA to manually update WN and now I guess I will have to do that for AA too. Normally would not care as we rarely fly AA but if points expire then we will have to do some shopping miles and track those points. </p>
<p>Would be great to see AAdvantage slapped down but that’s a fantasy given legal precedent which bends over to cater to the airlines.</p>

				<p>Maybe I just don’t understand this.  From an economic and brand awareness standpoint, shouldn’t AA be in favor of ANYTHING that drives interest in tracking and accumulating AA  miles or loyalty points, whether internal to AA or external ?  And furthermore I have to wonder about the reasoning behind spats like this.  Before seeing this blog post I had never heard of “Award Wallet” or of the TPG  app in question.  Guess what I’m about to google next to see what it’s all about and whether I might benefit from it ? Thanks AA for publicizing something you don’t like that I was previously unaware of and now may very well put to use to help me manage my customer experience with you.  Maybe you should have let sleeping dogs lie,</p><!-- .comment-content -->

<p>The cynic in me agrees that the timing is curious. What do you do when you accidentally sell your miles for $0.004 each and folks acquire millions of them? Either you devalue massively and face a backlash, or you work surreptitiously to expire many times more miles than you’d initially intended to …by restricting  access to venues that alert members that their points are about to expire and how long they have to prevent that from happening.</p>

				<p>I’m with those who have dozens of accounts to track. Yes, if you’re only an AA loyalist and only care about those particular points it’s easy enough to log into AA frequently and keep track that way. The value of Award Wallet is the ability to get updated information on lots of accounts quickly and see right away if anything is wrong, not posting as it should, gone missing, or more happily when points do post so that I can use them. Having to go to each website one by one would be a time consuming, tedious task. I hope TPG wins the suit.</p><!-- .comment-content -->

<p>US Airways 1549 was the Miracle on the Hudson. I think Gary is just reminding readers that the CEO of Red Ventures has the same ice-cold Hudson river nerves coursing through his body as the unwavering and superhuman Sully Sullenberger.

				<p>As much as I’m not a fan of TPG since they took the Bow Tie Guy route I understand AA’s need to try and protect privacy, cyber security, etc. but it’s very customer unfriendly. Much like Southwest not allowing (or having the IT that is able to allow)searching on Google Flights. As I continue to see travel companies do stuff like this, it seems like stupid timing. Our loyalty is on hold and as travel demand picks up we are in a new free-agent market like we haven’t seen since the 1980s. It’s less customer-friendly than the pop-up videos and bottom banners on BoardingArea.</p><!-- .comment-content -->

					<p>Good for American. Why in the world would someone allow access to your account? Whether it is with Mint, Quicken, Award Wallet or anyone else? The more access means the more chances of your account being hacked. It is stupid to allow anyone else except yourself to have access to your account.</p>
<p>If AwardWallet was really interested in helping you to track your miles, they would allow manual tracking, which they stopped doing. Trying adding a new account and see what options you have.</p>

				<p>This issue is much bigger than AA or TPG.  As a consumer I should have the right to allow any person or any device access to data that I have been authorized to access.   If AA has the ability to restrict this then they could also tell you that you can no longer use the Chrome browser, or your phone, or whatever other means you may use to get your data. (Practical rules for rate-limiting or preventing abuse are fine.)</p><!-- .comment-content -->

<p>It’s a pain in the ass to check a handful of programs, let alone dozens of airlines, hotels programs, etc. Aggregate apps and websites make the process way easier and l make it less likely for you to lose points to expiration. American Airlines’ refusal to allow sites to display data that you explicitly give access to is an obvious cash grab because 1) American Airlines wants to take even more money off of you by forcing you to go through there site/app and 2) they want you to forget about your points so your points to expire and they don’t have to honor free flights.</p>
<p>I , for one, want TPG to win on this fight.</p>
