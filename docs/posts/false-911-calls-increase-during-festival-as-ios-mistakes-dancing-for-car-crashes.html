However, as an additional potential life-saving precaution, if the user doesn’t respond to the alert prompt after 20 seconds, implying they could be unconscious, the device contacts emergency services automatically, and shares the location data.</p><p>It’s a feature that can potentially save lives, but also one that could potentially benefit from some refinement, as according to the <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/new-apple-feature-spurs-false-911-calls-at-bonnaroo-music-festival/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/new-apple-feature-spurs-false-911-calls-at-bonnaroo-music-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nashville ABC affiliate WKRN</a></span>, during the <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.bonnaroo.com/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.bonnaroo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival</a></span> in Manchester, Tennessee, the local Coffee County authorities had to deal with “about five times the amount of false 911 calls than average,” resulting from Apple devices incorrectly recognizing partying and dancing as car crashes. </p><p>Thankfully, that wasn’t enough false 911 calls to overwhelm the local system and prevent responders from dealing with real emergencies that weekend, and with the help of festival organizers, the local authorities were able to locate the source of every false 911 call to determine that no actual emergencies were being reported.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/new-apple-feature-spurs-false-911-calls-at-bonnaroo-music-festival/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/new-apple-feature-spurs-false-911-calls-at-bonnaroo-music-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to WKRN</a></span>, Apple offered to send representatives to Manchester to help resolve the issue, but the solution was to simply send localized alerts, including a statement made by the local police through Twitter, encouraging festival goers to temporarily deactivate the Crash Detection feature, which reduced the number of 911 calls by 40 to 60%.</p><p>Similar problems have occurred with iOS before.
