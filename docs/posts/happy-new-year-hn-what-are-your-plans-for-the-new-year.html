    <h1>Happy New Year HN! What are your plans for the new year?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Happy New Year HN<p>First: Thanks for all great submissions and for all high quality and interesting comments from all you users here on HN.</p><p>Second: Do you have any plans for the new year, new skills to learn, excited over any new project, looking forward to something, should you do anything different this year, etc?</p><p>Personally I never had any &#34;new year promises&#34;, neither this year, but I have at least a &#34;goal/plan&#34; this year, to do something different; 
Consume less, create/learn more. 
It is so easy just surf the web consuming stuff because you are bored, that in the end gives you nothing/little in the end. This year I will try to use more of my time to try to learn stuff that interest me or can be useful. I probably will fail miserably, but at least its a plan :) And now I have said it, on the internet, so best I stick to it :)</p><p>Once again
Happy New Year</p></td></div></div>
