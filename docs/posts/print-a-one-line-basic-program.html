    <p><i>10 PRINT</i> is a book about a one-line Commodore 64 BASIC program, published in November 2012.
    </p>

    <p>We’ve updated this page in late 2022: <b>Happy 10th anniversary to <i>10 PRINT,</i> which is
        still <i>in print</i> as a paperback!</b> Book purchases support the nonprofit organizations <a href="http://eliterature.org/">The Electronic Literature Organization</a> (to which all royalties are being
      donated) and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262526746/10-print-chr205-5rnd1-goto-10/">The MIT Press</a>, the book&#39;s
      publisher.</p>

    <p>This book takes a single line of code—the extremely concise BASIC program for the Commodore 64
      inscribed in the title—and uses it as a lens through which to consider the phenomenon of creative computing and
      the way computer programs exist in culture. The authors of this collaboratively written book treat code not as
      merely functional but as a text—in the case of <i>10 PRINT</i>, a text that appeared in many different printed
      sources—that yields a story about its making, its purpose, its assumptions, and more. They consider randomness and
      regularity in computing and art, the maze in culture, the popular BASIC programming language, and the highly
      influential Commodore 64 computer.</p>

      <p>Thanks to @BedfordLvlExp on Twitter for pointing out that the following corrections should be made, all on page
        229:</p>

      <p>&#34;leaving two more twenty-five-character rows to fill&#34; should read &#34;leaving two more forty-character rows to
        fill.&#34;</p>

      <p>&#34;the thirty-two pixel borders on the left and right and thirty-five pixel borders on the top and bottom were&#34;
        should be &#34;this border region, which can be set to different colors, just like the background, was&#34;</p>

        &#34;eliminates the underlying need for the border, though this characteristic visual element is stil drawn&#34;</p>
