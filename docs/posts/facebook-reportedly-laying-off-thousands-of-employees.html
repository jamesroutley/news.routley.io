    <h1>Facebook reportedly laying off thousands of employees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>&#34;...the reality is they are being forced out.&#34;</h2><h2>Shhhh</h2><p>The full picture of Facebook-turned-Meta&#39;s <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/facebook-reportedly-layoffs-restructuring">rumored layoffs</a> is coming <a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-headcount-zuckerberg-vision">further into focus</a> — and, well, things aren&#39;t looking too good for the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mark-zuckerberg-employees-metamates">metamates</a>. <em>Insider </em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-quiet-layoffs-will-impact-thousands-of-jobs-employees-say-2022-10">reports that the company</a> is planning a mass round of &#34;quiet layoffs,&#34; which could impact up to 15 percent of the entire company.</p><p>For the folks at home, that number would equal roughly 12,000 employees. And the reason why they&#39;re being called —<em> whisper voice </em>— quiet layoffs? According to <em>Insider&#39;s</em> sources, Facebook has already started the process, which it plans to execute via shifting performance expectations rather than <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-cutting-ten-percent-tesla-workforce">outright firing hordes of staffers</a> all at once.</p><h2>Rest in PIPeace</h2><p><em>Insider</em>&#39;s sources allege that last week — shortly before <a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-headcount-zuckerberg-vision">the company Q&amp;A</a> where Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a hiring freeze and a plan to &#34;manage out employees who aren&#39;t succeeding&#34; — Zucko commanded managers to label 15 percent of their team members as someone who &#34;needs support.&#34;</p><p>Per Facebook&#39;s employee review process, anyone who &#34;needs support&#34; is then put on what they call a &#34;performance improvement plan,&#34; or PIP. Although in this case, employees seem to believe that &#34;PIP&#34; actually translates to &#34;You&#39;re Screwed.&#34;</p><p>&#34;These 15 percent will likely be put on PIP and be let go,&#34; one Facebook worker reportedly posted on an anonymous forum called Blind, a popular app in Silicon Valley. Once they&#39;re on PIP, sources say, employees will then have 30 days to either apply to another position in the company or depart entirely.</p><p>Managers are at risk, too — one source alleged a number of them have already been PIP&#39;d and told to find new jobs.</p><p>&#34;It might look like they are moving on,&#34; the source explained, &#34;but the reality is they are being forced out.&#34;</p><h2>Needs Support</h2><p>But while Zuck is clearly wanting to keep this massive workforce slash on the hush-hush, Meta&#39;s last few quarters speak loudly (as does <a href="https://futurism.com/rumors-mark-zuckerberg-ufc-show">randomly renting out the UFC Apex arena</a>, but we digress). Blows to its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/snap-warning-shows-major-consumer-pullback-hitting-digital-ad-budgets-2022-5">advertising revenue stream</a> have caused major setbacks, as has its <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tiktok-vs-facebook-revenue-and-user-numbers-2022/">failure to compete</a> with TikTok. Elsewhere, billions have been poured into the chief metamates&#39;s metaverse vision, which has <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerbergs-metaverse-crap">pretty much nothing</a> to show for itself just yet.</p><p>Basically, it&#39;s been a bad year, and Facebook has a lot to figure out. Might we suggest, perhaps, putting it on a performance improvement plan? The whole thing is clearly in need of some support.</p><p><strong>More on the Facebook layoffs:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-headcount-zuckerberg-vision">Layoffs Hitting Facebook as Zuckerberg&#39;s Vision Stumbles</a></em></p></div></div>
