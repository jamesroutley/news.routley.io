    <h1>One common behavior seen in “mature” software engineers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a child, I was told many &#34;indoctrinating&#34; stories. While I don&#39;t care to name them here, many of these stories were meant to educate and set examples for students. There is one in particular that I find applicable for this discussion. The story goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A young soldier was walking with the general. As they walked on the stone path to cross the stream that surrounded their encampment, the young soldier slipped on a stone. Feeling flustered in front of the general, the young soldier quickly put the stone back in place to catch up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You problably know where I&#39;m going with this story. At work, we are just about to wrap up the performance review and promotion season. I always remind my team that performance ratings are separate from promotions. Though there&#39;s some loose correlation, promotion is more about consistent level N+1 behavior, while one could get a high performance rating by solving many level N problems.</p>
<p>It is great that an engineer could fix a particular problem efficiently. Though, a common trait we see in more &#34;mature&#34; engineers is go beyond &#34;just&#34; patching these problems. They take the extra step to make sure the next person won&#39;t have to spend the same level of energy fixing the same issue, or eliminate the problem class altogether for their team.</p>
<p>This is a behavior that we look at for all levels, varying in scope.</p>
