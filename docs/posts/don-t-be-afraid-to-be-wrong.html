  <h2>Context</h2>
  Being afraid can be helpful in certain situations but not all. Today, I am going to go
  over a few situations and provide techniques on how to prevent being wrong, and feeling
  (too) bad after being wrong; I am also going to discuss how to recover after being
  wrong, how to tell others you were wrong, and finally how to approach someone that is
  wrong.

  <h2>Being afraid</h2>
  Let&#39;s start with the &#34;being afraid&#34; part. We can all agree that being afraid is natural
  and often times useful but that it can be harmful if you get the risk-reward wrong.

  <h2>Being wrong</h2>
  In almost all (workplace) situations, it is not worth being afraid of being wrong.

  <h2>You are wrong, now what?</h2>
  The main thing to remember is that being wrong isn&#39;t the end of the world. Most
  likely everyone has already forgotten you got something wrong. The feeling you&#39;re having
  right after being wrong will fade away. With some practice, you will be able to recover
  from being wrong faster and faster.

  <h2>Someone is wrong</h2>
  If someone is wrong, it is important to remember that they are not wrong on purpose. Or
  at least that&#39;s how I approach thinking about it.
