  <h2>Being afraid</h2>
  Did you know there is a word for fear of being wrong? It’s known as <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199534067.001.0001/acref-9780199534067-appendix-0001#:~:text=without%20%2B%20taxis%20order%5D-,atelophobia,-Incompleteness%20or%20imperfection">atelophobia</a>.

  <h2>It will hold you back</h2>
  It will make you avoid certain situations - this can remove you from contexts in which you can learn, teach others, etc.

  <h2>It will make you more defensive</h2>
  I’ve seen this more times than I can count.

  <h2>It will stress you out more</h2>
  If you are constantly self regulating due to fear, you’ll feel and be more stressed.

  <h2>What you can do to continue engaging</h2>
  The main thing to remember is that being wrong isn&#39;t the end of the world. Most likely everyone has already forgotten you got something wrong. The feeling you&#39;re having right after being wrong will fade away. With some practice, you will be able to recover from being wrong faster and faster.

  <h2>Preparing mentally for when you&#39;re wrong</h2>
  It’s very helpful to prepare yourself for the very fact you will end up being wrong. Doing so will ensure you can react in the best ways.
  <ul>
    <li>Without over-thinking and over-preparing, map out what is the worst thing that can happen in any way you could be wrong. And map out the best outcome if you’re right. This is useful in asynchronous contexts - you can easily figure out how to react, navigate the objections if you’re wrong.</li>
    <li>Write down what you know and what you don’t know about the topic. Explicitly state when it’s an idea that can be discarded, when it’s a hunch, when it’s something that you know nothing about but it has occurred to you - this sets the scene for you and everyone to safely discard/accept what you’re saying.</li>
    <li>Train yourself to not regurgitate the “this is how I’ve always done it, therefore we should do it”. This won’t make you right, or remove the fear of being wrong - it will just make everyone question if there was a contribution in there somewhere.</li>
    <li>Think back and write down times when you were wrong and real consequences of those. Usually you will realise there has never been a terrible consequence except some embarrassment that lingered for a day or two. (As an experiment I have asked people a few times if they remember that one time when I said something that was wrong - almost always they have no idea what I am talking about - they simply immediately forgot about it).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  Everything is fine. Deep breaths, keep your head high, your sights on the future, and growing resilience.
