There were 2,087 searches in the 2021-2022 financial year, 5,065 in 2022-23, and 4,422 in the period between 1 July 2023 and 31 March 2024.</p><figure id="0d39557a-872d-4808-ad5a-511ec210de6a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:2,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Australian man says border force made him hand over phone passcode by threatening to keep device indefinitely&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;0d39557a-872d-4808-ad5a-511ec210de6a&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/14/australian-man-says-border-force-made-him-hand-over-phone-passcode-by-threatening-to-keep-device-indefinitely&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}" config="{&#34;renderingTarget&#34;:&#34;Web&#34;,&#34;darkModeAvailable&#34;:false,&#34;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&#34;:true,&#34;assetOrigin&#34;:&#34;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&#34;}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-2 | 2" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>The department data reveals that close to 94% of the time people freely revealed their phone passcode to officers, despite there being no legal requirement to do so. The ABF data shows less than 800 people had their devices “referred for further examination due to technical reasons or individual’s refusal to provide access”.</p><p>About one in four people who were stopped at the border had some data copied from their devices – 590 in 2021-22, 1,139 in 2022-23, and 1,447 in the current financial year.</p><p>There were 3.3 million arrivals or departures at Australia’s borders in March 2024 alone.</p><ul>

He described the behaviour as highly invasive and unnecessary harassment. During the most recent search, he said the threat of seizing the device was used to attempt to compel him to hand over his passcode. He was also asked to hand over the master password for his password manager but he refused. He said he was allowed to leave after an hour, but border force retained a USB drive.</p><figure id="058e8906-ccae-43e2-ab88-0d00010d9c67" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:10,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Border force apologises for failing to prevent ‘misconduct’ after reports found bullying and harassment&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;058e8906-ccae-43e2-ab88-0d00010d9c67&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/07/australian-border-force-abf-apology-misconduct-bullying-sexual-harassment-discrimination&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}" config="{&#34;renderingTarget&#34;:&#34;Web&#34;,&#34;darkModeAvailable&#34;:false,&#34;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&#34;:true,&#34;assetOrigin&#34;:&#34;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&#34;}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-10 | 10" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Since lodging a complaint with the department over his treatment, the drive has been sent back, Guardian Australia understands.

He raised concerns about how it could be applied to journalists, whistleblowers, and lawyers where confidentiality safeguards exist.</p><p>“The Human Rights Law Centre has consistently raised concerns around the lack of transparency, safeguards and oversight of ABF’s extraordinary powers to seize electronic devices at borders,” he said. “We are particularly concerned at ABF’s apparent use of coercive tactics to get around its lack of lawful power to compel passwords from travellers.”</p><p>Pender said the practices must be changed so the ABF is not exceeding its lawful authority.</p><p><em>*Name changed for privacy</em></p></div></div></div>
