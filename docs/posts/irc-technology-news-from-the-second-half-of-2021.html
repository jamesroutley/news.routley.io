<h3 id="babys-first-limnoria-plugin-and-other-notable-world-events">Baby’s first Limnoria plugin and other notable world events</h3>
<p>I have been using a custom bot to welcome newcomers to the various <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/IRC">LibreOffice contributor channels</a>. I wanted to make it more maintainable, so I reimplemented it as <a href="https://github.com/ilmari-lauhakangas/limnoria-plugins-libreoffice">a Limnoria plugin</a>. Thanks to Val for the support, it was fun to write it!</p>
<p>Sourcehut folks launched <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2021-11-29-announcing-the-chat.sr.ht-public-beta/">an IRC bouncer service</a> for the paying users of their software forge. One point of the endeavour is to drive improvements in the whole IRC ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ircdriven.com/">IRC Driven</a>, a site indexing IRC networks was relaunched. The site was originally created in 2006 and it provides statistics for a curated selection of IRC networks.</p>
