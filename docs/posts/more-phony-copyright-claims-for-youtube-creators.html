    <h1>More phony copyright claims for YouTube creators</h1>

						<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/logo-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="86"/>YouTube is SUCH a mixed blessing. Massive audience, miserable customer relations – especially for media creators who are posting work they care about.</p>
<p>Tony’s story is illustrative.</p>
<div id="attachment_154978"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154978" loading="lazy" src="https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/YouTube-anete-lusina-5721905.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="398" srcset="https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/YouTube-anete-lusina-5721905.jpg 1202w, https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/YouTube-anete-lusina-5721905-300x199.jpg 300w, https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/YouTube-anete-lusina-5721905-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://wpmedia-lib.larryjordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/YouTube-anete-lusina-5721905-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"/></p><p id="caption-attachment-154978"><em>TV image by Anete Lusina.</em></p></div>
<p><em>[Tony writes:]</em> Some time ago I wrote to you about phony claims for copyright against legally purchased music resulting in application of ads on videos. You kindly responded to this.</p>
<p>I eventually was able to overcome the problem on that occasion but it has recently arisen again but slightly worse. I have had another blizzard of phoney claims emanating from Adrev but will confine this tale to just one. I recently uploaded a short video with music purchased from Pond5. Within hours I received a phony claim for copyright from Adrev. Ads were placed prior to the start of the video and – much worse – within the video itself which only plays for about 12 minutes. I had gone to lot of trouble to creat a “mood” which was now completely ruined.</p>
<p>I disputed the claim and contacted Pond5 who were extremely helpful and supportive.</p>
<p><em>Pond5 support wrote</em>: “We’re happy to know your [copyright] claims have been released! These are often labor intensive on our team, and require much back-and-forth with the Content ID agencies. All in a day’s work, and to ensure you, our client, are totally satisfied with our support and products.</p>
<p>Regarding ads on your videos, that’s unfortunately entirely beyond our control. Those decisions are made with Google/YouTube and Pond5 has no voice in those decisions.</p>
<p>Pond5 then provided a link to a Forbes article from 2020: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/18/youtube-will-now-show-ads-on-all-videos-even-if-creators-dont-want-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Will Now Show Ads on All Videos, Even If Creators Don’t Want Them.</a></p>
<p><em>[Tony continues:]</em> After a few days the phony claims were withdrawn but the ads were not removed and are still there today weeks later. I kept badgering Pond5 and my complaints went up a level. I received the attached reply today. So it seems that, now, even if phony claims are dismissed and cleared the ads will remain and now that the fig leaf of pretending that a claimant exists has been removed, Google/You Tube will take 100% of the ad revenue and the creator’s video will remain burdened by ads forever.</p>
<p>I do concede that You Tube have made it possible for us to share our creations world wide at no cost and I am very appreciative of that.</p>
<p>I guess I can accept that ads prior to the start of a video is a small price to pay for that service. However I cannot stomach the barbaric practice of inserting garbage ads even in the middle of [dialog while] playing the video. This is another step in the wrong direction.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Larry adds</em>: Thanks, Tony, for sharing your experience. Situations like this could be improved if YouTube actually provided a way to communicate with them directly. But, that would cost them money.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After reading this article, Tony commented further:</p>
<p>YouTube are always promoting their own music as a source to avoid copyright issues. They may not mean it but that sounds suspiciously like something from the Godfather. “Use our product and we will protect you from the bad guys.” In any event, why would a serious filmmaker want to choose their music from the same source as everyone else?</p>
<p>Actually, probably the majority of You Tubers don’t use any music and for many of those who do, the more ads the better as the reason for uploading a video is to make money and they really don’t care about quality.</p>
<p>I should add that I have also had great support from Smartsound and Bjorn Lynne at Shockwave-Sound. But it all comes back to Google/You Tube… [and] Adrev who are the source of all the latest attacks.</p>
