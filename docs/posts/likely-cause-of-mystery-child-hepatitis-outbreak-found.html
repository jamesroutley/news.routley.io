I think that&#39;s what kind of took us by surprise.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;ve just assumed it was one little problem that will get easily sorted out - but actually it just kept on snowballing.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Initially, Rebecca was lined up to donate part of her liver - but, after a serious reaction to drugs used, she ended up in intensive care. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Noah was put on the transplant list and, soon after, received a new organ.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>His recovery has been good - but he will need to take immunosuppressant drugs for life, to stop his body rejecting the new liver.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Rebecca says Noah will stay on medication for life</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rebecca says: &#34;There is something really heartbreaking about that because you go along following the rules, do what you are supposed to do to protect people that are vulnerable and then, in some horrible roundabout way, your own child has become more vulnerable because you did what you were supposed to do.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Cases such as this are rare. Most children who catch these types of viruses quickly recover. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is unclear why some then develop liver inflammation - but genetics might play a part.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scientists have ruled out any connection with coronavirus or Covid vaccines. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One of the investigators, Prof Judith Breuer, an expert in virology, at University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: &#34;During the lockdown period when children were not mixing, they were not transmitting viruses to each other. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They were not building up immunity to the common infections they would normally encounter. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When the restrictions were lifted, children began to mix, viruses began to circulate freely - and they suddenly were exposed with this lack of prior immunity to a whole battery of new infections.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Experts are hopeful that cases are now becoming fewer but are still on alert for new ones. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Emma Thomson, who led the University of Glasgow research, said there were still many unanswered questions. &#34;Larger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in paediatric hepatitis cases.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored - it may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, leading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="related-internet-links"><p><h2>Related Internet Links</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li></ul><p>The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.</p></section><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
