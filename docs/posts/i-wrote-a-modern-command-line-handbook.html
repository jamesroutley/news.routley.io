    <h1>Show HN: I wrote a modern Command Line Handbook</h1>

          <h2>The command line is for everyone</h2>
          <p>
            Software developers, sysadmins, tech workers, and regular Linux/macOS
            users all use the modern Unix/Linux command-line shells to get things
            done. What about you?
          </p>
          <h2>You don&#39;t have to read the entire shell manual</h2>
          <p>
            You don&#39;t have to read the entire shell manual or study bulky Linux
            bibles to get going. Understand the most common concepts and commands
            quickly instead with this short handbook.
          </p>
          <h2>It&#39;s not just about the shell</h2>
          <p>
            Terminals, shells, command-line applications, and shell scripting.
            Don&#39;t learn things separately when you can learn them together. Tips and tricks included.
          </p>
          <h2>Run commands with confidence</h2>
          <p>More than one hundred annotated shell sessions and code examples to explore and follow along. If this
            doesn&#39;t change your approach to the command line, nothing will.
          </p>
          <h2>Fresh out of press</h2>
          <p>This handbook is a culmination of 4 years of learning, writing, and rewriting. Updated in 2025 to
            be the best guidebook that you can get this year.
          </p>
          <h2>
            5700+ readers
          </h2>
          <p>
            You are in good company. Join more than five thousand others
            sharpening their command line skills with this handbook.

          <h2>From the author</h2>
          <p>
            I have been a long-time Linux and command-line user, but I didn&#39;t always use the command line to its full potential.
            Partially because I didn&#39;t know what I was missing and partially because the world of shells and terminals has evolved so much over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed this book to showcase the most essential things in the shortest possible time. The book will introduce you to the efficient usage of the command line, shells like Bash and Zsh, scripting, and many classic and modern programs that are available for the terminal today.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will get a beautiful, carefully curated PDF with almost 100 syntax-highlighted and annotated shell sessions and other examples. My hope
            is that you will be able to get that satisfying feeling of using the command line to its full potential.
          </p>
