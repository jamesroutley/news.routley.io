    <h1>Why are developers expected to estimate tasks at all?</h1>

<h2>This is an experience problem, not a management problem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Software development is not carpentry. Almost everything a developer writes is unique, they have never built that particular thing before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part is not actually true, Carpenters and Developers face about the same level of uncertainty with each project. If you&#39;ve ever tried hiring a young independent carpenter, they will often way under bid the project, and have to come back asking for 2-3 times as much money to cover the unexpected materials and labor, but when you hire a carpenter with 10-30 years of experience, they can estimate a project within a 10% margin of error for actual variance, but know to build in a 50% margin of error for when the scope changes a bit, and they are on budget every time.  Not because every cabinet is the same, but because they are all made up of the same basic bits and parts.  These same margins of error to experience levels are seen in the software development industry, BUT <strong>software developers are on average 11 years less experienced than carpenters</strong> so we see a lot more novices and very few masters in the software world.</p>
<p>Those experienced developers who are out there have already learned so many new languages, done so many API integrations, built so many physics models and CRUD interfaces, etc that even if they do have to do something &#34;new&#34; they can break it down into 20 smaller things that they already have done many times before so they know just how long it will take.</p>
<h2>Management must expect you to estimate your project</h2>
<p>Only developers know how long it takes to write software, just like only carpenters know how long it will take to make a cabinet.  Yes, you in your novice ways may only be able to estimate within a 300% margin of error, but if that is how close you can get, imagine how much worse it would be if your manager had to guess?  When I ask my project manager how long HE thinks a task should take, if the job is just like a previous one, then he can usually guess pretty close, but if it&#39;s not something he&#39;s seen before he&#39;s can easily be off by 2000%... and no, that is not a hyperbole.  He literally does not no how a single part works where even a novice developer will have some foundational knowledge.  Even a novice developer knows SOME of the processes and requirements of a new project before he starts, and that still makes a young developer&#39;s estimate the best possible guess, when no other estimate can be closer.</p>
<p>Software development is a business.  It must either make money or add a value that is worth a certain cost.  While your job may be to write the software, it is your manager&#39;s job to sell a client on the idea of paying for the software.  Even if you are doing inside development, your manager will still need to &#34;sell&#34; the value of your work to his superiors or investors... and no one buys a product without knowing what it will cost.  So, if you can&#39;t provide an estimate (even a bad one) then there is no business.</p>
<p>As for deadlines, if you can&#39;t be held accountable for your estimates, then there is also no business.  Most development is a contractual agreement.  When you give a manager an estimate, he has to turn that into a bid to sell your time to the client.  His job is not just to say, &#34;this is 1000 hours of work&#34;.  His job is to talk to the client, get a feel for them, and decide if he can get away with asking for $100,000 or $150,000.</p>
<p>He has to consider how much residual income this client is worth.  He has to consider if it&#39;s worth risking the company&#39;s reputation asking for add-on costs if things go over budget, he has to consider if he should offer the client a payment plan, he has to consider dollar per hour how much each person working on the project costs the company.  He has to consider how much he has to pay you to NOT work if too many bids fall through.  Even if you are doing Agile development, these are still the kinds of numbers he has to discuss with clients.  Agile is a method for organizing development, not a substitution for responsible financing.</p>
<p>So, no he&#39;s not just getting high-fives for projects taking how long you said they should take, he&#39;s getting high-fives for all sorts of responsibilities and skills that you don&#39;t even need to think about that have to come together just right to keep the company going.  Yes, he needs your expertise where he needs it, but he has a whole other litany of jobs to worry about that you as a developer don&#39;t see.</p>
<h2>The real problem in the development industry</h2>
<p>Going back to the Carpenter problem, Carpenter&#39;s solved this issue centuries ago when they developed the guild system of management.  In guild work, you have apprentices, journeymen, and masters. A young and inexperienced craftsman should never work without the oversight of a master, and a moderately experience craftsman should only work independently on &#34;basic&#34; things, but there are just too few master developers to go around and no unified system for licensing masters to make sure that they are as good and experienced as they should be.</p>
<p>Some larger firms actually have partially adopted this system though.  We generally call them Intro, Junior, and Senior or Tier I, II, &amp; III developers.  If you work in such a firm, then the Senior Developer is usually the one who writes the estimates, but the issue is that most of these companies have only half adopted the guild system.  A person can be &#34;senior&#34; in title, but there are no quality controls to make sure that he actually has the skills that he should have; so, he may not be qualified to write estimates for apprentices (or even himself for that matter.)</p>
<p>Give the industry another 10-20 years to mature, and you will probably see it get to be almost identical to the carpentry industry... for now though, companies are just doing the best they can with the experience that is available.</p>
