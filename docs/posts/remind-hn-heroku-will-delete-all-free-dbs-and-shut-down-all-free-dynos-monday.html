    <h1>Remind HN: Heroku will delete all free dbs and shut down all free dynos Monday</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For other HN&#39;ers out there who have personal projects on Heroku and might&#39;ve forgotten (like I did), this weekend is the last chance to get data out of Heroku (or upgrade to paid plans) before it deletes databases/Redis and shuts down free dynos on Monday.</p><p>&gt; What products are impacted by the removal of free plans?</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; `free` dynos, `hobby-dev` Heroku Postgres, and `hobby-dev` Heroku Data for Redis plans.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; What happens if I take no action on my free apps or databases or do not upgrade to a paid plan?</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; If you take no action by November 28, 2022:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; - `free` dynos will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0. You must subscribe to the Eco dyno hours plan or upgrade to another paid plan before you can scale them up again. Any Scheduler jobs that used free dynos will fail until they are reconfigured to use another dyno type.</p><p>&gt; - For non-Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases will be deleted in accordance with the Heroku Documentation starting November 28, 2022.</p><p>&gt; - For Enterprise users, `hobby-dev` databases that belong to an Enterprise Account or Team will be converted to `mini`. There will be no immediate change in cost to your Heroku Enterprise invoices if an app is upgraded from a free tier resource to a paid tier resource. Any changes to Heroku Enterprise pricing would require a contract update to take effect. If you have any concerns about your contract pricing, contact your account executive.</p><p>&gt; - `hobby-dev` databases that belong to personal accounts will be deleted, and `free dynos` will be converted to `eco` dynos scaled down to 0, even if that user also belongs to an Enterprise Team. These users must upgrade to paid resources before November 28, 2022.</p><p>ref: https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq</p><p>I&#39;m personally moving my projects to a self-hosted dokku cluster, but I&#39;ve heard good things about fly and render too.</p></div></div></div>
