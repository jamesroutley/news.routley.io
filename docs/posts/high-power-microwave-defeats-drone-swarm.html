    <h1>High-power microwave defeats drone swarm</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>Leonidas neutralized 61-of-61 drones, culminating in a 49-drone swarm kill with one pulse of electromagnetic interference</blockquote><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrkopSw5uas" title="Epirus&#39; Leonidas High-Power Microwave Defeats 49-Drone Swarm"></iframe></p></figure><p><strong>Los Angeles, Calif—September 10, 2025</strong>—Epirus announced today the results of an August 26 demonstration of the company’s Leonidas high-power microwave (HPM) system that delivers weaponized electromagnetic interference to counter swarms of robotic, asymmetric threats. </p><p>The live-fire demonstration tested Leonidas against 61 drones across five operationally relevant flight scenarios. Leonidas’ suite of capability differentiators was on full display as the system disabled 61-of-61 drones—a 100% success rate. The event was capped off by the defeat of a 49-drone swarm consisting of two threat representative drone types all with one instant and low-collateral pulse of high-energy electromagnetic interference. </p><p>Leading up to finale, the prior flight scenarios were: </p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong>Multi-angle counter-swarm engagement. </strong>Two groups of three drones were flown in from opposite directions. Leonidas engaged and defeated the first trio of drones to the left then re-directed its HPM beam to engage and defeat the trio of drones to its right. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Selective targeting.</strong> Two drones were flown into the engagement area in close proximity to one another. An audience member chose the right drone to be targeted before Leonidas engaged and defeated the right drone and left the other drone unaffected, demonstrating the system’s software-defined, precision-controlled waveforms. Leonidas then engaged and defeated the remaining drone. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Precision intercept. </strong>A single drone flew into the fire zone. Leonidas engaged and defeated the target and dropped it to the ground within a software-defined, pre-identified safe zone. Leonidas is a low-to-no collateral counter-drone solution and uses software to defeat drones exactly when and where operators need to allow for designated safety zones to protect assets and personnel. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Multi-target engagement.</strong> Three drones flew into the fire zone at different ranges. Leonidas engaged and defeated all three drones simultaneously, demonstrating its one-to-many aerial defeat capability. </li></ul><p>“This is a watershed moment for Epirus. We believe showcasing our weaponized electromagnetic interference is the most effective way to communicate that Leonidas is the only mission-capable, counter-swarm solution for the one-to-many fight,” said <strong>Andy Lowery, Epirus CEO</strong>. “Those who joined us witnessed this first-hand as 61 drones went up—and 61 went down.” </p><p>The invitation-only demonstration took place at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, and was attended by representatives from throughout the U.S. Department of Defense, other U.S. Government agencies and nine allied countries. The event was conducted within site range restrictions and optimized for in-person viewing.</p><p>The event demonstrated the first generation of Leonidas, which was designed and developed using internal research and development funds in 2022. Epirus unveiled its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfOAKxRKJrA" target="_blank">latest version of Leonidas in July 2025</a>, which is expected to more than double the operational range and lethality over the 2022 system in the same form factor.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>About Epirus:</strong><br/></p><p>Epirus is a high-growth technology company dedicated to overcoming the asymmetric challenges inherent to the future of national security. Epirus&#39; flagship technology, Leonidas, is a software defined, energy-based high-power microwave platform, built using intelligent power management techniques which allow power-hungry systems to do more with less.
