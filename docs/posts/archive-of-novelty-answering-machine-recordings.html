				The Novelty Archive is made up of hundreds of recordings from 
				Cassettes, Compact Discs, and Archived MP3 Recordings. Some of 
				the items found in the archive include:  Crazy Calls, Dr. 
				Demento, CelebrityPhone, Celebrity AnswerAlls, Chick Hearn 
				Telephone Answering Tape, You Rang?, Phonies, Hey! Wait for the 
				Beep!, Radio Shack, Rich Little, At The Sound of The Beep, Pat 
				Fleet Operator Recordings, Garfield, &amp; Much More!</span><strong><span> </span>Note: 
				most of the recordings in the archive were archived from old 
				cassette tapes; many of them are several decades old as a 
				result, the sound quality will vary depending on the age and 
				condition of the tape.<span> </span></strong></p>
				<p>If you have a CD, Cassette, or digital 
				recording not archived, I&#39;d love to hear them and add them to 
				the archives!</p>
