<p>Pain can simplify point of view. When you’re in pain, it’s hard to think of anything else.</p>
<p>Pleasure too can simplify point of view. You may feel that nothing is more important than finding a way to make that pleasure last.</p>
<p>We think of pain and pleasure as opposites - pleasure makes us draw its object near, whereas pain impels us to reject its object. They are also similar – they both distract, making rival goals seem small.</p>
<p>Fear and courage each do best by knowing both. Whether on offense or defense, you seek to guess the opponent’s plan.</p>

<p>Sometimes, one of two seeming opposites is nothing but the absence of the other: sound and silence, light and darkness, interest and unconcern.</p>

<p>In appearing opposed, two things may serve related goals, or may engage selfsame agencies.</p>
<p>In contexts of data and code, opposition may signal an opportunity for structural sharing, for reuse.</p>
