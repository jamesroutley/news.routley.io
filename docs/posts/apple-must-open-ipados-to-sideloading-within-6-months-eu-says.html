<p>Starting in March with the release of iOS 17.4, iPhones in the European Union have been subject to the EU&#39;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a batch of regulations that (among other things) forced Apple to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">support alternate app stores</a>, app sideloading, and third-party browser engines in iOS for the first time. Today, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple&#39;s iPadOS as a &#34;gatekeeper,&#34; meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>

<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p>
<p>&#34;Apple now has six months to ensure full compliance of iPadOS with the DMA obligations,&#34; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">reads</a> the EU&#39;s blog post about the change.</p>
<p>Apple technically split the iPad&#39;s operating system from the iPhone&#39;s in 2019 when it began calling its tablet operating system &#34;iPadOS&#34; instead of iOS. But practically speaking, little separates the two operating systems under the hood. Both iOS and iPadOS share the same software build numbers, they&#39;re updated in lockstep (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/facing-quality-and-pacing-issues-apple-reportedly-delays-ipados-16/#:~:text=Apple%20will%20delay%20the%20release,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter.">with rare exceptions</a>), and most importantly for DMA compliance purposes, they pull software from the same locked-down App Store with the same Apple-imposed restrictions in place.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Apps distributed through alternate app stores or third-party websites will have to abide by many of Apple&#39;s rules and will still generally be limited to using Apple&#39;s public APIs. However, the ability to use alternate app stores and browser engines on the iPad&#39;s large screen (and the desktop-class M-series chips) could make the tablets better laptop replacements by allowing them to do more of the things that Mac users can do on their systems.</p>
<p>Though Apple has made multiple changes to iOS in the EU to comply with the DMA, EU regulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/apple-google-and-meta-are-failing-dma-compliance-eu-suspects/">are already investigating Apple</a> (as well as Google and Meta) for &#34;non-compliance.&#34; Depending on the results of that investigation, the EU may require Apple to make more changes to the way it allows third-party apps to be installed in iOS and to the way that third-party developers are allowed to advertise non-Apple app store and payment options. Any changes that Apple makes to iOS to comply with the investigation&#39;s findings will presumably trickle down to the iPad as well.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this directly affects US-based iPhone or iPad users, whose devices remain restricted to Apple&#39;s app stores and the WebKit browsing engine. That said, we have seen some recent App Store rule changes that have arguably trickled down from Apple&#39;s attempts to comply with the DMA, most notably <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">policy changes</a> that have allowed (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">some, not all</a>) retro game console emulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">into the App Store for the first time</a>.</p>
