<h3>
<span>6–1</span>Chance and likelihood</h3>
<p>“Chance” is a word which is in common use in everyday
living. The radio reports speaking of tomorrow’s weather may say:
“There is a sixty percent chance of rain.” You might say: “There is a
small chance that I shall live to be one hundred years old.” Scientists
also use the word chance. A seismologist may be interested in the
question: “What is the chance that there will be an earthquake of a
certain size in Southern California next year?” A physicist might ask
the question: “What is the chance that a particular geiger counter will
register twenty counts in the next ten seconds?” A politician or
statesman might be interested in the question: “What is the chance that
there will be a nuclear war within the next ten years?” You may be
interested in the chance that you will learn something from this
chapter.</p>
<p>By <em>chance</em>, we mean something like a guess. Why do we make
guesses? We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have
incomplete information or uncertain knowledge. We want to make a guess
as to what things are, or what things are likely to happen. Often we
wish to make a guess because we have to make a decision. For example:
Shall I take my raincoat with me tomorrow? For what earth movement
should I design a new building? Shall I build myself a fallout shelter?
Shall I change my stand in international negotiations? Shall I go to
class today?</p>
<p>Sometimes we make guesses because we wish, with our limited knowledge,
to say as much as we <em>can</em> about some situation. Really, any
generalization is in the nature of a guess. Any physical theory is a
kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there are bad guesses. The
theory of probability is a system for making better guesses. The
language of probability allows us to speak quantitatively about some
situation which may be highly variable, but which does have some
consistent average behavior.</p>
<p>Let us consider the flipping of a coin. If the toss—and the coin—are
“honest,” we have no way of knowing what to expect for the outcome of
any particular toss. Yet we would feel that in a large number of tosses
there should be about equal numbers of heads and tails. We say: “The
probability that a toss will land heads is $0.5$.”</p>
<p>We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being
made in the future. <em>By the “probability” of a particular outcome
of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a
number of repeated observations that will yield that particular
outcome</em>. If we imagine repeating an observation—such as looking at a
freshly tossed coin—$N$ times, and if we call $N_A$ <em>our
estimate</em> of the most likely number of our observations that will give
some specified result $A$, say the result “heads,” then by $P(A)$, the
probability of observing $A$, we mean
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:1}
P(A)=N_A/N.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Our definition requires several comments. First of all, we may speak of
a probability of something happening only if the occurrence is a
possible outcome of some <em>repeatable</em> observation. It is not clear
that it would make any sense to ask: “What is the probability that
there is a ghost in that house?”</p>
<p>You may object that no situation is <em>exactly</em> repeatable. That is
right. Every different observation must at least be at a different time
or place. All we can say is that the “repeated” observations should,
for our intended purposes, <em>appear to be equivalent</em>. We should
assume, at least, that each observation was made from an equivalently
prepared situation, and especially with the same degree of ignorance at
the start. (If we sneak a look at an opponent’s hand in a card game, our
estimate of our chances of winning are different than if we do not!)</p>
<p>We should emphasize that $N$ and $N_A$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI61">6.1</a>) are
<em>not</em> intended to represent numbers based on actual observations.
$N_A$ is our best <em>estimate</em> of what <em>would</em> occur in $N$
<em>imagined</em> observations. Probability depends, therefore, on our
knowledge and on our ability to make estimates. In effect, on our common
sense!  Fortunately, there is a certain amount of agreement in the
common sense of many things, so that different people will make the same
estimate. Probabilities need not, however, be “absolute” numbers.
Since they depend on our ignorance, they may become different if our
knowledge changes.</p>
<p>You may have noticed another rather “subjective” aspect of our
definition of probability. We have referred to $N_A$ as “our estimate
of the most likely number …” We do not mean that we expect to
observe <em>exactly</em> $N_A$, but that we expect a number
<em>near</em> $N_A$, and that the number $N_A$ is <em>more likely</em> than
any other number in the vicinity. If we toss a coin, say, $30$ times, we
should expect that the number of heads would not be very likely to be
exactly $15$, but rather only some number near to $15$, say $12$, $13$,
$14$, $15$, $16$, or $17$. However, if we <em>must</em> choose, we would
decide that $15$ heads is <em>more likely</em> than any other number. We
would write $P(\text{heads})=0.5$.</p>
<p>Why did we choose $15$ as more likely than any other number? We must
have argued with ourselves in the following manner: If the most likely
number of heads is $N_H$ in a total number of tosses $N$, then the most
likely number of tails $N_T$ is $(N-N_H)$. (We are assuming that every
toss gives <em>either</em> heads <em>or</em> tails, and no “other”
result!) But if the coin is “honest,” there is no preference for heads
or tails. Until we have some reason to think the coin (or toss) is
dishonest, we must give equal likelihoods for heads and tails. So we
must set $N_T=N_H$. It follows that $N_T=$ $N_H=$ $N/2$, or $P(H)=$ $P(T)=$ $0.5$.</p>
<p>We can generalize our reasoning to <em>any</em> situation in which there
are $m$ different but “equivalent” (that is, equally likely) possible
results of an observation. If an observation can yield $m$ different
results, and we have reason to believe that any one of them is as likely
as any other, then the probability of a <em>particular</em> outcome $A$
is $P(A)=1/m$.</p>
<p>If there are seven different-colored balls in an opaque box and we pick
one out “at random” (that is, without looking), the probability of
getting a ball of a particular color is $\tfrac{1}{7}$. The probability
that a “blind draw” from a shuffled deck of $52$ cards will show the
ten of hearts is $\tfrac{1}{52}$. The probability of throwing a
double-one with dice is $\tfrac{1}{36}$.</p>

<center><hr/></center>

<p><span>In Chapter <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/great-expectations/I_05.html">5</a> we described the size of a nucleus in terms of
its apparent area, or “cross section.” When we did so we were really
talking about probabilities. When we shoot a high-energy particle at a
thin slab of material, there is some chance that it will pass right
through and some chance that it will hit a nucleus. (Since the nucleus
is so small that we cannot <em>see</em> it, we cannot aim right at a
nucleus. We must “shoot blind.”) If there are $n$ atoms in our slab
and the nucleus of each atom has a cross-sectional area $\sigma$, then
the total area “shadowed” by the nuclei is $n\sigma$. In a large
number $N$ of random shots, we expect that the number of hits $N_C$ of
<em>some</em> nucleus will be in the ratio to $N$ as the shadowed area is
to the total area of the slab:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:2}
N_C/N=n\sigma/A.
\end{equation}
We may say, therefore, that the <em>probability</em> that any one
projectile particle will suffer a collision in passing through the slab
is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:3}
P_C=\frac{n}{A}\,\sigma,
\end{equation}
where $n/A$ is the number of atoms per unit area in our slab.

</div>
<p>We would like now to use our ideas about probability to consider in some
greater detail the question: “How many heads do I really <em>expect</em>
to get if I toss a coin $N$ times?” Before answering the question,
however, let us look at what does happen in such an “experiment.”
Figure <a href="#Ch6-F1">6–1</a> shows the results obtained in the first three
“runs” of such an experiment in which $N=30$. The sequences of
“heads” and “tails” are shown just as they were obtained. The first
game gave $11$ heads; the second also $11$; the third $16$. In three
trials we did not once get $15$ heads. Should we begin to suspect the
coin? Or were we wrong in thinking that the most likely number of
“heads” in such a game is $15$? Ninety-seven more runs were made to
obtain a total of $100$ experiments of $30$ tosses each. The results of
the experiments are given in Table <a href="#Ch6-T1">6–1</a>.<a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Looking at the numbers in Table <a href="#Ch6-T1">6–1</a>, we see that most of the
results are “near” $15$, in that they are between $12$ and $18$. We
can get a better feeling for the details of these results if we plot a
graph of the <em>distribution</em> of the results. We count the number of
games in which a score of $k$ was obtained, and plot this number for
each $k$. Such a graph is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>. A score of
$15$ heads was obtained in $13$ games. A score of $14$ heads was also
obtained $13$ times. Scores of $16$ and $17$ were each obtained
<em>more</em> than $13$ times. Are we to conclude that there is some bias
toward heads? Was our “best estimate” not good enough?  Should we
conclude now that the “most likely” score for a run of $30$ tosses is
really $16$ heads? But wait! In all the games taken together, there were
$3000$ tosses. And the total number of heads obtained was $1493$. The
fraction of tosses that gave heads is $0.498$, very nearly, but slightly
<em>less</em> than half. We should certainly <em>not</em> assume that the
probability of throwing heads is greater than $0.5$!  The fact that one
<em>particular</em> set of observations gave $16$ heads most often, is a
<em>fluctuation</em>. We still expect that the <em>most likely</em> number
of heads is $15$.</p>
<div id="Ch6-F2">
<p><img data-src="img/FLP_I/f06-02/f06-02_tc_big.svgz"/></p><p><span>Fig. 6–2.</span>Summary of the results of 100 games of 30 tosses each. The
vertical bars show the number of games in which a score of $k$ heads was
obtained. The dashed curve shows the expected numbers of games with the
score $k$ obtained by a probability computation.
</p>
</div>
<p>We may ask the question: “What <em>is</em> the probability that a game of
$30$ tosses will yield $15$ heads—or $16$, or any other number?” We
have said that in a game of one toss, the probability of obtaining
<em>one</em> head is $0.5$, and the probability of obtaining no head
is $0.5$. In a game of two tosses there are <em>four</em> possible
outcomes: $HH$, $HT$, $TH$, $TT$. Since each of these sequences is
equally likely, we conclude that (a) the probability of a score of two
heads is $\tfrac{1}{4}$, (b) the probability of a score of one head
is $\tfrac{2}{4}$, (c) the probability of a zero score
is $\tfrac{1}{4}$. There are <em>two</em> ways of obtaining one head, but
only one of obtaining either zero or two heads.
</p>
<p>Consider now a game of $3$ tosses. The third toss is equally likely to
be heads or tails. There is only one way to obtain $3$ heads: we
<em>must</em> have obtained $2$ heads on the first two tosses, and then
heads on the last. There are, however, <em>three</em> ways of obtaining
$2$ heads. We could throw tails after having thrown two heads (one way)
or we could throw heads after throwing only one head in the first two
tosses (two ways). So for scores of $3$-$H$, $2$-$H$, $1$-$H$, $0$-$H$
we have that the number of equally likely ways is $1$, $3$, $3$, $1$,
with a total of $8$ different possible sequences. The probabilities are
$\tfrac{1}{8}$, $\tfrac{3}{8}$, $\tfrac{3}{8}$, $\tfrac{1}{8}$.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The argument we have been making can be summarized by a diagram like
that in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F3">6–3</a>. It is clear how the diagram should be
continued for games with a larger number of tosses.
Figure <a href="#Ch6-F4">6–4</a> shows such a diagram for a game of $6$ tosses.
The number of “ways” to any point on the diagram is just the number of
different “paths” (sequences of heads and tails) which can be taken
from the starting point. The vertical position gives us the total number
of heads thrown. The set of numbers which appears in such a diagram is
known as <em>Pascal’s triangle</em>. The numbers are also known as
the <em>binomial coefficients</em>, because they also appear in the
expansion of $(a+b)^n$. If we call $n$ the number of tosses and $k$ the
number of heads thrown, then the numbers in the diagram are usually
designated by the symbol $\tbinom{n}{k}$. We may remark in passing that
the binomial coefficients can also be computed from
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:4}
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},
\end{equation}
where $n!$, called “$n$-factorial,” represents the
product $(n)(n-1)(n-2)\dotsm(3)(2)(1)$.</p>
<p>We are now ready to compute the probability $P(k,n)$ of throwing
$k$ heads in $n$ tosses, using our definition Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI61">6.1</a>). The
total number of possible sequences is $2^n$ (since there are
$2$ outcomes for each toss), and the number of ways of obtaining
$k$ heads is $\tbinom{n}{k}$, all equally likely, so we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:5}
P(k,n)=\frac{\tbinom{n}{k}}{2^n}.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Since $P(k,n)$ is the fraction of games which we expect to yield
$k$ heads, then in $100$ games we should expect to find $k$ heads
$100\cdot P(k,n)$ times. The dashed curve in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a> passes
through the points computed from $100\cdot P(k,30)$. We see that we
<em>expect</em> to obtain a score of $15$ heads in $14$ or $15$ games,
whereas this score was observed in $13$ games. We <em>expect</em> a score
of $16$ in $13$ or $14$ games, but we obtained that score in $15$ games.
Such fluctuations are “part of the game.”</p>
<p>The method we have just used can be applied to the most general
situation in which there are only two possible outcomes of a single
observation. Let us designate the two outcomes by $W$ (for “win”)
and $L$ (for “lose”). In the general case, the probability of $W$
or $L$ in a single event need not be equal. Let $p$ be the probability
of obtaining the result $W$. Then $q$, the probability of $L$, is
necessarily $(1-p)$. In a set of $n$ trials, the probability $P(k,n)$
that $W$ will be obtained $k$ times is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:6}
P(k,n)=\tbinom{n}{k}p^kq^{n-k}.
\end{equation}
This probability function is called the <em>Bernoulli</em> or, also, the
<em>binomial</em> probability.

<div id="Ch6-S3">
<h3>
<span>6–3</span>The random walk</h3>
<p>There is another interesting problem in which the idea of probability is
required. It is the problem of the “random walk.” In its simplest
version, we imagine a “game” in which a “player” starts at the
point $x=0$ and at each “move” is required to take a step
<em>either</em> forward (toward $+x$) <em>or</em> backward (toward $-x$).
The choice is to be made <em>randomly</em>, determined, for example, by
the toss of a coin. How shall we describe the resulting motion? In its
general form the problem is related to the motion of atoms (or other
particles) in a gas—called Brownian
motion—and also to the combination of
errors in measurements. You will see that the random-walk problem is
closely related to the coin-tossing problem we have already discussed.
</p>
<p>First, let us look at a few examples of a random walk. We may
characterize the walker’s progress by the net distance $D_N$ traveled in
$N$ steps. We show in the graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6–5</a> three examples
of the path of a random walker. (We have used for the random sequence of
choices the results of the coin tosses shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F1">6–1</a>.)</p>
<div id="Ch6-F5">
<p><img data-src="img/FLP_I/f06-05/f06-05_tc_big.svgz"/></p><p><span>Fig. 6–5.</span>The progress made in a random walk. The horizontal
coordinate $N$ is the total number of steps taken; the vertical
coordinate $D_N$ is the net distance moved from the starting position.
</p>
</div>
<p>What can we say about such a motion? We might first ask: “How far does
he get on the average?” We must <em>expect</em> that his average progress
will be zero, since he is equally likely to go either forward or
backward. But we have the feeling that as $N$ increases, he is more
likely to have strayed farther from the starting point. We might,
therefore, ask what is his average distance travelled in <em>absolute
value</em>, that is, what is the average of $\abs{D}$. It
is, however, more convenient to deal with another measure of
“progress,” the square of the distance: $D^2$ is positive for either
positive or negative motion, and is therefore a reasonable
<em>measure</em> of such random wandering.</p>
<p>We can show that the expected value of $D_N^2$ is just $N$, the number
of steps taken. By “expected value” we mean the probable value (our
best guess), which we can think of as the <em>expected</em> average
behavior in <em>many repeated</em> sequences. We represent such an
expected value by $\expval{D_N^2}$, and may refer to it also as the
“mean square distance.”  After one step,
$D^2$ is always $+1$, so we have certainly $\expval{D_1^2}=1$. (All
distances will be measured in terms of a unit of one step. We shall not
continue to write the units of distance.)
</p>
<p>The expected value of $D_N^2$ for $N&gt;1$ can be obtained from $D_{N-1}$.
If, after $(N-1)$ steps, we have $D_{N-1}$, then after $N$ steps we have
$D_N=D_{N-1}+1$ <em>or</em> $D_N=D_{N-1}-1$. For the squares,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:7}
D_N^2=
\begin{cases}
D_{N-1}^2+2D_{N-1}+1,\\[2ex]
\kern{3.7em}\textit{or}\\[2ex]
D_{N-1}^2-2D_{N-1}+1.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In a number of independent sequences, we expect to obtain each value
one-half of the time, so our average expectation is just the average of
the two possible values. The expected value of $D_N^2$ is then
$D_{N-1}^2+1$. <em>In general</em>, we should <em>expect</em>
for $D_{N-1}^2$ its “expected value” $\expval{D_{N-1}^2}$ (by
definition!). So
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:8}
\expval{D_N^2}=\expval{D_{N-1}^2}+1.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>We have already shown that $\expval{D_1^2}=1$; it follows then that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:9}
\expval{D_N^2}=N,
\end{equation}
a particularly simple result!</p>
<p>If we wish a number like a distance, rather than a distance squared, to
represent the “progress made away from the origin” in a random walk,
we can use the “root-mean-square distance” $D_{\text{rms}}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:10}
D_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\expval{D^2}}=\sqrt{N}.
\end{equation}
</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the random walk is closely similar in its
mathematics to the coin-tossing game we considered at the beginning of
the chapter. If we imagine the direction of each step to be in
correspondence with the appearance of heads or tails in a coin toss,
then $D$ is just $N_H-N_T$, the difference in the number of heads and
tails. Since $N_H+N_T=N$, the total number of steps (and tosses), we
have $D=2N_H-N$. We have derived earlier an expression for the expected
distribution of $N_H$ (also called $k$) and obtained the result of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI65">6.5</a>). Since $N$ is just a constant, we have the
corresponding distribution for $D$. (Since for every head more than
$N/2$ there is a tail “missing,” we have the factor of $2$ between
$N_H$ and $D$.)  The graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a> represents the
distribution of distances we might get in $30$ random steps (where
$k=15$ is to be read $D=0$; $k=16$, $D=2$; etc.).</p>
<p>The variation of $N_H$ from its expected value $N/2$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:11}
N_H-\frac{N}{2}=\frac{D}{2}.
\end{equation}
The rms deviation is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:12}
\biggl(N_H-\frac{N}{2}\biggr)_{\text{rms}}=\tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{N}.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>According to our result for $D_{\text{rms}}$, we expect that the
“typical” distance in $30$ steps ought to be $\sqrt{30} \approx 5.5$, or a
typical $k$ should be about $5.5/2 = 2.75$ units from $15$. We see that the
“width” of the curve in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>, measured from the
center, is just about $3$ units, in agreement with this result.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to consider a question we have avoided until
now. How shall we tell whether a coin is “honest” or “loaded”? We
can give now at least a partial answer. For an honest coin, we expect
the fraction of the times heads appears to be $0.5$, that is,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:13}
\frac{\expval{N_H}}{N}=0.5.
\end{equation}
We <em>also</em> expect an actual $N_H$ to deviate from $N/2$ by about
$\sqrt{N}/2$, or the <em>fraction</em> to deviate by
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{N}\,\frac{\sqrt{N}}{2}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}}.
\end{equation*}
The larger $N$ is, the closer we <em>expect</em> the fraction $N_H/N$ to
be to one-half.</p>

sequence of $N$ tosses of a penny.
</p>
</div>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F6">6–6</a> we have plotted the fraction $N_H/N$ for the
coin tosses reported earlier in this chapter. We see the tendency for
the fraction of heads to approach $0.5$ for large $N$. Unfortunately,
for any given run or combination of runs there is no <em>guarantee</em>
that the observed deviation will be even <em>near</em> the <em>expected</em>
deviation. There is always the finite chance that a large
fluctuation—a long string of heads or tails—will give an arbitrarily
large deviation. All we can say is that <em>if</em> the deviation is near
the expected $1/2\sqrt{N}$ (say within a factor of $2$ or $3$), we have
no reason to suspect the honesty of the coin. If it is much larger, we
may be suspicious, but cannot prove, that the coin is loaded (or that
the tosser is clever!).</p>
<p>We have also not considered how we should treat the case of a “coin”
or some similar “chancy” object (say a stone that always lands in
either of two positions) that we have good reason to believe
<em>should</em> have a different probability for heads and tails. We have
defined $P(H)=\expval{N_H}/N$. How shall we know what to <em>expect</em>
for $N_H$? In some cases, the best we can do is to observe the number of
heads obtained in large numbers of tosses. For want of anything better,
we must set $\expval{N_H}=N_H(\text{observed})$. (How could we expect
anything else?) We must understand, however, that in such a case a
different experiment, or a different observer, might conclude that
$P(H)$ was different. We would <em>expect</em>, however, that the various
answers should agree within the deviation $1/2\sqrt{N}$ [if $P(H)$ is
near one-half]. An experimental physicist usually says that an
“experimentally determined” probability has an “error,” and writes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:14}
P(H)=\frac{N_H}{N}\pm\frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}}.
\end{equation}
There is an implication in such an expression that there <em>is</em> a
“true” or “correct” probability which <em>could</em> be computed if we
knew enough, and that the observation may be in “error” due to a
fluctuation. There is, however, no way to make such thinking logically
consistent. It is probably better to realize that the probability
concept is in a sense subjective, that it is always based on uncertain
knowledge, and that its quantitative evaluation is subject to change as
we obtain more information.</p>

<h3>
<span>6–4</span>A probability distribution</h3>
<p>Let us return now to the random walk and consider a modification of it.
Suppose that in addition to a random choice of the <em>direction</em> ($+$
or $-$) of each step, the <em>length</em> of each step also varied in some
unpredictable way, the only condition being that <em>on the average</em>
the step length was one unit. This case is more representative of
something like the thermal motion of a molecule in a gas. If we call the
length of a step $S$, then $S$ may have any value at all, but most often
will be “near” $1$. To be specific, we shall let $\expval{S^2}=1$ or,
equivalently, $S_{\text{rms}}=1$. Our derivation for $\expval{D^2}$
would proceed as before except that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI68">6.8</a>) would be
changed now to read
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:15}
\expval{D_N^2}=\expval{D_{N-1}^2}+\expval{S^2}=\expval{D_{N-1}^2}+1.
\end{equation}
We have, as before, that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:16}
\expval{D_N^2}=N.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>What would we expect now for the distribution of distances $D$? What is,
for example, the probability that $D=0$ after $30$ steps? The answer is
zero! The probability is zero that $D$ will be <em>any particular</em>
value, since there is no chance at all that the sum of the backward
steps (of varying lengths) would exactly equal the sum of forward steps.
We cannot plot a graph like that of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>.</p>
<p>We can, however, obtain a representation similar to that of
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>, if we ask, not what is the probability of
obtaining $D$ exactly equal to $0$, $1$, or $2$, but instead what is the
probability of obtaining $D$ <em>near</em> $0$, $1$, or $2$. Let us
define $P(x,\Delta x)$ as the probability that $D$ will lie in the
interval $\Delta x$ located at $x$ (say from $x$ to $x+\Delta x$). We
expect that for small $\Delta x$ the chance of $D$ landing in the
interval is proportional to $\Delta x$, the width of the interval. So we
can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:17}
P(x,\Delta x)=p(x)\,\Delta x.
\end{equation}
The function $p(x)$ is called the <em>probability
density</em>.</p>
<p>The form of $p(x)$ will depend on $N$, the number of steps taken, and
also on the distribution of individual step lengths. We cannot
demonstrate the proofs here, but for large $N$, $p(x)$ is the
<em>same</em> for all reasonable distributions in individual step lengths,
and depends only on $N$. We plot $p(x)$ for three values of $N$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a>. You will notice that the “half-widths” (typical
spread from $x=0$) of these curves is $\sqrt{N}$, as we have shown it
should be.</p>

the starting place in a random walk of $N$ steps. ($D$ is measured in
units of the rms step length.)
</p>
</div>
<p>You may notice also that the value of $p(x)$ near zero is inversely
proportional to $\sqrt{N}$. This comes about because the curves are all
of a similar shape and their areas under the curves must all be equal.
Since $p(x)\,\Delta x$ is the probability of finding $D$ in $\Delta x$
when $\Delta x$ is small, we can determine the chance of finding $D$
<em>somewhere</em> inside an arbitrary interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$, by
cutting the interval in a number of small increments $\Delta x$ and
evaluating the sum of the terms $p(x)\,\Delta x$ for each increment. The
probability that $D$ lands somewhere between $x_1$ and $x_2$, which we
may write $P(x_1 &lt; D &lt; x_2)$, is equal to the shaded area in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F8">6–8</a>. The smaller we take the increments $\Delta x$, the
more correct is our result. We can write, therefore,
<span>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:18}
P(x_1 &lt; D &lt; x_2)=\sum p(x)\,\Delta x=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}p(x)\,dx.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}p(x)\,dx.

</div>
<p>The area under the whole curve is the probability that $D$ lands
somewhere (that is, has <em>some</em> value between $x=-\infty$

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:19}
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}p(x)\,dx=1.
\end{equation}
Since the curves in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a> get wider in proportion
to $\sqrt{N}$, their heights must be proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$ to
maintain the total area equal to $1$.</p>
<p>The probability density function we have been
describing is one that is encountered most commonly. It is known as the
<em>normal</em> or <em>Gaussian</em> probability density. It has the mathematical form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:20}
p(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\,e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is called the <em>standard deviation</em> and is given, in our case, by $\sigma=\sqrt{N}$ or, if the
rms step size is different from $1$, by $\sigma=\sqrt{N}S_{\text{rms}}$.</p>
<p>We remarked earlier that the motion of a molecule, or of any particle,
in a gas is like a random walk. Suppose we open a bottle of an organic
compound and let some of its vapor escape into the air. If there are air
currents, so that the air is circulating, the currents will also carry
the vapor with them. But even in <em>perfectly still air</em>, the vapor
will gradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated
throughout the room. We might detect it by its color or odor. The
individual molecules of the organic vapor spread out in still air
because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with other
molecules. If we know the average “step” size, and the number of steps
taken per second, we can find the probability that one, or several,
molecules will be found at some distance from their starting point after
any particular passage of time. As time passes, more steps are taken and
the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a>.
In a later chapter, we shall find out how the step sizes and step
frequencies are related to the temperature and pressure of a gas.</p>
<p>Earlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules
bouncing against the walls of the container. When we come later to make
a more quantitative description, we will wish to know how fast the
molecules are going when they bounce, since the impact they make will
depend on that speed. We cannot, however, speak of <em>the</em> speed of
the molecules. It is necessary to use a probability description. A
molecule may have any speed, but some speeds are more likely than
others. We describe what is going on by saying that the probability that
any particular molecule will have a speed between $v$ and $v+\Delta v$
is $p(v)\,\Delta v$, where $p(v)$, a probability density, is a given
function of the speed $v$. We shall see later how
Maxwell, using common sense
and the ideas of probability, was able to find a mathematical expression
for $p(v)$. The form<a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a>  of the
function $p(v)$ is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F9">6–9</a>. Velocities may have
any value, but are most likely to be near the most probable value $v_p$.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>We often think of the curve of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F9">6–9</a> in a somewhat
different way. If we consider the molecules in a typical container (with
a volume of, say, one liter), then there are a very large number $N$ of
molecules present ($N\approx10^{22}$). Since $p(v)\,\Delta v$
is the probability that <em>one</em> molecule will have its velocity
in $\Delta v$, by our definition of probability we mean that the
<em>expected</em> number $\expval{\Delta N}$ to be found with a velocity
in the interval $\Delta v$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:21}
\expval{\Delta N}=N\,p(v)\,\Delta v.
\end{equation}
We call $N\,p(v)$ the “distribution in velocity.” The area under the
curve between two velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, for example the shaded
area in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F9">6–9</a>, represents [for the curve $N\,p(v)$] the
expected number of molecules with velocities between $v_1$ and $v_2$.
Since with a gas we are usually dealing with large numbers of molecules,
we expect the deviations from the expected numbers to be small
(like $1/\sqrt{N}$), so we often neglect to say the “expected” number,
and say instead: “The number of molecules with velocities between $v_1$
and $v_2$ <em>is</em> the area under the curve.” We should remember,
however, that such statements are always about <em>probable</em> numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S5">
<h3>
<span>6–5</span>The uncertainty principle</h3>
<p>The ideas of probability are certainly useful in describing the behavior
of the $10^{22}$ or so molecules in a sample of a gas, for it is clearly
impractical even to attempt to write down the position or velocity of
each molecule. When probability was first applied to such problems, it
was considered to be a <em>convenience</em>—a way of dealing with very
complex situations. We now believe that the ideas of probability are
<em>essential</em> to a description of atomic happenings. According to
quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory of
particles, there is always some uncertainty in the <em>specification</em>
of positions and velocities. We can, at best, say that there is a
certain probability that any particle will have a position near some
coordinate $x$.</p>
<p>We can give a probability density $p_1(x)$, such that $p_1(x)\,\Delta x$
is the probability that the particle will be found between $x$
and $x+\Delta x$. If the particle is reasonably well localized, say
near $x_0$, the function $p_1(x)$ might be given by the graph of
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F10">6–10</a>(a). Similarly, we must specify the velocity of the
particle by means of a probability density $p_2(v)$,
with $p_2(v)\,\Delta v$ the probability that the velocity will be found
between $v$ and $v+\Delta v$.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is one of the fundamental results of quantum mechanics that the two functions $p_1(x)$ and $p_2(v)$ cannot be chosen
independently and, in particular, cannot both be made arbitrarily
narrow. If we call the typical “width” of the $p_1(x)$ curve $[\Delta
x]$, and that of the $p_2(v)$ curve $[\Delta v]$ (as shown in the
figure), nature demands that the <em>product</em> of the two widths be at
least as big as the number $\hbar/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the
particle. We may write this basic relationship as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:22}
[\Delta x]\cdot[\Delta v]\geq\hbar/2m.
\end{equation}
This equation is a statement of the <em>Heisenberg uncertainty
principle</em> that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Since the right-hand side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI622">6.22</a>) is a constant, this
equation says that if we try to “pin down” a particle by forcing it to
be at a particular place, it ends up by having a high speed. Or if we
try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it
“spreads out” so that we do not know very well just where it is.
Particles behave in a funny way!
</p>
<p>The uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must
exist in any attempt to describe nature. Our most precise description of
nature <em>must</em> be in terms of <em>probabilities</em>. There are some
people who do not like this way of describing nature. They feel somehow
that if they could only tell what is <em>really</em> going on with a
particle, they could know its speed and position simultaneously. In the
early days of the development of quantum mechanics, Einstein was quite
worried about this problem. He used to shake his head and say, “But,
surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!”
He worried about that problem for a long time and he probably never
really reconciled himself to the fact that this is the best description
of nature that one can give. There are still one or two physicists who
are working on the problem who have an intuitive conviction that it is
possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that all
of this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed. No one has
yet been successful.
</p>
<p>The necessary uncertainty in our specification of the position of a
particle becomes most important when we wish to describe the structure
of atoms. In the hydrogen atom, which has a nucleus of one proton with
one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty in the position of
the electron is as large as the atom itself! We cannot, therefore,
properly speak of the electron moving in some “orbit” around the
proton. The most we can say is that there is a certain
<em>chance</em> $p(r)\,\Delta V$, of observing the electron in an element
of volume $\Delta V$ at the distance $r$ from the proton. The
probability density $p(r)$ is given by quantum mechanics. For an undisturbed hydrogen atom $p(r)=Ae^{-2r/a}$. The
number $a$ is the “typical” radius, where the function is decreasing
rapidly. Since there is a small probability of finding the electron at
distances from the nucleus much greater than $a$, we may think of $a$ as
“the radius of the atom,” about $10^{-10}$ meter.

<p>We can form an image of the hydrogen atom by imagining a “cloud” whose
density is proportional to the probability density for observing the
electron. A sample of such a cloud is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F11">6–11</a>.
Thus our best “picture” of a hydrogen atom is a nucleus surrounded by
an “electron cloud” (although we <em>really</em>
mean a “probability cloud”). The electron is there somewhere, but
nature permits us to know only the <i>chance</i> of finding it at any
particular place.</p>
<p>In its efforts to learn as much as possible about nature, modern physics
has found that certain things can never be “known” with certainty.
Much of our knowledge must always remain uncertain. The <em>most</em> we
can know is in terms of probabilities.</p>
