    <h1>Clojure is a product design tool (2015)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article></article><article><p>As a product designer I&#39;m obsessed with solving problems, and lately I&#39;ve been designing with a niche programming language.</p><p><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> carries a stark notoriety among developers, despite being a tremendous feat of design. <a href="http://blog.venanti.us/why-clojure/">David Jarvis</a>, a former teammate of mine, encountered that reputation during an interview last year.</p></article><article><blockquote><p><strong><small>[David] </small></strong>... so long as it&#39;s not Lisp I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be fine!</p><p><strong><small>[Them] </small></strong>... it&#39;s Clojure.</p><p><strong><small>[David] </small></strong>(not knowing what Clojure is) *strange gurgling sound*</p></blockquote></article><article><p>Later that year I experienced Clojure&#39;s reputation for myself when I was invited to give a talk about <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a>—a variant of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript.</p><p>After the talk, one developer told me that he had never met another designer that used Clojure.
         At first I was surprised, and then concerned.</p><p>&#34;Maybe there&#39;s a reason no other designers do this&#34;, I thought.
         Then I remembered how I answered the first question I was asked that night—whether or not I enjoy writing ClojureScript.
         My answer was &#34;No.&#34;</p></article><article><h3>I didn&#39;t get it initially.</h3><p>At that time I was still working at CircleCI, and my answer reflected my experiences with a recent rewrite of our <a href="https://github.com/circleci/frontend">front end</a> web app to <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om</a>—a <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> wrapper for building interfaces.The ordeal taught me discipline but it also made my job harder.</p><p>The Clojure syntax is completely chaotic, with parentheses everywhere—at least that&#39;s what I thought last year.</p><p>Since then I&#39;ve since left CircleCI to work full-time on <a href="https://precursorapp.com/home">Precursor</a>, a collaborative prototyping tool that also has a ClojureScript front end.</p><p>As opposed to last year, not only would I say I enjoy writing ClojureScript now but—along with Om—it has ruined traditional HTML and JavaScript for me.
         I have a newfound sense of freedom, and that&#39;s why I started learning code in the first place.</p></article><article><h3>Now it all makes sense.</h3><p>I wasn&#39;t a designer for very long before I realized that I wanted to write my own code.
         High-fidelity mockups make terrible deliverables when it comes to product design.
         They waste huge amounts of time during development and never even see the light of day.</p><p>Learning HTML and CSS was the first step in taking ownership over my work.
         They kept me involved in most of development but I felt like a co-pilot, rather than the captain.</p><p>Preprocessors like Less, Sass, and Haml made things a little better.
         They taught me about fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions, and loops.</p><p>It was JavaScript frameworks that led me to my goal.
         Learning to use ClojureScript, Om, and React finally made me feel like I was taking ownership of my design work from beginning to end.</p></article><article><h3>ClojureScript saves me from other development tools.</h3><p>Before ClojureScript, I mostly used Haml for templating.
         It helped me avoid some defects in HTML like repetitive tagging.</p><p>However, Haml is more like a compromise than a solution.
         Its initial beauty fades with the first link-punctuation ritual.</p><code><span>%p
  Sentence with period after
  = succeed &#34;.&#34; do
    %a{href: &#34;#&#34;} a link</span></code><p>ClojureScript lets me avoid repetition and remains utterly simple while doing so.
         There&#39;s no song and dance; just solutions.</p><code><span>[:p &#34;Sentence with period after &#34; [:a {:href &#34;#&#34;} &#34;a link&#34;] &#34;.&#34;]</span></code><p>My favorite part about ClojureScript, is that it shares its syntax with Clojure itself.
         I improve my understanding of Clojure as a side effect of my normal workflow.
         I can&#39;t think of a better way to learn.
         That&#39;s great design, by any standard.</p></article><article><h3>And it protects me from complex design workflows.</h3><p>The icon system I made for Precursor is a good example of the inherent elegance within ClojureScript.</p><p>Using Illustrator, I constrain every icon to a single area.
         This helps me prevent inconsistent proportions.</p></article><figure><a data-caption-black="I pile icons on top of each other, and then I toggle their visibility to compare."><img src="https://dtwdl3ecuoduc.cloudfront.net/blog/clojurescript-is-a-design-tool/illustrator-onoff.gif"/></a></figure><article><p>I relate this process to ClojureScript with a map that defines all of my icon paths.</p></article><article><code><span>...
:stroke-menu-top &#34;M5,25h90&#34;
:stroke-menu-mid &#34;M5,50h90&#34;
:stroke-menu-btm &#34;M5,75h90&#34;
:stroke-lock-top &#34;M75,45V30C75,16.2,63.8,5,50,5S25,16.2,25,30v15&#34;
:filled-lock-btm &#34;M87.5,95h-75V45h75V95z&#34;
...</span></code></article><article><p>Then I specify which path goes where.</p></article><article><code><span>...
:menu {:paths [:stroke-menu-top
               :stroke-menu-mid
               :stroke-menu-btm]}
:lock {:paths [:stroke-lock-top
               :filled-lock-btm]}
...</span></code></article><article><p>This type of structure makes styling a breeze.</p></article><article><code><span>[class|=&#34;stroke&#34;] {
  fill: none;
  stroke: @color;
}
[class|=&#34;filled&#34;] {
  fill: @color;
  stroke: none;
}</span></code></article><article><p>To call this function I just specify the icon I want.</p></article><article><code><span>[:div (common/icon :menu)]</span></code></article><article><p>The paths associated with that icon get piled up and styled together.
         This lets me go from ideating to shipping in under 30 minutes.</p></article><article><h3>Every product designer should know about ClojureScript.</h3><p>I challenged myself to work outside my expertise, because I knew designing the same way everyday would dilute my passion.</p><p>My optimizations are individually subtle but they save me hours every week.
         I spend that time on more important things, like polish.
         And therein lies the point; Clojure makes me more efficient and extends my reach as a designer.</p><p>Don&#39;t let fear prevent growth.
         You don&#39;t have to learn Clojure—even though it&#39;d be nice knowing I&#39;m not alone—you just need to learn something.
         There&#39;s something you can learn right now that will help you a build better products.
         Find it and make something.</p></article></div></div>
