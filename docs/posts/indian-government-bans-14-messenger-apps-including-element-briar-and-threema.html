<p>The Centre on Monday blocked 14 messenger mobile applications, which were claimed to be used by “terrorists” to receive and spread messages from Pakistan. As per media reports, these terror groups are believed to be based in Jammu and Kashmir. The latest ban was reportedly enforced on the recommendation of defence forces, security, intelligence and investigation agencies. </p>
<p>As per a report by News18, based on source inputs, the blocked apps include Crypviser, Enigma, Safeswiss, Wickrme, Mediafire, Briar, BChat, Nandbox, Conion, IMO, Element, Second line, Zangi, Threema, among others.</p>
<p>The step was taken after multiple agencies found that these apps were being used by terrorists to communicate with their supporters and on-ground workers (OGW). The government found that these apps did not have representatives in India and they could not be contacted for seeking information as mandated by Indian laws. Agencies tried contacting the app management on various occasions, but there was no office to contact in India.</p>
<p>Reports further added that most of these apps were designed to provide anonymity to the users, and their features made it tough to resolve entities associated with them. The Ministry of Home Affairs through different agencies had found that these mobile apps aided terrorists and their affiliates to engage in activities, they added.</p>
<p>A senior intelligence official reportedly said that these apps were found to be spreading terror propaganda and inciting youths in Jammu and Kashmir. These apps have been blocked under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the official reportedly added.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the government has been trying to dent the communication network of terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. The apps that have been blocked have servers in different countries, which make them tough to trace. Also, there is no way to intercept these apps due to heavy encryption.</p>
<p>A senior government official involved in probing terror-related cases reprtedly said that on multiple occasions, security forces and investigation agencies have found these apps downloaded on mobile phones recovered from terrorists killed in operations; or, during an investigation, it was revealed that these apps were used to amplify the agenda of Pakistan-based terror outfits. Also, a number of OGWs arrested had at least one of these apps on their phone.</p>
