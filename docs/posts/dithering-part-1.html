    <h1>Dithering – Part 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Understanding how dithering works, visually.</p><div>
<p>tap/click the right side of the screen to go forward →</p><p>I’ve always been fascinated by the dithering effect. It has a unique charm that I find so appealing.</p><p>← tap/click the left side to go back</p><p>I was even more amazed when I learned how dithering works.</p><p>← or use arrow keys to navigate →</p><p>Look closely, and you’ll see this animation is made of alternating black and white pixels.</p><p>But these black and white pixels are specifically arranged to create the illusion of multiple shades.</p><p>That’s what dithering does: it simulates more color variations than what are actually used.</p><p>Here, it uses black and white to give the impression of multiple gray shades.</p><p>To me, dithering is about creating the most out of what we have, and that&#39;s what amazes me the most!</p><p>It inspired me to learn more about it, and now I want to share what I’ve learned.</p><p>Please note that this is just part one out of three, so I’ll only scratch the surface here.</p><p>I’ll go deeper in the next parts, which will come soon. Stay tuned!</p><p>First, let’s explore the dithering basics with this grayscale image example.</p><p>A grayscale image has various gray shades, from black to white.</p><p>Imagine a display that only shows black or white pixels, no grays. We must turn some pixels black and others white—but how?</p><p>One way is to map each pixel to the closest available color.</p><p>Pixels darker than medium gray turn black and lighter ones turn white.</p><p>This splits pixels into black or white groups.</p><p>However, this creates a harsh image with abrupt black-white transitions.</p><p>Shadow details vanish as gray pixels become fully black or white.</p><p>Dithering fixes this by selectively pushing some pixels towards the opposite color.</p><p>Some light gray pixels that are closer to white turn black.</p><p>Likewise, some dark grays turn white.</p><p>And it&#39;s done in a way that produces special patterns which simulate shades by varying the black-and-white pixel densities.</p><p>Denser black pixels are used in darker areas, while denser white pixels are used in lighter ones.</p><p>Next question: How are these patterns generated?</p><p>One simple dithering method, known as ordered dithering, uses a threshold map.</p><p>A threshold map is a grid of values representing brightness levels, from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest).</p><p>To dither, we compare each input pixel’s brightness to a corresponding threshold value.</p><p>If a pixel’s brightness exceeds the threshold (it’s brighter than the threshold), the pixel turns white. Otherwise, it turns black.</p><p>Repeating this for all pixels gives us the black-and-white dither patterns.</p><p>The threshold map is designed to output patterns where the black-and-white pixel density matches the input image’s shades.</p><p>So brighter input produces patterns with more white, while darker input produces more black.</p><p>These black-and-white density variations are what create the illusion of gray shades when viewed from a distance.</p><p>To dither larger images, we extend the threshold map to match the image size and follow the same principle:</p><p>Compare each pixel’s brightness to the threshold map, then turn it black or white accordingly.</p><p>The image now uses only two colors, but its overall appearance is preserved.</p><p>The variations in shades are now replaced by variations in black/white pixel density of the dithering patterns.</p><p>And that’s how dithering works in a nutshell: it replicates shades with fewer colors, which are strategically placed to maintain the original look.</p><p>I find it a bit ironic how I used to think dithering ‘adds’ a cool effect, when what it actually does is ‘remove’ colors!</p><p>That&#39;s all for now! We’ve reached the end, but there’s still a lot more to explore.</p><p>For example, we haven’t explored the algorithm to create a threshold map. (spoiler: there are many ways!)</p><p>There’s also another algorithm called error diffusion, which doesn’t use a threshold map.</p><p>Each algorithm creates a distinct, unique look, which I believe deserves its own article.</p><p>And that&#39;s why I decided to break this series into three parts.</p><p>In the next part, I’ll dive into various algorithms for creating threshold maps.</p><p>In the final part, I’ll focus on the error diffusion algorithm.</p><p>We&#39;ll dive even deeper into dithering&#39;s mechanisms in these next 2 parts, so stay tuned!</p><p>Thank you for reading!</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this kind of visual article, please consider following me on X/Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I&#39;ll keep creating more visual articles like this!</p><p>https://x.com/damarberlari</p><p>_blank</p>
