The idea is to observe the BGL patterns and adapt your strategies to get blood sugars to where you want them.</p><p id="17b5">Firstly, using the CGM and experimenting with food and insulin, we were able to approximated his ratios as being:</p><ol><li id="8210"><strong>Carbohydrate Ratio (CR) </strong>is<strong> 1:20, </strong>e.g.<strong> </strong>1 unit of insulin for 20g of carbs</li><li id="6b64"><strong>Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF)</strong> is <strong>1:10, </strong>e.g.<strong> </strong>1 unit of insulin will drop Sam’s BGL by 10 mmol/L</li><li id="87e1"><strong>ISF:CR </strong>is 10:20 or 1:2, e.g. 2g of carbs will raise Sam’s BGL by 1 mmol/L</li></ol><p id="aca7"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> These are only approximations because his insulin sensitivity changes a lot during the day; typically for dinner we give 10–20% less insulin.</em></p><p id="77df">Applying those ratios is not as easy though as our insulin pens (used to inject insulin) were not made for kids as small as Sam. They can only deliver at <strong>0.5u</strong> intervals, so we can:</p><ol><li id="efea">correct for 5, 10 or 15 mmol/L with 0.5u, 1u, 1.5u of insulin</li><li id="428c">give meal insulin for 10, 20 or 30g of carbs with 0.5u, 1u, 1.5u</li></ol><p id="780e">Since we can give finer grained carbs, e.g. a 2g gummy, we tend to round up the insulin doses and then bring him up later with small snacks. This makes our <strong>Meal Time Loop</strong> look like:</p><ol><li id="753c"><strong>Look at BGL.</strong> Add 0.5u to <code><strong>correction insulin</strong></code><strong> </strong>for every 5 mmol/L we want to bring him down.</li><li id="d2ec"><strong>Calculate the meal insulin</strong> by doing a quick carb count (and rounding up to the nearest 10g) add 0.5u of insulin to <code><strong>meal insulin</strong></code><strong> </strong>for every 10g of carbs<strong>.</strong></li><li id="a23d"><strong>Inject</strong> the <code><strong>meal insulin + correction insulin</strong></code><strong> </strong>units. <strong>However</strong>,<strong> </strong>if the meal dose is more than 1.5u we will split it into two injections and give the second one as he starts to eat. Anything more than 1.5u drops his BGL too fast.</li><li id="f4c3"><strong>Wait </strong>until he is about 6 mmol/L <strong>OR</strong> for 20 minutes <strong>OR</strong> until he starts to drop quickly <strong>OR</strong> he starts demanding food before giving him the food. This is a gut call based on the situation.</li><li id="a5da"><strong>Eat</strong> the food. If he doesn’t eat everything, keep an extra close eye BGL.</li><li id="e6fe"><strong>Repeat</strong> for every meal.</li></ol><p id="cff7">There is a lot of inaccuracy in the above loop, we are doing a lot of rounding and guessing. This does mean that we have to always keep an eye on Sam’s BGL with the <strong>Monitoring Loop:</strong></p><ol><li id="c186"><strong>Glance</strong> at his CGM data and look at BGL reading, direction and the rate of change.</li><li id="4ab6"><strong>Predict his future BGL. </strong>Try and guess what Sam’s BGL will be in about 5, 10, 30, 60 minutes out. You have to consider the CGM lag (CGMs are 10 mins behind), rate of change, when he last had some carbs or insulin, activity level, temperature, time of day, and anything else that might affect his BGL. <strong>This is a shot in the dark.</strong> You do seem to get better at it though, since you are practising every 5 minutes.</li><li id="342b"><strong>Calculate dose.</strong> Now that we have a guess of what he will be in the future we can change that by either giving some food or some insulin. Sam’s BGL will <strong>go up 1 mmol/L with 2gs of sugar </strong>or <strong>drop by 5 mmol/L with 0.5u of insulin</strong>.</li><li id="5e16"><strong>Do we dose?</strong> We will always give carbs if he risks going very low. Otherwise, we have to decide how confident we are in the above guesses to give him insulin or carbs. There is always the option to wait another 5 minutes to see if your guess was right.</li><li id="335c"><strong>Dose</strong>. It is easier to give Sam sugar than insulin.</li><li id="6467"><strong>Wait</strong> 5 minutes for the next reading.

The more irregular activities include maintaining a stock of supplies, hiding sugary treats everywhere, replacing needles and CGMs and the doctor’s visits.</p><p id="61ac">Once all that is done, you might have time to do other things, like a full time job that pays you money.</p></div><div><h2 id="c2a7">Tips and tricks</h2><p id="5f9a">This is just a bunch of stuff that we wish we would have known earlier.</p><p id="1a66"><strong>Meal Loop:</strong></p><ol><li id="ab13"><strong>Splitting up meal insulin into two shots (split bolusing)</strong> was one of our biggest improvements. If we gave him 2u for a meal he would drop too fast and it would make the timing very stressful. By splitting the doses we have managed a much stabler rise and drop of blood sugars and allowed us some breathing room if the toddler decides that today he hates pasta (for whatever reason they decide these things)</li><li id="ce0c"><strong>We say “prickle” </strong>before any finger prick or injection to calm him down. Sam doesn’t actually mind injections so much, he just hates being held still. Saying “prickle” lets him know that once we are done he can go run around again.</li><li id="5f86"><strong>Find ISF and CR ratios in the morning</strong>. The only time during the day a toddler has not eaten something is right after they wake up. The rest of the day is full of snacks and running around. The morning is the best time to dial in those ratios.</li><li id="5a4c"><strong>Keto sometimes</strong>. If Sam is high but he is hungry or deserves a reward we usually turn to keto bread, keto gummies, keto jelly, or lo carb kombucha (juice). Sam is <strong>not</strong> on a low carb diet, but keto food has allowed us to feed him without feeling guilty.</li></ol><p id="c676"><strong>Monitoring Loop:</strong></p><ol><li id="3d86"><strong>Identify basal insulin patterns.</strong> We noticed 2–3 hours after Protaphane he would go super low. We switched to Lantus which would drop much slower after 4–5 hours. This increased Sam’s TIR a ton.</li><li id="1aa5"><strong>Keep records. </strong>Having a good record of when insulin or carbs are given helps a ton in timing and identifying patterns.</li><li id="3c6b"><strong>iPhone display </strong>set up with night mode and “guided access” will not let it sleep so that I can glance at BGL anytime during the night. <em>Note: guided access will stop alarms from working, so I use an old iphone as a display.</em></li></ol><p id="8c7b"><strong>Overnight Oncall:</strong></p><ol><li id="5cf1"><strong>Use diluted insulin</strong>. If Sam is 12mmol/L at bedtime, a pen would deliver too much insulin. We got diluted insulin which we can give accurately from a needle and we use <strong>only for nighttime corrections</strong>.</li><li id="5b6a"><strong>Rules of thumb for quick action.</strong> At 2am doing calculations is hard. I recommend simplifying the maths to easy to follow rules, like if the low alarm goes off, give 4g of carbs, set an alarm for 30 mins, then go back to sleep.</li></ol></div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg" width="700" height="633" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 720w, https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 750w, https://miro.medium.com/max/786/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 786w, https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 828w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r4TxK-nTHR47wmB3yPg5xg.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" loading="eager" role="presentation"/></p></div><figcaption>Sam being a bionic kid with his CGM</figcaption></figure><p id="49a0">My wife and I are both working full time as Sam’s pancreas to give him the best chance at a long and healthy life.
