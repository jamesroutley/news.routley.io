    <h1>YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki is stepping down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/" data-ylk="cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">YouTube</a> CEO <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/susan%20wojcicki/" data-ylk="cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">Susan Wojcicki</a> has announced she&#39;s stepping down from the helm of the streaming video service. Wojcicki, who joined Alphabet nearly 25 years ago, said she&#39;s starting &#34;a new chapter focused on my family, health and personal projects I&#39;m passionate about.&#34;</p>
<p>Wojcicki has been involved with Google practically since the beginning. The company&#39;s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, set up office in her parents&#39; garage soon after they incorporated Google in 1998. Wojcicki became Google&#39;s first marketing manager the following year.</p>
<p>Among other things, she played a role in the earliest Google Doodles, co-created Google Image Search and was the first product manager of AdSense (one of Google&#39;s key advertising programs). In 2006, she encouraged Google to buy YouTube, which debuted a year earlier. Eight years later, Wojcicki took over YouTube and became one of the few women to run a major tech company.</p>
<p>During Wojcicki&#39;s tenure, YouTube became an increasingly important part of Google and Alphabet. The platform&#39;s ad revenue alone accounted for over 10 percent of the company&#39;s total revenue <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9de1a6b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">last quarter</a>. Wojcicki&#39;s run as YouTube CEO hasn&#39;t all been smooth sailing, of course. The platform has long struggled with <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-02-youtube-toxic-content-report.html" data-ylk="cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">moderation issues</a>, including around <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-youtube-hate-speech-policy-nazi-holocaust-sandy-hook.html" data-ylk="cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">hate speech</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-2020-election-authoritative-information-143432234.html" data-ylk="cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0">misinformation</a>. For her part, Wojcicki made it a point to listen to YouTube creators and users, and <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/letter-from-susan-our-2021-priorities/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0">address their concerns directly</a>.</p>

<p>In <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/a-personal-update-from-susan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0">her farewell letter</a>, Wojcicki said Neal Mohan, her de-facto deputy, is taking over as the new chief of YouTube. Mohan arrived at the company when Google bought <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-hearing-doubleclick-200745163.html" data-ylk="cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0">ad company DoubleClick</a> in 2007. He went on to become YouTube&#39;s Chief Product Officer in 2015 and helped to launch YouTube TV, YouTube Music, Premium and Shorts. Mohan also led the service&#39;s trust and safety team. </p>
<p>Intriguingly, Wojcicki said Mohan will be senior vice-president and head of YouTube, rather than CEO. &#34;With all we’re doing across Shorts, streaming and subscriptions, together with the promises of AI, YouTube’s most exciting opportunities are ahead, and Neal is the right person to lead us,&#34; Wojcicki wrote.</p>
<p>She won&#39;t be leaving YouTube immediately. &#34;In the short term, I plan to support Neal and help with the transition, which will include continuing to work with some YouTube teams, coaching team members, and meeting with creators,&#34; she wrote. Wojcicki will still be involved with Google and Alphabet moving forward, as she&#39;ll serve as an advisor. &#34;This will allow me to call on my different experiences over the years to offer counsel and guidance across Google and the portfolio of Alphabet companies,&#34; she noted.</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
