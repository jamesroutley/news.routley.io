<p>United Airlines has found loose bolts and other parts on 737 Max 9 plug doors as it inspects its fleet of Boeing jets following the Friday rapid depressurization aboard an Alaska Airlines jet of the same make, according to three people familiar with the findings.</p>
<p>The discrepant bolts and other parts on the plug doors have been found on at least five aircraft, one of the people told <em>The Air Current</em>.</p>
<p>Representatives for United and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
