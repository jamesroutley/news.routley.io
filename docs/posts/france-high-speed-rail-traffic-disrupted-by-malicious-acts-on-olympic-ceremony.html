The southeastern line was not affected as &#34;a malicious act was foiled.&#34; &#34;Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities,&#34; it said, adding that traffic on the affected lines was &#34;heavily disrupted.&#34;</p>                         <p>SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said that the attackers had started fires in &#34;conduits carrying multiple (fibre-optic) cables&#34; that carry &#34;safety information for drivers&#34; or control the motors for points. &#34;There&#39;s a huge number of bundled cables. We have to repair them one by one, it&#39;s a manual operation&#34; requiring &#34;hundreds of workers,&#34; he added.</p>            <p>French officials described the attacks on France&#39;s high-speed rail network as “criminal actions&#34; and said they were investigating whether they were linked to the Olympic Games.</p>                 <p>The Paris prosecutor&#39;s office has opened an investigation into the attacks on the rail network. It said it was investigating into &#34;the deterioration of property that threatens the fundamental interests of the nation.&#34; This crime, it added, carries a potential 15-year sentence and fines of €225,000. Further, it said crimes involving &#34;degradation and attempted degradation by dangerous means in an organized group&#34; can carry a 20-year prison sentence and fines of €150,000.</p>            <h2>800,000 passengers affected</h2>            <p>Trains were being diverted to different tracks &#34;but we will have to cancel a large number of them,&#34; the statement said. The SNCF has urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations. Farandou added that 800,000 passengers were affected.</p>                     <figure> <picture> <source srcset=" https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/556/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG 556w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/600/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG 600w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/664/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG 664w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/700/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG 700w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/800/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG 800w" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" alt="SNCF railway company workers and police officers work at a site where unknown actors targeted France&#39;s high-speed train network, ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony, in Croisilles, northern France, July 26, 2024." width="664" height="443"/> <img src="https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5500/3667/664/0/75/0/7392297_2024-07-26t094212z-164929915-rc2x29ads51v-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-railways-vandalism.JPG" alt="SNCF railway company workers and police officers work at a site where unknown actors targeted France&#39;s high-speed train network, ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony, in Croisilles, northern France, July 26, 2024." sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" width="664" height="443"/> </picture>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">SNCF railway company workers and police officers work at a site where unknown actors targeted France&#39;s high-speed train network, ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony, in Croisilles, northern France, July 26, 2024.  <span aria-hidden="true">BRIAN SNYDER / REUTERS</span>  </figcaption>  </figure>                      <figure> <picture> <source srcset=" https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/556/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg 556w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/600/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg 600w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/664/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg 664w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/700/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg 700w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/800/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" alt="Passengers gather around the departure boards at the Gare Montparnasse train station, in Paris, on July 26, 2024." width="664" height="443"/> <img src="https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5440/3626/664/0/75/0/f7db50f_5175588-01-06.jpg" alt="Passengers gather around the departure boards at the Gare Montparnasse train station, in Paris, on July 26, 2024." sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" width="664" height="443"/> </picture>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Passengers gather around the departure boards at the Gare Montparnasse train station, in Paris, on July 26, 2024.  <span aria-hidden="true">THIBAUD MORITZ / AFP</span>  </figcaption>  </figure>             <p>SNCF has announced that there will be no trains at Paris&#39; Gare Montparnasse station, which serves the west of the country, until 1 pm, with some delays and a few cancellations. &#34;All customers affected will receive a 100% refund on all train tickets,&#34; it added.</p>       <section> <p> Partner service </p> <a href="https://learn-french.lemonde.fr/?rfextension=LME" target="_blank"> <p>Learn French with Gymglish</p> <p>Thanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day.</p> <p>Try for free</p> </a> </section>        <p>At Montparnasse, passengers were waiting for more information about their trips, with display boards showing delays of more than two hours. &#34;Normal traffic is expected to resume on Monday, July 29,&#34; read one of the signs in the departure hall. The station&#39;s loudspeakers told passengers that conditions to exchange and refund tickets would be more flexible.</p>            <p>Passenger services chief Christophe Fanichet said there were delays of 90 minutes to two hours on services between Paris and France&#39;s north and east. The company also stated that all travelers would be &#34;progressively notified by SMS and email over the next few hours.&#34; &#34;We ask you not to come to the station; if we haven&#39;t warned you, your train isn&#39;t running,&#34; said Fanichet.</p>            <h2>Eurostar trains delayed</h2>            <p>Several Eurostar trains between Paris and London were also canceled Friday, the company said. &#34;All high speed trains going to and coming from Paris are being diverted via the classic line today,&#34; Eurostar said on its <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/travel-info/travel-updates/18844" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Nouvelle fenêtre">website</a>, meaning they will take an extra 90 minutes on a route that usually takes around two hours and 20 minutes. Eurostar also told AFP the line between Paris and Brussels was disrupted.</p>                 <p>Around 25% of Eurostar trains between Paris and London were canceled on Friday, the company said. &#34;This will also be the case on Saturday 27 and Sunday 28&#34; July, Eurostar said in a statement. The company expects the disruption to be cleared by Monday morning.</p>                     <figure> <picture> <source srcset=" https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/556/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg 556w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/600/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg 600w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/664/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg 664w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/700/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg 700w, https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/800/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" alt="Passengers wait for their train departures at the Bordeaux-Saint-Jean train station in Bordeaux, western France on July 26, 2024." width="664" height="443"/> <img src="https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/26/0/0/5568/3712/664/0/75/0/be7b952_5176541-01-06.jpg" alt="Passengers wait for their train departures at the Bordeaux-Saint-Jean train station in Bordeaux, western France on July 26, 2024." sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 556px, 100vw" width="664" height="443"/> </picture>   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Passengers wait for their train departures at the Bordeaux-Saint-Jean train station in Bordeaux, western France on July 26, 2024.  <span aria-hidden="true">CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT / AFP</span>  </figcaption>  </figure>             <p>&#34;Early this morning, coordinated and prepared acts of sabotage were perpetrated against installations of the SNCF,&#34; Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. &#34;There are huge and serious consequences for the rail network,&#34; he added, while security services are hunting the culprits. In a later statement, Attal said the sabotage acts had &#34;a clear objective: blocking the high-speed train network.&#34;</p>            <p>The &#34;massive attack&#34; against the high-speed rail network was an &#34;outrageous criminal act,&#34; Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said Friday. There would be &#34;very serious consequences&#34; for rail traffic throughout the weekend with connections towards northern, eastern and northwestern France halved, Vergriete said.</p>                 <p>The attacks were launched as Paris prepares for the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with 7,500 athletes, 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said he had &#34;full confidence&#34; in the French authorities despite the sabotaging of the train system hours before the Paris Games opening ceremony. &#34;I don&#39;t have concerns,&#34; the German told the media at the Olympic Athletes&#39; Village.</p>            <p>The sabotage on the rail network will have &#34;no impact on the ceremony,&#34; Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said.</p>            <p>But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer changed his travel plans to get to the Olympics on Friday after Eurostar trains were disrupted, Downing Street said. Starmer was meant to be traveling on the cross-Channel rail service from London to Paris for the Olympics opening ceremony. A  spokeswoman said he flew instead due to the delays and cancellations.</p>                 <p>However, two German athletes in showjumping, who were on a train to Paris to take part in the opening ceremony, had to turn back in Belgium because of lengthy delays. They will now miss the ceremony, German news agency dpa reported. &#34;It’s a real shame but we would have arrived too late,&#34; rider Philipp Weishaupt, who was traveling with teammate Christian Kukuk, told dpa. &#34;There was no longer a chance of making it on time.&#34;</p>                             <section>   </section>                 <section>  <p>  <span>Le Monde with AP and AFP</span>  </p>   </section>    <section>     </section>   </article>   </section>                     </section> </section>          <section id="js-capping" data-full="0" data-mini="0"> <section id="js-capping-wrapper">  <section id="js-capping-content"> <p>Vous pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> sur un seul appareil à la fois</p>   <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.</p>    <a href="https://moncompte.lemonde.fr" id="js-capping-yellow-button" data-cta="multi">Découvrir les offres multicomptes</a>  </section> <section id="js-capping-bottom">     <ul id="js-capping-faq"> <li> <p>Parce qu’une autre personne (ou vous) est en train de lire <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte sur un autre appareil.</p> <p>Vous ne pouvez lire <i>Le Monde</i> que sur <strong>un seul appareil</strong> à la fois (ordinateur, téléphone ou tablette).</p> </li> <li> <p>Comment ne plus voir ce message ?</p> <p>En cliquant sur «  » et en vous assurant que vous êtes la seule personne à consulter <i>Le Monde</i> avec ce compte.</p> </li> <li> <p>Que se passera-t-il si vous continuez à lire ici ?</p> <p>Ce message s’affichera sur l’autre appareil.
