<h3>How much do publishers earn from ad impressions?</h3>
<p>The amount of money an ad impression generates varies significantly across display mediums and content categories.</p>
<p>But we can get a good heuristic from <a href="https://adsense.google.com/start/#calculator">Google&#39;s AdSense estimated revenue calculator</a>.</p>
<p>The calculator gives you an estimate for your annual ad revenue potential based upon your content category (Finance, Games, Health, etc...) and your monthly page views.</p>
<p>For example, putting in 50k page views a month, with a Finance category, gives a potential yearly earnings of $2,000.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to take the <strong>median</strong> across all categories, which is an estimated annual revenue of $1,550 for 50,000 monthly page views.</p>
<p>This is approximately <strong>~$0.00022 earned per page view</strong>.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to generate AI content?</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s invent a blog that generates content in response to whatever the user types in the search bar.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll generate the article the user is looking for, on the fly. Will it be mostly nonsense? Probably. But let&#39;s go for it anyway, just to illustrate a point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>user: &#34;how to have my macbook audibly greet me whenever I flip it open&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to facilitate this, we&#39;ll wrap the user&#39;s query around a prompt.</p>
<p>Below is the prompt we&#39;ll use.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>You are an excellent blog writer. You write blogs that rank well in search engines because you know about SEO and how to use highly relevant and popular keywords. Your blog posts are informative, and help users achieve what they are looking for.

You will receive queries from users searching for blog posts. You will create blog posts that matches their query, that are helpful, and that answer or are relevant to whatever they are searching for.

Respond with only the blog post.</code></pre></div>
<p>With this prompt, and the user query, we have <strong>119 input tokens</strong> according to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat?models=gpt-4o-mini">OpenAI&#39;s Playground</a>.</p>
<p>The response generated by gpt4o-mini, is only <strong>829 output tokens</strong>.</p>

If you want your MacBook to greet you with a chime or a specific sound every time you flip it open, it’s a fun way to personalize your device and make your daily interactions a bit more exciting. While macOS doesn’t come with a built-in feature to audibly greet you immediately upon opening the lid, there are a few creative workarounds to achieve a similar effect. In this blog post, we will discuss a couple of methods you can set up for your MacBook to greet you audibly.

## Method 1: Setting Up a Startup Sound

1. **System Preferences:**
   - Go to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
   - Select **System Preferences**.
   - Click on **Sound** and then navigate to the **Sound Effects** tab.
   
2. **Enable Startup Sound:**
   - Make sure the option “Play sound on startup” is checked. This way, your MacBook will play the selected sound every time you start it up.
   - Note: This method will only play sound when the MacBook is fully powered down and then opened again.

While this method does not greet you specifically upon opening the lid from sleep mode, it’s effective for a full startup.

## Method 2: Create an Automator App for a Custom Greeting

For more customization, you can use the Automator app to create your own greeting sound that plays when the MacBook wakes from sleep.

### Steps to Create Your Greeting:

1. **Open Automator:**
   - Search for **Automator** in Spotlight Search or find it in the Applications folder.

2. **Create New Document:**
   - Choose **New Document** and select **Application**.

3. **Use the Run Shell Script Action:**
   - In the sidebar, find **Utilities** and drag the **Run Shell Script** action to the main area.

4. **Enter the AppleScript Command:**
   - Replace the default script with the following:
     ```bash
     osascript -e &#39;tell app &#34;System Events&#34; to say &#34;Welcome back!&#34;&#39;
     ```

5. **Choose Your Sound:**
   - If you want a specific sound file instead of a spoken greeting, use the following command instead:
     ```bash
     afplay /path/to/your/soundfile.mp3
     ```
   - Make sure you replace `/path/to/your/soundfile.mp3` with the actual file path of your chosen audio file.

6. **Save Your Application:**
   - Go to **File &gt; Save**, and name it something like “Greeting Sound.” Ensure it is saved in the Applications folder.

### Automating the Greeting Sound:

1. **Open System Preferences:**
   - Go to **System Preferences** and select **Users &amp; Groups**.

2. **Select Your User Account:**
   - Click on your username and select the **Login Items** tab.

3. **Add Your Automator App:**
   - Click the **“+”** button and navigate to the Greeting Sound app you created. Add it to the list.

Now, whenever your MacBook wakes from sleep, your personalized greeting sound will play.

## More Personalization Options

- **Use a Different Voice:** If you used the text-to-speech option, you can change the voice in **System Preferences** &gt; **Accessibility** &gt; **Spoken Content**.
- **Add More Sounds:** You can repeat the process for multiple sounds or greetings by creating separate Automator apps.

## Conclusion

By using the methods outlined above, you can add a personal touch to your MacBook experience. Whether you choose the simple startup sound or get creative with an Automator app, these options allow you to greet your MacBook (and yourself) every time you open it. So, go ahead and set it up, and enjoy your daily welcome back!

<p>The cost to generate the article was <strong>$0.00051525</strong>. And it wasn&#39;t half-bad.</p>
<h3>Ad impression vs AI cost.</h3>
<p>You can probably see where I&#39;m going with this now.</p>
<p>For that blog post, we might earn <strong>~$0.00022</strong> for the single page impression from the user that requested it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blog post itself, had a cost of <strong>$0.00051525</strong> to generate.</p>
<p>We made a net profit of $0.00022 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$-0.00029525</strong>!</p>
<p>Woohoo, we lost money! We&#39;re going to be rich!</p>
<p>Joking aside, let&#39;s imagine that blog post receives <strong>only 5 page views</strong> throughout its entire lifetime, which is a pretty conservative estimate to make.</p>
<p>Now, we&#39;ll earn $0.00022 * 5 = <strong>$0.0011</strong>.</p>
<p>Subtracting our cost, $0.0011 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$0.00058475</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s <strong>5.8 hundreths of a penny</strong>. Don&#39;t go spending it all in one place.</p>
<h2>Is this going to actually happen?</h2>
<p>Will the future of the internet be entirely dynamically generated AI blogs in response to user queries?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I hope not. But the internet has been on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">downward trend for a while now</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the internet is probably already SEO content blogspam generated by cheap copywriters.</p>
<h2>Is anyone doing this now?</h2>
<p>In a fun way, yes, check out <a href="https://websim.ai">Websim</a> which uses LLMs to dynamically generate an alternative internet. It&#39;s a &#34;web simulator&#34; brought to you by AI.</p>
<p>They&#39;re not making money though. There aren&#39;t any ads (yet).</p></section><hr/></article></div>
