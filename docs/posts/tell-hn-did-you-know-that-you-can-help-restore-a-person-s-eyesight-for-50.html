    <h1>Tell HN: Did you know that you can help restore a personâ€™s eyesight for $50?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Dear HN,</p><p>Is there a better way to start a year than with acts of generosity?</p><p>Recently, I learned about the Seva Foundation, which counts Larry Brilliant, Ram Dass and Steve Jobs among its founders. The foundation&#39;s mission is to <i>&#34;build sustainable eye care systems worldwide by creating equitable access to eye care, building capacity of new and existing eye hospitals and systems, and collecting and learning from evidence.&#34;</i></p><p>I perused their website, and was taken aback by how common it is in many parts of the world for scores of people to suffer from vision impairment due to cataracts - a condition that can be easily cured with a simple surgery that costs 50$ to carry out.</p><p>It is a powerful reminder of the stark inequalities that exist in the world. I feel grateful that there are people like the Seva Foundation, who are doing something about it.</p><p>You can learn more about the foundation and donate to the cause at:</p><p><a href="https://www.seva.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.seva.org/</a></p><p>P.S. I am not affiliated with the Seva Foundation, I just found them to be a genuinely great organization and wanted to spread the word.</p></div></div></div>
