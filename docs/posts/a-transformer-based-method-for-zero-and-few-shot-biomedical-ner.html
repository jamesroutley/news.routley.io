            <span>Abstract:</span>  Supervised named entity recognition (NER) in the biomedical domain is
dependent on large sets of annotated texts with the given named entities, whose
creation can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the extraction of
new entities often requires conducting additional annotation tasks and
retraining the model. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
transformer-based method for zero- and few-shot NER in the biomedical domain.
The method is based on transforming the task of multi-class token
classification into binary token classification (token contains the searched
entity or does not contain the searched entity) and pre-training on a larger
amount of datasets and biomedical entities, from where the method can learn
semantic relations between the given and potential classes. We have achieved
average F1 scores of 35.44% for zero-shot NER, 50.10% for one-shot NER, 69.94%
for 10-shot NER, and 79.51% for 100-shot NER on 9 diverse evaluated biomedical
entities with PubMedBERT fine-tuned model. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method for recognizing new entities with limited
examples, with comparable or better results from the state-of-the-art zero- and
few-shot NER methods.
