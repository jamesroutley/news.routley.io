    <h1>Tell HN: HP printers force you into agreement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The HP Smart App forces you to agree to use only their ink before you can use their app.   That shouldn&#39;t be a big deal since modern HP printers work fine out of the box without a driver.</p><p>However, after you&#39;ve printed a bunch of pages, they stop working and display the error message &#34;Printer setup incomplete. Your HP+ printer must be set up using the HP Smart app. Visit 123.hp.com to download the app and complete the guided setup. Any pages you have printed were intended for setup and have been exhausted.&#34;</p><p>Conveniently, this usually doesn&#39;t happen until it&#39;s too late to return the printer.</p></div></div></div>
