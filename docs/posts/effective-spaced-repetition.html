    <h1>Effective Spaced Repetition</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>You won’t get smarter by drilling IQ tests or playing the violin. Dual n-back
<a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq#personal-reflection-on-results">probably</a> won’t improve your working memory. But you can remember anything
you choose to with <a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is, by far, the most effective cognitive hack I’ve used. It
used to be that I’d read a book and afterwards remember almost
nothing. Sometimes I’d take Kindle highlights, or notes, but never review
them. And I hoped that though I could not necessarily <em>name</em> what I recalled
(because whose memory has an index?) that somehow the important information was
woven into my knowledge, tacitly. This is mostly a cope.</p>

<p>I love learning, and spaced repetition has helped me become extremely good at
it. But it took a long time to become effective at it. There’s a lot of advice
on the Internet on how to do it effectively, most of which is phrased in terms
of very general principles, but very few concrete examples. But what people
struggle with is: how do I turn this <em>specific, concrete</em> piece of information
into a set of flashcards?</p>

<p>This post describes the rules I use to write effective flashcards, with as many
examples as I could reasonably find.</p>

<p>The idea is mechanically very simple: as you learn things, you write
<em>flashcards</em>, which are question/answer pairs. Then you review them: you look at
the question, recall the answer, and turn the card over to see the answer. Then
you grade yourself: did you recall correctly or incorrectly?</p>

<p>If you keep recalling correctly, the review interval grows longer; if you get it
wrong, the interval gets shorter.</p>

<p>Some people use paper cards, most people use software such as <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>,
because the algorithm schedules reviews efficiently, so you don’t over-review
material. Unless you have a paper fetish, just use software.</p>



<p>If you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich? Or: if spaced repetition is so
effective, why doesn’t everyone do it? Why isn’t it as common as drinking
coffee?</p>

<p>There are two main limiting factors to effective spaced repetition.</p>

<h2 id="habit">Habit Formation</h2>

<p>For spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit. I drill flashcards
every day as part of my morning routine. But habit formation is difficult,
doubly so for people who have ADHD or are low in conscientiousness.</p>

<p>The reason you have to do it every day is that the spaced repetition algorithm
schedules the reviews for you, freeing you from having to do that manually. But
you don’t know what cards are due in a given day until you open the app. And if
you skip a day, those cards pile up and are due the next day.</p>

<p>A common failure mode (and I did this more than once, before I got the hang of
it) is to use Anki for two weeks, then drop it, and pick it back up six months
later only to find you have 600 cards due for review. This is not encouraging,
and it defeats the point of spaced repetition, which is to review the cards on
the intervals the algorithm chooses.</p>

<p>I don’t have much advice in this area, except that if you have persistent
problems with conscientiousness, untreated ADHD etc. you should address that
first.</p>

<h2 id="skill">Card-Writing Skills</h2>

<p>Writing effective flashcards is a skill that took me a while to acquire. Many of
the cards I wrote in the first four or six months of using spaced repetition
consistently turned out pretty much useless, and this can be frustrating. The
main reason to write this post was to communicate the lessons I learnt so you
can jump in to using spaced repetition effectively from the start.</p>

<p>One reason this can be frustrating is you’ll often remember a flashcard for the
first few weeks of it (when you’re seeing it with high frequency), but after a
couple of months, you start failing it. It didn’t take root in your long term
memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle
means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.</p>



<p>Learning is an automatic, instinctual process. It’s a fundamental feature of
intelligence. It’s a testament to how bad schooling is that people think they
have to have a special kind of brain to learn effectively, and that the idea of
learning triggers aversion in people. Remember the words of Feynman: “what one
fool can do, another can”.</p>



<p>Here are my rules for effective spaced repetition.</p>

<p>The rules are sorted by applicability (but not necessarily importance), with the
more general ones first, and most specific ones last.</p>

<p>Because many of the examples involve multiple rules at the same time, I decided
to list the examples separately from the list of rules.</p>

<h2 id="understand">Rule: Understand First</h2>

<p>Don’t try to memorize what you don’t understand. The concepts should be clear in
your head before you try to commit them to memory. “Clear” can be a fuzzy
thing. What I tend to do is: dig, expand, and clarify the text until I’m
comfortable I have a good grasp of this region of the concept graph, and then
write the flashcards.</p>

<p>Often, when reading a book, you can’t write the flashcards exactly as you read
the text, because further information can clarify or tie together important
concepts. It can be useful to keep a scratchpad where you write tentative
flashcard text as you read a chapter, and at the end you organize and
re-organize your scratchpad until you can commit it to flashcards.</p>

<h2 id="honest">Rule: Be Honest</h2>

<p>The software doesn’t know whether you recalled something correctly or not. You
are only accountable to yourself. If you recalled something wrong, or not quite
right, err on the side of caution and mark it forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="fun">Rule: Keep It Fun</h2>

<p>This is <em>crucial</em> to maintaining the habit. If reviewing flashcards feels like a
chore, you will become averse to doing it.</p>

<p>I used to frequently have this problem. I solved it in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having a diverse knowledge base you’re drilling helps, so you are not bored
by going through the same topic for a long time. Typically, spaced repetition
software will shuffle the cards, so that if you’re drilling all the cards
across all decks, you will be surprised often.</li>
  <li>A common source of frustration is cards that are too long to recall quickly,
and thus feel like a chore. Break big cards down into smaller cards. It feels
good to be able to fly through the cards quickly.</li>
  <li>Cards that are difficult to recall are very frustrating. I solved this by
applying the rules described in this post.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="repeat">Rule: Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>Memory is frequency times volume. Individual cards should be extremely brief,
but your deck as a whole can be as repetitive as you want.</p>

<h2 id="source">Rule:  Organize by Source</h2>

<p>Organize content by source, not topic.</p>

<p>The reason is you’ll often bring in information from multiple sources: multiple
textbooks, plus Wikipedia, plus lecture notes, etc. Each one of these sources
likely has a different way of organizing knowledge.</p>

<p>Don’t waste time trying to find the perfect ontology.</p>

<p>Make a deck for each source. In the case of textbooks, make a sub-deck for each
chapter. In the case of math textbooks, possibly make a sub-sub-deck in each
chapter to put theorem cards.</p>

<p>This also makes it easier to keep track of how far along you got into a text.</p>

<h2 id="atomicity">Rule: Write Atomic Flashcards</h2>

<p>Cards should be short. They should refer to as little information as
possible. They should be like chemical bonds, linking individual <em>atoms</em> of
knowledge.</p>

<p><em>This is the most important thing.</em> By far the worst failure mode is to
put too much in a flashcard.</p>

<p>There’s two reasons for this rule:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Larger cards are harder to remember.</li>
  <li>It’s harder to objectively grade yourself: when you reveal the answer, you
might have got some things right and some things wrong. If you click forget,
you will be over-reviewing the parts you already know. If you click
remembered, you will under-review the parts you forgot.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is one exception to this: you can have big cards if you also have smaller
cards that add up to the same information. You can think of the larger card as
testing that you can collate the information from the smaller cards.</p>

<h2 id="bidirectionality">Rule: Write Two-Way Questions</h2>

<p>When possible, ask questions in two directions.</p>

<p>Whenever you have a term with a definition, the obvious thing to do is to ask
for the definition from the term, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What is the order of a group?</p>

  <p>A: The cardinality of its underlying set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you can also ask for the term from the definition, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What is the term for the cardinality of a group?</p>

  <p>A: The group’s order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you have some notation, like $\mathbb{R}$ for the real numbers, or $\dim V$
for the dimension of a vector space, the natural thing to ask is what the
notation means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What does $\mathbb{R}$ stand for?</p>

  <p>A: The set of real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also ask the question backwards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What is the notation for the set of real numbers?</p>

  <p>A: $\mathbb{R}$</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="poly">Rule: Ask Questions in Multiple Ways</h2>

<p>Ask questions in multiple ways. Ask for formal and informal definitions of
terms. Ask for the formal and informal statements of a theorem. Ask questions
forwards and backwards. Add contextual questions: “what is the intutition for
[concept]?”. Add questions that link different concepts across your knowledge
graph.</p>

<p>The more interlinked your knowledge graph is, the better.</p>

<h2 id="graph">Rule: Concept Graphs</h2>

<p>It can help to visualize the concepts you’re acquiring as being like a graph,
where each node represents a discrete concept having certain properties, and the
edges in the graphs are questions which get you from one concept to another.</p>

<h2 id="hier">Rule: Learning Hierarchies</h2>

<p>A lot of knowledge is hierarchical, of the form “Foo can be either A, B, or C”,
or, dually, “A is a kind of Foo”. By analogy to OOP: these concepts are joined
by superclass and subclass relations.</p>

<p>The idea is to ask questons in the top down direction (“What are the subclasses of
Foo?”) and the bottom-up direction (“What is Bar a subclass of?”).</p>

<p>This ties into keeping flashcards atomic. Even when some information is not
hierarchical, intrinsically, breaking down large flashcards into smaller
flashcards is fundamentally building a hierarchy of flashcards.</p>

<h2 id="seq">Rule: Learning Sequences</h2>

<p>In general, to learn a sequence $(A_1, \dots, A_n)$, you want to generate the
following flashcards for each $i \in [1,n]$:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the $i$-th element?</td>
      <td>$A_i$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the position of $A_i$?</td>
      <td>$i$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What element comes after $A_i$?</td>
      <td>$A_{i+1}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What element comes before $A_i$?</td>
      <td>$A_{i-1}$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You might also want:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <strong>test card:</strong> a flashcard asking you to recite the sequence from beginning
to end.</li>
  <li>A <strong>cloze sequence:</strong> flashcard with a cloze deletion for each element in the
sequence, to fill in the blank given the context.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="#seq-script">sequence script</a> can generate these for you.</p>

<p>How thorough you want to be depends on the nature of the information. Most of
the time I use a cloze card and a test card.</p>

<p>Another type of card you might use (I use this to memorize poems) is a card that
gives you some context (the previous one or two items in the sequence) and asks
you to fill in the blank. For example, if you wanted to learn the sequence (A,
B, C, D), you might have these flashcards:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Beginning</em>, …</td>
      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Beginning</em>, A, …</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A, B, …</td>
      <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B, C, …</td>
      <td>D</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <a href="#poetry-script">poetry script</a> can generate these for you.</p>



<p>Many of these examples are overkill: we collect a lot more flashcards than the
subject deserves. But this is to illustrate the general rules. With experience,
you can learn how many questions a particular topic requires, and different
volumes of your knowledge graph will be more or less interlinked.</p>

<h2 id="magma">Example: Magma Formation</h2>

<p>From my geology notes:</p>

<div>

  <p>Magma is liquid rock under the Earth’s surface.</p>

  <p>The three magma-forming processes are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Increasing Temperature:</strong> increasing temperature can melt rock.</li>
    <li><strong>Decreasing Pressure:</strong> when the pressure drops, atoms are more free to
move, and rock becomes liquid.</li>
    <li><strong>Addition of Water:</strong> water lowers the melting point of rock, because the
water molecules disrupt the crystal bonds.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Magma forms in three places:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hot spots:</strong> as hot rock rises, pressure decreases and it becomes magma.</li>
    <li><strong>Rift zones:</strong> as tectonic plates are pulled apart, hot rock rises (because
it is less dense) to plug the gap and melts due to decreasing pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Subduction zones:</strong> water-rich ocean lithosphere sinks into the mantle. The
water heats up and rises, adding water to the overlying rock, which the
melts.</li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>Let’s break this down hierarchically. We want to memorize three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What magma is.</li>
  <li>How it forms.</li>
  <li>Where it forms.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, the definition:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is magma?</td>
      <td>Liquid rock under the Earth’s surface.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for liquid rock under surface of the Earth?</td>
      <td>Magma.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Second, we want to know how magma forms. A common mistake here would be to put
the magma-forming processes <em>and</em> their explanations in the same
flashcard. Rather, to keep each card as small as possible, we want to separate
the list of processes from their definitions.</p>

<p>So we first as for a list of mechanisms:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the magma-forming processes?</td>
      <td>Increasing temperature, decreasing pressure, addition of water.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And then we ask for an explanation of each. We don’t really need to ask why
adding temperature melts rock:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Why does decreasing pressure melt rock?</td>
      <td>Because the atoms are more free to move.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why does adding water lower the melting point of rock?</td>
      <td>Because water molecules disrupt the bonds in the rock minerals.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Third: where magma is found. Again, we separate the list from the details:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Where does magma form?</td>
      <td>Over hot spots, in rift zones, and in subduction zones.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Then we ask for details. For each place where magma forms, we ask both which
processes are involved, and what the full causal explanation is. We also ask the
question backward: which places involve a given process.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What magma-forming process happens over a hot spot?</td>
      <td>Pressure-release melting.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What magma-forming process happens in a rift zone?</td>
      <td>Pressure-release melting.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What magma-forming process happens in a subduction zone?</td>
      <td>Increasing temperature and addition of water.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Where does magma form due to pressure release?</td>
      <td>Hot spots and rift zones.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Where does magma form due to increasing temperature and the addition of water?</td>
      <td>Subduction zones.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does magma form in a hot spot?</td>
      <td>As hot mantle rock rises, the decrease in pressure causes it to melt.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does magma form in a rift zone?</td>
      <td>As the tectonic plates move apart, hot rock rises to fill the gap, and the decrease in pressure causes it to melt.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does magma form in a subduction zone?</td>
      <td>Waterlogged crust dives into the mantle, the water turns to steam and rises, the addition of water to overlying rock causes it to melt.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We can visualize the resulting knowledge graph like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/magma.svg"/></p>

<h2 id="tectonics">Example: Plate Tectonics</h2>

<p>Here’s the information:</p>

<div>

  <p>The zone where two or more tectonic plates meet is called a <em>plate
boundary</em>. There are three kinds:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Convergent boundaries: plates come together.</li>
    <li>Divergent boundaries: plates move apart.</li>
    <li>Transform boundaries: plates slide past each other.</li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>Applying the rule that cards should be two-way, we want two flashcards for the
term ‘plate boundary’.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is a plate boundary?</td>
      <td>The place where tectonic plates meet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for the place where tectonic plates meet?</td>
      <td>Plate boundary.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For the different types of plate boundary, we only ask the question in the
top-down direction (we don’t need to ask “what kind of thing is a transform
boundary?”, since the name kind of gives it away):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the types of plate boundary?</td>
      <td>Convergent, divergent, transform.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For each kind of plate boundary, we also ask the question in two ways:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Definition: convergent boundary.</td>
      <td>Where tectonic plates come together.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Definition: divergent boundary.</td>
      <td>Where tectonic plates move apart.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Definition: transform boundary.</td>
      <td>Where tectonic plates slide past each other.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Term: place where tectonic plates come together.</td>
      <td>Convergent boundary.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Term: place where tectonic plates move apart.</td>
      <td>Divergent boundary.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Term: place where tectonic plates slide past each other.</td>
      <td>Transform boundary.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Graphically, here’s how the questions link the concepts in the knowledge graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/plates.svg"/></p>

<h2 id="neural">Example: Neural Cells</h2>

<p>Cells in the nervous system are divided into neurons and glia. Glial cells are
divided into macroglia and microglia. Macroglia are divided into astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells.</p>

<p>Visually:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/neuro.svg"/></p>

<p>We first write the top-down questions:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What kinds of cell make up the nervous system?</td>
      <td>Neurons and glia.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the kinds of glial cell?</td>
      <td>Microglia and macroglia.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the kinds of macroglia?</td>
      <td>Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And the bottom-up questions. We don’t ask these when the answers are obvious:
“what are microglia/macroglia a kind of” has an obvious answer.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>

<h2 id="neurons">Example: Neuron Types</h2>

<p>This is a brief example about keeping cards short and using hierarchies to break
things down.</p>

<p>From my neuroscience notes:</p>

<div>

  <p>Neurons can be divided into three categories by their function:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Sensory:</strong> feed sensory information into the brain.</li>
    <li><strong>Motor:</strong> send motor commands to the muscles.</li>
    <li><strong>Interneurons:</strong> connect within the CNS. These are further divided into:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Local:</strong> form circuits with nearby neurons.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay:</strong> have long axons and communicate across brain regions.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>Let’s start by doing this the wrong way, by loading too much information
into one card.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the functional categories of neuron?</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Sensory:</b> feed sensory information into the brain.</li>
          <li><b>Motor:</b> send motor commands to the muscles.</li>
          <li><b>Interneurons:</b> connect within the CNS.</li>
        </ul>
        (😩 too long)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the different types of interneuron?</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Local:</b> form circuits with nearby neurons.</li>
          <li><b>Relay:</b> have long axons and communicate across brain regions.</li>
        </ul>
        (😩 too long)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Let’s first break this down by separating <em>terms</em> from <em>definitions</em>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the functional categories of neuron?</td>
      <td>Sensory, motor, interneurons.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are sensory neurons?</td>
      <td>Neurons which feed information into the brain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are motor neurons?</td>
      <td>Neurons which send commands to the muscles.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are interneurons?</td>
      <td>Neurons which connect within the CNS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the types of interneuron?</td>
      <td>Local, relay.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are local interneurons?</td>
      <td>Interneurons that form circuits with nearby neurons.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are relay interneurons?</td>
      <td>Interneurons have long axons and communicate across brain regions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now we ask the questions in the backward direction: from the definition to the term:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for a neuron that feeds information into the brain?</td>
      <td>Sensory neuron.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for a neuron that sends commands to the muscles?</td>
      <td>Motor neuron.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for a neuron that connects within the CNS?</td>
      <td>Interneuron.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for an interneuron that forms circuits with nearby neurons?</td>
      <td>Local interneuron.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for an interneuron that communicates across brain regions?</td>
      <td>Relay interneuron.</td>
    </tr>

<h2 id="vect">Example: Vector Spaces</h2>

<p>Here’s what we want to learn:</p>

<div>

  <p>A vector space, informally, is a set whose elements—called vectors—can be
added or scaled.</p>

  <p>More formally: a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set $V$ plus two
operations:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Vector addition: $V \times V \to V$</li>
    <li>Scalar multiplication: $V \times \mathbb{F} \to V$</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Satisfying the following axioms:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Commutativity of Addition</dt>
    <dd>$u + v = v + u$</dd>
    <dt>Associativity of Addition</dt>
    <dd>$u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$</dd>
    <dt>Identity of Addition</dt>
    <dd>$\exists 0 \in V : v + 0 = v$</dd>
    <dt>Inverse of Addition</dt>
    <dd>$\forall v \in V, \exists -v \in V : v + (-v) = 0$</dd>
    <dt>Identity of Scaling</dt>
    <dd>$1v = v$</dd>
    <dt>Distributivity</dt>
    <dd>$\forall v \in V, a,b \in \mathbb{F} : (a+b)v = av + bv$</dd>
  </dl>

</div>

<p>We have to break this down. Severely. We will do this step by step.</p>

<p>First, we have to separate the informal (intuitive) and formal definitions:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Informally: what is a vector space?</td>
      <td>A set whose elements can be added or scaled.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Formally: what is a vector space?</td>
      <td>A vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set $V$ plus two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We add one brief question about notation (you may choose to skip this one, it’s
an example):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the elements of a vector space called?</td>
      <td>Vectors.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now we ask about the signatures of the operations:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the signature of vector addition?</td>
      <td>$V \times V \to V$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the signature of scalar multiplication?</td>
      <td>$V \times \mathbb{F} \to V$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Next, we ask for the axioms:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the axioms that define a vector space?</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>Commutativity of Addition</li>
          <li>Associativity of Addition</li>
          <li>Identity of Addition</li>
          <li>Inverse of Addition</li>
          <li>Identity of Scaling</li>
          <li>Distributivity</li>
        </ol>
     </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Finally, we ask what each axiom means:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: commutativity of addition</td>
      <td>$u + v = v + u$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: associativity of addition</td>
      <td>$u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: identity of addition</td>
      <td>$\exists 0 \in V:  v + 0 = v$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: inverse of addition</td>
      <td>$\forall v \in V, \exists -v \in V:  v + (-v) = 0$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: identity of scaling</td>
      <td>$1v = v$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vector spaces: state: distributivity</td>
      <td>$\forall v \in V, a,b \in \mathbb{F}:  (a+b)v = av + bv$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Graphically, you can try visualizing the flashcards and their relationships like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/vect.svg"><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/vect.svg"/></a></p>

<p>If you want to be extra thorough, you can also write the backwards questions:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for a set whose elements can be added or scaled?</td>
      <td>A vector space.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $u + v = v + u$</td>
      <td>Commutativity of Addition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$</td>
      <td>Associativity of Addition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $\exists 0 \in V : v + 0 = v$</td>
      <td>Identity of Addition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $\forall v \in V, \exists -v \in V : v + (-v) = 0$</td>
      <td>Inverse of Addition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $1v = v$</td>
      <td>Identity of Scaling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name this axiom: $\forall v \in V, a,b \in \mathbb{F} : (a+b)v = av + bv$</td>
      <td>Distributivity</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="parity">Example: Parity Group</h2>

<div>

  <p>The <em>parity group</em> is a group that represents the rules for adding even and odd
numbers. The underlying set is $\set{\text{even}, \text{odd}}$, with
$\text{even}$ and $\text{odd}$ representing even and odd numbers
respectively. The composition table is:</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>$+$</td>
        <td>$\text{even}$</td>
        <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\text{even}$</td>
        <td>$\text{even}$</td>
        <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
        <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
        <td>$\text{even}$</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The identity element is $\text{even}$. The group is Abelian.</p>

</div>

<p>We can turn this into the following flashcards:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the parity group?</td>
      <td>The group that represents the rules for adding even and odd numbers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the order of the parity group?</td>
      <td>$2$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the underlying set of the parity group?</td>
      <td>$\set{\text{even}, \text{odd}}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the identity element of the parity group?</td>
      <td>$\text{even}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the operation of the parity group?</td>
      <td>Addition of even and odd numbers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$\text{even} + \text{even} = $</td>
      <td>$\text{even}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$\text{even} + \text{odd} = $</td>
      <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$\text{odd} + \text{even} = $</td>
      <td>$\text{odd}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$\text{odd} + \text{odd} = $</td>
      <td>$\text{even}$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is the parity group Abelian? Why or why not?</td>
      <td>Yes, because addition commutes.</td>

<h2 id="logical-consequence">Example: Logical Consequence</h2>

<p>From my notes on logic:</p>

<div>

  <p>The two notions of <em>logical consequence</em> are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Semantic Consequence:</strong> $Q$ is a semantic consequence of $P$ iff, in every
interpretation where $P$ is true, $Q$ is also true. This is denoted $P
\models Q$.</li>
    <li><strong>Syntactic Consequence:</strong> $Q$ is a syntactic consequence of $P$ iff there
exists a proof from $P$ to $Q$. This is denoted $P \vdash Q$.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Semantic consequence is about interpretations, while semantic consequence is
about proofs.</p>

</div>

<p>We begin with the most basic question:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the two notions of logical consequence?</td>
      <td>Semantic and syntactic.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Then we ask questions specifically about semantic consequence:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Define semantic consequence</td>
      <td>$Q$ is a semantic consequence of $P$ iff in every interpretation where $P$ is true, $Q$ is also true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What’s the notation for “$Q$ is a semantic consequence of $P$”?</td>
      <td>$P \models Q$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does $P \models Q$ mean?</td>
      <td>$Q$ is a semantic consequence of $P$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Semantic consequence connects sentences by…</td>
      <td>Iterpretations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Which notion of logical consequence involves interprerations?</td>
      <td>Semantic consequence.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And then about syntactic consequence:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Define syntactic consequence</td>
      <td>$Q$ is a syntactic consequence of $P$ iff there is a proof from $P$ to $Q$.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What’s the notation for “$Q$ is a syntactic consequence of $P$”?</td>
      <td>$P \vdash Q$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does $P \vdash Q$ mean?</td>
      <td>$Q$ is a syntactic consequence of $P$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Syntactic consequence connects sentences by…</td>
      <td>Proofs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Which notion of logical consequennce involves proofs?</td>
      <td>Syntactic consequence.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2 id="perodization">Example: Periodization</h2>

<p>Timelines are a great example of how breaking information down hierarchically
can help you learn long sequences. Sometimes the breakdown is already done for
us.</p>

<div>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale">geologic time scale</a> (GTS) divides the geological record of the Earth
into four nested time units:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The <strong>eon</strong> is the largest unit. Eons last hundreds of millions of years.</li>
    <li>Eons are further divided into <strong>eras</strong>, which last tens to hundreds of
millions of years.</li>
    <li>Eras are divided into <strong>periods</strong>, which last millions to tens of millions of
years.</li>
    <li>Finally, periods are divided into <strong>epochs</strong>, which last hundreds of
thousands to millions of years.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The four eons, from oldest to most recent, are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Hadean (4.5Gya to 4Gya)</li>
    <li>Archean (4Gya to 2.5Gya)</li>
    <li>Proterozoic (2.5Gya to 538Mya)</li>
    <li>Phanerozoic (538Mya to present)</li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>We want to learn the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What the geologic time scale is.</li>
  <li>How it divides the Earth’s history.</li>
  <li>The four eons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s begin with the simplest flashcards, the definition of the GTS:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the geologic time scale?</td>
      <td>The timeline of Earth’s history.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for the timeline of Earth’s history?</td>
      <td>The geologic time scale.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The subdivisions form a sequence, from oldest to most recent: eon, era, period,
epoch. So let’s feed it into the <a href="#seq-script">sequence script</a>. Here’s the
input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Geologic Time Units
Eon
Era
Period
Epoch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running <code>cat units.txt | ./sequence.py &gt; units.csv</code> and importing <code>units.csv</code>
into Mochi, we get these flashcards:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> Recall all elements of the sequence</td>
      <td>Eon, Era, Period, Epoch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What element has position 1?</td>
      <td>Eon.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What element has position 2?</td>
      <td>Era.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What element has position 3?</td>
      <td>Period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What element has position 4?</td>
      <td>Epoch.</td>

    <tr>

      <td>4.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What comes after Eon?</td>
      <td>Era.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Geologic Time Units:</strong> What comes before Epoch?</td>
      <td>Period.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You probably don’t need <em>all</em> of these. You can probably get away with just
these:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the units of the geologic time scale, from largest to smallest?</td>
      <td>Eon, era period, epoch.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the largest unit in the geologic time scale?</td>
      <td>The eon.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the second-largest unit in the geologic time scale?</td>
      <td>The era.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the third-largest unit in the geologic time scale?</td>
      <td>The period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the smallest unit in the geologic time scale?</td>
      <td>The epoch.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, since this is a concept hierarchy, we also ask the “what is” questions.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an eon?</td>
      <td>A division of the geologic time scale.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an era?</td>
      <td>A division of the geologic time scale.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an period?</td>
      <td>A division of the geologic time scale.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an epoch?</td>
      <td>A division of the geologic time scale.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And, since units have a duration, we ask what for the duration. We do this
forwards and backwards:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the duration of an eon?</td>
      <td>Hundreds of millions of years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<h2 id="ratnums">Example: Rational Numbers</h2>

<p>Let’s commit this to spaced repetition:</p>

<div>

  <p>The set of rational numbers, denoted $\mathbb{Q}$, is the set of fractions with
integer numerator and denominator, where the denominator is non-zero.</p>

  <p>Formally:</p><p>

\[\mathbb{Q} = \left\{\, \frac{p}{q} \,\, \middle| \,\, p, q \in \Z \land q \neq 0 \,\right\}\]

  </p><p>The $\mathbb{Q}$ stands for <em>quotient</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>Let’s visualize the concept graph as we build up the flashcards. We start with
the central node, the concept of the rational numbers:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/rats1.svg"/></p>

<p>Then we add a notation node, linked by two forward and backwards questions:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/rats2.svg"/></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the notation for the set of rational numbers?</td>
      <td>$\mathbb{Q}$.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does $\mathbb{Q}$ stand for?</td>
      <td>The set of rational numbers.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Formal as well as informal definitions:</p>

<h2 id="regex">Example: Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>This is an example about asking questions in two ways.</p>

<p>These cards go from a concept to a regex:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What regex matches the start of a line?</td>
      <td><code>^</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What regex matches the end of a line?</td>
      <td><code>$</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What regex matches a digit?</td>
      <td><code>\d</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to the above, add cards that go from the regex to the concept:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What does <code>^</code> match?</td>
      <td>The start of a line.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does <code>$</code> match?</td>
      <td>The end of a line.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does <code>\d</code> match?</td>
      <td>A digit 0-9.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="voltage">Example: Voltage</h2>

<p>This is an example of asking questions in different ways</p>

<div>

  <p>The <em>voltage</em> between two points $A$ and $B$ can be defined as either:
Voltage can be defined as:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The difference in electric potential between the two points.</li>
    <li>The amount of work done by a $1C$ particle as it travels from $A$ to $B$.</li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>The idea here is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We first ask for the definition of voltage in terms of both electric
potential and work.</li>
  <li>We also ask what is the term for each definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which gives us the following flashcards:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is voltage in terms of electric potential?</td>
      <td>Difference in electric potential between two points.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is voltage in terms of work?</td>
      <td>Work done by a 1C particle as it travels from A to B.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for the difference in electric potential between two points?</td>
      <td>Voltage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for the work done by a 1C particle as it travels between two points?</td>
      <td>Voltage.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="isomers">Example: Isomers</h2>

<div>

  <p>Two chemical compounds are said to be <strong>isomers</strong> of each other if they have the
same chemical formula (same number of atoms of each element) but their
three-dimensional structure differs.</p>

  <p>Isomers can be divided into:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Structural Isomers:</strong> the chemical formula is the same but the atoms are
bonded differently.</li>
    <li><strong>Stereoisomers:</strong> the chemical formula and the bonds are the same but the
spatial arrangement is different. These are divided into:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Conformational Isomers:</strong> can be intercoverted by rotating about a sigma
bond.</li>
        <li><strong>Configurational Isomers:</strong> cannot be interconverted without breaking a
bond. These are further subdivided into:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Enantiomers:</strong> non-superposable mirror images. Also called <em>optical
isomers</em> because of the way they reflect plane-polarized light.</li>
            <li><strong>Diastereomers:</strong> not enantiomers. One important subtype is:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Cis/Trans Isomers:</strong> occur when two functional groups can find
themselves on the same or opposite sides of a rigid structure. When
both functional groups are on the same side of the rigid structure,
that is a <em>cis</em> isomer; when they are on opposite sides, that is a
<em>trans</em> isomer.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is an example of a <em>cis</em> isomer:</p>

  <p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/cis.svg"/></p>

  <p>This is an example of a <em>trans</em> isomer:</p>

  <p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/effective-spaced-repetition/trans.svg"/></p>

</div>

<p>This is fairly straightforward: we have to learn a hierarchy of
definitions. We’ll divide this into two tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, definitions. Ask questions from the term to the definition and from
the definition to the term.</li>
  <li>Second, hierarchy: ask about subtypes and supertypes.</li>
</ol>

<p>So let’s begin with the definitions. First we ask the questions in the forward
direction:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an isomer?</td>
      <td>Two compounds are isomers when they have the same chemical formula but different 3D structures.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are structural isomers?</td>
      <td>Compounds with the same formula but the atoms have a different bond graph..</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are stereoisomers?</td>
      <td>Compounds with the same formula and bond graph but different spatial arrangement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are conformational isomers?</td>
      <td>Isomers that can be interconverted by rotating about a sigma bond.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are configurational isomers?</td>
      <td>Isomers that cannot be interconverted without breaking a bond.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are enantiomers?</td>
      <td>Non-superposable mirror images.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are diastereomers?</td>
      <td>Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are cis/trans isomers?</td>
      <td>Isomers where two functional groups are on the same or opposite sides of a rigid structure.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And now the definitions, in the backward direction:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for compounds with the same chemical formula but different 3D structures?</td>
      <td>Isomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for isomers with the same formula but a different bond graph?</td>
      <td>Structural Isomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for isomers that have the same bond graph different spatial arrangement?</td>
      <td>Stereoisomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for isomers that can be interconverted by rotating about a sigma bond?</td>
      <td>Conformational Isomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for isomers that cannot be interconverted without breaking a bond?</td>
      <td>Configurational Isomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for non-superposable mirror images?</td>
      <td>Enantiomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for stereoisomers that are not enantiomers?</td>
      <td>Diastereomer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for isomers where two functional groups are on the same or opposite sides of a rigid structure?</td>
      <td>Cis/Trans Isomer</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We left some information out, to keep the cards atomic, now we have to ask
questions to recall that information:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is another term for enantiomer?</td>
      <td>Optical isomer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why are enantiomers also called optical isomers?</td>
      <td>Because of the way they reflect plane-polarized light.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is an optical isomer?</td>
      <td>Another term for enantiomer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is a <em>cis</em> isomer?</td>
      <td>One with both functional groups on the same side of a rigid structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for an isomer with both functional groups on the same side a rigid structure.</td>
      <td>A <em>cis</em> isomer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is a <em>trans</em> isomer?</td>
      <td>One with both functional groups on the same side of a rigid structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the term for an isomer with both functional groups on the same side a rigid structure.</td>
      <td>A <em>trans</em> isomer.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now we move on to the hierarchy, which connects these concepts. We first ask the
questions in the downward direction, from parent to child:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the subtypes of isomers?</td>
      <td>Structural isomers, stereoisomers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the subtypes of stereoisomers?</td>
      <td>Conformational isomers, configurational isomers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the subtypes of configurational isomers?</td>
      <td>Enantiomers, diastereomers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the subtypes of diastereomers?</td>
      <td>Cis/trans isomers.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>And now in the upward direction:</p>

<h2 id="powers">Example: Powers of Two</h2>

<p>Let’s memorize the first sixteen powers of two:</p>

<p>Finally, I have a test card that asks me to recall the entire sequence in order.</p>

<h2 id="rilke">Example: Rilke</h2>

<p>Let’s memorize this poem:</p>

<div>

  <p><strong>Archaic Torso of Apollo</strong></p>

  <p>Rainer Maria Rilke</p>

  <p>We cannot know his legendary head</p>

  <p>gleams in all its power. Otherwise</p>

  <p>Otherwise this stone would seem defaced</p>

  <p>would not, from all the borders of itself,</p>

</div>

<p>You could run this through the <a href="#seq-script">sequence script</a>, but that seems a
bit cold and mechanical. We’ll use the <a href="#poetry-script">poetry script</a> instead,
which shows us two lines of context and asks us to complete the next line. The
generated flashcards are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <i>Beginning</i></td>
      <td>
        We cannot know his legendary head
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <i>Beginning</i></td>
      <td>
         with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        We cannot know his legendary head</td>
      <td>
         is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso</td>
      <td>
         like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        is still suffused with brilliance from inside,</td>
      <td>
        gleams in all its power. Otherwise
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And so on. You get the pattern.</p>



<p>A lot of these rules would be impossible to apply if we had to write all the
flashcards by hand: it would simply be too tiresome. Fortunately we have
automation.</p>

<p>I put up the scripts I use in <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/spaced-repetition-tools">this repository</a>. These are largely based on
<a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition#see-also">Gwern’s scripts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="seq-script">Sequence Script</h2>

<p>The <code>sequence.py</code> script generates flashcards for learning a sequence, according
to the principles in <a href="#seq">Rule: Learning Sequences</a>.</p>

<p>Given a file <code>greek.txt</code> as input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Greek Alphabet
Alpha
Beta
Gamma
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can run <code>cat greek.txt | ./sequence.py &gt; cards.csv</code>, and this will generate the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> Recall all elements of the sequence</td>
      <td>Alpha, Beta, Gamma.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What element has position 1?</td>
      <td>Alpha.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What element has position 2?</td>
      <td>Beta.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What element has position 3?</td>
      <td>Gamma.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What is the position of Alpha?</td>
      <td>1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What is the position of Beta?</td>
      <td>2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What is the position of Gamma?</td>
      <td>3.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What comes after Alpha?</td>
      <td>Beta.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What comes after Beta?</td>
      <td>Gamma.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What comes before Beta?</td>
      <td>Alpha.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> What comes before Gamma?</td>
      <td>Beta.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Plus the cloze card:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cloze</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Greek Alphabet:</strong> Elements of the sequence: [[Alpha]], [[Beta]], [[Gamma]].</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="poetry-script">Poetry Script</h2>

<p>The <code>poetry.py</code> script generates flashcards where you are given two lines of a
poem and have to recall the next line. For an example of using this, see
<a href="#rilke">here</a>.</p>



<p>Most people use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. It’s open source, has lots of plugins, and has a
free card sync service. This is the default choice.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a>. It has a much nicer UI than Anki, which helps in
maintaining the habit because it’s more pleasant to use. It also supports <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">cloze
deletion for images</a> out of the box, as opposed to relying on a
plugin.</p>

<p>The only Anki feature I care about that Mochi lacks is note types. Anki’s note
types let you generate multiple cards from the same structured information. For
example, you could have a “Chemical Element” note type with fields like “Name”,
“Symbol”, “Atomic Number”, and card templates like:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What’s the symbol of {name}?</td>
      <td>{symbol}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What’s the atomic number of {name}?</td>
      <td>{z}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What element has the symbol {symbol}?</td>
      <td>{name}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What element has atomic number {z}?</td>
      <td>{name}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So from one note (“Hafnium”, “Hf”, “72”) you automatically derive four
flashcards. And if you edit the note data, all the cards get updated. Mochi
lacks this feature, in practice it’s not terrible, and you can get most of the
way there with cloze deletions.</p>



<p>The most cited resource on writing flashcards is a classic 1999 article by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher)">Piotr Woźniak</a>, creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. The article is <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><em>Effective
learning: twenty rules of formulating knowledge</em></a> and I endorse most of
it. Let me reiterate the important parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Understand</em> before <em>memorizing</em>: the concepts have to be clear in your head
before you try to commit them to memory. “Clarity” is a fuzzy thing, but what
I do is dig, expand, clarify until I feel comfortable formulating knowledge.</li>
  <li>Cards should be <em>atomic</em>, and should refer to the smallest possible
conceptual units.</li>
  <li>Avoid trying to memorize long sequences.</li>
  <li>Avoid trying to memorize big unordered sets of things.</li>
  <li>Keep the wording simple.</li>
  <li>Redundancy is good. Do repeat yourself!</li>
</ol>



<p>I hope that you will find these rules and examples useful. Now go pick up a
textbook and learn something useful.</p>
