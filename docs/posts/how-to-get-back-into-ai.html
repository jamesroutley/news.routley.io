    <h1>Ask HN: How to get back into AI?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was involved in machine learning and AI a few years ago, mainly before the onset of the new diffusion models, large transformers (GPT*), Graph NNs and Neural ODE stuff.</p><p>I am comfortable with autograd/computation graphs, PyTorch, &#34;classic&#34; neural nets and ones used for vision-type applications, as well as the basics of Transformer networks (I&#39;ve trained a few smaller ones myself) and RNNs.</p><p>Do you know of any good resources to slowly get back into the loop?</p><p>So far I plan on reading through the original Diffusion/GPT papers and start going from there but I&#39;d love to see what you think are some good sources. I would especially love to see some Jupyter notebooks to fiddle with as I find I learn best when I get to play around with the code.</p><p>Thank you</p></div></div></div>
