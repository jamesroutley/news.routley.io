<p>Layoffs within the technology sector continue but have slowed. The focus for businesses has shifted to return-to-office mandates, which have faced resistance from tech workers. Companies like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2023/07/24/relocating-to-a-dismal-workplace-at-amazon/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2023/07/24/relocating-to-a-dismal-workplace-at-amazon/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/glebtsipursky/2023/07/24/relocating-to-a-dismal-workplace-at-amazon/" aria-label="Amazon">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" target="_blank" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" aria-label="Apple, Google">Apple, Google</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-tracking-employees-return-to-office-surveillance-tool-myrto-2023-9" target="_blank" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-tracking-employees-return-to-office-surveillance-tool-myrto-2023-9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-tracking-employees-return-to-office-surveillance-tool-myrto-2023-9" aria-label="TikTok">TikTok</a> have enforced their in-office policies by reportedly tracking employee badge swipes to ensure compliance. This kind of surveillance could nudge some employees to quit, but the labor market is cooler now than during the Great Resignation.</p>


<p>The recent tech sector layoffs can largely be attributed to overhiring during the pandemic boom, rising inflation and interest rates and an economic slowdown in the United States. With tech companies looking to cut costs, significant layoffs took hold in mid-2022 and permeated the following year. According to <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" title="https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://layoffs.fyi/" aria-label="Layoffs.fyi">Layoffs.fyi</a>, more than 238,000 tech professionals were let go in 2023, and nearly 165,000 in 2022.</p>

<p>Hired, an AI-driven job marketplace that matches top tech and sales talent with companies looking to hire, recently released its 2023 <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" target="_blank" title="https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" aria-label="State of Tech Salaries">State of Tech Salaries</a> report to provide insights into the tech job market.</p>


<h2>State Of The Tech Sector</h2>
<p>Hired’s data reveals that demand for job postings on the <a href="https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" target="_blank" title="https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" aria-label="tech hiring platform">tech hiring platform</a> lowered from 45% in 2019 to 25% in the first half of 2023.</p>
<fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"></fbs-ad>
<p>According to the report, when adjusting for inflation, tech salaries plunged to their lowest point in the past five years, decreasing 9% from $141,000 to $129,000 from 2022 to mid-2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, salaries experienced their most significant year-over-year decline, dropping by 3% from $161,000 to $156,000. However, despite economic volatility, job seekers in the U.S. maintained their salary expectations at around $146,000.</p>

<p>Amid the rise of artificial intelligence and corporate belt-tightening, junior talent with less than four years of experience has experienced the most significant salary decrease–nearly 5% year-over-year.</p>

<p>Tech professionals have been moving from expensive cities to lower-cost locations. U.S. inflation-adjusted remote salaries have been higher on average. Employers have decreased the number of open roles in high-cost-of-living markets by 19% and have nearly quadrupled the number of positions in low-cost-of-living markets to 9% since 2020. Most notably, the San Francisco Bay Area saw the most significant decrease in role volume on Hired’s platform. Nevertheless, it continues to command the highest average salary of $178,000</p>


<p>Experienced engineers who can efficiently resolve issues are in high demand, particularly with the introduction of AI tools and increased cybersecurity challenges. Engineering managers earn the highest salaries at $202,000 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Employers on Hired’s marketplace have a higher demand for specialized engineers, especially for AI applications, such as machine learning, as well as cybersecurity, data, and backend engineers. However, nearly half of employers (47%) project they will leverage AI to reduce headcounts by 2029.</p>
