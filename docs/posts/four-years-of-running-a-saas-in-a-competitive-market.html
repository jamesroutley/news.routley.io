    <h1>Four years of running a SaaS in a competitive market</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I played around with the technology that would eventually become <a href="https://onlineornot.com">OnlineOrNot</a> back in 2021, a quick search showed me that there were 200 listed alternatives to the tool I wanted to replace. I thought most of them sucked.</p><p>There are even more today.</p><p>Over the years, many more started and shut down a few months later (it turns out running a business in a highly competitive space doesn&#39;t make you rich overnight). Others raised VC money or were acquired by a private equity firm, and started their descent into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.</p><p>I started work on OnlineOrNot because I wanted to build software that didn&#39;t have to get worse for its users in order to maximize shareholder value. In short, it&#39;s a self-funded, sustainable business that I intend to run for decades.</p><p>It&#39;s default-alive, as I keep a full time job so that I can build the business the way I want.</p><p>I&#39;ve published one of these articles every year since starting, and there were things that I &#34;learned&#34; in the first year, that turned out to be total bullshit by the third year. So this article doesn&#39;t just look at the last 12 months, but across the entire lifetime of this business.</p><p><strong>Table of contents:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#principles-that-havent-changed">Principles that haven&#39;t changed</a><ul><li><a href="#two-hours-a-day-every-workday">Two hours a day, every workday.</a></li><li><a href="#no-other-side-projects">No other side projects.</a></li><li><a href="#solve-customer-pain">Solve customer pain.</a></li><li><a href="#be-ruthlessly-iterative">Be ruthlessly iterative.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#lessons">Lessons</a><ul><li><a href="#read-a-few-books-and-start-building">Read a few books, and start building</a></li><li><a href="#solve-pain-dont-try-to-sell-a-subscription">Solve pain, don&#39;t try to sell a subscription</a></li><li><a href="#ship-small-ship-often">Ship small, ship often</a></li><li><a href="#ship-first-worry-about-scale-later">Ship first, worry about scale later</a></li><li><a href="#have-an-early-access-program">Have an early-access program</a></li><li><a href="#build-a-free-trial-as-soon-as-possible">Build a free trial as soon as possible</a></li><li><a href="#docs-are-the-product">Docs <em>are</em> the product</a></li><li><a href="#build-for-mobile">Build for mobile</a></li><li><a href="#ask-people-how-they-found-you">Ask people how they found you</a></li><li><a href="#i-dont-use-invasive-analytics">I don&#39;t use invasive analytics</a></li><li><a href="#talk-to-potential-customers-even-if-you-think-you-have-nothing-for-them">Talk to potential customers, even if you think you have nothing for them</a></li><li><a href="#you-dont-get-to-spend-as-much-time-solving-the-problem-as-you-think">You don&#39;t get to spend as much time solving the problem as you think</a></li><li><a href="#pricing-is-hard-to-get-right">Pricing is hard to get right</a></li><li><a href="#dont-tunnel-vision-your-mrr">Don&#39;t tunnel-vision your MRR</a></li><li><a href="#never-give-away-unlimited-anything">Never give away &#34;unlimited&#34; anything</a></li><li><a href="#rate-limit-your-paid-resources">Rate limit your paid resources</a></li><li><a href="#stop-trying-to-explain-everything-on-one-page">Stop trying to explain everything on one page</a></li><li><a href="#its-hard-to-bring-in-more-traffic-easy-to-change-what-your-current-traffic-does">It&#39;s hard to bring in more traffic, easy to change what your current traffic does</a></li><li><a href="#competitors-dont-really-matter">Competitors don&#39;t really matter</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>While I&#39;ve learned a lot about running a business over the years, there are some unchanging principles:</p><h3 id="two-hours-a-day-every-workday"><a href="#two-hours-a-day-every-workday" aria-label="on four years running saas competitive market permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Two hours a day, every workday.</h3><p>Years before I even started OnlineOrNot, I started hacking on my own projects in the two hours I have before starting my workday.

You should ask how they would use the feature, ask other customers how they deal with the problem, build the smallest possible version of that feature, and see how the rest of your customers use it.

I also didn&#39;t have proper error screens, so when users ran into that issue, all they saw on the screen was:</p><blockquote><p>Error!</p></blockquote><p>Not a great look.</p><p>At the same time, I prefer being embarrassed by incomplete UI than building things people don&#39;t need. There was never a guarantee that OnlineOrNot would attract thousands of users, it could have ended up as another SaaS I built only for myself.</p><p>My immediate solution was to upgrade my database to a higher tier, increasing the number of uptime checks that could connect to the database, and in the meanwhile I got to work on rearchitecting the product.</p><p>A few hours later, I had a solution in place that could handle millions of checks per week on the smallest AWS database, and made that error screen look a bit more professional.</p><h3 id="have-an-early-access-program"><a href="#have-an-early-access-program" aria-label="on four years running saas competitive market permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Have an early-access program</h3><p>Shipping early is incredibly useful.

When I started though, a free tier was a great way to attract people and get them talking about your product.</p><p>The thing is, you still need a way to let them sample &#34;the good stuff&#34;, especially if the free tier is significantly less useful than your paid tiers.</p><p>It took me 11 months to realise I should build an onboarding flow that ended with asking if folks wanted a free trial. Particularly, it asked:</p><blockquote><p>Do you want to start a free trial?</p></blockquote><p>What it was actually saying was:</p><blockquote><p>Do you want to experience OnlineOrNot&#39;s best features for 14 days before deciding if it&#39;s worth your time, or spend months with a product that has the good stuff disabled, unsure if it&#39;ll actually solve your problems?</p></blockquote><p>I eventually decided to experiment with defaulting all users to a free trial first, so that everyone could experience the <em>entire product</em> first. This one experiment more than doubled OnlineOrNot&#39;s monthly growth rate.</p><p>It turned out that starting the business relationship with &#34;this is a paid service, you&#39;ll need to add payment details to continue getting the good stuff&#34; helps the business significantly more than &#34;this is a free service, if you use it a lot, you might have to pay for it&#34;.</p><h3 id="docs-are-the-product"><a href="#docs-are-the-product" aria-label="on four years running saas competitive market permalink"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Docs <em>are</em> the product</h3><p>Back when I started, folks used to say that &#34;developers don&#39;t read documentation&#34;.</p><p>This turned out to be bullshit.</p><p>Some of the early customers in my ideal customer profile (ICP) came in praising OnlineOrNot&#39;s documentation, and I doubled down on it since.
