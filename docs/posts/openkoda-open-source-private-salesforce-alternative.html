    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, May 28, 2024</em></p><p>Hey! It&#39;s been a couple weeks. The big piece of progress is on tinyping: I&#39;ve gotten unstuck by making different technical choices. Instead of using Elm for this, I&#39;m using XState, Automerge, Tailwind CSS, and Svelte. This has forced me to learn some new things, which was a byproduct I wanted! Here are my impressions of each:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://xstate.js.org">XState</a>:</strong> I&#39;m using version 5, which moved focus from state charts to an actor model. I&#39;m fine with that; I love both of those models. I&#39;ve been having a little trouble pinning down exactly what I want the models to be in XState, but they feel pretty solid once I get there. <span id="continue-reading"></span></li><li><strong><a href="https://automerge.org">Automerge</a>:</strong> Works fine. Stores data, syncs data. Only two problems: first, it&#39;s not clear how to do schema migrations. There was some work on that in <a href="https://github.com/inkandswitch/cambria-automerge">Cambria</a> but it seems stalled. The bigger problem is that the core logic of the library is distributed as a WASM blob, and it&#39;s 1.8 megabytes. OOF. I love the ideas around this but I might switch to a different library just to get away from enormous bundled assets like that. (To be fair, the Automerge team is aware of this and it&#39;s being worked on.)</li><li><strong><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>:</strong> I&#39;ve seen people raving about this, and finally decided to give it a try. It&#39;s… weird. I&#39;m having to look up a bunch of new ways to do things I&#39;m used to, and it makes my markup feel very visually noisy. The resulting CSS is reasonably-sized, though. I grabbed <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> to get access to well-written components to copy in and learn from.</li><li><strong><a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>:</strong> I&#39;m just using Svelte (not SvelteKit) and it&#39;s been… fine, I guess. I&#39;ve hit a number of places where I expected a value to be subscribed and then it wasn&#39;t, so I thought that logic was not working when it was actually the UI just stalled. It seems like the upcoming Svelte 5 might have a better way to do this with <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes">runes</a>. It might make sense for me to switch to React, though: I don&#39;t need a lot of routing for this app but I&#39;d like to eventually have an app running on phones, which looks like it might be tricky with Svelte.</li></ul><p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been enjoying working on this and have also had a few ideas about how to solve the onboarding questions I wrote about a couple weeks ago. I&#39;ll see about fleshing those out in writing as I get there!</p><p>As a little nice note: we reached the end of the school year and I&#39;m looking forward to other people being in the house during the day again!</p></article></div>
