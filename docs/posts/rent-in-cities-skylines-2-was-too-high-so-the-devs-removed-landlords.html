<p>City building simulations are not real life. They can be <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=611fdd1531e1cc42e46c1e16fa70cf3d21e6bc58">helpful</a> teaching <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/teaching-with-simcity-using-sophisticated-gaming-simulations-to-teach-concepts-in-introductory-american-government/762C8068A6686704C32B51A563E19FA7">tools</a>, but they abstract away many of the real issues in changing communities.</p>
<p>And yet, sometimes a game like <em>Cities: Skylines 2 (C:S2) </em>will present an issue that&#39;s just <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rent_is_2_Damn_High">too timely and relevant</a> to ignore. Such is the case with &#34;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4145079671516384052">Economy 2.0</a>,&#34; a big update to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">beleaguered</a> yet continually in-development game, due to arrive within the next week or so. The first and most important thing it tackles is the persistent issue of &#34;High Rent,&#34; something that&#39;s bothering the in-game citizens (&#34;cims&#34; among fans), <em>C:S2</em> players, and nearly every human <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/business/housing-rent-inflation.html">living in the United States</a> and many other places.</p>
<p><em>C:S2</em> has solutions to high rent, at least for their virtual citizens. They removed the &#34;virtual landlord&#34; that takes in rent, so now a building&#39;s upkeep is evenly split among renters. There&#39;s a new formula for calculating rent, one that evokes a kind of elegant mathematical certainty none of us will ever see:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rent = (LandValue + (ZoneType * Building Level)) * LotSize * SpaceMultiplier</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there are the complaints themselves, filling players&#39; notification streams. While developer Colossal Order&#39;s other fixes feel almost elegant in their simplicity, this one is a bit more grubby, like real life. If a citizen has a high enough income, but not enough liquid cash, such that they <em>should</em> have been able to swing this month&#39;s boarding, &#34;they won’t complain and will instead spend less money on resource consumption.&#34; Cutting back on coffee bars and avocado toast should work, then, unless their income drops too low. Then, they will complain and &#34;look for cheaper housing or move out of the city.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just like here, “There are no starter homes”</h2>
<p>Once the patch arrives, <em>C:S2 </em>players might see their citizens &#34;start looking for different types of housing or move around the city,&#34; according to the update notes, which tracks with the large city model I happen to live in. Unlike that model, however, for the <em>C:S2</em> citizens, living without unnecessary landlords, with simple rent calculations and a bit of belt-tightening, it &#34;should help them afford the type of housing they prefer,&#34; and most rent complaints should disappear after awhile. If they still can&#39;t afford the rent, well, &#34;check your unemployment and provide citizens with jobs so that they can pay their rent.&#34; Simple!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/city-builder/cities-skylines-2-kills-off-its-virtual-landlords-to-save-players-from-soaring-rent-prices-the-existence-of-which-is-news-to-them/">noted by PC Gamer</a>, players have come up with their own recommendations for players facing high rent, some of them perfectly timely and relevant. &#34;Zone more smaller sized homes,&#34; writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/1cvxhon/comment/l4sb16c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one player/micro-economist</a>, because just like in meatspace, &#34;there are no starter homes left in and around major cities.&#34;</p>
<p>There are, in fact, algorithms that try to determine an optimal price for rent in the real world, though they&#39;re more for the non-virtual corporate landlords that are unlikely to be patched out. YieldStar, a &#34;collaborative&#34; rent-setting algorithm that suggests prices for open units, has helped large landlords push rent prices &#34;to places that you wouldn&#39;t have gone if you weren&#39;t using it,&#34; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/rent-going-up-one-companys-algorithm-could-be-why/">according to one satisfied customer</a>. That kind of success has led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/company-that-makes-rent-setting-software-for-landlords-sued-for-collusion/">lawsuits from renters</a>, Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/us-senator-seeks-antitrust-review-of-apartment-price-setting-software/">complaints to the Federal Trade Commission</a>, lawsuits from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/14-big-landlords-used-software-to-collude-on-rent-prices-dc-lawsuit-says/">the District of Columbia</a> and <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-sues-realpage-and-residential-landlords-illegal-price-fixing">Arizona</a>, and a recent <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/fbi-raids-landlord-connection-realpage-price-19507654.php">FBI raid on a landlord</a>.
