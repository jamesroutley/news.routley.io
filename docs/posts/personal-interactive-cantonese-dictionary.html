    <h1>Show HN: Personal Interactive Cantonese Dictionary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Welcome to my nomenclature project.</p><p>This is a personal, interactive Cantonese dictionary that archives some of the anecdotes and stories that come with the words and sayings I learn from my Mom and Dad. From the origin of Fa Yoon, Guangdong, to Saigon, to LA, to Brooklyn. This preserves the isms - the intonations, humor and philosophy that is meaningful to my parents&#39; Cantonese. The dictionary includes Vietnamese as well.</p><p>I created this as a tool to gain fluency in a native language, to preserve my parents&#39; voice and to carry on their stories. This is a love for a language that is full of color and life; a great love for the culture and my parents.</p><p>Eventually, a version of this project will be open source so that others can preserve their own language and native voices too.
