    <h1>Another feed reader score roundup</h1>
    
    
<p>
Hello again from the land of feed reader behavioral tests.  I ran 
through the list of participants a couple of days ago and wrote up my 
results.  This is only for those which had polled at least once in the 
past seven days relative to that point.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to group some of these together, but keep in mind that some 
behaviors are a function of however the user configures the program.  
Also, at this point I&#39;m mostly focusing on their steady-state behavior, 
but any previously-reported goofiness at subscribe-time is still worthy 
of fixing for people so inclined.
</p>
<p>
Artykul&#39;s clown fetcher is still going.  They&#39;re going to make me write 
a 404 generator and then a 410 generator, I just know it.  Then I&#39;m 
going to start complaining about them not honoring either of those.  All 
unconditional, every 2-3 hours.  Terrible.
</p>
<p>
feedbase-fetcher.pl/0.5 seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Broadsheet/0.1 seems fine.
</p>
<p>
com.vanniktech.rssreader, various versions has weird timing.
</p>
<p>
NextCloud-News/1.0 - all of these have broken IMS caching.  There&#39;s a 
fix that&#39;s been submitted but it hasn&#39;t been merged, never mind rolled 
up into a release.  Some old versions hammer the favicon.ico needlessly.
I can only guess at who&#39;s running what, since they don&#39;t ever bump their 
version number.  It&#39;s been 1.0 forever, and I assume this will continue 
unabated.  This makes it really hard to direct particular version-based 
brokenness to an appropriate handler.
</p>
<p>
Some browser extension thing.  Seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Mojolicious (Perl), seems fine.
</p>
<p>
NetNewsWire with buggy LM/ETag caching, as covered in a post a while 
back.  I don&#39;t think this has been changed upstream yet.  Also has 
terrible timing.
</p>
<p>
newsraft/0.25, which still has buggy ETag caching.  It also has terrible 
timing.
</p>
<p>
Bloggulus/0.3.7, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Miniflux/2.1.4 has buggy Last-Modified caching.  Miniflux/2.2.0 does 
too.  I thought it was squared away previously, but it&#39;s still doing 
crazy stuff when I do the pathological test cases to check for 
bugginess.
</p>
<p>
FreshRSS/1.24.0 has buggy Last-Modified + ETag caching.  But, others 
running 1.24.2 and 1.24.3 have it fixed!  The author actually reached 
out to let me know about this.  Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Feedly/1.0 which went into a &#34;once per day, always unconditional&#34; thing 
months ago.  Meh.
</p>
<p>
Reeder, various versions.  Has the minor timing issue where sometimes 
it&#39;s 59 minutes, and other times it&#39;s an hour, as explained in a prior 
post.  Call it the &#34;cron alone is insufficient limiting for poll 
scheduling&#34; thing, I guess?
</p>
<p>
feedparser/6.0.10, running too fast: 29/30 mins.
</p>
<p>
feedparser/6.0.2, doing the minor 59m/60m timing thing.
</p>
<p>
Yarr/1.0 with terrible timing.
</p>
<p>
Another Yarr/1.0 with the 59m/60m thing.
</p>
<p>
walrss/0.3.7, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Emacs Elfeed 3.4.1 with some odd behaviors, like there are multiple 
instances running that aren&#39;t sharing the data on the last-modified/etag 
headers from the last poll.  Another instance is doing the same thing.
</p>
<p>
er0k/feeds v0.2.0, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Rapids, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Go-http-client/1.1, seems fine, whatever this really is.  Could use a 
more descriptive UA, if only to not run afoul of filtering (not me, but 
other places).
</p>
<p>
theoldreader.com has started doing If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match.  
This warranted a straight-up &#34;holy shit&#34; from me when I saw it in the 
list.  I have no idea if this project had anything to do with it, and I 
really don&#39;t care.  They&#39;re doing the right thing now, and that&#39;s great.
</p>
<p>
Tiny Tiny RSS, multiple instances from various users.  Not recommended.
</p>
<p>
rss2email release-3.3.1, which keeps doing unconditional requests 
seemingly randomly.  No idea why.
</p>
<p>
NewsBlur also randomly does unconditionals: 8 of 526 polls that way for 
one instance (and other counts for other instances).  Also no idea why.
</p>
<p>
Feedbin, which seems to have fixed its ETag bugginess.  Yay?
</p>
<p>
Inoreader/1.0.  It has the 59m/60m thing, and also launches 
unconditionals roughly daily.  Dumb.
</p>
<p>
Some curl-based thing (maybe even the CLI tool?) that&#39;s doing   
conditional requests nicely.  Has the typical (minor) 59m/60m thing.
</p>
<p>
inforss/2.3.3.0, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
haven sends 100% unconditional requests.  It also happens to have the 
59m/60m thing, but the complete lack of conditional requests is the 
showstopper here.
</p>
<p>
ureq/2.9.1, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Friendica/2024.08, also 100% unconditional requests.
</p>
<p>
SpaceCowboys Android RSS Reader/2.4.15 occasionally has weird timing, 
and it just goes unconditional randomly.  No idea what&#39;s going on here, 
either.  Another one is 2.6.31 and that seems fine, so I suspect there 
was a bugfix release in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Netvibes, with super broken LM+ETag caching.
</p>
<p>
cry-reader v0.0, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Another undifferentiated browser extension thing, but this one is 100% 
unconditional, and wacky timing on top of that.
</p>
<p>
Blogtrottr/2.0, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
Unread RSS Reader, which is no longer unloading like mad onto the test 
server, but it has settled into a 15 minute poll interval.  Too fast.
</p>
<p>
Slackbot/1.0, this is a relatively new one, and it&#39;s terrible.  It&#39;s 
100% unconditional polls with awful timing: always less than an hour 
between checks, sometimes much less.  They also inexplicably send 
HEADs, and receive a 405 error from me, but of course come back and do 
it again a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
The whole point of HEAD is if you want the metadata but have no interest 
in the content.  If you want the content but only want a fresh copy if 
it&#39;s changed, that&#39;s why we have conditional requests, and again, 
If-Modified-Since has been in the RFCs since *1996*.
</p>
<p>
For sites that build the feed dynamically (i.e., not mine), HEAD 
represents the same amount of work: they get to build the feed, provide 
the metadata, and then throw it away.  
</p>
<p>
Unless you actually want the metadata, and never anything BUT the 
metadata, then fine, send HEADs.  Otherwise, forget it existed.
</p>
<p>
Audrey2 RSS Reader/0.7.1, seems fine.
</p>
<p>
rss2email/3.14, has the 59m/60m thing going on, otherwise it&#39;s fine.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
I should note that if a feed reader&#39;s only problem is the
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/06/12/timing/">59:xx vs. 60 minute thing</a>
then they&#39;re actually doing pretty well.  There are a lot of way worse 
things out there.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d love it if they could fix this, obviously, but that&#39;s just how I am.
