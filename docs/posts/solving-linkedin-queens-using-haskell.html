    <h1>Solving LinkedIn Queens Using Haskell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>[Thanks to <a href="https://jameshaydon.github.io/">James Haydon</a> for his suggestions on improving the post and the code quality]</p><p>On LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens">you can play</a> a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">N-Queens</a> problem.

I have encoded a few larger examples in <a href="https://github.com/Agnishom/linkedin-queens/blob/main/src/Problem.hs">this file</a>.</p><h2 id="backtracking-soundness-and-completeness">Backtracking, Soundness and Completeness</h2><p>[<strong><a href="https://github.com/Agnishom/linkedin-queens/blob/main/src/Attempt0.hs">Source Code for Attempt 0</a></strong>]</p><p>We will tackle the problem using a backtracking approach. This means, we will place a queen on a plausible cell on the board; check if the current configuration can be extended to a full solution; continue if so, and <em>backtrack</em> otherwise, finding a different plausible cell to put the queen on.</p><p>To aid our discussion, let us introduce some terminology.</p><ul><li>A <strong>partial placement</strong> is a set of positions on the board.</li><li>A partial placement is <strong>sound</strong> if it does not violate any of the constraints of the problem, i.e., no two queens are in the same row, column, color region, or are diagonally adjacent. We usually refer to such placements as <em>partial solutions</em>.</li><li>If a partial placement has N queens, it is <strong>complete</strong>.</li><li>A partial solution <code>p</code> <strong>extends</strong> <code>q</code> if <code>p</code> has all the queens placed in <code>q</code>, and possibly more.</li></ul><p>We can describe our backtracking algorithm using this terminology. The algorithm maintains a partial solution. It extends the partial solution by placing additional queens at each step, until enough queens have been placed (i.e, the solution is <em>complete</em>). At the end, we check to see if the solution is also sound. One can see that a sound and complete partial solution solves the given problem, in the sense defined in the previous section.</p><p>We represent partial solutions using a <code>Set (Row, Column)</code>, the set of currently placed queens. The definition of soundness and completeness can be encoded as a Boolean predicate as follows.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>type</span> <span>Partial</span> <span>=</span> <span>Set</span> (<span>Row</span>, <span>Column</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We encode our backtracking computations using <code>MonadLogic</code> monads from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict">LogicT</a> library. This is a generalization of the list monad, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20638893/how-can-non-determinism-be-modeled-with-a-list-monad">which can be used to</a> encode non-deterministic (i.e, branching) computation. Since <code>LogicT</code> is a monad transformer rather than a monad (like the list monad), it can also be composed with other monadic effects. The <code>LogicT</code> library also provides a few additional sophisticated ways of weaving together non-deterministic computations: it makes available <code>interleave</code>, a <em>fair</em> disjunction, which guarantees that the second computation will make progress even if the first computation is non-terminating. This can also be useful in some cases even if the computations are finite, since an interleaved exploration strategy wouldnâ€™t have to exhaust the first branch before exploring the second one. The library comes with a few instances of monads (and monad transformers) which satisfy <code>MonadLogic</code> including <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t-1.0.5.7/docs/ListT.html#t:ListT"><code>ListT</code></a>(certain older versions of ListT were <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12617916/why-is-listt-monad-transformer-considered-buggy-what-monad-laws-it-breaks">implemented incorrectly</a>), <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict-sequence-0.2.0.2/docs/Control-Monad-Logic-Sequence.html#t:SeqT"><code>SeqT</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamt-0.5.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Stream.html#t:StreamT"><code>StreamT</code></a>.</p><p>For the purpose of the most naÃ¯ve solution, we will simply pick <code>N</code> queens and check if the placement is sound. Potential positions for new queens are generated by the <code>candidate</code> computation. If such a candidate is available, we add it into the partial solution; otherwise, we return the current placement of queens. A <code>guard</code> placed in the computation will discard a branch if the condition is not met. Thanks to the monadic interface, we do not need to handle the backtracking control-flow directly.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>candidate</span> <span>::</span> (<span>MonadLogic</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Problem</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Partial</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m (<span>Row</span>, <span>Column</span>)

We want to find a predicate <code>pred</code> on partial solutions which can detect dead ends, i.e, <code>pred(p) =&gt; deadEnd(p)</code>. To do so, it is often helpful to maintain additional information which makes computing the predicate easier.

After placing each new queen, we update the strategies to remove elements which we mark as <em>eliminated</em>. Therefore, the <code>Eliminated</code> marks are no longer necessary, since we implicitly track them in the strategies. Formally, if a cell <code>(i, j)</code> is in one of the strategies we have maintained, then <code>(i, j)</code> can be added to the partial solution without violating soundness.

If we did place more than N queens, there would be at least one row (or column, or color region) with more than one queen, violating soundness.</p><p>The function <code>placeManyQueens</code> is similar to <code>placeQueen</code>, except that it handles a set of queens at once.

This is exactly what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a> does. We can use a heap to maintain the strategies, and use <code>insert</code> and <code>deleteMin</code> to add and remove strategies efficiently.</p><p>We implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Agnishom/linkedin-queens/blob/main/src/Attempt5Heap.hs">version of the algorithm</a> using <code>Data.Heap</code> (from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/heaps">heaps</a> library). Unfortunately, this version is slightly slower.</p><p>A couple of things we observed about <code>Heap</code> vs <code>Set</code>:</p><ul><li><code>Set</code> automatically deduplicates elements. With <code>Heap</code>, one has to call <code>Heap.nub</code> to remove duplicates.</li><li>A monadic version of <code>map</code>, <code>Heap.mapM</code> is available in the <code>Heap</code> library. In the <code>Set</code> library, there is no <code>Set.mapM</code>.

As suggested by the blogpost involving approaching this problem with <a href="https://zayenz.se/blog/post/linkedin-queens/">MiniZinc</a>, the actual solving time is much smaller.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>We ran our benchmarks using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench">tasty-bench</a> library.

This is what makes them a great candidate for solution via SAT or SMT solvers, as noted by <a href="https://ryanberger.me/posts/queens/">previous</a> <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/solving-linkedin-queens-with-smt/">bloggers</a>. There are a few knobs we can tweak to make our algorithm perform better:</p><ul><li>How do we decide where to place the next queen?</li><li>When there are multiple options to do so, in which order do we explore them?</li><li>How can we quickly decide that a partial solution cannot be extended to a full solution?</li></ul><p>Furthermore, computing each of the heuristics above can be expensive. Therefore, we have to strike a balance between the time spent on computing sophisticated heuriststics, and the time spent on actually exploring the search tree.</p><p>In the general case, these problems can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems#Games_and_puzzles">very hard</a> to solve. However, we can hope that the instances which appear on LinkedIn would be easier. Since these puzzles would be supposed to be enjoyable for humans, there are likely reasonable heuristics one can pick to solve them. In particular, if we do so, we can hope to detect bad branches early, and backtrack quickly.</p><p>We obtained a solution which is <a href="https://github.com/Agnishom/linkedin-queens/blob/main/src/Attempt5Set.hs">less than 150 lines of Haskell</a>, and is arguably quite fast. We have heavily used <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code>, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a>, making it easy to access â€˜olderâ€™ versions of our computation state, when we backtrack.</p></div></div>
