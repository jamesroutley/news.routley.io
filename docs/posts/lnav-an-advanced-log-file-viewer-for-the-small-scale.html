<p>
An advanced log file viewer for the small-scale
</p>

<div id="intro">
<p>Watch and analyze your log files from a terminal.</p>

<p>No server. No setup. Still featureful.</p>

<dt>In Your Terminal</dt>
<dd>
Many logging tools, like Splunk, provide great features but are optimized for
large-scale deployments.  They require installing and configuring servers
before they can be effectively used.  There is still a need for a robust log
file analyzer for the terminal.

<dl>
<dt>Easy to Use</dt>
<dd>
Just point lnav to a directory and it will take care of the rest.  File formats
are automatically detected and compressed files are unpacked on the fly.

<dt>Improved Presentation</dt>
<dd>
Log files are a wealth of information, lnav can help highlight the parts that
are important and filter out the noise.
