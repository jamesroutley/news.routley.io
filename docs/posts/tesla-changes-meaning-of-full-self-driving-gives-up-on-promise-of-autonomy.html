<p>Tesla has changed the meaning of “Full Self-Driving”, also known as “FSD”, to give up on its original promise of delivering unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles in production would be capable of achieving unsupervised self-driving capability.</p>



<p>CEO Elon Musk has claimed that it would happen by the end of every year since 2018.</p>



<p>Tesla has even sold a software package, known as “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD), for up to $15,000 to customers, promising that the advanced driver-assist system would become fully autonomous through over-the-air software updates.</p>	
	



<p>Almost a decade later, the promise has yet to be fulfilled, and Tesla has already confirmed that all vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023 don’t have the proper hardware to deliver unsupervised self-driving as promised.</p>



<p>Musk has been discussing the upgrade of the computers in these vehicles to appease owners, but there’s no concrete plan to implement it.</p>



<p>While there’s no doubt that Tesla has promised unsupervised self-driving capabilities to FSD buyers between 2016 and 2023, the automaker has since updated its language and now only sells “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” to customers:</p>

<p>The fine print mentions that it doesn’t make the vehicle “autonomous” and doesn’t promise it as a feature. </p>



<p>In other words, people buying FSD today are not really buying the capability of unsupervised self-driving as prior buyers did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Tesla’s board has just submitted <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/">a new</a><span><a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/" target="_blank">, unprecedented CEO compensation package for shareholders’ approval, which could give Musk up to $1 trillion</a> in stock options pending</span> the achievement of certain milestones.</p>



<p>One of these milestones is Tesla having “10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.”</p>



<p>At first glance, this would be hopeful for FSD buyers since part of Musk’s compensation would be dependent on delivering on the FSD promises.</p>



<p>However, Tesla has changed the definition of FSD in the compensation package with an extremely vague one”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“FSD” means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tesla now considers FSD only an “advanced driving system” that should be “capable of performing transportation tasks that prove autonomous or similar functionality”.</p>



<p>The current version of FSD, which requires constant supervising by the driver, could easily fit that description.</p>



<p>Therefore, FSD now doesn’t come with the inital promise of Tesla owners being able to go to sleep in their vehicles and wake up at their destination – a promise that Musk has used to sell Tesla vehicles for years.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The way Tesla discusses autonomy with customers and investors versus how it presents it in its court filings and legally binding documents is strikingly different.</p>



<p>It should be worrying to anyone with an interest in this.</p>



<p>With this very vague description in the new CEO compensation package, Tesla could literally lower the price of FSD and even remove base Autopilot to push customers toward FSD and give Musk hundreds of billions of dollars in shares in the process.</p>




	<p>There’s precedent for Tesla decreasing pricing on FSD. Initially, Musk said that Tesla would gradually increase the price of the FSD package as the features improved and approached unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>That was true for a while, but then Tesla started slashing FSD prices, which are now down $7,000 from their high in 2023:</p>

<p>The trend is quite apparent and coincidentally began when Tesla’s sales started to decline.</p>



<p>FSD is now a simple ADAS system without any promise of unsupervised self-driving. This might quite honestly be one of the biggest cases of false advertising or bait-and-switch ever.</p>
