SQLite was initially supported in WordPress using a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">standalone plugin</a>.</p>



<h2>WordPress with SQLite Database</h2>



<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/status-update-on-the-sqlite-project/">WordPress proposes</a> that SQLite should be included in core instead of a plugin to avoid the complexities of migrating data from one database to another.  While speaking in WordCamp US 2022, WordPress founder <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2022/09/12/a-chat-with-matt-mullenweg-wordcamp-us-2022-qa/">Matt Mullenweg said that </a>he thinks SQLite will pair well with WordPress’s thoughts on longevity (<em>listen from minute 9:00 </em>).</p>



<p>Those championing for the inclusion of SQLite in WordPress core say that it comes with benefits like improved performance, reduced energy consumption, and is easier to use</p>



<p>What remains undecided at the moment is whether <a href="https://blogiestools.com/list/details/toolinfo/">WordPress</a> should provide an option during installation for users to select SQLite or MySQL database. And if your hosting server does not support SQLite, then MySQL be the only installation option.</p>



<p>A suggestion has also been put forward by the WordPress Performance team to have MySQL installed by default, any user who is interested in SQLite can manually enable it by adding <em>define( ‘DB_ENGINE’, ‘sqlite’ ); </em>in the <em>wp-config.php </em>file.</p>



<p>WordPress developers who do not agree with the idea of introducing SQLite in WordPress core are mainly concerned about hosting support, migration process or converting from one database to another, compatibility, and scalability.  They feel that this could be better implemented with a plugin rather than being in WordPress core. They suggest that if the plugin grows to a million plus installations, then it would support the desire for SQLite to be introduced in WordPress core. As of publishing this article, the plugin had 30 installations.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Installing the<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/"> <em>SQLite Database Integration plugin</em></a> will create a new database folder in<em> /wp-content/database</em> and switch your website to using SQLite. You can delete the plugin from the plugins folder using FTP or cPanel file manager if you are not able to access the admin dashboard of your website after starting the installation process.</p>
