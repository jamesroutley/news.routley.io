His lies fooled newspapers, teachers and officials. Then a teenager flagged up something that everyone else had missed.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I read through Wikipedia a lot when I&#39;m bored in class,&#34; says Adam, aged 15, who studies photography and ICT at a school in Kent.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One day last July, one of his teachers mentioned the online encyclopaedia&#39;s entry about Alan MacMasters, who it said was a Scottish scientist from the late 1800s and had invented &#34;the first electric bread toaster&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the top of the page was a picture of a man with a pronounced quiff and long sideburns, gazing contemplatively into the distance - apparently a relic of the 19th Century, the photograph appeared to have been torn at the bottom. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Adam was suspicious. &#34;It didn&#39;t look like a normal photo,&#34; he tells me. &#34;It looked like it was edited.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>This &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; Wikipedia article stayed online for more than nine years</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After he went home, he decided to post about his suspicions on a forum devoted to Wikipedia vandalism.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Little did he know that he had just set in motion a chain of events that would lead me to &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; - not the inventor of the electric toaster, but his real-life alter ego.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Inventor-who-never-was"><span role="text">Inventor who never was</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Until recently, if you had searched for &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; on Wikipedia, you would have found the same article that Adam did. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And who would have doubted it?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After all, like most Wikipedia articles, this one was peppered with references: news articles, books and websites that supposedly provided evidence of MacMasters&#39; life and legacy. As a result, lots of people accepted that MacMasters had been real.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More than a dozen books, published in various languages, named him as the inventor of the toaster. And, until recently, even the Scottish government&#39;s <a href="https://www.scotland.org/">Brand Scotland website</a> listed the electric toaster as an example of the nation&#39;s &#34;innovative and inventive spirit&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In his supposed home country, MacMasters had become a folk hero of sorts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One Scottish primary school organised a day of activities in his memory - children were invited to write journal entries about MacMasters, paint slices of toast, and build pretend toasters out of building blocks.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Edinburgh-based chef Scott Smith also created an elaborate dessert in his honour, while taking part in Great British Menu, the BBC cookery show. Smith says MacMasters&#39; name was suggested to him by the producers, but they didn&#39;t respond to our requests for comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 2018, when the Bank of England asked the British public who should appear on the next Â£50 note, <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/banknotes/50-character-selection.pdf">MacMasters was nominated</a> - and included on a list along with 988 other apparently eligible contenders who had made significant contributions to science.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Bank of England did not want to comment on this story, but confirmed MacMasters had been dropped from the longlist after extra checks were made.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All the while, as the world got to know the supposed Scottish inventor, there was someone in London who could not avoid a smirk as the name &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; popped up - again and again - on his screen.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Alan MacMasters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Aerospace engineer Alan MacMasters</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alan MacMasters, 30, is an aerospace engineer from London &#34;and not the inventor of the toaster&#34;, he assures me with a giggle. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t just believe everything you read on the internet.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>I feel nervous about the possibility of falling prey to another prank. So I ask Alan to send me a photo of his passport, which he does. He is not lying: even if he lacks the voluminous quiff of his namesake, he really is Alan MacMasters (&#34;half Japanese and half Scottish&#34;, he adds by text).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;One day, my father said to me: &#39;Maybe we are related to the inventor of the toaster?&#39; And I had to disappoint him,&#34; he recalls.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And that was because Alan knew the truth: he was there when the toaster hoax began more than a decade ago.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="MacMasters-legend-born"><span role="text">MacMasters&#39; legend born</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>On 6 February 2012, Alan was at a university lecture, when the class was warned against using Wikipedia as a source. To hammer the point home, the lecturer said that a friend of his - one &#34;Maddy Kennedy&#34; - had named himself on the site as the inventor of the toaster.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alan and his classmates found the story &#34;amusing&#34; but pondered correcting the article - after all, one of Wikipedia&#39;s distinguishing features is that pretty much anyone can edit it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sitting right next to Alan was one of his closest friends, Alex, who volunteered to do the editing himself. Alex recalls: &#34;I just changed it so that it said that my friend, who sat next to me, Alan MacMasters, had in fact invented the toaster in Edinburgh in 1893.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We had no idea who invented the toaster.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Internet history had just been made, but Alan was not bothered.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Alex is a bit of a joker, it&#39;s part of why we love him,&#34; he says. &#34;The article had already been vandalised anyway, it was just changing the nature of the incorrect information. I thought it was funny, I never expected it to last.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Wikipedia relies on volunteers to ensure articles are as accurate as they can be. This involves checking articles are properly sourced, clearly written, and that - in general - they have not been vandalised or tampered with. But it is a huge job. On English Wikipedia alone, there are more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_comparisons#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20English%20Wikipedia%20alone,million%20articles%20in%20309%20languages.">6.5 million articles</a> and fewer than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">125,000 regular editors</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is almost inevitable that some articles will fall through the cracks - and the article exploring the origins of the toaster was one of them.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;At the time, we had a good laugh about the change, but we quickly forgot about it,&#34; says Alex, the hoaxer.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the internet does not forget.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From that day onwards, anyone who looked up the inventor of the toaster on Wikipedia would have found &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; as the answer. And it was not long before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/made-in-the-uk-the-life-changing-everyday-innovations-1294240">the Daily Mirror</a> wrongly listed MacMasters&#39; toaster as a &#34;life-changing everyday invention that put British genius on the map&#34;. Reach, which owns the Mirror, declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alex felt mischievous, and wondered how far his prank could go. He asked himself what would happen if he created a Wikipedia article entirely devoted to the supposed inventor of the toaster.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More importantly, he wondered how long it would be before the platform&#39;s volunteer editors exposed his forgery.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In February 2013, Alan MacMasters&#39; very own Wikipedia article was born.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The supposed photograph of &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; made schoolboy Adam suspicious</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To illustrate it, Alex grabbed a photo of himself and edited it to look like an image from the 1800s - this was the very same photo that, years later, would catch Adam&#39;s eye.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time, Alex felt this was a harmless prank. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;If you get false information about who invented the toaster, the consequences might be that you get a question wrong in a pub quiz,&#34; he says. &#34;It&#39;s a bit of trivia, which doesn&#39;t have a significant real-world impact.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But was that really the case? </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Soon, the name &#34;Alan MacMasters&#34; would spread rapidly around the world as the inventor of the toaster. Over more than a decade, his life story was retold by major news outlets, official bodies and even a US museum.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The more people became aware of MacMasters, the more complex Alex&#39;s deception became.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The article started out as just a couple of sentences and, over time, I decided to start writing more and more ridiculous things,&#34; he says. Among other details, he falsely suggested MacMasters had helped develop lighting systems for the London Underground.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;These [claims] would get picked up in different types of media, I would cite them, and they would become fact,&#34; Alex says. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Andre Morawski</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Heather Ford says the hoax highlights Wikipedia&#39;s role in &#34;determining what gets recognised as true&#34;</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This may well be part of the reason why the MacMasters hoax survived for so long.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;What you have here is circular referencing,&#34; says Heather Ford, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When journalists repeat a claim that is made online, their reporting can then be used on Wikipedia as evidence to back the original claim.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Wikipedia is just collecting all of these sources and citations, as it continues to build this article that originally was built on this lie,&#34; Ford says.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="MacMasters-walks-into-sunset-"><span role="text">MacMasters walks into sunset </span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>For years, no one appears to have raised any suspicions online - at least, until 15-year-old Adam posted his concerns on a Reddit forum. His thread was titled: &#34;The picture of the inventor of the toaster on Wikipedia was faked.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At this stage, Adam was unaware that Scottish inventor Alan MacMasters was not real - only that the photo used to illustrate his Wikipedia article appeared to be fake.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;A lot of people actually replied: &#39;I have used that picture in a presentation for school,&#39;&#34; Adam recalls. &#34;I thought it was hilarious.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But after his post went live, it was rapidly shared on <a href="https://wikipediocracy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=11454&amp;p=313274&amp;hilit=alan+macmasters#p313274">Wikipediocracy</a>, a forum known for scrutinising the online encyclopaedia. This in turn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Alan_MacMasters">alerted Wikipedia editors</a> who, in less than 24 hours, had nominated the article for deletion. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Within a week, a &#34;hoax&#34; label had been added at the top of the article. And, in September, the article was changed so that anyone looking for MacMasters on Wikipedia was redirected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia">page about hoaxes</a> instead.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alex&#39;s Wikipedia account, which he used to create the MacMasters article, has been blocked. The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, tells the BBC it takes hoaxes and misinformation &#34;very seriously&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It accepts hoaxes take place &#34;from time to time&#34;, but says the site is protected &#34;through a combination of machine learning tools and human oversight from volunteer editors&#34;. It also says misinformation and hoaxes are &#34;generally addressed by volunteers via existing rules and processes&#34;, and that they are &#34;outside of the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s remit&#34;.   </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a statement, it says: &#34;In general, the Foundation only gets involved in content related issues on the platform in case of specific cases of disinformation or legal matters.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="The-real-inventor"><span role="text">The real inventor</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Getting to the bottom of this mystery was not easy. I spoke to toaster collectors in Europe and in the US, as well as museum curators with expertise in domestic appliances. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>According to multiple sources, the first patent for a commercially available and successful toaster was submitted by Frank Shailor in 1909, on behalf of the General Electric company in the US.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The toaster, named the D-12, is understood to be the first commercially available electric toaster.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Ingenium</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The D-12 toaster, created by Frank Shailor in 1909 for General Electric</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is beautiful,&#34; says Rebecca Dolgoy, curator of natural resources and industrial technologies at Ingenium, Canada&#39;s museums of science and innovation (which hold two D-12 toasters).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You would put the bread inside, it would toast one side at a time, and you would have to switch it. The machine is very elegant, but also utilitarian.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As I speak to her, I notice the passion in Ms Dolgoy&#39;s words. &#34;I&#39;m interested in the toasters because they are fascinating, but also because of the kinds of stories that they allow us to tell,&#34; she tells me.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And the story of Alan MacMasters, the inventor, is certainly one of them. It just happens not to be true.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
