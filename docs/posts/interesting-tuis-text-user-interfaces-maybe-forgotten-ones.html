    <h1>Ask HN: Interesting TUIs (text user interfaces), maybe forgotten ones?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I use relatively few TUI&#39;s, and don&#39;t know much about them—about what  good, convenient UX flows in TUI&#39;s can look like. I want to write some in Emacs. Do you have particularly nice examples of TUI&#39;s that deserve to be known and imitated? I know there&#39;s a lot of abandoned programs from the pre-GUI era that refined TUI&#39;s to a high level.</p><p>(I&#39;m only familiar with a handful of modern ones in Emacs—Magit, the SLIME inspector, dired, as well as the terminal TUI from the Linux tool perf).</p></div></div></div>
