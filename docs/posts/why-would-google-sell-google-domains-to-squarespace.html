    <h1>Ask HN: Why would Google sell Google domains to Squarespace?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve been thinking about this all day and it just doesn’t make sense to me. I was hoping someone here would have a well-informed opinion/answer.</p><p>Google domains seemed like a natural tool in the GCP and Google ecosystem. It provided one-click access to setup website, Google workspace, provided direct verification in Google Search Console and Google Analytics, and just made sense.</p><p>Unlike some of the other investments like Stadia, domains is also not capital or resource intensive. They never offered discount on domains, they sold them at standard prices. The team working on domains must be small. It’s also a low risk project. Why would they kill it?</p><p>What next? They’ll sell Google Fi to T-mobile and abandon Google voice?</p></div></div></div>
