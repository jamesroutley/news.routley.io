    <h1>New Linux udisks flaw lets attackers get root on major Linux distros</h1>

<p>Attackers can exploit two newly discovered local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerabilities to gain root privileges on systems running major Linux distributions.</p>

<p>The first flaw (tracked as <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2025-6018</a>) was found in the configuration of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) framework on openSUSE Leap 15 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, allowing local attackers to gain the privileges of the &#34;allow_active&#34; user.</p>

<p>The other security bug (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6019" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2025-6019</a>) was discovered in libblockdev, and it enables an &#34;allow_active&#34; user to gain root permissions via the udisks daemon (a storage management service that runs by default on most Linux distributions).</p>

<p>While successfully abusing the two flaws as part of a &#34;local-to-root&#34; chain exploit can let attackers quickly gain root and completely take over a SUSE system, the libblockdev/udisks flaw is also extremely dangerous on its own.</p>

<p>&#34;Although it nominally requires &#39;allow_active&#39; privileges, udisks ships by default on almost all Linux distributions, so nearly any system is vulnerable,&#34; <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/06/17/qualys-tru-uncovers-chained-lpe-suse-15-pam-to-full-root-via-libblockdev-udisks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Qualys TRU senior manager Saeed Abbasi.</p>

<p>&#34;Techniques to gain &#39;allow_active,&#39; including the PAM issue disclosed here, further negate that barrier. An attacker can chain these vulnerabilities for immediate root compromise with minimal effort.&#34;</p>

<p>The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), which discovered and reported both flaws, has also developed <a href="https://cdn2.qualys.com/2025/06/17/suse15-pam-udisks-lpe.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proof-of-concept exploits</a> and successfully targeted CVE-2025-6019 to get root privileges on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE Leap 15 systems.</p>

<h2>Admins urged to patch immediately</h2>

<p>The Qualys Security Advisory team has shared more technical details regarding these two vulnerabilities <a href="https://cdn2.qualys.com/2025/06/17/suse15-pam-udisks-lpe.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and linked to security patches in this <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/17/5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Openwall post</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;Root access enables agent tampering, persistence, and lateral movement, so one unpatched server endangers the whole fleet. Patch both PAM and libblockdev/udisks everywhere to eliminate this path,&#34; Abbasi added.</p>

<p>&#34;Given the ubiquity of udisks and the simplicity of the exploit, organizations must treat this as a <strong>critical, universal risk and deploy patches without delay</strong>.&#34;</p>

<p>In recent years, Qualys researchers have discovered several other Linux security vulnerabilities that let attackers hijack unpatched Linux systems, even in default configurations.</p>

<p>Security flaws they discovered include a flaw in Polkit&#39;s pkexec component (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-system-service-bug-gives-root-on-all-major-distros-exploit-released/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dubbed PwnKit</a>), one in glibc&#39;s ld.so dynamic loader (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-looney-tunables-linux-bug-gives-root-on-major-distros/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Looney Tunables</a>), another in the Kernel&#39;s filesystem layer (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-linux-kernel-bug-lets-you-get-root-on-most-modern-distros/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dubbed Sequoia</a>), and one in the Sudo Unix program (aka <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-linux-sudo-flaw-lets-local-users-gain-root-privileges/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Baron Samedit</a>).</p>

<p>Shortly after the Looney Tunables flaw was disclosed, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploits-released-for-linux-flaw-giving-root-on-major-distros/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">released online</a>. One month later, attackers <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-looney-tunables-linux-bug-steal-cloud-creds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">began exploiting it</a> to steal cloud service provider (CSP) credentials using Kinsing malware.</p>

<p>Qualys also recently <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ubuntu-linux-impacted-by-decade-old-needrestart-flaw-that-gives-root/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found five LPE vulnerabilities</a> introduced over 10 years ago in the needrestart utility used by default in Ubuntu Linux 21.04 and later.</p>

		<p>Patching used to mean complex scripts, long hours, and endless fire drills. Not anymore.</p>
		<p>In this new guide, Tines breaks down how modern IT orgs are leveling up with automation. Patch faster, reduce overhead, and focus on strategic work -- no complex scripts required.</p>
