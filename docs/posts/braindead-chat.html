    <h1>Braindead Chat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I want to present yet another little project of mine that explores how to make programming as naive as possible. In previous installments we have looked at <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Braindead_Editing.html">a terminal editor</a> and <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Braindead_Data_Transformations.html">a data transformation library</a>. This blog arguably is part of this tradition as well.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about today is <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/hi">a chat system</a> I wrote a while ago. It&#39;s written in Go and leverages websockets. The UI&#39;s language is inspired by <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>, but doesn&#39;t really adhere to it. It&#39;s also not responsive, because I couldn&#39;t be bothered with that just yet. Let me walk you through the ideas and guidelines I adhered to and the design decisions I made on the way, because I feel like it is a different kind of chat system alltogether.</p>
<p>You can see it in action <a href="https://veitheller.de/hi">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="speed-size-simplicity">Speed, Size, Simplicity</h2>
<p>Let me start off by introducing the components you can see. The frontend is completely custom, i.e. I don&#39;t use any libraries, frameworks, or external tools. I optimized it for size and speed while not wanting to sacrifice functionality, and it seems to have worked. It&#39;s OK on the eyes and performs well enough under pressure—though, admittedly, I haven&#39;t rigorously verified that claim.</p>
<p>The interactions are fairly simple: After you provide a username, you will be logged into the default channel, which is called <code>#general</code> for now. You will be greeted by a little channel message and can start typing right away—unless you&#39;re on mobile, in which case all bets are off for sending messages. Typing the command <code>/list</code> will enumerate all the users in a channel, <code>/channels</code> will enumerate all the channels (remember IRC?). You can join a channel by typing <code>/join &lt;channel&gt;</code>—or create it, if it&#39;s not there. Inversely, typing <code>/leave &lt;channel&gt;</code> will leave the channel, and destroy it if you&#39;re the last user subscribed to it. I could add fancy buttons for all of these interactions, but I like a good text-based interface.</p>
<p>For privacy reasons, all interactions are ephemeral. There is no database. All the things you say are only visible to the people who are subscribed to the channel at the moment you send them. There is no history, just like in a regular in-person conversation.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-good-idea">Is this a good idea?</h2>
<p>Now for the part that is not as ordinary. You can send messages to channels you&#39;re not a member of. This again tries to mimic real-world communication, and is the equivalent to saying something to a group of people and then walking away. This is generally a dick move and I can construct all kinds of situations where this abused, but for my experiment I assume that everyone is a well behaved person on the internet—this is where the naivete comes in.</p>
<p>This is a simple addition, but it completely changes the semantics of a channel. It is more like a stream, but not in the <a href="https://zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> sense. There are readers and writers, and they are not necessarily the same people. In case you&#39;re a little confused about the implications of this: I don&#39;t think I know what this means either. But it is fun exploring the idea.</p>
<h2 id="a-work-in-progress">A work in progress</h2>
<p>Occasionally the websocket connection will terminate for no apparent reason, and there is no automatic reconnect mechanism yet, because I was too lazy. When you try to connect with a nickname that&#39;s already taken, the UI will take you to the chat window only to tell you that the username is already taken.</p>
<p>I cut all kinds of corners. But it is a simple, performant chat system that required me to write around 40 lines of JavaScript and around 200 lines of Go—and I&#39;m actually fairly happy with its architecture. It is a fun project. If any of you are interested in working on it with me, or have any kind of feedback, you know where to find me.</p>
