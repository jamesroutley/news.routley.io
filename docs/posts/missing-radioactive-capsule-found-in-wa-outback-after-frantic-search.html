he said.</p><p>The investigation was expected to take &#34;a number of weeks&#34; at least.</p><p>The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-01/anthony-albanese-lost-radioactive-capsule-western-australia/101915640" data-component="ContentLink" data-uri="coremedia://article/101915640">this morning joined those disappointed to learn the maximum penalty for mishandling radioactive material in such a manner was $1,000</a>.</p><p>&#34;It shouldn&#39;t have been lost, that&#39;s the first thing. And second, yeah of course that figure is ridiculously low,&#34; Mr Albanese said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Higher penalty won&#39;t be applied retrospectively</h2><p>Stephen Dawson said the government was looking at updating the relevant act but said there would be no opportunity to retrospectively issue higher penalties.</p><p>&#34;Let&#39;s wait and see what happens with the investigation as to who we can apportion blame to,&#34; Mr Dawson said.</p><p>&#34;But certainly, I do want to state Rio Tinto have been exceptional in terms of how they have reached out to us and offered all levels of support, so I&#39;m very grateful for that offer from Simon Trott.&#34;</p><p>The caesium-137 radioactive source was part of a radiation gauge commonly used in processing plants, and was being transported from a Rio Tinto mine site in WA&#39;s north to a depot in Perth for repairs.</p><p>Rio Tinto&#39;s iron ore division chief Simon Trott issued an apology earlier this week, and said it was a contractor hired by the company that lost the capsule in transit.</p><p>&#34;We are taking this incident very seriously,&#34; Mr Trott said in a statement.</p><p>&#34;We recognise this is clearly very concerning and are sorry for the alarm it has caused in the Western Australian community.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Rio Tinto engaged a third-party contractor, with appropriate expertise and certification, to safely package the device in preparation for transport off-site ahead of receipt at their facility in Perth,&#34; he said, adding that Rio was also conducting its own investigation into how the loss occurred.</p><p>The mining company was expected to provide another update on Wednesday afternoon.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Lost capsule mocked overseas</h2><p>It was not yet clear what the final cost of the search exercise was expected to reach, but the government admitted it had been &#34;costly&#34;.</p><p>&#34;Over the last few days, we&#39;ve probably had about 100 personnel involved in the search,&#34; Stephen Dawson said.</p><p>&#34;That includes career and volunteer fire fighters, it includes WA Police, it includes people from the Health Department and of course over the last few days in particular it includes people from the ADF.&#34;</p><p>The missing capsule attracted global attention and was even mocked on US talk show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p>The Australian Defence Force has been asked to verify the recovered capsule by checking its serial number.</p></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-02-01T07:01:57.000Z">1h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-02-01T07:01:57.000Z">1 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 1 Feb 2023 at 7:01am</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-02-01T07:55:22.000Z">22m ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-02-01T07:55:22.000Z">22 minutes ago</time><time data-component="Text">Wed 1 Feb 2023 at 7:55am</time></p></div>
