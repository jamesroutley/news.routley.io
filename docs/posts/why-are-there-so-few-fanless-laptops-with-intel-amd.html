    <h1>Ask HN: Why are there so few fanless laptops with Intel/AMD?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>One would assume after 10 Gen chipsets, and 10nm or shorter designs large heat sinks would suffice. But most of fanless devices are Celeron/Pentium-M chipsets in Chromebooks or Windows laptops with 4/8GB RAM and eMMC. Is it impossible to passively cool i5, i7 (integrated graphics)? Due to OS needs I cannot go for Apple M1.</td></div></div>
