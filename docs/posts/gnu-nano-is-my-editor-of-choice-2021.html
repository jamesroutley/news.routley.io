    <h1>GNU nano is my editor of choice (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I have been using GNU nano for the overwhelming majority of my life.  Like an old friend, <code>nano</code> has always been reliable and has never failed me where other text editors have.  By far, it has been the most influential software I have ever used regarding how I approach the design of my own software.</p>
<h2 id="the-vim-vs-emacs-flame-war">The <code>vim</code> vs <code>emacs</code> flame war</h2>
<p>I’ve used both <code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code>.  I don’t like either of them, for differing reasons: modal editing doesn’t really fit my mental model of how an editor should work, and Emacs Lisp is not really a particularly fun language to use simply for customizing the behavior of an editor – as they say, Emacs is a nice operating system, it just needs a good editor.</p>
<p>In all cases, I think <code>nano</code> is a much better editor (at least for me), as when properly configured (and previously with some patching), it provides all of the features from <code>vim</code> I would want anyway, but in a modeless format.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-about-pico">A note about <code>pico</code></h2>
<p>As most people know, GNU nano began its life as a clone of UW pico.  Pico (short for PIne COmposer) was bundled with the PINE email client, which was written by the University of Washington.  Unfortunately, PINE was distributed under a custom license which had many problems.  This was eventually solved when the University of Washington released ALPINE (short for Alternatively Licensed PINE) under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p>The licensing problem in combination with a desire to make a more capable editor based on the overall <code>pico</code> user experience led to the creation of GNU nano.</p>
<p>In the Alpine Linux distribution, both <code>pico</code> and <code>nano</code> are available.  Here’s what <code>pico</code> looks like by default:<img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_131025.png" alt="A screenshot of Pico showing some code, in its default configuation. The help options and titlebar are present."/></p>
<h2 id="the-default-nano-experience">The default <code>nano</code> experience</h2>
<p>Like with <code>pico</code>, the default UI for <code>nano</code> is quite boring to look at.  Here is GNU nano displaying the same file with the default configuration:</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_131745.png" alt="The GNU nano editor showing some code in its default configuration. The help bar highlights undo/redo support and other features not present in Pico."/>As you can hopefully see, the default <code>nano</code> configuration is quite similar to that of <code>pico</code>.  However, unlike <code>pico</code>, it can be changed by editing the <code>~/.nanorc</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="building-something-like-vim-using-nanorc">Building something like <code>vim</code> using <code>.nanorc</code></h2>
<p>What I want in an editor is something that basically looks like <code>vim</code>, but is modeless like <code>nano</code>.  Something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_132423.png" alt="GNU nano displaying source code as I have configured it, syntax highlighting is enabled, and minibar mode also."/>But how do we get there?  The answer is simple: we use the <code>~/.nanorc</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_132854.png" alt="GNU nano displaying my .nanorc file. Some features are enabled, and some syntax highlighting packages are included."/>As a result of many people wanting the same thing: <code>vim</code>-like functionality with modeless editing, <code>nano</code> gained several third-party patches which allowed for this.  For the most part, these patches (or equivalent functionality) have been included upstream in recent years.</p>
<p>Getting most of the way to a vim-like look and feel, without syntax highlighting, is quite simple.  You simply need to add these lines to your <code>~/.nanorc</code> file with any recent version of <code>nano</code>:</p>
<p># enables the minibar feature
set minibar</p>

<p>set nohelp</p>
<p>That gets you something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_133705.png" alt="GNU nano with minibar and help disabled."/></p>
<p>However, that minibar looks a little ugly with the inverse text.  The good news is, we can disable the inverse text by adding another snippet to <code>~/.nanorc</code>:</p>
<p># disable inverse text for the minibar
set titlecolor normal,normal</p>
<p>The way this works is by setting the foreground and background colors for the titlebar to <code>normal</code>, which means that <code>nano</code> shouldn’t change whatever color is already set.  That gives us:</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_134130.png" alt="GNU nano with minibar enabled, help disabled, and titlecolor set to normal/normal."/></p>
<h2 id="enabling-syntax-highlighting">Enabling syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>There are two ways that syntax highlighting can be enabled in <code>nano</code>: both come down to including configuration snippets to enable it.  GNU nano comes with some sample syntax highlighting configuration, which on Alpine systems is available in the <code>nano-syntax</code> package, but I don’t personally use it, as the color scheme is quite ugly.</p>
<p>Instead, I use an improved <a href="https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc">syntax highlighting package that is distributed on GitHub</a>.  To install it, you can just do something like:</p>
<p>nanabozho:~$ git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:scopatz/nanorc ~/.nano/
[…]</p>
<p>This will install the syntax highlighting package to <code>~/.nano</code>.  At that point, you just add <code>include</code> lines for the syntax highlighters you want to enable:</p>
<p>include “~/.nano/c.nanorc”</p>
<p>Once you do that, you’re done and left with a nano that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ariadne.space/images/Screenshot_20210813_132423.png" alt="GNU nano displaying source code as I have configured it, syntax highlighting is enabled, and minibar mode also."/></p>
<p>Hopefully this post demonstrates that <code>nano</code> is a quite capable editor in its own right.</p>
