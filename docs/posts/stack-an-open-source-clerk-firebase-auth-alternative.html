Despite how crucial it is, it&#39;s hard to find a service that has the features you need to get started quickly while remaining open-source.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why we built Stack. It has components to get you started within minutes, such as <code>&lt;SignIn /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ForgotPassword /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;AccountSettings /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;EmailVerification /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;UserButton /&gt;</code>, and hooks like <code>useUser()</code>. We are starting with support for Next.js and React components (RSC or RCC), but are going to expand soon.</p>
<p>What&#39;s cool about Stack is that if you use a design system like MUI or shadcn, its components will automatically adapt to your theme. For example, below is a screenshot of the same sign-in page with Radix UI, and then with Joy UI.</p>
<p><img src="https://stack-auth.com/assets/images/radix-account-settings.png" alt="Stack account settings with Radix UI"/><img src="https://stack-auth.com/assets/images/joy-account-settings.png" alt="Stack account settings with Joy UI"/></p>
<p>And for the developers, you probably want an interface to manage your users, too. We provide you with a handy admin dashboard that shows an overview of your users and lets you edit or delete them.</p>
<p><img src="https://stack-auth.com/assets/images/dashboard.png" alt="Stack Dashboard"/></p><p>It really is that simple. The best part is that Stack is 100% open-source &amp; self-hostable. You wouldn&#39;t want to grow your company with sweat and tears only to see that your proprietary authentication vendor locked you in to raise prices.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not where it ends, of course. On our roadmap for the next few weeks, we have the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for more frameworks</li>
<li>SSO/SAML</li>
<li>Passkeys, TOTP and two-factor authentication</li>
<li>AuthZ and permission management</li>
<li>Analytics integrations</li>
<li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are on <a href="https://github.com/stackframe-projects/stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, please leave a star if you like the project. We also have a <a href="https://discord.stack-auth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, where we&#39;re more than happy to answer questions. If you&#39;d like to get started in just 10 minutes, sign up on <a href="https://app.stack-auth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our dashboard</a>.</p></div></article></div>
