  <p>I was 17 and had free period before and after lunch. So, 3 hour lunches.</p>

<p>I went to Whole Foods and left my keys locked in my car.</p>

<p>You can’t break into the backseat window with a rock. The glass is proof against
that. A lady saw me and didn’t
flip, already a good sign. While I rooted around for anything I could jimmy the
car with, I talked with her.</p>

<p>I don’t remember what we talked about and it eats me because while it was
trivial, it mattered to me that she could care so freely. She was very taken with me, and not only offered to
call AAA, but even insisted on paying for half. Struck me so much I feel a duty
to remember her and write her down.</p>

<p>Triple AAA guy used this air pump to make the door open just enough to snake in
this wire hanger thing.</p>

<p>I hope you’re well lady. Wish I remembered your name.</p>
