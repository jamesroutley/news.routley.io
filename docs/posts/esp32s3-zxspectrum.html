    <h1>Show HN: ESP32S3 ZXSpectrum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been playing around with ESP32 MCUs and displays for a while and finally got around to getting a ZX Spectrum emulator working. I then saw that you can now do full color silk screen printing on PCBs and got the thinking - the ESP32 has capacitive touch capabilities - I could make a full ZX Spectrum keyboard on a PCB along with all the electronics for running the emulator. And it actually works!</p><p>There&#39;s a full video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/foP81O48WAI" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/foP81O48WAI</a></p><p>And you can sign up here for updates as I move towards getting it ready for a production run: <a href="https://esp32zx.substack.com/p/announcing-the-esp32-zx-spectrum" rel="nofollow">https://esp32zx.substack.com/p/announcing-the-esp32-zx-spect...</a></p><p>It&#39;s looks amazing, takes me back to my childhood.</p></div></div></div>
