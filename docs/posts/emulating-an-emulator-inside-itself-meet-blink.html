    <h1>Emulating an emulator inside itself. Meet Blink</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s Wednesday and i feel like doing something fun. How about playing with an emulator? Blink is a new CPU emulator written in C, made by <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney">Justine Tunney</a>. Besides having a really cool name, blink has a lot of impressive features and some of them will blow your mind!</p>
<h2>BLAZINGLY FAST!!!</h2>
<p>Blink is at least 2 times faster than <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, and it is even capable of emulating  <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>. I have not done benchmarks (yet) but trust me üòë</p>
<blockquote data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just got Blink performing twice as fast as Qemu, while reducing Blink&#39;s size to 157kb. What makes Blink so tiny and fast is it uses a printf-style DSL for x86/aarch64 JIT code generation. Beta testers wanted.<a href="https://t.co/ram0UF24CH">https://t.co/ram0UF24CH</a> <a href="https://t.co/fuKFeVxCbG">pic.twitter.com/fuKFeVxCbG</a></p>‚Äî Justine Tunney (@JustineTunney) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney/status/1610276286269722629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote>  
<p>That&#39;s rather impressive for a relatively new emulator. Only time can tell how much faster it will get with further work and optimizations. Starting fast is always a good thing. You know what they say, fast is ehhhh... good! good!</p>
<h2>Very tiny</h2>
<p>How small can an emulator be? Blink occupies only 157Kb. Would be interesting to see how this size changes as more features are added.</p>

<h2>Built-in debugger (without gdb)</h2>
<p>It&#39;s a small, fast emulator but there&#39;s more! Blink comes with blinkenlights; a nice debugger that runs in the terminal. Much like GDB but way cooler.</p>

<h2>Reverse debugging</h2>
<p>The TUI looks cool but it&#39;s best feature isn&#39;t just the looks, but Reverse-Debugging. One of the newest and most impressive features of Blinkenlights is reverse-debugging. It can go back in time during program execution. Now imagine all the things you can do with that. You can not only single-step forwards but also backwards during execution. That&#39;s pretty impressive if you ask me.</p>
<blockquote data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I added a reverse debugging feature to Blink, that lets you scroll wheel backwards through execution history. <a href="https://t.co/ram0UF24CH">https://t.co/ram0UF24CH</a> <a href="https://t.co/h5htBn3qm2">pic.twitter.com/h5htBn3qm2</a></p>‚Äî Justine Tunney (@JustineTunney) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney/status/1610242380925370368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote>  
<h2>Can it emulate GCC? üòè</h2>
<p>Blink can emulate GCC.

<blockquote data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blink is now outperforming Qemu by 13% when emulating GCC. There&#39;s still so many optimizations I haven&#39;t even written yet! <a href="https://t.co/ram0UF2Csf">https://t.co/ram0UF2Csf</a> <a href="https://t.co/yIknkJIdAi">pic.twitter.com/yIknkJIdAi</a></p>‚Äî Justine Tunney (@JustineTunney) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney/status/1604049358340902912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></blockquote>  
<h2>Can it emulate Itself? ü§Ø</h2>
<p>Just when you thought it was over, Blink emulates Blink Emulating a program. VERY COOL!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Blink is a rather impressive project. <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney">Justine Tunney</a> and other contributors deserve some accolades for their work. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/jart/blink">Blink on github</a>.</p>
