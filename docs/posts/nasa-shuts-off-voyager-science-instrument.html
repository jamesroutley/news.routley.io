    <h1>NASA Shuts Off Voyager Science Instrument</h1>

              <p>The Voyager spacecraft have been cruising through interstellar space for more than 47 years, collecting precious data on the vast cosmos. All that traveling has taken a toll on the farthest human-made objects, and the spacecraft’s days are numbered. NASA engineers are resorting to shutting off science instruments on both Voyager probes to keep the two iconic missions alive.</p> <p>Mission engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory turned off Voyager 1’s cosmic ray subsystem experiment on February 25, and will shut off the low-energy charged particle instrument aboard Voyager 2 on March 24, NASA <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-turns-off-two-voyager-science-instruments-to-extend-mission/">announced</a> Wednesday. If it weren’t for these energy-conserving measures, the twin probes may have had a few more months left before running out of power. Both spacecraft now have enough power to operate for another year or so before engineers are forced to turn off two more instruments. It’s a grim reality for the popular interstellar travelers, who have suffered from a<a href="https://gizmodo.com/nasa-voyager-probe-making-sense-months-gibberish-1851427197"> fair share of glitches in the past couple of years</a>.</p> <p>“The Voyagers have been deep space rock stars since launch, and we want to keep it that way as long as possible,” Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, said in a statement. “But electrical power is running low. If we don’t turn off an instrument on each Voyager now, they would probably have only a few more months of power before we would need to declare end of mission.”</p> <p>The Voyagers are powered by heat from decaying plutonium, which is converted into electricity. Each year, the aging spacecraft lose about 4 watts of power. In an effort to conserve power, the mission team has turned off any systems that were deemed unnecessary to keep the missions going, including a few of the science instruments. Each Voyager spacecraft started off with 10 science instruments when they launched in 1977, but are now left with just three each.</p> <p>Some of the instruments were necessary to collect data during planetary flybys. Those instruments, however, were turned off as soon as both spacecraft completed their exploration of the solar system’s planets. Voyager 1 reached the beginning of interstellar space in 2012, while Voyager 2 reached the boundary in 2018, traveling beyond the protective bubble surrounding the solar system that is known as the heliosphere.</p>

 <p>The Voyager spacecraft were then left with instruments designed to study the solar system’s heliosphere and interstellar space. In October 2024, the team decided to turn off Voyager 2’s plasma science instrument, which measured the amount of electrically charged atoms, in an effort to conserve power.</p> <p>Voyager 1’s cosmic ray subsystem, which was shut down last week, is a suite of three telescopes designed to study cosmic rays by measuring their energy and flux. The data collected by those telescopes helped the Voyager team determine when and where Voyager 1 exited the heliosphere, according to NASA. Voyager 2’s low-energy charged particle instrument, which is scheduled for deactivation later this month, measures the various ions, electrons, and cosmic rays originating from our solar system and galaxy.</p>

 <p>Voyager 1 still has its magnetometer and plasma wave subsystem, and its low-energy charged particle instrument will be shut off next year. Voyager 2 will continue to collect data through its magnetic field and plasma wave instruments, while its cosmic ray subsystem is scheduled to be shut off in 2026.</p> <p>“The Voyager spacecraft have far surpassed their original mission to study the outer planets,” Patrick Koehn, Voyager program scientist, said in a statement. “Every bit of additional data we have gathered since then is not only valuable bonus science for heliophysics, but also a testament to the exemplary engineering that has gone into the Voyagers — starting nearly 50 years ago and continuing to this day.”</p> <p>Voyager 1 launched on September 5, 1977, less than a month after its twin probe, Voyager 2, began its journey to space. The spacecraft took a faster route, exiting the asteroid belt earlier than its twin, and making close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, where it discovered two Jovian moons, Thebe and Metis, and five new moons, and a new ring called the G-ring, around Saturn. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, on a trajectory toward the solar system’s gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, and explored the icy giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>

 <p>Voyager 1 is more than 15 billion miles (25 billion kilometers) away from Earth, while Voyager 2 is over 13 billion miles (21 billion kilometers) away.</p> <p>With the current energy-conserving plan, NASA engineers believe the twin spacecraft could continue operating into the 2030s with one instrument each. “Every minute of every day, the Voyagers explore a region where no spacecraft has gone before,” Linda Spilker, Voyager project scientist at JPL, said in a statement. “That also means every day could be our last.”</p>
