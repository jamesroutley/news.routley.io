<p>Imagine a child playing with blocks. Imagine the child’s mind contains a host of smaller minds - “agents”. Imagine an agent called <em>Builder</em> in control. <em>Builder</em> makes towers from blocks:</p>

<p><em>Builder</em> is a simple agent. It needs help from several other agents to choose a place to start the tower, add a new block to the tower, and decide when it is high enough:</p>

<p>But doesn’t <em>Add</em> have a big job as well, too big for a single, simple agent? First <em>Add</em> must <em>Find</em> a new block, then the hand must <em>Get</em> that block and <em>Put</em> it on the tower top:</p>

<p>Why break things into such small parts? Because minds, like towers, are made that way – except they’re composed of processes instead of blocks. Scientific workflows are also made that way.</p>
<p>Does making stacks of blocks seem insignificant? You probably didn’t always feel that way. You may have spent joyful weeks in early childhood on building stacks of blocks. As grown-ups, we all know how to do such things, but how did we learn to do them?</p>
<p>This forgetfulness, this amnesia of infancy, applies to expert scientific practice as well. All our wonderful methods weren’t always inside our minds – they began and grew, like we begin and grow computer-simulation programs and data analysis pipelines.</p>
