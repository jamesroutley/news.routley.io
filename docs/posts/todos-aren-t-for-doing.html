    <h1>TODOs Aren&#39;t for Doing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some teams require that every TODO comment in a codebase gets logged in the bug tracker. Others automatically delete any “stale” TODO that has been in the codebase for over a year. Don’t do it!</p>
<p>TODO comments don’t need to get done in order to be valuable. If you have</p>
<pre><code>// TODO: Write the second half of this file so next week&#39;s launch won&#39;t explode
</code></pre>
<p>then sure, you should probably track that somewhere.</p>
<p>But to me, a good TODO looks more like this:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO: If the user triple-clicks this button, the click handler errors because [xyz]
</code></pre>
<p>Would this be the highest-priority thing on the backlog? Probably not. Most users won’t end up triple-clicking that button. But the <code>// TODO:</code> doesn’t need to be a plan to actually do something. Instead, it’s a note about “here’s an edge case that wasn’t handled” or a suggestion for a better structure that the author didn’t make time to implement — it captures a little slice of the author’s brain and gives a little window into the rich context they had at the time they wrote the code.</p>
<p>Sometimes TODOs are useful, sometimes they’re not, but well-placed TODOs can often answer a future reader’s “Am I totally missing something, or wouldn’t it better if this code was refactored like this?” — and answer it well enough to get past the hump of “Ehh, maybe I’ll just leave it the way it was in case the original author knew something I don’t.”</p></div></div>
