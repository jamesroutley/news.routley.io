    <h1>I Am Leaving</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  <p>This video is dedicated to all those with an astonishingly enduring faith in tech billionaires and their products. And to all those who begin their updates with “Dear...” like they are writing a letter to an absent editor.</p>

                  <p>These things take a solid <em>frickin’</em> week to make so, if you’re able, support me on <a href="https://opencollective.com/webbed-briefs"><strong>Open Collective</strong></a> or <a href="https://webbed-briefs.teemill.com/collection/new"><strong>buy some official merch</strong></a>!</p>
