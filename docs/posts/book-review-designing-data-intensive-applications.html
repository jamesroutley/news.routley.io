<p>After kicking off our technical book club at work over a year ago
with <em>The Art of PostgreSQL</em> (see my <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2020-03-29-taop-review.html">review</a> and <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2020-04-05-taop-summary.html">summary</a>), we took almost half a
year of a hiatus before deciding to tackle another book—but in August,
we decided to give <a href="https://dataintensive.net/"><em>Designing
Data-Intensive Applications</em></a> (DDIA) by Martin Kleppmann a
go.</p>

<p>We “worked” on the book from August until December, and it was not
exactly a breeze to read; I don’t think anybody regretted the time spent
on reading and discussing, though.</p>

<p>This is not a short book by any standard, and a few typos in such a
dense text would certainly be forgivable. However, I don’t remember
seeing any at all. This book has been around for a few years, and the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920032175">errata</a>
aren’t non-existent, but whatever process there is in place to fix typos
resulted in the version I ended up reading being near-perfect.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The level of care is exceptional also elsewhere. A pet peeve of mine
are technical books with shell script snippets full of outdated and bad
practices, as if it didn’t matter; I appreciate it all the more when an
author cares about these little things as well. (And can you trust
somebody who doesn’t quote their variables? Surely not.)</p>
<p>There are several examples where concepts are explained using simple
shell implementations, for example the “world’s simplest database”:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>db_set ()</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>echo</span> <span>&#34;</span><span>$1</span><span>,</span><span>$2</span><span>&#34;</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> database</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>db_get ()</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>grep</span> <span>&#34;^</span><span>$1</span><span>,&#34;</span> database <span>|</span> <span>sed</span> <span>-e</span> <span>&#34;s/^</span><span>$1</span><span>,//&#34;</span> <span>|</span> <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Everything neatly quoted, no <a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html">Useless Use of Cat</a>,
no ugly (and <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/tail.html#tag_20_125_18">not
even POSIX compliant</a>) <code>tail -1</code>… perfect.</p>

<p>Each chapter starts with a beautiful map with locations named after
the material introduced in the chapter. Kleppmann wrote a <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/03/15/map-distributed-data-systems.html">blog
post</a> about this where he explains that the regions stand for the
concepts, and the cities are specific implementations. There was even a
Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://dataintensive.net/poster.html">posters</a> with all the
maps!</p>
<p>I enjoyed looking at the maps before reading, seeing some terms I’d
heard before and some I had no clue what they meant—and then coming back
to the map after reading, and understanding why things are grouped
together and what the concepts behind the names are.</p>

<p>Throughout each chapter, a ton of references are listed (about one
hundred per chapter), so if I’m more interested in any topic (just
because, or maybe because I’m working on a related problem), there’s no
shortage of material to dive deeper. Almost every reference links to the
source, and Kleppmann maintains a <a href="https://github.com/ept/ddia-references">Git repository</a><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> with updated links. (Now, if he
would only merge my pull request with a fix…)</p>

<p>Reading this often felt like studying for a university exam: I would
read and highlight, then go through the chapter again and write a
summary for it. That’s of course not required, but I feel like I’m
retaining much better like this. (If only I would have enjoyed studying
as much when it would have been more useful!)</p>
<p>The book covered a lot I only have passing familiarity with (such as
non-relational datastores), barely even knew existed (for example
leaderless replication), or just took for granted without knowing how it
works (like indexing). If I need to know more about a topic, I now know
where to start.</p>
<p>For some concepts, I realized how incomplete my understanding had
been (example: ACID and isolation levels), and I’m now at least aware of
that. Know what you don’t know!</p>
<p>And, almost the biggest win for me, a lot more problems I encounter
or read about every day make a lot more sense now: I have a better idea
what approaches and tradeoffs there are, or at the very least I remember
that I <em>should</em> know what something is about—and then I can go
look it up. <del>I can also drop more buzzwords in interviews now, which
always impresses everybody involved.</del></p>
<p>All in all, the book deserves all the praise it gets, and I can’t
imagine anybody buying and reading it ending up thinking that either
money or time was wasted.</p>
