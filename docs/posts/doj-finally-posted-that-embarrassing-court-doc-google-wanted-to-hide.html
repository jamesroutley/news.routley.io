<p>The US Department of Justice has finally posted what judge Amit Mehta described at the Google search antitrust trial as an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416692.pdf">&#34;embarrassing&#34; exhibit</a> that Google tried to hide from the public.</p>
<p>The document in question contains meeting notes that Google’s vice president for finance, Michael Roszak, &#34;created for a course on communications,&#34; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-29/google-search-is-like-cigarettes-or-drugs-executive-said">Bloomberg reported</a>. In his notes, Roszak wrote that Google&#39;s search advertising &#34;is one of the world&#39;s greatest business models ever created&#34; with economics that only certain &#34;illicit businesses&#34; selling &#34;cigarettes or drugs&#34; &#34;could rival.&#34;</p>
<p>At trial, Roszak told the court that he didn&#39;t recall if he ever gave the presentation. He said that the course required that he tell students &#34;things I don’t believe as part of the presentation.&#34; He also claimed that the notes were &#34;full of hyperbole and exaggeration&#34; and did not reflect his true beliefs, &#34;because there was no business purpose associated with it.&#34;</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Google repeatedly objected to the document being shared in court, claiming it was irrelevant to the DOJ&#39;s case. Then, after Mehta allowed the DOJ to present the document as evidence, Google tried to seal off Roszak&#39;s testimony on the document, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-fights-to-hide-embarrassing-but-not-confidential-doj-trial-exhibit/">Mehta granted, but later said that Google&#39;s request put him &#34;in a pickle.&#34;</a></p>
<p>“This doesn’t contain anything confidential,” Mehta told Google. “I understand it’s somewhat embarrassing for the witness.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Sealing Roszak&#39;s testimony made it harder for the public to understand the context of the document, Mehta worried. Ultimately, Mehta not only denied Google&#39;s request to redact portions of the document but also &#34;said he would unseal the portion of Roszak’s testimony related to it,&#34; Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>Beyond likening Google&#39;s search advertising business to illicit drug markets, Roszak&#39;s notes also said that because users got hooked on Google&#39;s search engine, Google was able to &#34;mostly ignore the demand side&#34; of &#34;fundamental laws of economics&#34; and &#34;only focus on the supply side of advertisers, ad formats, and sales.&#34; This was likely the bit that actually interested the DOJ.</p>
<p>&#34;We could essentially tear the economics textbook in half,&#34; Roszak&#39;s notes said.</p>
<p>Part of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/heres-exactly-what-google-will-argue-to-fight-the-dojs-antitrust-claims/">DOJ&#39;s case argues</a> that because Google has a monopoly over search, it&#39;s less incentivized to innovate products that protect consumers from harm like invasive data collection.</p>
<p>A Google spokesman told Bloomberg that Roszak&#39;s statements &#34;don’t reflect the company’s opinion&#34; and &#34;were drafted for a public speaking class in which the instructions were to say something hyperbolic and attention-grabbing.&#34; The spokesman also noted that Roszak &#34;testified he didn’t believe the statements to be true.&#34;</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Google lawyer Edward Bennett told the court that Roszak&#39;s notes suggest that the senior executive&#39;s plan for his presentation was essentially &#34;cosplaying Gordon Gekko&#34;—a movie villain who symbolizes corporate greed from 1987&#39;s <em>Wall Street</em>.</p>
<p>The debate over how much of Roszak&#39;s notes could be shared with the public ended with an agreement between the DOJ and Google on all trial exhibits. By 9 pm every trial day, Google or other third parties can object to the DOJ posting trial exhibits like Roszak&#39;s notes online. Otherwise, the DOJ can post trial exhibits &#34;as soon as it is reasonable to do so,&#34; Mehta ruled.</p>
<p>The DOJ posted the trial exhibit yesterday, so now you can read Roszak&#39;s &#34;embarrassing&#34; notes <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416692.pdf">here</a>.</p>
