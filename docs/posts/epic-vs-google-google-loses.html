    <h1>Epic vs. Google: Google Loses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="region" aria-labelledby="stream-lede"><p>The future of Google’s app store is at stake in a lawsuit by <em>Fortnite </em>publisher Epic Games. Epic sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees, claiming the Android operating system’s Google Play store constituted an unlawful monopoly. It wanted Google to make using third-party app stores, sideloaded apps, and non-Google payment processors easier — while Google said its demands would damage Android’s ability to offer a secure user experience and compete with Apple’s iOS.</p><p>On December 11th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">the jury ruled in Epic’s favor</a>, finding that Google has turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, answering yes to every question in front of them about Google’s monopoly power, anticompetitive behavior, and the illegal ties between the different parts of its business.</p><p><strong>Follow along with all of our updates below.</strong></p></div><div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-9a8aaf44-0917-43a4-a85e-36f390b0615d"><div><div><div><div><div><p>And here is Epic&#39;s celebratory blog post after the Epic v.

They decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers, and deals with OEMs were all anticompetitive.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7e076576-d488-4067-8145-294fac083d3c"><div><div><div><div><div><p>Google will appeal the Epic v.

The data remains unchanged,” begins Kravis.</p><p>“Time and again during this trial, you saw Epic overreach,” he adds, explaining how Epic wasn’t able to prove things like Project Hug were direct bribes or that Samsung was in collusion with Google. </p><p>Perhaps thinking about the judge’s warning, Epic moves on — Kravis is now pointing out that Epic is just trying to get a free ride on Google Play now. Here’s one quote from that:</p><p>“Epic can’t pocket the money in its own store and then stand up here and tell you it’s trying to protect the consumer.”</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-62739d26-5542-40b4-b1c8-aa16df96ecae"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“A monopolist shouldn’t be worried about its customers trying to choose other options, because they don’t have other options.”</p><p>Just a good quote about Google’s testimony, which I don’t think quite lands because Google’s internal emails show the company was actively worried about “other options” arising on Android if Google didn’t take action.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-4608ce95-57c3-4b65-9875-c40e7a2e9f20"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>Google tries to shoot down its Hug.</p><p>“At the beginning of this trial, Epic told you it would prove three of the 21 Project Hug agreements were payoffs... the evidence has shown nothing like that. The written agreements don’t say anything like this,” Kravis tells the jury.</p><p>“You can review them during your deliberations, and when you do, you will see they say nothing — nothing — about developers not being able to open their competing app stores.”</p><p>He points out even Epic CEO Tim Sweeney didn’t believe Activision Blizzard truly wanted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23981939/activision-blizzard-king-project-boston-android-app-store-games-candy-crush">to open its own app store</a>.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2ec3cca9-68a2-4693-a277-5e5c804cbad4"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“They didn’t provide any testimony from an Android phone manufacturer — we did.”</p><p>That’s Google, referring us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981432/epic-v-google-is-back-with-motorola-specifically-eric-christensen">to a Motorola exec’s testimony</a> that Motorola found it was a competitive advantage to ship with Google apps. </p><p>“This is an android phone manufacturer telling you this helps us build better phones at a lower cost — this is pro competitive,” says Kravis. </p><p>Mind you, the Motorola testimony is also when we saw that Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981694/an-internal-lenovo-motorola-document-shows-the-company-gets-paid-millions-when-it-complies-with-goog">does directly pay some OEMs</a> not to preload rival app stores.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-9402dd11-1f10-4a16-8aee-a1a79e1cf44a"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>Google is bashing Epic’s sideloading argument hard.</p><p>“Epic’s own expert admitted this is all the Android operating system itself requires for sideloading: three steps. And remember, you only have to go through this process once,” says Kravis. “He just thinks the steps should be compressed.”</p><p>“What evidence did you see during this trial that compressing three steps into two steps or one step would fix this alleged harm?” Kravis rhetorically asks the jury. </p><p>I’ve thought for a while that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=Epic%20lost%20the%20sideloading%20and%20security%20arguments%20IMO.">Epic mostly lost the sideloading argument,</a> and Google’s really driving it home.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2c20ebfd-e304-4732-a6fe-d1ed04064fb1"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“Right next to each other on the homescreen.”</p><p>We’re back to Google suggesting the Galaxy Store side by side on the homescreen with the Google Play Store (as it is on modern Samsung phones) is evidence of competition. </p><p>“Those consumers choose the Play Store 83 percent of the time — this is Google winning the competition because it has a better store,” says Kravis.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cd0accbe-327c-4597-8ac4-7e5a099efadb"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>Google says Epic was not forced to use Google’s billing system — because players clearly bought V-Bucks elsewhere.</p><p>Now we know why Google made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23744188">this point</a> earlier in the trial.</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-988463a6-a827-42a0-86e9-3522674d3e0a"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>Google turns Fortnite against Epic again.</p><p>Kravis just showed the jury a slide showing all the ways to play <em>Fortnite</em>, including the PC, Nintendo Switch, cloud gaming and more. </p><p>“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23745210">Professor Tucker’s market definition</a> is the only one that accounts for all these other choices,” he says. </p><p>“What’s missing from [Epic’s economist’s] charts is all the other choices that consumers and developers have.”</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-984f1999-2b97-43e9-bf6b-efb1e60b6358"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“Our competitors are charging a lower price: how can we respond?”</p><p>Google says the evidence shows that Google competes with Apple on price, that we’ve repeatedly seen the two lower their service fees to compete with one another. “This is not the behavior of a monopolist,” Kravis tells the jury.</p><p>“We don’t dispute that Google competes with other stores on Android,” he says, only that he wants to show that competition extends to Apple. (Epic had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951318/epic-expertly-found-what-wasnt-there">repeatedly shown</a> Apple wasn’t listed in Google’s internal documents about app store competitors.)</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-361f90f7-8ae8-44ce-8c88-a4fcffeca4a6"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“These numbers are really concerning to Google — Google doesn’t want to lose 60 million users to the iPhone every year.”</p><p>Kravis spent a decent chunk of Google’s closing argument fighting against the idea that users won’t switch between iOS and Android and ended that section once again suggesting that even if the percentage of switchers is small, the absolute number is large.</p><p>He also had a memorable line about the lag we’ve seen between apps appearing on iOS and Android: “What Purnima told you, and the evidence shows, is that app developers are like the rest of us. They have to prioritize, they have to decide which apps to build first.”</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b07342a5-bfad-4344-b17a-735eb19d494b"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“Because Apple and Google are in the same market, Google cannot have monopoly power.”</p><p>That seems straightforward enough — if jurors decide that Apple vs. Google is the relevant market. Google’s attorney suggests that because Apple has 64 percent of app store revenues, period, Google is too small to have monopoly power. </p><p>Now, he’s attempting to say that app stores are critical to phone buyers to the point that Apple competes with Google on that level:</p><p>“They take it home, they turn it on, it’s got a lousy app store on it... you don’t need a PhD in economics to know what’s going to happen next... they’re going to buy another phone.” </p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-bb532761-b36e-44f7-bc18-67342b99ee0a"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span><img alt="Sean Hollister" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div><div><p>“PayPal and Stripe do not deliver apps to billion of consumers around the world.”</p><p>Kravis is going fast and fierce. </p><p>“Epic wants you to give them a deal they have not been able to get anywhere else... a deal that would effectively allow them to use the Play Store for free.”</p><br/></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul></section></div></div>
