<p>
Is it that time of the year again? A new intellectual minted. The loss of next
few evenings watching YouTube, reading substacks? All for that sweet nectar of a
novel “hot take”.</p>
<p>
It seems every 6 months I find someone new to obsess over. This started a few
years ago. First it was Jordan Peterson, then it i was Eric Weinstein, then
Chamath, the list goes on. Most recently, it’s been Peter Zeihan.</p>
<p>
The story goes something like this, I get recommended a clip on YouTube, there’s
a man who is calm, articulate, and says something that completely violates the
narrative. How fascinating. Is my understanding of the world completely wrong?!
I need to read everything this man written.</p>
<p>
The next few weeks are spent digging up every single video I can find, hearing
the same points repeated, each video adding a little extra context which helps
fill in the gaps. By the end of it I feel like I can articulate the points as well as
him. I can’t, but it sure feels like I can.</p>
<p>
And so the man gets a seat on the roster. From here on out, anytime a new
piece of content comes out, i’ll be the first to listen.</p>
<p>
Without fail, each one of comes to dissapoint. They’re either a one trick
pony, and every development in the world is analyzed through the same tired lens
whether its applicable or not. Or, they are so desparate for keeping momentum
so they have a “hot take” everything. Problem is their first take is
often born out of decades of experience in a field, whereas each subsequent is born
out of decreasing rigor. And so, their credibility withers.</p>
<p>
It’s a shame because they are clearly very smart men who have much to contribute
to the public conversation, but they make the tactical error of getting out over
their skis.</p>
<p>
I don’t blame them either. Imagine toiling away in the obscurity of some dark
university office building. Thrown into the limelight because you have the next
interesting thing to say at the right moment when the world is paying attention.
Milk it for all it’s worth. Get that bag. </p>
<p>
But dear reader see this pattern for what it is.</p>
<p>
You’re basis for truth often relies on authority of your source.
Epistemologically speaking it’s a weak standard, but this is a busy world, and
you need some heuristic to sift through it quickly. Know this pattern so you can
cast off these men at their peak instead of riding it all the way down.</p>
<p>
And take note when one doesn’t fall, study them the hardest.</p>
