    <h1>Tell HN: Today Is Global Accessibility Awareness Day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As builders and creators we want to maximize our impact.  There&#39;s a lot of talk about ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance).  Which for most us is pretty abstract and something only really big companies invest a small % of their revenue into to attract certain kinds of investors (there are exceptions).</p><p>One way we can all directly make impact is making a commitment to make our software accessible to all, starting with educating ourselves about common mistakes folks make when designing UI that produce software that can&#39;t be used by folks who have temporary or long term low vision, low hearing, neurological, and other disabilities.</p><p>There are a ton of free educational events on accessibility going on today, and if you don&#39;t have time today, find a recording, or listen to a podcast, there is a huge opportunity to make impact once you better understand the challenges.</p><p>A couple of years ago while doing research on accessibility I came across the Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and the GAAD foundation (https://accessibility.day/) - there are many such orgs, but if you consider yourself accessibility curious, today&#39;s a good day to get curious.</p><p>/PSA</p></div></div></div>
