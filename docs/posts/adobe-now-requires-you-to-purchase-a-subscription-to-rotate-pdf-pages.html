    <h1>Adobe now requires you to purchase a subscription to rotate PDF pages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Adobe now requires you to purchase a subscription to rotate PDF pages, which is such comically desperate monetisation. I wish they would stop investing so much time into increasingly aggressive pricing, and just fix their widespread bugs, such as After Effects not being able to render videos (which is its main purpose), or Photoshop becoming worse every year.</p></div></div>
