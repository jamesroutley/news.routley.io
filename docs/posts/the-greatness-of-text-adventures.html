    <h1>The Greatness of Text Adventures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Text adventures are weird. They are so weird I don’t know how to write this
article, so prepare to read something even more rambly than usual. Normally,
when this happens, I decide not to publish the article. But
</p>

<ol>
<li>I really want to share my enthusiasm for text adventures, and</li>

<li>I needed something to link to when I wrote that article on <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/lessons-from-creating-first-text-adventure.html">what I learned
from creating my text adventure</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let’s go!
</p>
<section id="outline-container-text-adventures-have-awesome-properties">

<p>
Here’s a list of cool properties of text adventures.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-freedom">
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<div id="text-orgd362409">
<p>
Text adventures give the player a lot of freedom.
</p>

<p>
In graphical games, the player character can act in at best a handful of
significantly different ways in any given situation<span><sup>1</sup> Not counting small
variations. Using different types of attack is still attacking, for example.
Entering into dialogue is still one action, however deep the dialogue is.</span>. In a
text adventure, the player character typically has ten or twenty meaningfully
different ways to act in any given situation.
</p>

<p>
This freedom is liberating: even though the player cannot literally do anything
they want, a well-designed text adventure really makes it seem as though they
could, by having programmed generic interactions between actions and objects.
This freedom can also be used to good effect to give the user alternatives for
solving puzzles.<span><sup>2</sup> Such as when, faced with a foosball table, one solution can
be to <code>TAKE BALL. PUT BALL IN GOAL</code>.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">
<h2 id="non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">Non-graphical and non-literal experiences</h2>
<div id="text-org3e383cd">
<p>
By being non-graphical, text adventures have the benefit of conveying things
without having to represent them literally. In a graphical game, if we wish to
represent a large city, we must model a literal large city, with thousands of
buildings. In a text adventure, we can instead describe the city such that it
feels large, whicle modelling only very few buildings.
</p>

<p>
Another example of the ingraphicality of the medium is that text adventures can
represent non-visual effects; we can model other senses than vision, like smell
and touch.
</p>

<p>
With text, we can also present an abstract space much easier than with graphics,
which tend to the literal.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-cheaper-dynamic-environments">
<h2 id="cheaper-dynamic-environments">Cheaper dynamic environments</h2>
<p>
Text adventures can more easily support dynamic environments. In a graphical
game, dynamic environments require complicated physics and animations. This – in
addition to the effort of graphical and sound design – makes graphical games
more expensive to create than text adventures. Many of the greatest text
adventures of all time were developed as pet projects by single developers in
their spare time.<span><sup>3</sup> From what I understand, text adventures are even used to
prototype narratives and mechanics in some big game studios.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-mature-technology">
<h2 id="mature-technology">Mature technology</h2>
<div id="text-org8924178">
<p>
If all of the above is not intriguing enough, let’s also mention that text
adventures are a mature technology. They were some of the first computer games
ever created. It’s difficult to find a computer that cannot run text adventures.
</p>

<p>
Great! But what … are they?

<div id="text-org2c9be1f">
<p>
I have played a few text adventures the past months, and here’s a brief excerpt
from one<span><sup>4</sup> <i>The Dreamhold</i>; Andrew Plotkin; self-published; 2004. <a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fdreamhold.z8">Playable
online.</a></span>. This transcript begins when we have exited the starting area, and just
begun to explore what lies beyond.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CURVING HALL, WEST END
</p>

<p>
The curving corridor ends here, in a blank plaster wall relieved by a single
window. The window looks out on a strange subterranean prospect to the west. You
can return east, pass through the archway to the north, or try the closed door
to the south.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A broad glass pane looks out over a dark cavern. This end of the corridor seems
to be deep underground. A natural cave spreads out below; its mammoth columns
and cascades of flowstone are only dimly picked out by the candlelight behind
you. The farther reaches are hidden in darkness. But the shining waterfall
before you is easily visible. A stream pours in from your right, tumbles from a
ledge, and plummets into a pit beneath the window. The water seems to sparkle
with some natural phosphorescence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; break window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The glass ignores your assault.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; enter archway</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls here are painted white and are utterly undecorated. An archway leads
south. In the center of the room stands an earthenware tub. From it sprouts a
tangle of vines, broad fan-like leaves, and an enormous golden flower. The
luxuriant growth clashes, you think, with the room’s stark emptiness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant sits alone in its pot, in the center of the empty room. The golden
flower is nearly the size of your head. It rises from a tangle of vines and
leaves that would better suit an unexplored south-coast swamp than someone’s
home.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant’s stems look too thick to break.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; smell flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You lean forward and take a deep breath of the
flower’s aroma.
</p>

<p>
Memory nearly bursts through.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
DANK JUNGLE (IN THE EARTHENWARE TUB)
</p>

<p>
You are standing waist-deep in an empty earthenware tub, in the midst of a
trackless jungle.
</p>

<p>
Heavy, entangled trunks and vines loom in every direction, as far as you can see
– and you can’t see far. The sky is entirely obscured by layers of vegetation.
Only a murky green light filters down to you. But golden flowers dot the trees,
like bursts of sun.
</p>

<p>
An iron key is balanced neatly on the edge of the tub.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take key</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; get out of tub</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You swing your legs out of the tub, and find the world swinging around you…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls of the room are painted in green slashes, like the trunks of uncounted
trees, and splashed with gold. An archway leads south. A hint of sweet-rank
perfume touches you as you breathe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; inventory</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You are carrying an iron key.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
We explored a space in a building set into a cave, and smelling the flower got
us transported … into a memory? Or literally miniaturised and into the tub? We
were able to bring the iron key, after all. Did we even emerge into the same
room, given that the description changed? It’s not made clear, and this
ambiguity is okay in text – each reader will get to play their own preferred
version of the game.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is a game by an author that is known for abstract mechanics.
There are also games that are far more traditional in their mechanics. When I
stop playing <i>Plundered Hearts</i><span><sup>5</sup> <i>Plundered Hearts</i>; Infocom; Infocom; 1987.
<a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Feblong.com%2Finfocom%2Fgamefiles%2Fplunderedhearts-r26-s870730.z3">Playable online</a>.</span> I can almost hear the chirping of the jungle and the lapping
of the waves against the island where I’m stalking around a large house trying
to figure out how to get into the ongoing ball.
</p>

<p>
It shouldn’t come as a surprise. Novels – and spoken stories – have transported
readers to fantastical locations for ages. But I still didn’t know text
adventures could be so immersive.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="outline-container-interaction-in-text-adventures">

<div id="text-org285bcf1">
<p>
The bright reader has already figured out how interaction works in text
adventures: the game prints a brief paragraph of text describing the players’
immediate environment or the result of their last action, followed by a prompt
sign, after which the player types in what they want to do next.<span><sup>6</sup> There are
technical differences here between <i>narrator</i>, <i>player character</i>, and <i>player</i>
but we’ll brush past that for the moment.</span>
</p>

<p>
The instructions the player types into the prompt look like English, but they
follow a fairly strict format used in almost all text adventures by convention.
These are recognised by a component of the game called the <i>parser</i>. Despite the
strict format, some of the joy of playing these text adventures is trying
something crazy, like in <i>Plundered Hearts</i> when we stand on the balcony above
the ballroom, see the rope on which the chandelier is attached, type <code>SWING ON
ROPE</code> … and the player character comes crashing down onto the dancing guests
with a big “Aiieeee!” It’s outside the conventional commands, but it makes sense
and the author catered for it.
</p>

<p>
Text adventures typically take a simulationist approach to narration. This means
the author has not specified what happens in any given situation. Instead, what
happens next is determined mechanistically by the player’s actions given the
current world state. Maybe we need to cross a violent river, but it’s up to us
if we want to block it, re-route it, magically freeze it, or jetpack over it.
The progress is gated on being able to cross, not how that ability is achieved.
</p>

<p>
The violent river is an example of a <i>puzzle</i>, which are usually strewn
throughout text adventures. These puzzles are used to pace the narrative, and
avoid dumping everything on the player at once. Obstacles get placed in the way
of progress, and the player needs to find ways around them to experience more of
the story.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle-pacing of text adventures means they can often contain a lot more
detail and flavour text than a corresponding novel, because the player slowly
uncovers the text they are most interested in, and are free to ignore the
rest.<span><sup>7</sup> Well, any information needed to solve puzzles cannot be ignored, of
course. Old school games tended to hide such information in the most innocuous
places, requiring careful searching of every nook and cranny to proceed. Modern
games, by contrast, tend to be more forgiving and hint more actively at which
locations are important to search.</span>

<div id="text-org66a4f32">
<p>
At some point I would like to do a formal comparison of text adventure puzzles
by way of grounded theory<span><sup>8</sup> That is the only hammer I have for extracting
structure and meaning from unstructured accounts.</span>. That is out of scope of this
article, so we’ll look at one sloppy categorisation of interest:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lock-and-key: we must possess a specific item to get past an obstacle. We find
the item by observing the environment carefully.</li>
<li>Lock-and-password: we must perform a specific action to get past an obstacle.
We learn about the action by observing the environment. Tougher puzzles
require astuter observation, sometimes even catching on to background
patterns.</li>
<li>Change-the-self: we must alter our appearance to get past an obstacle. This
can be considered a combination of key- and password-based puzzles: we must
find the item that masks our appearance, and then be perceptive enough to know
when to wear it.</li>
<li>Change-an-item: converting one item to another is fairly common, either by
performing the right action on it or by combining it with the right other items.</li>
<li>Change-the-environment: we must rearrange the environment in a way that makes
actions possible that were previously unthinkable, unreasonable, or nonsensical.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some puzzle types that might not fit into the above categories.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Waiting-based puzzles: where just quietly waiting for one or more turns makes
something happen.</li>
<li>Persistance-based puzzles: where doing something once has an effect that is
not quite useful, but doing it many times has an effect that is very useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Either of these could be considered lock-and-password puzzles, only with the
password being to repeat an action.
</p>

<p>
We could also categorise puzzles into what sort of simulation they are based on,
e.g. whether they simulate human senses<span><sup>9</sup> Requiring observing the environment
in particular ways, or manipulating the senses of others such as shouting to
wake someone up.</span>, or physical systems<span><sup>10</sup> Getting items to increase leverage,
throwing things at other things to dislodge them, getting something large to
block a view, etc.</span>, or machines<span><sup>11</sup> Figuring out how to run a bread dispensing
machine, or how an orrery evolves to bring an item closer to the ground.</span>, or
magic systems<span><sup>12</sup> These simulations need to be internally consistent, but they
may not correspond to any natural laws we know from our world.</span>, or the desires
of other people<span><sup>13</sup> Giving people things, showing them things, feeding animals,
etc.</span>.

<div id="text-orgb3a1b39">
<p>
Text adventures are generally free<span><sup>14</sup> In the sense of gratis, but also
sometimes libre.</span>. They spawned out of the culture of free sharing at <abbr>mit</abbr> and
other universities, and they are passion projects to date. Most games are
released in competitions, and all big competitions have rules that stipulate
playing the game must be free. There are good reasons to try playing them, and
few reasons not to.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you know more about text adventures than I did when I started
out. Here are some games I have played and which I think aren’t terrible for a
beginner:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition97%2Ftads%2Fglow%2Fglow.gam">Glowgrass (1997)</a>: You crash land in an overgrown Ancient settlement, and the
eerie starts to take on a familiar face as you end up learning more about what
has happened.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FViolet.zblorb">Violet (2008)</a>: If you can successfully type the command <code>WRITE</code> you win the
game. But boy are there many distractions when a distractable person just
needs to write.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fdreamhold.z8">The Dreamhold (2004)</a>: You wake up in a wizard’s Dreamhold with no memory. As
you explore, some things come back to you. Eventually you gather all masks and
you figure out what you need to do to finish what you started.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Feblong.com%2Finfocom%2Fgamefiles%2Fplunderedhearts-r26-s870730.z3">Plundered Hearts (1987)</a>: You are a woman stuck between men who have violent
business to finish with each other. Somehow you end up rescuing your pirate
hero multiple times.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FLostPig.zblorb">Lost Pig (2007)</a>: You are an orc and you lost your pig. Now you must find it.
You’ll make a friend along the way. This game has fairly difficult puzzles,
but it is incredibly responsive; even silly actions (<code>BURN TAPESTRY</code>) have
effects programmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are all games that are either <i>merciful</i> or <i>polite</i> on the <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/essays/cruelty-revisited.html">Zarfian
cruelty scale</a>, meaning you might be able to die, but the game will not let you
continue to play after failure has become certain.<span><sup>15</sup> In contrast, games that
are <i>cruel</i> will happily let you put the game into an unwinnable state with no
way to tell that that has even happened.</span> Create a savegame after every time
you’ve made progress (with the <code>SAVE</code> command) and you’ll never lose much
progress.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card.pdf">Zarf’s <abbr>if</abbr> cheat sheet</a> contains some useful commands that tend to work in many
games. It’s fine to not be able to solve a puzzle. Sometimes they are hard. Make
sure you have examined <i>everything</i> carefully for hints. If you still cannot
progress, see if you can play with a friend. If you have no friends, look up
hints or a walkthrough.<span><sup>16</sup> My personal rule is that if I have come up with a
solution that <i>ought</i> to have worked, but wasn’t programmed with the appropriate
response, I allow myself to cheat and look at the solution in a walkthrough.
Often the solution is the same as I had thought of, only it expected a variation
on the wording I used. E.g. <code>WAVE MIRROR IN MOONLIGHT</code> might not work, but <code>PUT
MIRROR IN MOONBEAM</code> does.</span>
</p>

<p>
Give it a fair shot. It takes a few games until one is familiar enough with the
conventions to navigate the game smoothly, but it’s worth it, I think. Opens up
a whole world.

<section id="outline-container-appendix-a--text-adventure-vs--interactive-fiction">

<div id="text-org618619f">
<p>
A brief note on terminology is in place. I call these games <i>text adventures</i>,
but a lot of people these days prefer the term <i>interactive fiction</i>. Here’s how
that happened.
</p>

<p>
In the mid-1970s, a couple of avid cavers programmed a text-based virtual cave
exploration simulator on a large mainframe computer. They named the simulator
<i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>, and it got colloquially known as <i>Adventure</i>. This
was the first game of its kind, and it spawned an entirely new genre. Much like
the game <i>Rogue</i> spawned the genre of roguelikes, the game <i>Adventure</i> spawned
the genre of <i>text adventures</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these game-defined genres change names. First person shooters used
to be known as <i>Doom clones</i>, but as they branched away from the formula of the
original <i>Doom</i>, they needed a more generic name. This has happened also with
text adventures. These types of games soon branched out to include less
adventurous mechanics, and a new name was needed. One big developer in
particular, Infocom, went with <i>interactive fiction</i>, in part to try to sell the games to
a broader market of readers. That name stuck around as the more inclusive
term.<span><sup>17</sup> Some interactive fiction games aren’t even parser-based, but
choice-based: instead of asking the player to type in what they want to do, they
stop at story beats and give the player a list of alternatives for how to
proceed.</span>
</p>

<p>
There are three reasons I still speak of text adventures:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I have not yet branched out to these other games. The games I’ve played (and
started to make) are still fairly firmly planted in the simulationist,
puzzle-paced <i>Adventure</i> tradition. If I specifically played the games that
came out just after Doom and mimicked it closely, I would similarly say I
play <i>Doom clones</i>, not first person shooters.</li>

<li>I dislike the term <i>interactive fiction</i> because it’s provably too long. Just
as with “first person shooter”, which is universally abbreviated <abbr>fps</abbr>,
nobody bothers saying or writing “interactive fiction”. They abbreviate it to
<abbr>if</abbr> instead. And <i>that</i> is such an overloaded combination of characters that
it becomes impossible to perform a web search for. I don’t like that.</li>

<li>A minor reason is that if I wanted a good work of fiction, I’d pick up a
book. I play text adventures for the interactivity in a simulated world, and
there I want good game mechanics before a good narrative. Calling it interactive
fiction puts the emphasis on the narrative over the game, which is not what I’m
looking for.</li>
</ol>
