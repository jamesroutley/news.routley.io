<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This post or I should say a series of posts, is a result of a kinda (not yet, as it turns out :&gt;) failed <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amiga 1000 Phoenix upgrade project that I did write about some time ago.</a> </p>
<p>It all looks like this is going to be my longest and most complicated project. It still has a work-in-progress status but I’ve decided to start writing about it because I keep on forgetting the details. I’ve already forgotten a lot, so time to refresh my memory and describe the idea behind the project, the job, and the details of it.</p>
<h2>Codename: Tesseract</h2>
<p>This post will be divided into at least four or maybe even five parts. I already have over 400 pics and we are far from the finish. This project evolves dynamically as there are a lot of problems that I have sorted out, so be prepared for twists and turns.</p>
<p>As I’ve described in <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A1K Pheonix’s post</a>, MrTrinsic decided that we should try another route and by that he meant, to create a brand new custom Amiga 2000 from scratch, I mean like a TOTAL custom job!!!11!!eleven!!!!.</p>
<p>The brand new mobo, case, and tons of add-ons – brand new and old. At first, I didn’t realize how hard it might be but hey! this is why challenges are cool! am I right? So like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE5dIscvDxrb7CD5uiJJOiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrian says</a> … Let’s get right to it!</p>
<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>The plan was to make a fully working A2000 mobo from a scratch, meaning, to get a brand new PCB, solder it all up and make it work. That was my first task, which turned out to be quite easy but also time-consuming. As a bonus, it was also a very relaxing experience. </p>
<p>MrTrinsic RULEZ! He proactively searches and sends all gear directly to me which makes the whole job way easier so we are working on this project as a team and that saves a lot of time. Did I mention that this project is over a year and keeps on going lol?!</p>
<p>Let’s leave the case for now and focus on a motherboard build.</p>
<h2>The marvelous MOBO</h2>
<p>As I said, MrTrinsic sends/orders the majority of the gear needed for this project directly to me. I didn’t have to wait long for a brand new A2000 PCB to show at my doorstep.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UZ0XlbM-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>This is a PCB that was made brand new, based on an awesome rev-eng job done by <a href="https://github.com/Floppie209/Amiga2000-remake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Floppie209</a></p>
<p>Shortly after receiving a PCB, I started to order parts like crazy. However, I did a mistake as I wanted to lower costs too much and I ordered parts from different shops. Now I know that I should’ve ordered all the parts from one, but big supplier as it reduces waiting time to a minimum.</p>
<p>Anyways, candies started to show up.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wi1fGRd-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>There are a lot of parts that need proper bending so I’ve figured that I’ll 3D print a tool for it.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XqJKEJW-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<h2>Soldering</h2>
<p>From now on, that was just a matter of bending parts and putting ’em in the place.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9WnzsSo-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>I’ve figured out that using paper paint tape to hold components in place makes the job way easier.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FwnaYft-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>This is how it looks on the other side. </p>

<p>Some fails along soldering were introduced too 😀 Sorted out later, so no worries 😉 </p>
<p>Always remember!! – DO READ <strong>readme.txt</strong> and documentation 😀</p>

<p>Now, to a <strong>great</strong> FAT AGNUS problem (you’ll see why this is important soon and in future posts too)</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/obmNvRZ-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>For now, just a teaser … Cheers rj1307!! 🙂</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XyoqvXF-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>Some spare parts from a dead, donor A500 mobo + new sockets and ports</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LceHMdk-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<h2>The PSU</h2>
<p>Ok, so with the majority of passives in place, I could start working on the PSU. The first idea was to use a cool ATX to AMIGA adapter that I’ve already used in the <a href="https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A1K Phoenix project</a>. I just had to rewire everything to match the A2000s power socket.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sZOBtcR-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>For those who are having trouble with figuring out the above wiring, here is how it goes:</p>
<p>From the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>RED – +5V</li>
<li>BLACK – GND</li>
<li>YELLOW – +12V</li>
<li>SPACE</li>
<li>BLUE – -12V</li>
<li>ORANGE – +5V user</li>
<li>GREEN – -5V</li>
<li>WHITE – TICK signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing time! … without custom chips!</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KUBdM3i-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/T5lK7FJ-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<h2>Custom chips</h2>
<p>Now, with passives in place and successfully tested without a magic smoke, I could move on to testing the setup with custom chips.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/z9gB7Or-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>I wanted to make a quartz resonator replaceable so I’ve come up with an idea to cut a precision DIP socket proper size and remove unnecessary pins. This allows you to easily replace the part without serious soldering hassle. On the left, pins were removed.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cETsdyM-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/O34mbm4-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/v0BltMJ-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The next piece needed to run the whole unit was to install a FAT AGNUS chip. MrTrinsic wanted this Amiga to have 2MB of CHIP RAM. This was supposed to be done by a mod installation. There were some problems (as usual:) introduced. The first problem was a capacitor collision but that was easily sorted out by resoldering it.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XPKi1A3-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The second problem was that this mod didn’t work with this mobo … sadly, I’ve figured that out after soldering it on …</p>
<p>I had to desolder it, and that’s when problems started. Turns out (no shit Sherlock) that it is kinda hard to desolder standard gold pins from a brand new, gold-plated motherboard.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XZqQLzC-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>No worries, the module was brutally removed but was rescued afterward and will be used in another project 🙂</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/qwE01tH-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2DhSEBn-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>Anyway, I had to install a standard PLCC socket and put a regular FAT AGNUS in it just to test if it all works.</p>
<p> Aaaaaaand…</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/XOl5BvJ-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Y0jzZVN-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p><strong>It worked!!! YAY!</strong></p>
<h2>The Case</h2>
<p>Now, with a working mobo as a base, I could move on to early measurements of a case.</p>
<p>MrTrinsic figured out that we should be OK with “such a large” case for A2000</p>
<p>However, there were a lot of things that had to be sorted out first to make it all happen.</p>
<p>The case that MrTrinsic picked is TF5 type. It was sold by Karma Digital, Omaura, and Aumro.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kDvTKuj-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/VDYF4ij-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>I didn’t waste time and I started working on it. One of the first things that had to be done was to remove all those studs designed for PC motherboards.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2gXg4El-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The first measurements followed quickly.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/h2yegmV-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>It quickly turned out that I can work on some improvements by simply cutting off the tips of screws to save 2mm of space. </p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AHxnPLb-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>That task was sorted out by the Dremmel-like tool. I’ve also removed other minor obstacles along with screw tips.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/h0VeuAS-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>With everything flatted out, I could start working on new mount points for a freshly made A2000 mobo.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jNqujAF-1.png" alt=""/></figure>
<p>After a while …</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/QmlBOLh-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<h2>Isolation</h2>
<p>I first made a template out of cardboard and used it to carve a proper polyethylene sheet to place it underneath a mobo as a separator.</p>
