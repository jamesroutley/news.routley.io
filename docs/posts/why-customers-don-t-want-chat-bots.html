<p>I came across an intriguing comment recently by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and public face of ChatGPT. Altman has been in the news quite a bit during his global PR tour, including an appearance at a U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html" target="_blank">Senate hearing</a> last Tuesday, during which he asked for Congressional regulation of AI.</p>

<p>The Senate hearing was sanitized and tame, showing off Altman as a calm and relatable technologist. At one point, Sen. Kennedy asked him if he makes a lot of money from OpenAI, allowing Altman to give an aw-shucks answer that he is only “paid enough for health insurance” and is motivated purely because he loves the work. (No mention of the five racecars Altman claims to own, including two MacLarens, as well as the “guns, gold . . . and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to” he boasted of to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny" target="_blank"><em>New Yorker</em></a> – let alone his ongoing attempt, worthy of a Bond villain, to scan the iris of every person on earth with a metal orb, in exchange for some cryptocurrency he invented. I’m <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank">not making this up</a>.)</p>
