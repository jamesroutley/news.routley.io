    <h1>Clever code is probably the worst code you could write</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Engineer‚Äôs Codex is a free publication about real-world software engineering. I write about real-world </span><a href="https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-instagram-scaled-to-14-million" rel="">technical case studies</a><span>, </span><a href="https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-one-line-of-code-caused-a-60" rel="">outages</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-to-burnout-a-software-engineer" rel="">interesting stories</a><span> from the industry.</span></em></p><p>When I was an undergrad, Leetcode broke my brain. I would see top solutions of esoteric one-liners and wrongly think ‚Äúhow do I ever get this good?‚Äù</p><p>This is commonly called ‚Äúcode golfing‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fun hobby, but very far from ‚Äúgood code.‚Äù</p><p>Everybody (including those on Leetcode) knows this isn‚Äôt good code. In the industry, it‚Äôs the worst code one could write.</p><p><span>However, on the other end of the spectrum, I realized eventually that the </span><strong>clearest code was actually the hardest to write.</strong></p><p>It made sense retrospectively. Reviewing the code of a senior staff software engineer was much easier to follow and review compared to the code of an entry-level L3 engineer.</p><p>The ‚Äúpower‚Äù of clear code, for better or for worse, was made fully clear to me after a certain incident at work.</p><p>I once wrote a data enrichment module in C++, a language that is generally harder to read compared to other languages simply due to its verbosity.</p><p>I started with just two files (.h/.cpp) and all the implementation code went into just these two files.</p><p>The result was this giant, disgusting piece of spaghetti on the inside, but a perfectly working program on the outside.</p><p><span>This would </span><em>never</em><span> get past code review.</span></p><p><span>I split the implementation into 30+ diffs. At the time I was working at a company that used </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs" rel="">stacked diffs</a><span>. (This also happened to be my personal record for length of chained diffs, so I was pretty proud of the following outcome üôÇ).</span></p><p>Each diff was a neat, containerized piece of code, with convenient placeholders for dependencies that would arrive in a later diff. It had code neatly split out into helper functions and helper files when necessary.</p><p>Each diff had reasonable unit test coverage - the basics and some obvious edge cases were covered, but I didn‚Äôt go wastefully overboard with it.</p><p><span>Each diff also took me quite a few iterations of ‚Äúcode cleaning,‚Äù refactoring, and more. </span><strong>It took a lot more effort than I expected to achieve ‚Äúclear code,‚Äù especially for such a large program.</strong></p><p><span>The result? </span><em>A beautiful landing of the data enrichment module, with easy to read, clear code.</em></p><p><span>While I was proud of it, there was suddenly a </span><strong>problem</strong><span> when I talked to my manager about it.</span></p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhile I understand how complex this was, when it comes to performance reviews, this code looks trivial. It looks too easy, too simple.</p><p>I would recommend writing an implementation doc of this module just so we can demonstrate that this was actually quite complex.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><span>I was shocked - this wasn‚Äôt some startup. This was one of the biggest companies in the world, </span><em>known for their engineering culture</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>I now understood why Big Tech seemingly had so many docs ‚Äî half of the docs I wrote didn‚Äôt </span><em>need</em><span> to be written, except they did‚Ä¶ because I wanted to get raises and be promoted.</span></p><p><span>While promotion culture in Big Tech is a story for another article (subscribe to see it in your inbox soon üôÇ), the main point here is that </span><strong>great code is very clear and readable.</strong></p><p><span>There‚Äôs a </span><a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law" rel="">popular saying</a><span> that </span><strong>debugging code is twice as hard as writing it</strong><span>. It‚Äôs the reason why when ChatGPT outputs some hogwash, it‚Äôs easier just to re-prompt it or write it from scratch yourself instead of trying to figure out the errors in its buggy code.</span></p><blockquote><p>Clever code is harder to read and looks esoteric.</p><p>Clear code is harder to write and looks easy.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><span>The only way I got better at writing clear, readable code was just </span><strong>writing a lot of code while strictly following a clear style guide.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Also, having more experienced devs review my code with a magnifying glass. </p><ul><li><p>It was agony to get tons of comments and ‚Äúnits‚Äù about seemingly pointless style in the beginning, but it paid off in the end.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Coding style is </span><strong>more important</strong><span> than I expected in the beginning. My start to software engineering started from being on the product-minded end of the spectrum and moved towards the ‚Äútechnical-minded‚Äù side of the spectrum.¬†</span></p><ul><li><p>I had started coding solely to start a business, so I initially only cared about code as a tool, resulting in crappy, unmaintainable code.</p></li><li><p>It‚Äôs only through more experience with writing code and working within teams that the importance of clear, readable code became more obvious.</p></li><li><p>It‚Äôs not just me. This is an obvious revelation to anybody who has been writing code in the industry for more than a year. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><a href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html" rel="">John Carmack once wrote a long email about coding style in 2007, which is an interesting read.</a></strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/how-google-writes-clean-maintainable" rel="">Google probably has the most public style guide</a><span>. Vercel also recently released their </span><a href="https://github.com/vercel/style-guide?utm_source=tldrwebdev" rel="">style guide</a><span>, and pretty much every company uses some sort of linter and prettifier.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>My friend Jordan Cutler, who writes the popular </span></p><p><span> , is holding a course: </span><strong><a href="https://maven.com/jordan-cutler/mid-level-to-senior?promoCode=CODEX" rel="">Mid-level to Senior for high-growth engineers</a><span>.</span></strong></p><p>I‚Äôm a huge advocate for Jordan - he‚Äôs an extremely kind, driven, and encouraging friend.</p><p><strong><a href="https://maven.com/jordan-cutler/mid-level-to-senior?promoCode=CODEX" rel="">If you‚Äôre interested in growing as a software engineer, I would highly recommend his course.</a></strong></p></div></div></div>
