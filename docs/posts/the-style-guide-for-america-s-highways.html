            <p>Driving across America, you will encounter a wide variety of cultures, landscapes, people and animals. But the one consistent thing that will stay the same from Maine to California are the signs you pass on the highway. That is because America’s roads and highways have a big, fat style guide.</p>

But the one consistent thing that will stay the same from Maine to California are the signs you pass on the highway. And that is because America’s roads and highways have a big, fat style guide. </p><p>First published in 1935, the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) “<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/index.htm">Manual on Uniform Traffic Control</a>” (MUTCD), is a hefty tome consisting of close to 900 pages that contains the federal standards for all traffic safety signs, roadway markings and other “traffic control devices” that a driver on a road in the U.S. might encounter. </p><p>The MUTCD states that it “shall be recognized as the national standard for all traffic control devices installed on any street, highway, bikeway, or private road open to public travel”. Exact specifications for the font, size, spacing of letters, background colors, reflectivity, mounting location and orientation help ensure that traffic signs are consistently readable at a glance while driving anywhere in the U.S.. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.08.20-AM.png" width="880" height="1113" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.08.20-AM.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.08.20-AM.png 880w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.10.48-AM.png" width="738" height="962" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.10.48-AM.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.10.48-AM.png 738w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.12.35-AM.png" width="745" height="967" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.12.35-AM.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.12.35-AM.png 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.13.54-AM.png" width="741" height="965" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.13.54-AM.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-at-2.13.54-AM.png 741w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption>Signs to warn you of bighorn sheep, and to direct you to spelunking.

But states do have some freedom in the signs that they use.</p><h2 id="shall-should-may">Shall, Should, May<br/></h2><p>Within its pages, many of the rules are marked as “Standard” – along with the verb “shall”, indicating a mandatory or required rule. But some other rules are marked as “Guidance” (the state “should” follow this rule), “Option” (the state “may” follow this rule) or “Support” which just offers extra information on the rule. The law offers states some flexibility in how they interpret the standards, and defines a process for experimenting with new signs and markers. </p><p>By <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2011-title23-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title23-vol1-sec655-603.pdf">law</a>, each state is required to either adopt the U.S. MUTCD as its standard, or supplement the national manual with its own state-specific amendments, or adopt its own manual altogether (as long as it is in “<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/state_info/index.htm">substantial conformance</a> with the National Manual”). Ten states have their own MUTCD:  <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/programs/safety-programs/camutcd">California</a>, <a href="https://www.txdot.gov/business/resources/traffic-design-standards/tmutcd.html">Texas</a>, <a href="https://epg.modot.org/index.php?title=Category:900_TRAFFIC_CONTROL">Missouri</a>, <a href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/trafficeng/publ/mutcd/">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyNnvMXo5LgvhvSltSOh5miCxD84PSdJ/view">Utah</a>, <a href="https://mdotjboss.state.mi.us/TSSD/tssdHome.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.in.gov/dot/div/contracts/design/mutcd/mutcd.html">Indiana</a>, <a href="https://www.dot.state.oh.us/roadway/omutcd/Pages/default.aspx">Ohio</a>, <a href="https://deldot.gov/Publications/manuals/de_mutcd/index.shtml">Delaware</a> and <a href="https://roads.maryland.gov/mdotsha/pages/index.aspx?PageId=835">Maryland</a>.</p><p>Here’s some example passages from the federal MUTCD that illustrate the detail of the standards:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>“The DO NOT ENTER sign, if used, should be placed directly in view of a road user at the point where a road user could wrongly enter a divided highway, one-way roadway, or ramp (see Figure 2B-12). The sign should be mounted on the right-hand side of the roadway, facing traffic that might enter the roadway or ramp in the wrong direction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only acceptable alternative background colors for Street Name (D3-1 or D3-1a) signs shall be blue, brown, or white. Regardless of whether green, blue, or brown is used as the background color for Street Name (D3-1 or D3-1a) signs, the legend (and border, if used) shall be white. For Street Name signs that use a white background, the legend (and border, if used) shall be black.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“On multi-lane streets with speed limits greater than 40 mph, the lettering on post-mounted Street Name signs should be composed of initial upper-case letters at least 8 inches in height and lower-case letters at least 6 inches in height.”</p>

This manual includes 375 pages of precise schematics for a wide variety of signs, indicating the exact shape of the ursine silhouette on the “<strong>W11-16 LARGE ANIMAL - BEAR</strong>” sign, the exact radius of the rounded corners of rest stop signs, and the distance between the peaks of the shield emblem that highway route numbers are enclosed in.</p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/shs-215-1.png" alt="Silhouette of a large bear on a diamond shaped yellow sign.

In 2004, the FHWA <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/res-ia_clearview_font.htm">authorized provisional use of the font </a>for traffic signs. </p><p>Big problems emerged when this new typeface was approved. When developing Clearview, the new font failed to match the readability of the Standard Alphabet typeface at the standard letter sizes defined by the MUTCD. The designers had to increase the letter size to achieve a higher degree of legibility. This created problems for sign manufacturing and design, as it changed long held standards for sign dimensions. And though this typeface was merely approved as an option that states could use (in a limited number of circumstances), it created enormous confusion for state transportation departments who thought this might be a replacement for Standard Alphabet (it wasn’t). Such a complex and carefully considered system now had unhelpful ambiguity. </p><figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-07-at-11.58.52-PM.png" alt="A type sample contrasting the shapes and sizes of Clearview and Standard Alphabet, showing Clearview in blue, and Standard Alphabet in red.
