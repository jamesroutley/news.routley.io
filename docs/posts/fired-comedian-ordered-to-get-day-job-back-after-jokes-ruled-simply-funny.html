Image Credit: Jad Sleiman</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A reporter who was fired last year when his employer found clips of his standup comedy online must be reinstated because his jokes are funny, a third-party arbitrator has ruled. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The arbitrator also found that his comedy clips, which covered topics including 9/11, Israel, and oral sex, could violate Philadelphia-based <a href="https://whyy.org/?utm_source=googlegrant&amp;utm_campaign=1420877238&amp;utm_term=whyy%20org&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqNSsBhAvEiwAn_tmxQzVxWeE2MZmooi0YjiTctGa7ZbETmLa2TuqfEIA6q4UAKL8pkChORoC9D0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">NPR member station WHYY</a>’s social media policy and must be removed. The reporter, Jad Sleiman, said this raises concerns about the boundaries of remote work.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I kind of couldn’t believe it,” said Sleiman, who <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1c_VTjAcQc/" target="_blank">wrote on Instagram</a> that he’s been pursuing comedy full-time since his firing. “The one thing I’ve been told about arbitration is they usually split the baby, so nobody gets everything they want. But what’s been on my side this whole time is the case against me has just been such bullshit.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sleiman had spent five years as a reporter at <em>The Pulse</em>, a health and science radio broadcast produced by WHYY. However, after senior management found clips of his standup comedy routines that he had <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jadslay/" target="_blank">posted on Instagram</a>—clips the company alleged were “egregious” with “sexual connotations, racial connotations, and misogynistic information,” according to the arbitration case document Sleiman <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/18wv311/fired_from_member_station_whyy_for_stand_up_won/" target="_blank">posted online</a>—he was <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/whyy-reporter-fired-standup-comedy-20230306.html" target="_blank">fired last January</a>. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“They cut off my health insurance same day, despite the fact that they know I have multiple sclerosis and rely on very expensive drugs to walk,” Sleiman told Motherboard on Wednesday. “They also went and deleted all my work from the site, every single possible clip I could try to use to get a job.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sleiman’s comedy focused on his “experiences as an Arab American, raised in a Muslim family, his experience in the U.S. Marine Corps, and his reporting while he was in the Middle East,” including embedding with Syrian opposition fighters and covering ISIS in Iraq, the arbitration document states. It includes written samples of nine jokes that Sleiman had posted as clips on Instagram (which, as part of the arbitration agreement, he has since removed from his page). One joke is listed with the title, “Kind of Racist.”</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I work at one of these places that’s so woke it’s kinda racist,” the joke reads in part. “Like this lady asked my boss, she’s like ‘Yo, does Jad consider himself a person of color?’ because she was making a list of us. Fucking hell? Sick, alright. I get to be in this lady’s brown dude Pokédex.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Another joke is titled “Trump vs Muslims vs Jews.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“People say Muslims hate Jews. It’s more accurate to say, we’re very afraid of them,” the joke reads in part. “They’ve been kicking our ass for, like, 70 years. We’ve got to rethink that term homophobia, dude. Homophobia means you hate gay people. It doesn’t mean homosexuals have defeated you in a dozen wars.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sleiman, who was represented by SAG-AFTRA grievance lawyers, argued that he had been terminated without due process. Lawyers from <a href="https://www.duanemorris.com/index.html" target="_blank">Duane Morris LLP</a>, including the firm’s vice chairman Thomas Servodidio, argued that Sleiman’s “inflammatory” comedy constituted a violation of WHYY’s code of conduct and social media policy, which states that “employees must take care that their postings cannot be interpreted as inflammatory, unethical or illegal, since such posts may have an adverse effect on WHYY.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The arbitrator said that he read this policy as not incorporating a “reasonable person” standard, meaning that workers “must be vigilant not to post anything on social media that could conceivably be interpreted as inflammatory even by highly sensitive and thin-skinned individuals without an appreciation for irony or satire.” </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“That’s nuts, right?” Sleiman said. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The arbitrator performed an in-depth analysis of the nine comedy samples to determine whether they were in violation of this reading of the policy. Though parts of some jokes were deemed potentially inflammatory, many were found to be either funny or an astute critique of some institution of power. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Of “Kind of Racist,” the arbitrator wrote that it was “a powerful condemnation, in a funny way, of what [Sleiman] calls corporatized racial consciousness.” About “Trump vs Muslims vs Jews,” he wrote that “much of the clip is somewhat amusing.” Another joke was “simply funny.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The arbitrator was not a fan across the board. They found that one joke  was “insightful, principled and serious, but not very funny.” Sleiman said he was disappointed by this review. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The arbitrator ordered on December 29 that Sleiman be reinstated in full. When asked whether he believed he would have gotten his job back without SAG-AFTRA involvement, Sleiman said, “No. No, I would have been screwed completely, because Pennsylvania is an at-will state, so they could have just fired me and that would have been the end of it. The fact that it’s a union shop is actually the whole reason I was able to fight back at all.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>SAG-AFTRA did not respond to a request for comment. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Something that the union is kind of concerned about is the way remote work has changed the way we work,” Sleiman said. “We’re always online, on Slack and shit, so when are we off the clock? Couple that with ever widening definitions of racist, sexist, whatever and you have an atmosphere where you’re always at work, which is a place you can say less and less,” according to the arbitrator’s interpretation of the policy.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sleiman said he expects to start working again in the coming week, unless the company decides to appeal the arbitration decision.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I’m going to walk in there like fucking Vince McMahon,” he said, laughing. “I’m very curious to see how much they spent—Duane Morris is some of the biggest in the country. They tried their best. They called me every name in the book. They cut off my health insurance. They deleted all of my fucking stories, which like, what the fuck? And then they still lost. People keep asking, ‘Is it going to be weird going back?’ I’m like, yeah, for them.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A WHYY spokesperson told Motherboard in an email that the station was reviewing the arbitrator’s decision and would be deciding on next steps in the near future.  </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2024/01/03/jad-sleiman-whyy-fired-comedian/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Magazine</a> on Wednesday, a WHYY spokesperson wrote, “We are evaluating the decision, any appeal options and next steps. While we do not agree with all of the arbitrator’s conclusions, we certainly accept the arbitrator’s decision that Mr. Sleiman needs to permanently remove all inflammatory or offensive social media posts as a condition of any future employment at WHYY.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“WHYY, as a trusted news organization, has no tolerance for behavior that demeans any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual preference or other protected status,” the statement continued.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Sleiman told Motherboard on Thursday that he has contacted a defamation lawyer.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em><strong>Correction</strong>: An earlier version of this story characterized WHYY as an NPR affiliate. It is an NPR member station.</em></p></span></p></div></div>
