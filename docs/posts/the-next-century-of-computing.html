    <h1>The Next Century of Computing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In this article, I will be giving 80 brief predictions on the future of computing and its impact on the broader world. These are largely predictions that you will not find elsewhere, and this is certainly not an exhaustive list of my ideas. However, from much of my theoretical research and various trends I’ve seen playing out, these are the places where I see things eventually deviating from common expectations.</p><p>Many of these take the form of a niche that I see existing now or in the future. How fast these predictions come true will be highly dependent on how fast people can find these niches and begin to fill them. In some ways this is a guide for people who may be interested in building a future that I hope you’ll agree with me is more interesting and inspiring than many current visions of the future.</p><p>This is not the place for me to justify these predictions with lengthy explanations of course. Such explanations may be fleshed out in future articles.</p><div><li><p><span>Let us start by getting the obvious out of the way. Moore’s law is coming to an end. It is slowing down rather than coming to a grinding halt, but already </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="">Dennard scaling has broken down</a><span>, which eliminates many of the real benefits from scaling further for chips that are not almost entirely memory.</span></p></li><li><p>The end of Moore’s Law will quickly result in much more bizarre hardware. The decades ahead of us will be a Cambrian Explosion of bizarre hardware.</p></li><li><p>Existing architectures will be abandoned. No more x86, ARM, or RISC-V. However, this will go far deeper than people expect. The basic concept of computing as a machine executing a stream of instructions, shuffling data back and forth between processor and memory, will eventually be abandoned in favor of more exotic models. The models we have today will be shown to be largely arbitrary, holding back potential efficiency gains and theoretical insights with models that reflect naive computational theory from the 1940s and 50s that has yet to die far more than any fundamental nature of computing.</p></li><li><p>Legacy code will still be runnable through emulation. Native hardware support will be abandoned. Modern hardware already spends &gt;99.9% of its complexity and energy on smoke and mirrors to provide the illusion of being an impossibly fast PDP-11. Fancy features like Out-of-Order execution, cache coherency, etc. will be scrapped and will be replaced by simpler, more efficient, more scalable hardware.</p></li><li><p>General-purpose processors will get multiple orders of magnitude faster even after the end of Moore’s law, but only by exploiting a tradeoff between performance and familiarity.</p></li><li><p>Hardware will begin to conform less to human models and more to physics. Computers are made of real atoms, use real energy, produce real heat, occupy real space, and take real time to send bits around to different locations in that space. These are things that cannot be abstracted away without paying serious costs, and without Moore’s law providing free efficiency subsidies by other means, real efficiency gains will come from deconstructing these old models and more deeply understanding the relationship between computation and fundamental physics.</p></li><li><p><span>Much of the mandatory rethinking of hardware design and emulation-focused compatibility will allow old design mistakes to be corrected. For example, modern OSes are only millions of lines of code today because of arbitrary HW decisions in the 90s that produced a performance advantage for embedding driver code into the OS.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipNaiTf3eOw" rel="">Silicon compilers will become common place</a><span>. In response, innovative fabs will scale up </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-project_wafer_service" rel="">wafer-sharing services</a><span>. It will soon be possible to design a custom CPU or ASIC, upload the files to TSMC’s website, pay $500 and have a batch of 10 chips delivered to your door a couple months later. Hardware engineering will become almost as commonplace as software engineering.</span></p></li><li><p><span>In the short term, the inevitable </span><em>Javascript chip design frameworks</em><span> will create </span><em><strong>massive security problems, baked into unchangeable silicon</strong></em><span>. Software engineers are not prepared for hardware engineering. The low costs and low volumes around shared wafer prototyping will mitigate problems somewhat, but eventually the powerful formal methods tooling that has already been used by hardware engineers for decades will be forced into the hands of a much wider audience.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The computing industry will get over its irrational fear of Turing. Undecidability is deeply misunderstood; undecideable problems must be solved, and are regularly solved by any useful static analysis tool. Undecidable problems are not incomputable (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Uncomputability_of_Kolmogorov_complexity" rel="">that’s a separate computability class</a><span>), but rather are the computational equivalent of irrational numbers; impossible to compute exactly, but rather easy to approximate. A golden age of code analysis and formal methods will follow once this misplaced fear is gone.</span></p></li><li><p><span>As hardware becomes more physics-constrained, it will simultaneously become more bizarre but also more regular. One of the first forms this will take, a form already beginning to appear in some </span><a href="https://www.adapteva.com/announcements/epiphany-v-a-1024-core-64-bit-risc-processor/" rel="">niche</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.cerebras.net/" rel="">high-performance</a><span> </span><a href="http://www.rexcomputing.com/" rel="">computing</a><span> </span><a

in a regular grid.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

a successful product</figcaption></figure></div></li><li><p><span>Computing on tiled architectures shares much in common with distributed systems programming, albeit with more predictability and on a much smaller scale. For physics-related reasons, computing on data is cheap, moving data around is relatively expensive.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Far more powerful software diagnostic tools will be built. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger" rel="">Debuggers that haven’t improved in any meaningful way since the 1980s</a><span> will be abandoned for tools that can stream and visualize megabytes or gigabytes of data per second. Many applications will feature a dedicated diagnostics dashboard that future debuggers will be able to access.</span></p></li><li><p>Garbage collection for large programs will become impractical, as it relies on many behaviors that will scale absurdly poorly with physics-constrained hardware. GC may still be practical on small scales, or for programs that make little use of hardware. Programming languages and other tools will provide better and more intuitive tools for memory management, creating a middle ground between manual and automatic memory management.</p></li><li><p><span>Computer memory will generally make more use of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management" rel="">memory arenas and similar techniques</a><span>. This will not just provide performance advantages when freeing memory, but will also enable easier code analysis and better control of data locality (which will be one of the most important performance factors).</span></p></li><li><p>More visual and intuitive tooling will make a far larger impact on the ability for normies to participate in software development than any VC-backed nocode project will ever come close to achieving. Not only this, but it will vastly improve the productivity of professional software developers.</p></li><li><p><span>Computer science as a mathematical field will become less introverted and will begin to intermingle with other branches of mathematics on a far deeper level. It will also begin to more closely resemble traditional mathematical fields such as geometry and statistical physics. Computer science insights will then be turned around to produce deeper insights into those fields.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Much of these insights will be seeded from attempts to </span><a href="https://geometricdeeplearning.com/" rel="">reverse-engineer deep learning</a><span> and the brain. The tools developed there will begin to influence tooling meant for more traditional software development, highlighting deep geometric relationships at the core of computation. This will radically change how we think about computer programming. Our existing programming paradigms and language designs are extremely unlikely to survive this transition, and computing on the other side will be almost unrecognizable to us today.</span></p></li><li><p>This will blend nicely with physics-constrained hardware. There are close relationships between data storage, communication latency/bandwidth, and basic geometry. These relationships will become increasingly more relevant over time.</p></li><li><p>Reverse-engineering efforts in machine learning and neuroscience will bear substantial fruit. Reverse-engineering efforts in other parts of biology will soon follow. In much the same way that physics has directly inspired an enormous deal of the most powerful modern mathematics, completely new computing paradigms will emerge from studying computational systems that were designed by gradient descent or natural selection as opposed to human engineering.</p></li><li><p><span>Theoretical neuroscience will provide a new paradigm of error-tolerant computation. Granted, theoretical brain models with these properties </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_distributed_memory" rel="">have been known of for decades</a><span>, but they will become more relevant in the future.</span></p></li><li><p>The “Singularity” will fail to materialize. The vast power of human ingenuity will prove to not be purely the result of big brains, but rather the product of human language allowing us to stand on the shoulders of giants, giants whom themselves stand upon the shoulders of others. Yes, more powerful brains will be capable of some impressive feats, but will also be prone to making many arguments along the lines of “heavy objects fall faster than light objects” without constant real-world experimentation that is not bottlenecked by compute.

Optimizing for iMmErSiOn will prove to be nothing more than a meme that wastes billions of dollars. A good book is immersive. The real benefit of VR will be in significantly increasing the bandwidth of data that can be extracted from the brain and by increasing the sensory range of human-computer interaction.

They will not replace transistors, but rather will result in chips that combine transistors with other devices that can perform certain complex logic functions more efficiently.</span></p></li><li><p>Quantum computing will influence classical computing. While quantum algorithms may be hard to simulate on classical computers, they are still possible to simulate.

Core count (and thus computing power) scales with volume, while memory bandwidth and I/O scale with surface area.
