    <h1>Ask HN: What is the most useless project you have worked on?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If you&#39;re feeling useless, remember that I exist.</p><p>Let me give you some context. I work in the pipeline automation department of a company. Last month, our team decided to deprecate an internal tool due to several maintenance issues. So we created a pipeline that automates the implementation of this legacy tool, in case other teams needed to use it. (WHAT???)</p><p>This month, a guy in my team found some improvement scenarios in the automation. So I was chosen to implement this changes in this legacy internal tool.</p><p>The thing is, after I finished the adjustments, my pull requests are not getting approved due to adjustments meticulously requested by this guy in my team. Adjustments to make the pipeline automation even more resilient in complete unlikely scenarios.</p><p>But this same week, my TL sent notices to all the other teams informing them that this internal tool has been deprecated and they should no longer use it. So what sense does it make to have a pipeline automation that implements the use of the deprecated tool? And if it has been deprecated, why would I need to make an adjustment for the automation to be even resilient if no one should be able to use it anymore? So why am I being allocated to work on in such waste of time like it? (WTF???)</p><p>This makes me wonder, how many people have to work on something that they see no sense in doing at all.</p><p>So once again, if you&#39;re feeling useless, remember that I exist.</p></div></div></div>
