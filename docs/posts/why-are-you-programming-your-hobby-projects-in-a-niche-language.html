    <h1>Ask HN: Why are you programming your hobby projects in a niche language?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>My niche language is Racket. I like it because I like Schemes more than Common Lisps and I think it is the most accessible Scheme. It improves on some of the issues I have with my main language, Python, mostly around creating an executable. If I&#39;m being honest, I also get a dopamine hit from using a niche language, but maybe I&#39;m not the only one who feels that way.</td></div></div>
