By 2035, solar <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-technology-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photovoltaics</a> are projected to generate a staggering <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024/executive-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10.7k TWh globally</a> — nearly 28% of the total anticipated demand! As cities grow and the impacts of climate change intensify, the transition to renewable energy sources like solar becomes increasingly urgent. By offering a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, solar energy empowers <a href="https://explore.panda.org/climate/how-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint#:~:text=If%20you%20can&amp;#x27;t%20change,phone%20power%20banks%2C%20etc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">individuals</a> and <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/esg/the-energy-transition/energy-demand-opportunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">businesses</a> to control their own energy production and reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p data-block-key="8eqo9">Unfortunately, barriers to solar adoption persist, particularly <a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/Rolling-out-renewables-in-the-Global-South-A-developer-perspective.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in parts of the Global South</a> where access to financing, technology, and infrastructure is limited. To unlock solar’s potential around the world, a concerted effort is needed from governments, organizations, and researchers to develop accessible and scalable solutions. Assessing the solar viability of a property involves numerous variables, often posing a challenge for homeowners and businesses. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps Platform (GMP) Solar API</a> simplifies the process of assessing solar potential and designing solar systems by leveraging aerial imagery to provide key insights for rooftops.</p><p data-block-key="4o5on">Today, we&#39;re excited to announce an <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experimental expansion in the coverage of this API in the Global South</a>. By applying machine learning (ML) models to satellite imagery, we can generate digital surface models (DSMs) and roof segmentation maps to enable solar assessments in new areas around the world.

Though working with lower-resolution satellite imagery presents new challenges, such as the scarcity of accurate elevation maps, reduced image quality, and distortions from oblique viewing angles, we see this as a significant opportunity to accelerate the growth of solar markets in new regions. Satellite imagery not only offers a pathway to global coverage but also enables more frequent data updates, even in well-mapped areas like the US and Europe, where relying solely on expensive and potentially outdated aerial imagery can be a limitation.</p><p data-block-key="4me8k">This data is currently available to experimental users through the <a href="https://goo.gle/solar-api-expanded-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar API Expanded Coverage Testing Program</a>, with a number of solar installers already using the data outputs, as shown below.</p>

    <h2 data-block-key="uhkgd">Using ML to predict high-quality DSMs and roof segments</h2><p data-block-key="60qb2">The solar data generation pipeline requires high-quality DSMs in order to compute planar roof segments for solar panel calculations. However, traditional stereo methods for satellite DSM generation are unreliable because high-resolution (&lt;1 meter) satellite imagery is expensive to capture, often leading to limited views of a given region with significant temporal gaps. Existing roof segmentation techniques are also less accurate on satellite data due to the lower resolution. To address these challenges, we’ve developed new ML models that can generate high-quality nadir (overhead) DSMs and planar roof segment instances from single-view satellite imagery.</p>

    <p data-block-key="uhkgd">We employ a two-stage model to produce DSMs and roof segments. The first stage is the base model, which processes off-nadir satellite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RGB</a> imagery with the corresponding <a href="https://www.celestis.com/resources/faq/what-are-the-azimuth-and-elevation-of-a-satellite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">satellite view angles</a>. We optionally include low-quality <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs664/2008sp/handouts/cs664-10-stereo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photogrammetry-derived</a> relative heightmaps (DSM-DTM) where they are available. These initial input DSMs have limited coverage and are at an insufficient resolution for detailed rooftop calculations. Using a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U-Net</a>–style architecture with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swin Transformer</a> encoder, the base model generates improved height maps and roof segment instances in the off-nadir view. These are then reprojected to a nadir view using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geometry-based reprojection</a>.</p><p data-block-key="2t64s">The second stage, the refinement model, further enhances the nadir RGB, DSM and segment instances by filling in gaps and artifacts produced in the reprojection step. The base and refinement models use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">L1</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/sobel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sobel gradient</a> losses for DSM estimation, and <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2023/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">affinity mask losses</a> for roof segmentation.</p>

    <p data-block-key="yvzd4">Our models are quantitatively evaluated using a variety of metrics, including DSM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mean absolute error</a> (MAE), <a href="https://www.nachi.org/roof-slope-pitch.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roof pitch</a> error, and roof segment instance <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/blog/intersection-over-union-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intersection over union</a> (IOU). DSM and pitch results are compared to high-quality aerial DSM equivalents. Roof segment labels are obtained in two ways — either computed using <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cap6411/cap6411/spring2006/Lecture11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graph-cut</a> (GC) on DSM labels, or manually labeled using human annotations.</p><p data-block-key="8eh5b">We categorize these results into two groups based on input channels: &#34;RGB-only&#34; (global coverage) and &#34;RGB+DSM&#34; (limited coverage, only where stereo-based input DSMs are available), which help us understand model performance. These detailed performance metrics were compared across a broad set of countries where higher-quality aerial data is available. We also evaluated end-to-end results from the Solar API pipeline.</p>

  <p data-block-key="yvzd4">The results show that while inclusion of low-quality DSMs improves shading predictions, as captured by the building DSM MAE, it doesn’t significantly improve roof segmentation or pitch accuracy, which are more critical for estimating solar potential. Our model&#39;s strong performance with RGB-only inputs makes it suitable for application in any region where satellite RGB imagery is available.</p>

    <p data-block-key="yvzd4">Our models generalize well across varying architectural styles and landscapes. In regions with flat rooftops, our DSMs accurately capture obstacles and roof surfaces with a high level of accuracy. In areas with tilted rooftops, the models effectively predict roof ridges, which are important for accurate panel placement. While the DSMs may not capture the intricate details of individual trees, tree height information is available and used for analyzing shading impacts over adjacent rooftops.</p><p data-block-key="1j1eu">The figure below compares the predictions of our satellite-based model against the high-quality aerial data that is currently available in the Solar API.</p>
