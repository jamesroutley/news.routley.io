    <h1>Ask HN: Do you use an optimization solver? Which one? Do you like it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>We’re trying to bring new ideas to the optimization space. We’ve used a bunch of technologies over time (CP, MIP, LP, heuristics, etc.). We’ve built our own solver (for <a href="https://www.nextmv.io" rel="nofollow">https://www.nextmv.io</a>) and learned a lot along the way.<p>Solvers are amazing. MIP solvers, for example, are some of the fastest and most mature software packages that exist. They’re also wickedly challenging to use effectively.</p><p>Do you use optimization solvers? Which ones? Why? Do you like them? Why or why not?</p></td></div></div>
