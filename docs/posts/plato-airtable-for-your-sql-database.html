    <h1>Show HN: Plato ‚Äì Airtable for your SQL database</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we&#39;re thrilled to launch <a href="https://plato.io">Plato</a>. Plato is Airtable for your SQL database. It‚Äôs the easiest way to make your database accessible for business operations such as customer support, customer success, and sales ops. Plato is free today for anyone to play with our sample DB or connect their own.</p><p>We created Plato because we noticed something strange. When helping our friends at a fintech startup, we saw that while they had spent weeks building an admin panel from scratch, their accountants seldom used it. They often had to run new queries and track new data that their admin panel didn‚Äôt support. Rather than waiting for features, they resorted to dumping CSVs into Airtable, which quickly grew out of sync.</p><p>We built Plato to make internal tools like admin panels more flexible and adaptible for the entire team.</p><p>üëÄ PM needs a single view on each user? Join tables together into a single <em>virtual table</em>. No SQL¬†needed.</p><p>Providing your team with direct access to your database can be scary, which is why Plato lets you configure tables to be read-only and never stores your row data. We‚Äôre also soon rolling out on-prem and an internal API client.</p><p>Most think low-code platforms are built to bring power to those outside of the engineering department, or ‚Äúcitizen developers‚Äù, but the leading internal tool builders are all marketed exclusively to engineers. What gives?</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6215aff673d185d731cf0d6f/6407d4e1c9676314bfc73aae_plato-blog-02-architecture-diagram.png" loading="lazy" alt="Internal tool builders vs Plato architecture diagram"/></p></figure><p>Today‚Äôs launch is just our first milestone on the way toward creating a new kind of tooling platform: a <strong>sandbox</strong>.¬†A sandbox is a safe playground for anyone to build and extend their own workflow tools: admin panels, scheduling apps, inventory management, task trackers, etc.. Engineers surface internal systems as building blocks that operators can then safely assemble into new tools. Data teams already understand the importance of providing their teammates with a sandbox for self-serve analytics. We believe engineers will likewise come to see the importance of providing a sandbox for tools.</p><p>Plato&#39;s mission is to be the best sandbox for internal tools, where everyone can build new tools on a reliable foundation. For many, that foundation begins at the database. To support a wider range of tools, we‚Äôll soon be rolling out custom views, pages, and automations. We hope you&#39;ll follow us for further developments.</p></div></div>
