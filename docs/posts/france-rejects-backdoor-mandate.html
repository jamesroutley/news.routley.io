    <div><div><div><p><span>In a moment of clarity after initially moving forward a deeply flawed piece of legislation, the French National Assembly has done the right thing: it rejected a dangerous proposal that would have gutted end-to-end encryption in the name of fighting drug trafficking. Despite heavy pressure from the Interior Ministry, </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2025/03/21/l-assemblee-vote-pour-le-maintien-de-la-confidentialite-des-messageries-cryptees-lors-d-une-nuit-agitee_6584121_3224.html"><span>lawmakers voted Thursday night</span></a><span> (article in French) to strike down a provision that would have forced messaging platforms like Signal and WhatsApp to allow hidden access to private conversations.</span></p>
<p><span>The vote is a victory for digital rights, for privacy and security, and for common sense.</span></p>
<p><span>The proposed law was a surveillance wishlist disguised as anti-drug legislation. Tucked into its text was a resurrection of the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/give-ghost-backdoor-another-name"><span>widely discredited &#34;ghost” participant model</span></a><span>—a backdoor that pretends not to be one. Under this scheme, law enforcement could silently join encrypted chats, undermining the very idea of private communication. Security experts have </span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/64968/why-the-ghost-keys-solution-to-encryption-is-no-solution/"><span>condemned</span></a><span> the approach, </span><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-ghost-proposals/"><span>warning</span></a><span> it would introduce systemic vulnerabilities, damage trust in secure communication platforms, and create tools ripe for abuse.</span></p>
<p><span>The French lawmakers who voted this provision down deserve credit. They listened—not only to </span><a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/"><span>French digital rights organizations</span></a><span> and technologists, but also to basic principles of cybersecurity and civil liberties. They understood that encryption protects everyone, not just activists and dissidents, but also journalists, medical professionals, abuse survivors, and ordinary citizens trying to live private lives in an increasingly surveilled world.</span></p>
<h3><b>A Global Signal</b></h3>
<p><span>France’s rejection of the backdoor provision should send a message to legislatures around the world: you don’t have to sacrifice fundamental rights in the name of public safety. Encryption is not the enemy of justice; it’s a tool that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"><span>supports our fundamental human rights</span></a><span>, including the right to have a private conversation. It is a pillar of modern democracy and cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><span>As governments in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and elsewhere </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/defending-encryption-us-and-abroad"><span>continue to flirt with anti-encryption laws</span></a><span>, this decision should serve as a model—and a warning. Undermining encryption doesn’t make society safer. It makes everyone more vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span>This victory was not inevitable. It came after sustained public pressure, expert input, and tireless advocacy from civil society. It shows that pushing back works. But for the foreseeable future, misguided lobbyists for police national security agencies will continue to push similar proposals—perhaps repackaged, or rushed through quieter legislative moments.</span></p>
<p><span>Supporters of privacy should celebrate this win today. Tomorrow, we will continue to keep watch. </span></p>
