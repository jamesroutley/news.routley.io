More than 100 years after her groundbreaking work, Sophie Hardach travels to Paris to trace the lingering radioactive fingerprints she left behind.</b></p><p>The Geiger counter starts flashing and buzzing as I hold it against the 100-year-old Parisian doorknob. I am standing in the doorway between the historical lab and office of Marie Curie, the Polish-born, Paris-based scientist who invented the word &#34;radioactivity&#34; – and here is an especially startling trace of her. The museum that houses the lab has invited me in here to track radioactive handprints left by her when she worked here in the early 20th Century. Here, on the doorknob, is one such trace. There&#39;s another one on the back of her chair. Many more of these invisible traces are dotted all over her archived notes, books and private furniture, some only discovered in recent years. </p><p>The Geiger counter&#39;s reaction, and the numbers on the display, suggest the presence of above-background radioactivity, though only at low and non-threatening levels. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/sievert">microsievert</a>, which measures the potential impact of radiation on the human body, it comes to about 0.24 microsievert per hour, well within safe <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irsn.fr/foire-questions/faq-radioprotection-lhomme">limits</a>, according to experts.</p><p>Marie Curie worked here from <a target="_blank" href="https://musee.curie.fr/decouvrir/lieux-historiques/le-bureau-de-marie-curie">1914 until 1934</a>, the year of her death, handling radioactive elements including radium, which she and her husband Pierre Curie had discovered in 1898. For most of her life, she did this with bare, increasingly radium-<a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/madamecuriebiogr00evec_0/page/384/mode/2up?q=372">scarred</a> hands. She then transferred traces of these elements onto other things she touched. Tracking the handprints through her work spaces, one can imagine how she might have gone &#34;from the lab to the office, opened the door and pulled out the office chair to sit down&#34;, says Renaud Huynh, the director of the Curie Museum, as he guides me from trace to trace.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl367.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout The faintly radioactive doorknob at the Curie Museum (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The faintly radioactive doorknob at the Curie Museum (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p>Some radioactive traces, for example in the Curies&#39; lab notes and <a target="_blank" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84515207.image">notebooks</a>, have long been known about: one analysis in the 1950s made some of them <a target="_blank" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3198s/f1006.item">visible</a> by using a photographic plate.

If we were to erase these traces, we would lose this memory. It might be a detail, but it evokes a mode of contamination, it evokes a certain way of working – and it also evokes an era.&#34;</p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>It&#39;s like holding the history of radioactivity in my hands – Marc Ammerich</span></p></div></div><p>Huynh has invited me into the museum outside opening hours, and also into the nearby archive, to talk about these traces. Since radioactivity is invisible, I had asked him before the visit if I could bring a Geiger counter to bring the traces to life for our readers. He agreed, and also let me invite Marc Ammerich, a radiation expert, to help me measure and interpret the results. </p><p>Ammerich spent 40 years working for French radioprotection agencies, inspecting the safety of France&#39;s nuclear power plants. Since 2019, he has been tasked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpcirkus.org/images/JT4_2022/presentations/14.%20Musée%20Curie.pdf">comprehensive tests</a> on the museum&#39;s collection. He has tested about 9,000 items from the Curies and their family so far, including the extendable dining table, where he found two radioactive patches next to each other, like two handprints, where a person would grab the table and pull it out for visitors. </p><p>Turning his attention to the Curies&#39; legacy has been a special experience, Ammerich says: &#34;To measure the notebooks where they write about their discoveries of radium and polonium, to measure the instruments they used – it&#39;s extraordinary. It&#39;s like holding the history of radioactivity in my hands&#34;.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4l6.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout Marc Ammerich measures the back of Marie Curie&#39;s office chair for radioactive traces left by her hands (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Marc Ammerich measures the back of Marie Curie&#39;s office chair for radioactive traces left by her hands (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="the-&#39;shed-years&#39;"><b id="the-&#39;shed-years&#39;">The &#39;shed years&#39;</b></span><span id=""><b id=""> </b></span></h2></p><p>Marie Curie was a doctoral student in Paris in the 1890s, when she came across a curious phenomenon.</p><p>She was studying the recently discovered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">mysterious rays</a> emitted by uranium. The scientist Henri Becquerel had described their interesting properties. The rays gave off light, and also, they made air conduct electricity. Curie <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">proposed the word radioactivity</a> for these peculiar rays – coining the word still used today. Testing various ores for their levels of radioactivity, Marie Curie then noticed something surprising: some of these ores were much more radioactive than the known radioactive elements they contained (uranium and thorium). </p><p>To find this unknown element, she began refining a uranium ore called pitchblende, removing all known elements from it, until only the mystery element would be left. Excited by the project, Pierre joined her. They crushed the ore, dissolved the resulting powder in acid, filtered it in many different steps, and obtained an increasingly concentrated, and increasingly radioactive product, Huynh explains.</p><p>It was an arduous process. As Marie Curie <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">herself</a> put it: &#34;The life of a great scientist in his laboratory is not, as many may think, a peaceful idyll. More often it is a bitter battle with things, with one&#39;s surroundings, and above all with oneself&#34;.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl3kj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout Renaud Huynh, Marc Ammerich and the Curies: Pierre, Marie, their daughter Irène and their son-in-law, Frédéric (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Renaud Huynh, Marc Ammerich and the Curies: Pierre, Marie, their daughter Irène and their son-in-law, Frédéric (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p>Not having access to a proper lab, they worked in a store room, and then, a leaky shed behind a university building. In Marie Curie&#39;s description, the shed was furnished with &#34;some worn pine tables, a cast-iron stove&#34; – and it lacked any safety provisions whatsoever: &#34;There were no hoods to carry away the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">poisonous gases</a> thrown off in our chemical treatments&#34;. And yet, &#34;it was in this miserable old shed that we passed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">the best and happiest years of our life</a>, devoting our entire days to our work&#34;, she writes. </p><p>In 1898, at the end of this backbreaking process of refining the pitchblende and then further refining tiny, highly radioactive crystals, they announced that they had discovered two new elements: polonium, which they named after Marie Curie&#39;s homeland, Poland; and radium. </p><p>&#34;It was a very toxic environment,&#34; says Huynh. &#34;Because there were not only radioactive vapours, and radioactive dust, but they also used many chemical products to break up the pitchblende that are banned from laboratories today, such as mercury.&#34;</p><p>The shed no longer exists, having been torn down; the lab in the museum is where Marie Curie later worked. In recent years, Ammerich conducted a wide-ranging inspection and safety review for the museum. He and his team removed surface contamination, such as weakly radioactive dust, from furniture in the preserved office. The remaining, faint radioactivity is from traces that sunk into the wood or metal and are now inside it, meaning that even if someone were to now touch the furniture, they would not transfer any contamination.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4nx.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout Inside Marie Curie&#39;s decontaminated lab, where she worked after leaving the &#39;shed&#39; (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Inside Marie Curie&#39;s decontaminated lab, where she worked after leaving the &#39;shed&#39; (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p>&#34;The lab was already decontaminated in the 1980s,&#34; says Huynh. At the time, the practice in the museum was to &#34;try and scrub off the contamination with abrasive sponges, and if radioactivity was then still detected, it meant it had sunk into the material, and they&#39;d throw away the whole thing and replace it&#34; with a copy, he says.</p><p>The lab bench, for example, was replaced with a replica, Huynh explains. Today, weakly radioactive traces such as the ones on the chair and doorknob are allowed to stay in place, he says, and are considered as heritage.</p><p>&#34;These historical traces of radioactivity are so important because they show the working conditions of Marie Curie at the time. They should be preserved at all costs,&#34; says Thomas Beaufils, a professor and museologist at the University of Lille who <a target="_blank" href="https://nordmagnetik.hypotheses.org/1628#more-1628">specialises</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.andra.fr/node/2041">conservation and protection of radioactive heritage</a>. &#34;There is no other place in the world where radioactivity has been spread throughout a lab and office by Marie Curie. It has a huge heritage value.&#34;</p><p>Today, radium – which Marie Curie discovered during her PhD research – is no longer used in France, having been replaced with safer and more manageable elements, Ammerich explains. And the way scientists work with radioactive elements has of course fundamentally changed, he says. </p><p>&#34;If Marie Curie were a PhD student today, she would first of all need to apply for a range of permits to work with these radioactive materials,&#34; says Ammerich. &#34;And she would only be allowed to do her research in an authorised lab, with all the necessary safety and ventilation equipment. She certainly wouldn&#39;t be handling the materials on a table or lab bench, she would be using a glove box,&#34; a sealed container with the radioactive material inside, he adds.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4pk.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout A box in the Curie Museum&#39;s archive, marked &#34;attention: radioactive material&#34; (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>A box in the Curie Museum&#39;s archive, marked &#34;attention: radioactive material&#34; (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="testing-history"><b id="testing-history">Testing history</b></span><span id=""><b id=""> </b></span></h2></p><p>When we planned the visit, Huynh said we could measure anything we wanted in the lab, office and archive, as long as it could be done safely. Two photographers accompanied me and documented our tests – which ended up taking six hours, as we journeyed through Marie and Pierre Curies&#39; spellbinding research and discoveries. Given the wealth of objects in the archive, I decided to focus on things that might transport us to two crucial periods in the Curies&#39; story: their early years, discovering radium together; and Marie Curie&#39;s time leading research at the Radium Institute, alone, after Pierre&#39;s death in 1906.</p><p>Ammerich shows me how to take meaningful measurements. He has brought a briefcase filled with different detectors. One is a yellow Geiger counter, about palm-sized, for two types of measurements. The first of these tests, measured in &#34;counts per second&#34;, detects whether radiation is present, in the form of alpha, beta or gamma rays. This overall test helps detect whether the object we are measuring is radioactive, or not.</p><p>If an object does register above-background radioactivity, the second measure we take shows the potential impact of these rays on the human body, measured in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/sievert">microsievert</a> per hour. This helps check if an object&#39;s level of radioactivity poses a risk to human health, by potentially raising the long-term risk of cancer. We also use a spectrometer, which can pick up more detailed information, such as which radioactive element is being measured. And we test some non-radioactive surfaces, as a control.</p><p>Ammerich had already previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpcirkus.org/images/JT4_2022/presentations/14.%20Musée%20Curie.pdf">tested</a> all the objects we look at, as part of his evaluation of the collection. He has also assessed if there was a risk to museum visitors or staff, from the weakly radioactive objects. &#34;There&#39;s no danger, nothing,&#34; he says, for either of those groups, based on his assessment. Nor was there any risk to us as we measured these objects – which we simply did to allow me to understand, and report on, the radioactive traces.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4r5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout A box containing a lab note written by the Curies during their discovery of radium (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>A box containing a lab note written by the Curies during their discovery of radium (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="a-radioactive-lab-note"><b id="a-radioactive-lab-note">A radioactive lab note</b></span></h2></p><p>In an office above the museum&#39;s archive, Huynh opens a box with a small radioactivity warning sticker on the side.

Marie Curie writes the result down as 223.3 – very close to the weight as it is known today, of 226. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a remarkable document,&#34; Huynh says. &#34;It&#39;s the calculation proving that, yes, it has an atomic weight that makes it different from other elements, that gives it a place in the periodic table, and it&#39;s also written during a period of such intellectual energy.&#34;</p><p>In fact, Frédéric Joliot, the Curies&#39; son-in-law, made a print of this lab note with a <a target="_blank" href="https://musee.curie.fr/blog/la-fiche-radioactive">photographic plate</a> in the 1950s to show the contamination, and also measured it with a ticking Geiger counter – possibly making him the first person to <a target="_blank" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3198s/f1006.item">investigate</a> his extended family&#39;s radioactive heritage. &#34;It&#39;s moving to hear ... the very same radium extracted and handled by Pierre and Marie Curie&#34;, making itself known through the detector&#39;s sound, he wrote at the time.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl4wt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout The note by the Curies, with Pierre&#39;s looser handwriting and Marie&#39;s neater writing (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The note by the Curies, with Pierre&#39;s looser handwriting and Marie&#39;s neater writing (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="the-secrets-of-parisian-pavements"><b id="the-secrets-of-parisian-pavements">The secrets of Parisian pavements</b></span></h2></p><p>As we measure the objects, we also take measurements of surfaces that have nothing to do with the Curies and their legacy, to give us something to compare our other readings against. </p><p>An ordinary Parisian parquet floor, in a building that was never used by the Curies, gives a reading of 0.11 microsievert per hour. This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09553002.2024.2418495">background radiation</a> which an average person is exposed to every day, from natural sources such as the ground and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irsn.fr/savoir-comprendre/sante/lexposition-radioactivite-naturelle-france">cosmic radiation</a>, Ammerich says. He points out that we humans are also radioactive ourselves, as we contain radioactive elements such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irsn.fr/foire-questions/faq-radioprotection-lhomme">potassium</a>. In France, the legal limit of a person&#39;s exposure to radioactivity, in addition to natural and medical exposure, is 1 millisievert (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.irsn.fr/foire-questions/faq-radioprotection-lhomme">1,000 microsievert</a>) per year for members of the public. For workers in nuclear facilities, it&#39;s 20 millisievert (20,000 microsievert) per year. </p><p>Placed on an ordinary stretch of pavement outside the building, the reading rises slightly, to 0.19 microsievert per hour. That&#39;s because Parisian pavements are made of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09553002.2024.2418495">granite</a>, which can contain radioactive elements such as uranium, Ammerich says.</p><p>We take turns carefully hovering the Geiger counter over the Curies&#39; lab note. It buzzes, having detected above-background levels of radioactivity, especially towards the bottom of the page, where human hands may have touched it more. But the levels are very low, and from a human health and safety perspective, the lab note is not dangerous at all, Ammerich and Huynh say.</p><p>In the museum, we measure the public areas where visitors walk – they measure at background levels, of around 0.11 microsievert per hour: &#34;It&#39;s the level of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09553002.2024.2418495#abstract">natural radioactivity</a>, of the ground, the Sun, the people all around us, with their potassium,&#34; says Ammerich. The back of Marie Curie&#39;s office chair; the doorknob; and an instrument called a piezoelectric quartz electrometre, which the Curies used to measure radioactivity, all measure somewhat above those background levels, but still well within safe ranges.</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl5bf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout Measuring the 1902 lab note with a dosimetre, which displays the presence of radium, Ra-226 (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Measuring the 1902 lab note with a dosimetre, which displays the presence of radium, Ra-226 (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p>The overall safety assessment of any given place or object is not only based on such measurements, Ammerich explains. Instead, it is estimated based on a range of factors, including the length of time of the exposure, the distance to the object, and which parts of the body are exposed to it. The different types of rays also matter: alpha rays can be mostly stopped by human skin, and completely stopped by a sheet of paper, he explains. Gamma rays are more penetrating, but can be stopped by concrete or lead. Radium, the chief source of contamination for the Curies&#39; heritage, gives off alpha, beta and gamma rays, but mostly alpha. Ammerich&#39;s risk assessment for the museum&#39;s visitors as well as for museum staff was based on thorough measurements of all the objects, along with those comprehensive factors, and found that there was no risk.</p><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="&#39;glowing-like-fairy-lights&#39;"><b id="&#39;glowing-like-fairy-lights&#39;">&#39;Glowing like fairy lights&#39;</b></span></h2></p><p>The Curies themselves noticed that their radioactive materials, such as radium salts and radioactive gases, were contaminating everything else in the shed.</p><p>&#34;The dust, the air in the room, the clothes are <a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Doctoral_thesis_by_Marie_Curie_%281903%29.pdf">radioactive</a>,&#34; Marie Curie reports in her doctoral thesis in 1903.</p><p>Still, at this stage, the Curies did not seem worried for their safety: their only concern was that the contamination might muddle their scientific <a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Doctoral_thesis_by_Marie_Curie_%281903%29.pdf">results</a>.</p><p>Marie Curie and others noticed, over time, that her hands were &#34;calloused, hardened, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/madamecuriebiogr00evec_0/page/384/mode/2up?q=372">deeply burned by radium</a>&#34;.

The worry was that leaving it in place could mean it would end up with a future owner who might not know about its past, and might use or process the wood in ways that would spread the contamination.</p><p>With Langevin-Joliot&#39;s agreement, the cupboard was cut into pieces and incinerated in a radioactive waste facility, Benoit explains: &#34;The cupboard doesn&#39;t exist anymore. It&#39;s sad, it was heartbreaking, but that&#39;s how it is.&#34;</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lgl5nh.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout Marie Curie&#39;s visiting card on her desk in Paris (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)"/><span>Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Marie Curie&#39;s visiting card on her desk in Paris (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="thinking-about-risk"><b id="thinking-about-risk">Thinking about risk</b></span></h2></p><p>Today, radium is sometimes described as <a target="_blank" href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/88/radium">the most radioactive natural element</a> ever discovered. But Benoit challenges that description. From a safety perspective, &#34;saying that one element is more radioactive than another, doesn&#39;t really make sense&#34;, he says, since estimating radioactivity is more complex than just measuring an element&#39;s level of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/activity-radioactivity">activity</a> (the rate at which the radioactive element decays, measured by counting the number of disintegrations per second). One must also consider its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nrc.gov/materials/types/radium.html">half-life</a>, the time required for half of it to decay – in the case of radium, 1,600 years – he says, as well as the actual impact on humans, which in turn depends on a range of factors. </p><p>&#34;If you take carbon-14, for example – yes, that&#39;s an element that emits radiation. But only over a very weak distance, only a few centimetres,&#34; he says. He puts his finger on the table, between our coffee cups. &#34;So if it were placed here, we could sit where we&#39;re sitting, and we wouldn&#39;t risk anything.&#34;</p><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="the-lead-coffins"><b id="the-lead-coffins">The lead coffins</b></span></h2></p><p>There is a tragic side to the Curies&#39; legacy. Already in the early days of working with radium in the shed, Pierre noticed that he felt increasingly sick. Marie Curie also felt sick, struck by a mysterious fatigue. She died at 66, of leukaemia, a cancer of the blood. It may not have been radium that killed her: Huynh says the culprit was more likely her work with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69617/69617-h/69617-h.htm">X-Rays</a> during World War One, which would have exposed her to the kind of radiation known to raise the risk of leukaemia. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://musee.curie.fr/decouvrir/la-famille-curie/biographie-d-irene-et-frederic-joliot-curie">Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> died in their late 50s, also of cancer. Before his death, Frédéric had been especially active in improving safety regulations and equipment for people working with radium, Huynh says.</p><p>Today, the Curies are entombed in a crypt of the Panthéon monument in Paris, in lead coffins, to block any potential radiation from traces inside (or on) their bodies. They were previously buried in a cemetery just outside of Paris. In the 1990s, before they were transferred to the Pantheon, radiation experts exhumed and tested their bodies, detecting some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bshr.org.uk/journals/IL37.pdf">radioactive contamination</a>, before laying them to rest in the lead coffins. </p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>If we don&#39;t protect our material heritage, we&#39;ll be a society without any historical depth – Thomas Beaufils</span></p></div></div><p>For Ammerich, the experience of handling the couple&#39;s belongings remains very moving. &#34;When I tested Marie Curie&#39;s diary, where she writes about her husband&#39;s death – I&#39;ll be honest with you, I had tears in my eyes,&#34; he says.</p><p>In his view, it would be a shame to remove the small remaining traces in her Paris office: &#34;Imagine if you cleaned everything off, and then in the future, nothing would prove what happened here.&#34;</p><p>&#34;From a historical point of view, our societies are built on these kinds of objects and memories from the past. If we don&#39;t protect our material heritage, we&#39;ll be a nation, a society, without any historical depth,&#34; Beaufils says. &#34;And a society without depth will struggle to develop, and to thrive,&#34; both from a social and technological point of view, he adds.</p><p>Huynh sees the Curie Museum as &#34;a link between the past and the future&#34;, especially given its location on a busy cancer research campus, the <a target="_blank" href="https://institut-curie.org/">Institut Curie</a> Research Center. When I visit, I see researchers mingling in the rose garden by Marie Curie&#39;s lab – dressed in jeans and T-shirts, not suits and long dresses, as they would have been during her time. Huynh tells me there are also active labs on the floors above and below the museum.</p><p>&#34;Many researchers here are very proud of that heritage,&#34; he says. &#34;It&#39;s a kind of &#39;Curie spirit&#39;.&#34;</p><p>--</p><p><i id="if-you-liked-this-story,">If you liked this story, </i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;"><i id="sign-up-for-the-essential-list-newsletter">sign up for The Essential List newsletter</i></a><i id="–-a-handpicked-selection-of-features,-videos-and-can&#39;t-miss-news,-delivered-to-your-inbox-twice-a-week."> – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can&#39;t-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</i> </p><p><i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on">For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/"><i id="facebook">Facebook</i></a><i id=",">, </i><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future"><i id="x">X</i></a> <i id="and">and </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><i id="instagram">Instagram</i></a><i id=".">.</i><i id=""> </i></p></article></div>
