    <p>Hello this is Theodore Nichols and welcome to my world wide web page.</p>
    <p><u>Update 5/6/2025</u> My <a href="https://x.com/LegbootLegit/status/1919745971673551192" target="_blank">neighbor hurt himself</a> and is now Beefing with me about the coins. He has <a href="https://x.com/LegbootLegit/status/1919885715745202532" target="_blank">not returned my prototype thnickels</a> yet. Please help me share awareness of this situation.</p>
    <p><u>Updated 5/1/2025:</u> I have partnered with someone to help me take <a href="https://www.legboot.com/thnickels-pre-order/">pre-orders</a> for thnickels. Slots limited.</p>
    
    <p><u>Updated 4/30/2025:</u> I have received hundreds of e-Mails from my flyer. I told my grandson that flyers still work in this day and age. He said societal media is the only way, but I was right. And he is still very thin. <b>Thank you all for the interest, I will be in touch.</b></p>
    <p><u>Updated 4/24/2025:</u> Thank you for the huge interest in my coins. Yes there are some pre order slots left but going fast.</p>
