    <h1>Who owns the copyright to my medical images? (2018)</h1>

<p>I popped round to an NHS dentist a few months ago - and they stuck my head on one of these contraptions.</p><p>Afterwards, I asked the dentist if I could have a copy of the scan. She wasn&#39;t terribly sure. She <em>thought</em> that she had to charge me for it. Then wondered if there was a data protection problem. Then started talking about copyright and the licence that they had signed with the machine&#39;s manufacturer.</p><p>As I&#39;m disinclined to argue with anyone wielding a syringe and bone-saw, I asked if I could take a photo of the screen.  That was acceptable to her.</p><p>So - who owns the copyright on medical images?  Some points to consider:</p><ul><li>The NHS is free at the point of use - but I pay a small fee for dentistry. So am I the customer?</li><li>The dentist and assistant posed me correctly, but left the room and let the machine take my photo. Who created the image?</li><li>I didn&#39;t sign anything about copyright.</li><li>Could a manufacturer claim copyright of images created with their tool?  What about the data they derive from analysing the image?</li><li>Can a patient be trusted not to do anything stupid with their medical data - like post it on their blog?</li></ul><p>As medical technology gets more sophisticated - and more Internet connected - this will become an increasing problem.</p><hr/><p>Comments from Tweeps:<br/></p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had 2 examples in last months - NHS xray of fractured finger told couldn&#39;t have image and couldn&#39;t take picture (due to social media abuse &amp; cloning).
