He argued at trial that what he had said was true.</p>  <p>But in a ruling on the case, B.C. Supreme Court Justice Nitya Iyer found that Ginther was not a credible witness and he had not proven the allegations.</p> </section> <div> <section aria-describedby="advertisment9640676395711580404827181507832123">  <div>  <div id="ad__inner-3"> <div data-ad="[[7,7],[1200,250],[1200,90],[970,90],[970,250],[728,90],[300,250]]" data-ad-interscroller="7x7" data-ad-loc="3" data-ad-mobile="[[7,7],[300,250],[320,50],[300,50]]" id="ad-3"> <div aria-hidden="true"> <div> This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </div> <section>   <p>“I conclude that the defendant defamed the plaintiffs in his Google and Yelp reviews,” said the judge.</p>  <p>Longhouse, a family business, claimed that Ginther had damaged their reputation and caused them economic loss, and that he had acted with malice. They sought general, aggravated and punitive damages totalling $675,000, as well as special costs.</p>  <p>But the judge said the amount for general damages being sought, $125,000 each for Brian and Moila Jenkins, the two named principals of the company, was excessive because there was no evidence that anyone who knew them and read the reviews believed Ginther’s accusations.</p>  <p>“The ubiquity of Internet reviews is now a fact of business life.
