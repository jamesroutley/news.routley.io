The concept emphasizes security over compliance and encourages private innovation to provide the solution.</p> <p>There is a mountain of effort behind the scenes to keep a program like FedRAMP moving forward.

As circumstances and priorities change across the government, our attrition rate is lower than anticipated a month ago. We said goodbye to many people this month, including four federal staff and 26 contracted security reviewers who supported FedRAMP for many years and recently completed a record-breaking three month review marathon that exceeded expectations.</p> <p>Our team still has the right folks to deliver against FedRAMP 20x expectations and will continue to demonstrate our commitment through collaboration with stakeholders and continuous incremental delivery.</p> <p>To have your voice heard about changes to the program, review and comment on our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/rfcs/">RFCs</a>, join the discussion in our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/working-groups/">community working groups</a>, and consider participating in our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one">FedRAMP 20x Phase One pilot</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/blog/"><i></i> Back to Blogs</a></p> </div></div>
