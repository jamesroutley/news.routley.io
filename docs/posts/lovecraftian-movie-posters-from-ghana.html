    <h1>Lovecraftian movie posters from Ghana</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The first regular movie screenings in Gold Coast colony took place in Accra shortly after 1900 when traveling showmen from other parts of West Africa began screening their wares in various coastal cities on tours that took place over a period of months. The Gold Coast’s first purpose-built movie theatre, constructed by the British businessman John Bartholomew on Station Road in Accra, dates from 1914, just seven years after the first purpose-built theatre appeared in the United Kingdom, illustrating the very rapid spread of cinema technology and film entertainment across the empire although the logistical and financial challenges of operating in a colonial location limited further expansion at that time.</p>
<cite>Gareth McFeely, <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/15684?show=full">“Gone Are The Days”: a social and business history of cinema-going in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1910-1982</a> (2015) 138</cite></blockquote>



<p>The British Empire claimed the Gold Coast in Western Africa as a colony from 1821-1957, and for many years it was white British businessmen who dominated the modest cinema industry and controlled what kinds of films were shown and when—and sometimes to whom, as Batholomew’s theater sometimes staged “Europeans Only” showings (McFeely 142). The modest little industry expanded slowly through the period of silent films and into the era of sound, marketing primarily English-language British and American films to an increasingly English-speaking and English-literate audience. Films were subject to the approval of the Cinematograph Exhibition Censorship Board of Control and other British laws and regulations.</p>



<p>Even as neighborhood theaters continued to expand to meet the needs of a growing urban population, beginning in the 1940s, the colonial government’s Gold Coast Film Unit also used buses to distribute documentary films, newsreels, and government information films to rural areas, including propaganda films produced by the Colonial Film Unit. In 1957, Ghana achieved independence and operated as a commonwealth realm; the new government took over the colonial-era government’s production and showing of films, and this continued when Ghana became a republic in 1960, with the government-owned Ghana Film Industry Corporation established in 1964 and the state-owned West African Pictures Co. Ltd., which ran a chain of movie theaters. Foreign entities like AMPECA (American Motion Picture Export Company) had to deal not just with government regulations and censorship, but sometimes direct competition with private theater owners in Ghana.</p>



<p>Political unrest and economic hardship rocked Ghana for much of the later 20th century, notably the 1966 military coups of 1966, 1972, 1979, and 1981; the government finally transitioned back to civilian democratic rule in 1993. During this period of turmoil, film censorship in the country slackened:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Films such as <em>Blacula</em> and <em>The Exorcist</em> underline the mild nature of censorship in the mid1970s: a decade earlier the censor banned almost all horror films, never mind ones that contained dramatic scenes of bodies rising from the dead or adolescent girls possessed by evil spirits.</p>
<cite>Gareth McFeely, <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/15684?show=full">“Gone Are The Days”: a social and business history of cinema-going in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1910-1982</a> (2015) 311</cite></blockquote>



<p>Economic hardship still continued, with inflation, widespread unemployment, and sometimes radical shifts in government policies all making it more costly to import films and keep up ticket receipts. Worse, after the 1981 coup the government enacted a nighttime curfew that lasted for two years, effectively destroying the old business model of nighttime cinema screenings.</p>



<p>In the early 1980s, the first independent films were produced in Ghana, many taking advantage of the Video Home System (VHS) technology to film direct-to-video. Videocassette recorders (VCRs) first became commercially available in the mid-1950s, but it wasn’t until the 1970s that home systems became commercially viable, with VHS emerging as the dominant format. The increasing availability and lowering costs of VHS VCRs spurred the home video market; films that were previously only available in traditional movie theaters could now be rented or purchased to view at home for relatively little cost, and the smaller, more portable, and cheaper VHS cameras lowered costs for independent filmmakers. Video rental stores proliferated in countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and some filmmakers and distributors increasingly skipped traditional theater releases, releasing their films directly to video.</p>



<p>In many ways, the VCR changed how people all over the world watched and interacted with movies. Video cassettes were now marketed directly to the public, with the art on the paper sleeve taking the place of the traditional cinema poster. The lowering cost and increasing availability of video cassette technology allowed it to penetrate new global markets. You no longer needed to build a special building just to show films, and entrepreneurs were no longer restricted to government-made entertainment or officially licensed imports. In the 1980s, as the first independent Ghanaian filmmakers were shooting direct-to-video, small VCR-based theaters and video clubs began to pop up in urban areas of Ghana like the capital Accra, often with pirated video tapes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the widespread introduction of foreign videocassettes into Ghana in the mid-1980s, a group of entrepreneurs created small-scale mobile film distribution empires, sending their agents out on the road with videocassettes, television monitors, VCRs, portable gas-powered generators and rolled-up canvas movie posters. This mobile cinema phenomenon quickly became a part of the cultural domain of even the smallest villages and hamlets in the Ghanaian countryside. In the early years a big city distributor or his aide would roll into town—often by bus—possibly for three or four days, and begin the local version of a movie marathon. By day this would generally occur within the confines of a family home or possibly some small communal meeting center, such as a social club; by night, weather permitting, in the open air. By the early 1990s, these mobile cinema operations had peaked and local businessmen at the village level had largely replaced their traveling predecessors, purchasing their own TV sets, generators and VCRs. In order to assist with marketing, the big city distributors continued to provide a hand-painted-on-canvas movie poster with each cassette they rented or sold.</p>
<cite>Ernie Wolfe III, “Adventures in African Cinema, 1975-1998” in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Canvas-Hand-Painted-Movie-Posters/dp/096642722X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ancienthist0b-20&amp;linkId=cf08290eaaa691bb26fe42071a917a4d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Extreme Canvas </a></em>(2000) 25-26</cite></blockquote>



<p>The timeline for when exactly hand-painted posters emerged in Ghana is unclear; through the 1970s Ghanaian theaters would use standard industry posters:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main methods of advertising to this varied clientele were posters outside the theatres and the projection of trailers for coming attractions. Until the 1970s, American and British film distribution companies supplied posters and other advertising materials at the same time as the reels of film, while locally hand-painted canvas posters, similar to the vivid panels used to publicize concert party performance, were also used at times.</p>
<cite>Gareth McFeely, <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/15684?show=full">“Gone Are The Days”: a social and business history of cinema-going in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1910-1982</a> (2015) 166</cite></blockquote>



<p>Using pirated VHS tapes would mean no official marketing materials, however; to advertise these films, local Ghanaian artists were commissioned to hand paint posters, often on cheaply available materials like flour sacks (and later, locally milled linen canvases, Wolfe 26). These were typically local commercial artists—sign painters and the like—who watched the film or used existing video cassette box art for inspiration. Many of these were foreign films, produced in Hong Kong, India, Nigeria, and the United States; as a consequence, the artistic sensibilities and commercial priorities for these handmade signs were very different from Hollywood or Bollywood counterparts. Few actor names appear, and the posters may feature nudity, graphic violence, gore, and spoilers that didn’t appear in the original advertising materials.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the late 1990s cheap preprinted publicity materials had crowded local advertising traditions out, while the video club boom had also peaked, reducing the demand for eye-catching advertising materials in a market where profit margins were razor-thin.</p>
<cite>Gareth McFeely, <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/15684?show=full">“Gone Are The Days”: a social and business history of cinema-going in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1910-1982</a> (2015) 166</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Pure economics ultimately brought about the demise of this once-thriving and extremely localized contemporary African painting phenomenon. By 1996, with the Ghanaian economic boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s nearing its end, mobile cinemas were all but gone and video clubs had reached their peak. Business interested outside of Ghana, often from Europe, had begun providing many more video titles to the local marketplace, and with them for the first time came a large inventory of free offset-printed posters.</p>
<cite>Ernie Wolfe III, “Adventures in African Cinema, 1975-1998” in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Canvas-Hand-Painted-Movie-Posters/dp/096642722X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ancienthist0b-20&amp;linkId=cf08290eaaa691bb26fe42071a917a4d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Extreme Canvas </a></em>(2000) 26, 28</cite></blockquote>



<p>By the 2000s, the hand-painted movie poster tradition was in serious decline; the spread of television in Ghana, the advent of digital video discs, and mobile video streaming increasingly made home viewing more accessible and affordable to local audiences. The Ghanaian movie posters began to receive international recognition with the publication of works like <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Canvas-Hand-Painted-Movie-Posters/dp/096642722X?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ancienthist0b-20&amp;linkId=cf08290eaaa691bb26fe42071a917a4d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Extreme Canvas</a></em> (2000) and art gallery exhibitions. As local demand declined, the market for such art shifted. Original posters became collectibles to be displayed in art galleries and sold on eBay; new posters might be commissioned and prints sold through marketers like the <a href="https://deadlypreygallery.com/">Deadly Prey Gallery</a> for a Western audience who appreciated the aesthetic, or produced for exhibitions of contemporary African art—but the original theaters and context in which these artworks first emerged is essentially gone.</p>



<p>Of all the films to receive the Ghanaian treatment, very few are examples of Lovecraftian cinema. While potentially any video cassette could make its way to Ghana, there were a few practical limitations when considering such works that have come to light: the film had to be released on video cassette between c. 1985-1999, a relatively available mainstream or direct-to-video release and would need to be sufficiently lurid or gory to appeal to Ghanaian audiences—or at least, to produce a poster sufficiently striking or memorable to be subsequently noticed and reproduced for Western audiences. By no means has every handpainted movie poster from Ghana been preserved; these posters are the quintessence of ephemeral commercial art, aging quickly and destined to be eventually discarded once their purpose was served.</p>



<p>In practice, this rules out the early Lovecraftian films of the 1960s like <em>The Haunted Palace </em>(1963), <em>Die, Monster, Die! </em>(1965), or <em>The Curse of the Crimson Altar </em>(1968), and more obscure or international independent efforts like <em>Cthulhu Mansion </em>(1990) or <em>Cthulhu </em>(2000), leaving a handful of adaptations and more loosely Lovecraftian films.</p>



<h2>The Dunwich Horror (1970)</h2>



<p>A loose update and adaptation of Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror,” set in the contemporary late 1960s. While there are few gory scenes in the film, the psychedelic visuals, <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>-esque plot, and a brief scene of Wilbur Whateley’s twin brother might all appeal to horror aficionados in Ghana.</p>

<p>These posters all follow the official marketing for <em>The Dunwich Horror </em>(1970) fairly closely, and given when the film was released—before the “Golden Age” of hand-painted posters, when official posters were in circulation—some of the earlier artists may well have seen versions of that poster and consciously modeled their images on that. It’s notable that the poster signed A. Michael Art, which is probably the most recent, differs much more markedly in the design (even depicting actress Sandra Dee as Black!), and with several uncharacteristic elements not in the film (the grasping hands, the rope around her neck). What’s really striking is how all of the artists chose to depict the tentacles as snake-like hair, turning Wilbur Whateley’s twin into a gorgon-like figure.</p>



<h2>Re-Animator (1985), Bride of Re-Animator (1990), and Beyond Re-Animator (2003)</h2>



<p>The first Lovecraftian film by director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuzna was an update and adaptation of “Herbert West–Reanimator,” followed by sequels <em>Bride of Re-Animator</em> and <em>Beyond Re-Animator.</em> Unlike the rather sedate Lovecraft adaptations of the 60s, this was a horror comedy with outstanding practical gore effects, black humor, vivid action, and intense visuals. It is little surprise that it attracted the attention of Ghanaian audiences.</p>

<p>The gore and nudity in <em>Re-Animator</em>, <em>Bride of Re-Animator </em>(labeled as <em>Re-Animator 2</em> above), and <em>Beyond Re-Animator</em> gave Ghanaian artists plenty of opportunity to use their own imaginations, with the decapitation of Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) given the spotlight. Two of the posters closely follow international marketing materials, albeit with their own Ghanaian spin (the reanimating reagent is replaced with blood in the first poster featuring Jeffrey Combs as Dr. Herbert West, and Barbara Crampton appears to have gotten a breast augmentation and is no longer censored by the blood drop in the lovingly rendered head-giving-head scene). While not explicitly labeled as <em>Beyond Re-Animator</em>, the final poster is easy to identify as that film because of the distinct depiction of the scene where a rat fights a reanimated penis (although in the film, the testicles are not attached).</p>



<p>Very noticeable about these posters is the skill and attention given to the lettering; while some of the artists may have closely copied other posters or appear to have been told the plot of the movie instead of watching it, the lettering on the titles is terrific.</p>





<p>As a related piece of work, consider this poster for <em>Dr. Giggles </em>(1992). Jeffrey Combs doesn’t appear in this movie—the eponymous doctor was played by Larry Drake—but Dr. Herbert West obviously resonated with at least one Ghanaian artist.</p>



<h2>From Beyond (1986)</h2>



<p>The second Lovecraftian film by director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuzna is an update and adaptation of Lovecraft’s “From Beyond.” This film doubles down on suggestions of sex and the visual effects, with inhuman monsters and grotesque transformations. Fewer posters of this work have been preserved.</p>

<p>The first poster for <em>From Beyond </em>is a not-entirely-inaccurate rendition of Dr. Pretorius (Ted Sorel) in his makeup; although the enlarged, external pineal gland has been rendered as a snake (shades of <em>The Dunwich Horror </em>posters). By contrast, the second post is completely unrecognizable as any imagery from the film, and indicates that the artist probably painted it based on a description or straight from the imagination.</p>



<h2>Evil Dead II (1987) &amp; Army of Darkness (1992)</h2>



<p>Director Sam Raimi’s <em>Evil Dead II </em>and its sequel <em>Army of Darkness</em> defined the look of the <em>Necronomicon</em> for moviegoing audiences for a generation, and the image of the book as roughly bound in human skin with an actual face visible on the cover continues to influence depictions of Lovecraft’s fictional tome today. Ghanaian artists seem less interested in depicting the <em>Necronomicon ex Mortis</em>, however, than they were with the character of Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) with his iconic chainsaw-prosthetic.</p>

<p>Between the two Sam Raimi films, there are a lot of great images and scenes for Ghanaian artists. Which is why it is surprising that the artists sometimes recombine the <em>Evil Dead </em>imagery with that drawn from other films, such as Amando de Ossorio’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombs_of_the_Blind_Dead">Blind Dead</a> </em>series, John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em>, and what might be <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkinhead_(film)">Pumpkinhead</a></em>. Which might be false advertising, but the important thing was to get butts in seats, and the more exotic imagery of some of the posters shows how syncrenistic these posters could be, borrowing horrific images from other films to fill in the space and spice up the post.</p>



<h2>Hellboy (2004)</h2>



<p>This adaptation of Mike Mignola’s comic book character to the silver screen by director Guillermo del Toro falls outside the “Golden Age” of Ghanaian movie posters, and posters for it may have been produced later for Western audiences. The final Lovecraftian villain for the film gets less attention than Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen (Ladislav Beran).</p>









<p>It’s interesting to note that the first two posters both mention Ron Perlman by name, which was rare during the Golden Age unless the lead was an international superstar like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bizarrely, David Hyde Pierce is also mentioned; Pierce had provided the voice for Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones), but went uncredited in the film.</p>



<p>Some readers might be disappointed that these hand-painted Ghanaian posters aren’t more “Lovecraftian” in the sense of emphasizing imagery familiar to Western audiences—there are scarcely any tentacles, nary a <em>Necronomicon</em>, no signs pointing to Dunwich or Arkham or Miskatonic University—but that is part of the point and the charm of these posters. They were being created outside the wider Western cultural milieu; they were at several removes from the original fiction H. P. Lovecraft wrote, and were working within their own cultural context, with images that stood out to them or made sense for their purpose.</p>



<p>This is Lovecraftian cinema as Ghanaians would have seen it in the 80s, 90s, and 00s. When school kids might wait for the sun to go down, praying it wouldn’t rain, and then crowding into an open-air theater, like a drive-in without cars, all eyes glued on the screen. There were people in Ghana that could chant “Klaatu barada nikto!” as loudly as anyone else anywhere else in the world, who would hold their breath as Dr. Pretorius’ head was lowered between a nubile pair of legs, or cringe as Ken Forey was eaten alive by things just beyond the edge of perception. It was their part of a shared experience, and these posters are the remnants of that, as surely as any Mythos tome ever stood as a record and monument of a lost age.</p>
