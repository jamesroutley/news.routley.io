                                 <p>The following strategy, <strong>SQ4R</strong>, is built around the idea that what you do <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> you read is as important as the reading itself.  Learning is an <em>active</em> process which requires concentration and energy.  Understanding and <em>using</em> the following strategies will increase your comprehension and your retention of the
                                    information.

                                       <p>Read the title and introductory paragraph(s).  Fix the name of the chapter in your
                                          mind.  Often the introduction to the chapter supplies background for recognizing the
                                          purpose of the chapter.  It may also state specifically the method of development
                                          the author intends to follow.

                                       <p>Read headings, subheadings, and italicized words.  Go through the chapter heading
                                          by heading; these will form a topical outline.

                                       <p>Read the summary at the end of the chapter.  Reread it to see which ideas the author
                                          restates for special emphasis or what general conclusions he or she comes to.  If
                                          there is no summary, read the last sentence or two before each new heading.

                                       <p>Answer the questions that you raised before you began to read.  Answer fully, and
                                          be sure to include the reasons the author believes the answer is true.  Recall the
                                          answer and do not refer to the book.

                                       <p>Tell yourself the major concept(s) of the section.  <strong>Put the ideas into your own words</strong>. If you simply <em>read </em>a textbook chapter, you will probably remember less than one-third of what you read
                                          by the following week.  In two months, you will remember about 14% of the material,
                                          hardly enough to do well on a test.  In order to transfer a greater portion of the
                                          material you read from your short-term to long-term memory, you must do something
                                          <em>active</em> with the information to help &#34;attach&#34; it to your memory.  If you take time after
                                          reading each section of the chapter to recite the information, you will ensure that
                                          more of it goes into long-term memory.  If you recite, you are likely to remember
                                          80% of what you read after a week and 70% after two months.  Now check your answers
                                          by referring to the book.

                                       <p>After having read a section and reflected on what you have read and questioned yourself
                                          about the material, you are ready to take notes.  Taking notes at this point in time
                                          will almost ensure that you are noting the important parts of the section.  Go back
                                          over the paragraphs and highlight or underline only the main ideas and supporting
                                          details with no more than 10-15% of the page highlighted.  Use marginal notations
                                          as a way to separate main ideas from examples and each of those from new terminology.
