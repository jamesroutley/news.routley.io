<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Started working on my project <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/slow-art-online">Slow Art Online</a>. Spent the morning just getting set up. I worked on a simple full-stack app for the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/finance/">CS50x Finance problem</a>, but it’s one thing to fill in the blanks in the distribution code for a class assignment and another to set up a project from scratch. I learned a lot (and learned how much more I have to learn) about virtual environments, dependencies, package managers, and so on.</li>



<li>In the afternoon, I paired w/ Bradley on getting the image from the Met API. We got the image link loading on a page, and after that, I was able to pass the variable to the Jinja template to load the image itself on the page. When the image appeared on the page, it was a thrill. “It works!” Those moments are so fun.</li>



<li>I plan to come back to this project during the batch and keep working on it since I could definitely use more API practice and I have a lot of ideas for the site.</li>
</ul>

<li>Need to investigate getting hot-reload working—it didn’t seem to be working and I had to restart the server to test new changes, which was not ideal.</li>
