    <h1>Discovering ptrace Is Discovering Pain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of my latest projects is writing <a href="http://github.com/hellerve/d">a debugger</a>. How hard can it be, I thought, I’m basically just wrapping system calls. So, to make things a bit more interesting, I decided to support both Linux and OS X. Some of you—the poor souls who’ve tried writing a debugger yourselves—might know where this is going. I really have no excuse: I knew about the incompatibilities and, like an idiot, decided to go for it anyway. Here is my story.</p>
<h2 id="elegy-to-a-system-call">Elegy to a system call</h2>
<p>For those of you who are lucky enough not to know about <code>ptrace</code>, let me introduce you: it is the mother of all system calls. The UNIX wizards of the 70s, in their infinite wisdom, decided to put all the facilities for inspecting and debugging a program into one single function call that has about a gazillion possible argument configurations, depending on what you want to do. Want to single-step through a program? Want to get the register contents, or modify them? Want to get or set memory? Want to work with breakpoints? <code>ptrace</code> is the answer to all of those questions. Its first argument, the <code>ptrace_request</code>, specifies what you want to do, and the arguments that come after that change according to that. Sounds like a job for multiple dedicated functions to me, but who am I to challenge the wisdom that was handed to us by the sages of Bell Labs?</p>
<pre><code>uint64_t get_instruction_pointer(pid_t pid) {
  struct user_regs_struct regs;
  ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, NULL, &amp;regs);
  /* rip is the instruction pointer register */
  return regs.rip;
}</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 1: An example of how to get the current instruction pointer using <code>ptrace</code>.</p>
<p>To my surprise, working with <code>ptrace</code> actually isn’t as painful as I made it sound. After understanding its idiosyncracies, it’s actually quite pleasurable. Sure, the names of the requests are different on BSD and Linux, but that’s nothing a few cleverly placed <code>define</code> statements can’t fix, right? At least the rest of the interface is the same.</p>
<p>Enter OS X. Someone—or, more likely, some committee—came to a conclusion that mirrors my complaints from earlier: let’s gut this hellish mutation of a system call and split it up into a bunch of different functions instead. Sounds like a good idea at first, until you realize that that means that you have to implement integral parts of your debugger again, and then hide all of that behind several massive <code>ifdef</code> statements.</p>
<p>I’d happily pay that price if it meant that the interface was any better. Sadly, this is not the case. Let’s consider the example I provided in Figure 1 and reimplement it for OS X. Feel the pain.</p>
<pre><code>uint64_t get_instruction_pointer(pid_t pid) {
  thread_act_port_array_t thread_list;
  mach_msg_type_number_t thread_count;
  x86_thread_state64_t thread_state;
  task_t port;
  mach_msg_type_number_t sc = x86_THREAD_STATE64_COUNT;

  task_for_pid(mach_task_self(), pid, &amp;port);

  task_threads(d-&gt;port, &amp;thread_list, &amp;thread_count);


  thread_get_state(thread_list[0], x86_THREAD_STATE64,
                   (thread_state_t)&amp;thread_state, &amp;sc);

  return thread_state.__rip;
}</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 2: Let’s just get this over wi—OH MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?!</p>
<p>Sorry you had to see that. I’m not going to walk you through that code—mostly because I think noone should have to know such a godawful API. If you’re persistent or masochistic enough to want to learn more, I suggest you <a href="http://uninformed.org/index.cgi?v=4&amp;a=3&amp;p=14">read this tutorial from Uninformed</a>.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, there is a mind-boggling scarcity of resources regarding this API, and the tutorials that do exist are outdated. The Uninformed article I linked to above talks about PowerPC, for instance, an architecture that is pretty outdated and rare these days. And this is one of the best resources I could find. How did I find out how to change the macros and function calls to the x86 equivalent? I’m so glad you asked: I grepped through <code>/usr/include</code> and tried a few wild guesses. My favorite part is that the x in <code>x86</code> is the only thing that’s not capitalized in the constant. Whoever decided on that naming caused me another minute of hell.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t portable across OS X machines either, because it’s architecture-dependent—<code>x86</code> has two different structs and constants for 32 and 64 bit, respectively, and then there’s also <code>i386</code> and <code>PPC</code>, but I sincerely hope I’ll never have the urge to support those.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>I guess the moral of the story is “be careful what you wish for”, because my timid wishes for a bit of modularity just landed me in <code>ifdef</code> purgatory. There is something to be learned even in Gehenna, though, and that’s something <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/On_API_Updates.html">I’ve written about before</a>: I like API updates. Some APIs need a thorough cleanup, and, much like people who change for the better, emerge as more productive members of society. I even applaud some updates that break my software, because they provide soothing for my code that has been plagued by a sore for no good reason. Sometimes, however, the updates don’t lead anywhere; either they don’t address a need/make things worse or they introduce incompatibilities that make supporting multiple platforms harder for the user. OS X’s API is a prime example for both of these points.</p>
<p>Wish me luck on my next adventures in writing a debugger.</p>
