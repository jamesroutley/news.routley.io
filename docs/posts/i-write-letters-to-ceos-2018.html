That&#39;s why I decided to freely give away ideas for new products, marketing strategies and businesses. Well, <em>almost freely.</em> <a href="https://www.johnwdefeo.com/articles/investing-lessons">I own stock in dozens of companies</a> and some of them may benefit from my ideas. If they win, I win. So, I mapped my ideas to my investments and drafted letters to their CEOs when I felt like I had enough to say.</p><p>Writing to a CEO is a curious thing. Executives travel a lot and many of them have assistants who screen their mail. Would my letters even be seen? Yes, it turns out.</p><p>Ian Cook, CEO of Colgate-Palmolive, wrote me a two-page letter that addressed my ideas point by point. Garry Ridge, CEO of The WD-40 Company sent me a handwritten letter and an autographed copy of his book. Gerald Shreiber, CEO of J&amp;J Snack Foods (the maker of SuperPretzels) forwarded my ideas to his marketing leaders. Chris Killingstad, CEO of Tennant Company, sent me a cordial reply. I even received a letter back from Warren Buffett (yes, that one).</p><p>As thrilling as it was to find these letters in the mailbox, the real thrill was to discover the hidden lessons in the responses that I received:</p><h2><strong>I Don&#39;t Know Everything</strong></h2><p>I&#39;m grateful that Ian Cook debunked many of my ideas by citing market research and Colgate-Palmolive&#39;s alternative strategies. (He did so in a kind and informative way.) It&#39;s no surprise that great companies often test and disprove ideas that sound good on paper. Thankfully, the letter that I wrote was friendly, not cocky. Acting like a know-it-all would have <a href="https://medium.com/@johnwdefeo/i-was-addicted-to-partisan-politics-9e84a5203b71">set me up to look like a fool</a>.</p><h2><strong>Good Ideas Aren&#39;t Always Good Opportunities</strong></h2><p>Two executives sent me responses that praised my ideas, but said that the <a href="https://www.johnwdefeo.com/articles/satisficing">opportunity cost</a> of implementing those ideas was too high. It&#39;s refreshing to see leaders who are focused and committed to pursuing what they believe are the best opportunities. I&#39;ve worked for companies where the leaders were seduced by any smooth pitch or shiny thing. It never ended well.</p><h2><strong>Making Time for People Is Important</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s amazing that the leaders of multi-billion dollar companies responded to my letters. I&#39;m not proud enough to believe that my letters were particularly special. Rather, I think the executives who responded to me are special leaders. The book that WD-40 CEO Garry Ridge sent me is about <a href="https://www.johnwdefeo.com/articles/great-business-lessons">investing in people and making time for them</a>. It&#39;s appropriately titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helping-People-Win-Work-Philosophy/dp/0137011717"><em>Helping People Win at Work</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Responsiveness Is Golden</strong></h2><p>For every CEO who wrote me back, two did not (even so, that&#39;s a great response rate!). Let&#39;s split these companies into two groups: respondents and non-respondents. From the time that I mailed my letters, the compound annual return of the respondent group is 8.97% greater than the non-respondent companies.</p><p>That&#39;s a huge difference that could mean millions of dollars in additional gains when projected over a lifetime! The sample size of this data is too small to be statistically valid, but I believe I witnessed something meaningful. Now, I look for companies whose leaders communicate well. Writing is thinking and executives who are clear in their words are likely to be clear in their thoughts.</p>
