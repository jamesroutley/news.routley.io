<p>Two dreaded words have the power to ruin employees and People team’s day: performance reviews. </p>



<p>GAH I tense up writing those words. </p>



<p>I’ve never met a People team that enjoys performance reviews. <em>If you do, drop me a line please!</em> Reviews are easy to deploy thanks to great softwares but a freakin’ pain in the behind to get folks to complete. </p>



<p>You’ve hit rock bottom during reviews when you’ve sent your 10th Slack asking a manager to complete their reviews. </p>



<p>Not to mention employees say reviews bring up feelings of anxiety and fear and contribute to their overall stress. Total flight or fight. ACK.</p>



<p><strong>So, if everyone hates performance reviews why do we do them? MAKE A SUBHEADLINE</strong></p>



<p>Because they can tell us how employees and in turn the company is performing!</p>



<p><strong>WRONG. </strong></p>



<p>Research shows that performance reviews can cost companies millions in terms of hours invested for <a href="https://www.synchr.com/resources/why-performance-reviews-dont-work#:~:text=Annual%20reviews%20aren&#39;t%20hitting,in%20reviews%20is%20not%20valuable"><strong>very little return</strong>.</a> </p>



<ul><li>90% of HR professionals say reviews don’t provide accurate results </li><li>58% of execs say reviews don’t drive success </li><li>14% of employees say reviews inspire them to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-reviews.aspx">improve their performance</a></li></ul>



<p>OOF that is the trifecta! </p>







<p>So, we all agree that reviews are ineffective and don’t give us good results. </p>



<p>But how did they get that way? </p>



<p>It’s a combination of things that contribute to making reviews ineffective. </p>



<p><strong>1. We’re trying to do too much with reviews. </strong>Review conversations have been used to:</p>



<ul><li>Provide feedback</li><li>Discussion compensation </li><li>Celebrate a promotion </li><li>Provide evidence to fire someone (<em>manage up or out, right? Gross</em>)</li></ul>



<p>It’s too much! Each of these bullet points could be a conversation on its own and when so many things get tossed into one conversation, the real message doesn’t land. </p>



<p>Leaving employees to wonder, <em>what is the actual purpose of performance reviews?</em></p>

<p><strong>2. Managers aren’t effective at giving feedback. </strong>Hey, I’ve been there too! Where you feel like you have a million tasks on your plate and the last thing you want to do is give your team feedback. You’re not alone.</p>



<p>Most managers are promoted because they’re good at their job NOT because they are good managers. Then, they’re not really provided with training on how to give feedback.  </p>



<p>Everyone has a horror story involving a terrible manager. Well, well, well how do you think we got here?</p>



<p>Companies <strong>do not </strong>invest enough in training and supporting managers. </p>



<p>When it comes to evaluations <em>some</em> managers are unable to provide accurate, actionable feedback. </p>



<p><strong>3. Performance reviews are riddled with bias. </strong>Y’all didn’t think I was going to talk about performance reviews and not mention bias, did you?? </p>



<p>I have biases. You have biases. We all have biases! Don’t believe me? </p>



<p>Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist who won a Nobel Peace prize for his work, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/sounding-the-alarm-on-system-noise">showed in his research</a> that the vast majority of human decisions aren’t made based on facts or logic <strong>rather </strong>intuition, bias and beliefs. </p>



<p>Bias can creep into performance reviews so easily. You can have the best intentions when going through a review process but the sneaky part of bias is that it can be<strong> unconscious</strong>. That unconscious bias can affect how you assess the performance of an individual without you even realizing. </p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c6lCDsNxtdyS0VhMIH2p1C8uAtZpSaXf3uYb5e7gFWUTUMSmx7Q_JCO-z3J3EQakpfTivFpJNb_DNU67Uz8Zp5OoTEeUjQ2AbU9zU7eumDl-27upEP5tCMU_DWHDR6biY-pygwYaqJnY0DTpXBk6IamhSrh8yQF5f6U1b4N6zgRrGjkv-tH3KUy5DQ" alt="" width="838" height="838"/></figure>



<p>So um… how could reviews ever be fair or effective? It feels pretty impossible but there are a few things People teams can do!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Build a culture of continuous feedback. </strong>Start with <strong>requiring </strong>managers to conduct 1:1 on a weekly or biweekly basis. By requiring managers to make time to give feedback they will <em>hopefully </em>give feedback. 1:1s should work like a two way street giving the employee time to share feedback and their perception of their performance. </li></ol>



<p>There are different types of 1:1s like general, tactical, growth, motivation, and alignment setting. Flexibility will be key as managers should guage what their employees need most that week. <a href="https://hypercontext.com/blog/meetings/121-questions-for-one-on-one-meetings#one-on-one-questions-managers">This question bank</a> has over 100+ questions over several categories you can use for 1:1s!</p>



<p><strong>A sample framework for your general 1:1: </strong><strong><em>30 mins</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>How is your week going?</li><li>What are some of your priorities for this week?</li><li>What challenges have you been having?</li><li>How can I help you?</li><li>What feedback do you have for me?</li></ul>



<p>With continuous feedback being a core part of your culture, reviews won’t be a time to pack everything into one conversation. The conversation will feel like an extension of an ongoing conversation. </p>



<p><strong>People teams: </strong>If 1:1s are required, how will you hold your managers accountable? </p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Monitor the bias. </strong>There are <a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/performance-review-bias">common biases</a> that show up in reviews such as:</li></ol>



<ul><li><strong>Primacy bias:</strong> letting something you learned early on influence your perception of someone’s performance.</li><li><strong>Recency bias:</strong> focusing on what happened recently rather than the entire time period. </li><li><strong>Halo/horns effect:</strong> letting good/bad traits overshadow others. </li></ul>



<p>Bias show up in reviews in several ways. From how employees are described to what feedback is being given. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90791371/the-one-word-that-shows-performance-reviews-are-still-terribly-biased"><strong>Studies have shown:</strong></a></p>



<ul><li>Women get 22% more personality feedback than men, for example calling women “nurturing” or “dedicated”</li><li>63% of men reported being described as “ambitious” compared to 17% of women </li><li>Black and Latino employees receive 2.4 times more <strong>not actionable </strong>feedback than their White and Asian counterparts.</li></ul>



<p>Before reviews begin, conduct a training on how bias can appear in reviews. While you can’t train the bias out of folks you can make them more aware! </p>



<p>People teams should monitor the feedback inputted in reviews and require that all ratings have examples.</p>



<ol start="3"><li>Train your managers. For the second week in a row, I’m including this in my tips section. Training you managers is the single most important thing you can do to resolve a lot of the problems that occur in the workplace. </li></ol>



<p>When it comes to performance reviews having managers that are strong at communicating, effective at giving feedback and empathetic enough to lead conversations will be a game changer. But none of that matters if managers can’t build trust with their teams. </p>



<p>Three training sessions I would recommend holding with managers prior to any review cycle:</p>



<ul><li>How to build trust with your team</li><li>How to write actionable feedback </li><li>How to deliver feedback</li></ul>

<p>I can’t let you leave without sharing my take on this. Don’t do reviews. </p>



<p>Performance reviews that happen 1 or 2 times a year contribute to this notion that performance is a linear line. </p>



<p><strong>But it rarely ever is.</strong> Your performance changes weekly. What happens if you have an off week right before a performance review, is that going to impact your performance and raise?<em> Maybe… </em></p>



<p>What if we could design a system that accounted for the fact that performance varies week over week? </p>



<p>You can. </p>



<p>There is a way to get quality performance data, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, in a meaningful way on things that are most important to the organization. </p>



<p>Like a product iterates in sprints, why can’t we approach employee performance like a sprint?</p>



<p><strong>Imagine the following scenario:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Employee &lt;&gt; manager check-in scheduled for every two weeks to discuss performance </li><li>At the end of the check-in both employee and manager answer 2-3 questions about performance, expectations, morale, etc. </li><li>At twice a year, employee &lt;&gt; manager meet for a longer period of time to discuss bigger career growth, goals and achievements </li></ul>



<p>Yes, this requires managers to make time for their employees. At the same time, it’s really a lighter lift than those one or two performance review a year. It could also resolve the feeling of anxiety and stress employees feel with reviews. </p>



<p><strong>Spoiler alert: </strong>I’m going to try rolling this out at Workweek in the next few months. I’ll be sharing everything I learn with this group! Hoping my hypothesis that more touch points around performance will lead to happier and more engaged employees. </p>
