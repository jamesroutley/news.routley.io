<p><span id="more-19692"></span>I have been thinking a lot about our forthcoming four-day trip to Berlin. We are squeezing this in between visits from overseas friends, and regular work and family commitments. From the reading I have done there is so much, maybe too much, to see and do in Germany&#8217;s capital. I naturally made a spreadsheet (thinking of you, LSE Boy) to help split the days into manageable chunks, with sit down dinners at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I am still figuring out whether to try Berlin&#8217;s famous <a href="https://www.exberliner.com/food/the-best-currywurst-in-berlin/">Currywurst</a> because I am not keen on street food and sauces dripping down onto my clothes. My back up plan, if I miss this, is to have it at <a href="https://www.germangymnasium.com">German Gymnasium</a> back in London.</p>
<p>There are various transport and sightseeing discount cards, and <a href="https://wonderfulwanderings.com/berlin-welcome-card/">this is an excellent article</a> explaining the differences between the <a href="https://www.berlin-welcomecard.de/en">Berlin Welcome Card</a> and the <a href="https://easycitypass.com/en/visit-berlin/">EasyCityPass Berlin</a>. We are using the former for our trip (only for the transport element).</p>
<p>The only timed tickets we needed to book ahead were to the <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en">Reichstag</a>, home to the <em>Bundestag</em> (German Parliament).</p>
<p>This is a summary of the resources I used. I want a holiday with plenty of history, walking and eating, and thought I should make a list for any future trip, as well as a go-to guide when I am in Berlin itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Useful tourist information websites:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.germany.travel/en/home.html">German National Tourist Board</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en">Visit Berlin</a></p>
<p><a href="https://citymapper.com/berlin">Citymapper Berlin</a> to get you from A to B by public transport</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/home/"><em>Staatliche Museen zu Berlin </em></a>(Berlin State Museums). Berlin&#8217;s national museums are closed on Mondays. Every first Sunday of the month is Museum Sunday in Berlin, and most museums have free admission then. I found a museum that had free entry on Thursday afternoons courtesy of a corporate sponsor, so do look out for such information on individual museum websites. Some of the exhibits and rooms might be closed for restoration work, and it&#8217;s best to take a chilled attitude to this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot see every museum and have decided to limit ourselves to the ones covered by the <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-pass-berlin">Museum Pass Berlin</a>. Download and <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/document/2022-08-29_Liste_Museumspass.pdf">print the list here</a> before you travel, as it has opening times and transport information. At-a-glance list of the <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museums-museum-pass">30 museums covered</a>.</p>
<p>I am big fan of Rick Steves and here is <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/europe/germany/berlin-itinerary">his suggested itinerary</a> of Berlin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/en/de/berlin-region/berlin/restaurants">Michelin food guide</a> currently lists 80 recommendations in Berlin. How many days do you have?</p>
<p>For young people i.e. those under 30 years of age, <a href="https://www.ginagoesto.com">Gina Goes To</a> is right up your street. I am using the list in Gina&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ginagoesto.com/home/2022/7/10/berlin-a-city-guide-">Berlin City Guide</a> for breakfast and cafe recommendations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guidebooks I used to plan this trip:</strong></p>
<p>If you live in London, Stanfords in Covent Garden specialises in maps and travel books. Otherwise, their <a href="https://www.stanfords.co.uk">website</a> lists a wide selection of books and maps for any country you can think of.</p>

<p><strong>Maps, which came before Apps:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Everyman Mapguides Berlin</em>, published by Everyman Citymap Guides, <span style="font-weight: 400;">ISBN 978-1841595696. I have several maps from this series as they are easy to fold out page-by-page and mark with the places you want to visit.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>comfort! map Berlin Map</em>, published by ExpressMap, ISBN 978-8380464117. Useful because of the laminated finish and the line showing the demarcation between (the previous) East and West Berlin.</p>

<p>A personal <strong>reading list to enhance your visit to Berlin</strong> and to engage with some aspects of Germany in World War II (in order of publication date):</p>
<p><em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> by John le Carré, published in 1963 and still available in various formats.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel</em> by James B. Donovan, published in 1964 and still available in various formats.</p>
<p><em>Munich</em> and <em>Fatherland </em>by Robert Harris.</p>
<p><em>The Boys in the Boat</em> by Daniel James Brown is out of print but used copies are available. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it covered topics I could engage with: world recession, rowing, education, dedication to a craft, family ties and how to overcome poverty with determination and vision.</p>

<p>A selected list of <strong>films set in Berlin </strong>or on aspects of Germany in World War II, some based on the books above (in chronological order of the the time it is set in):</p>

<p><strong>Selected reading on the Protestant Reformation:</strong></p>
<p>Wittenberg lies 88 kms south of Berlin, about 45 minutes by direct train from Berlin&#8217;s <em>Hauptbahnhof</em> (Central Station). Officially known as <a href="https://lutherstadt-wittenberg.de/en/">Lutherstadt Wittenberg</a> to mark its association with Martin Luther, this is where the Protestant Reformation began in 1517.</p>
<p>Each year the town hosts two Luther-themed festivals: <a href="https://lutherstadt-wittenberg.de/en/events/reformation-festival">Reformation Day</a> on October 31 and <a href="https://lutherstadt-wittenberg.de/en/events/city-festival-for-luthers-wedding">Luther’s Wedding</a>. The latter is held on the second weekend in June, when we will be in Berlin. We may not have time for a side trip and if we do, it should be to Potsdam, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Conference">Potsdam Conference</a> of 1945 was held. The background reading to the Reformation is very interesting because it effectively split Christian religious practices in Europe into Protestant North and Catholic South.</p>
<p><em>The Unquenchable Flame: Introducing the Reformation</em> by Michael Reeves, published by Inter-Varsity Press, ISBN 978 1 84474 3858</p>
<p><em>Rick Steve&#8217;s Berlin</em> (see above) has a very readable section on Luther, Wittenberg and the Reformation (pages 348 &#8211; 373)</p>
<p><em>A History of Christianity</em> by Diarmaid MacCulloch has a scholarly chapter on Luther, the Reformation and Reformed Reformation (sometimes called Calvinism). Published by Allen Lane, ISBN 978 0713 998696 (chapter 17, A House Divided, pages 604 &#8211; 654).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mind your Language:</strong></p>
<p>Finally, a German phrase book to learn some basic words. However I really am glad that English is widely spoken in Berlin. Most of the websites have pages in English. <em>DK Eyewitness German Phrase Book</em>, published by Dorling Kindersley, ISBN 978 0241289372. I have mainly been reading the Menu section so far&#8230;</p>
