            <h3>What is the Three-Body Problem?</h3>
            <p>
                The three-body problem is one of the most famous challenges in classical physics and celestial
                mechanics.
                It asks: given the initial positions, masses, and velocities of three bodies in space, can we predict
                their
                future motion under mutual gravitational attraction?
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the two-body problem (which has an exact analytical solution), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-body problem has no
                    general closed-form solution</a>. This makes numerical simulation the primary tool for studying
                these complex
                gravitational systems.

            <h3>N-Body Gravitational Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                This simulator uses Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation to model the gravitational forces between
                every pair of bodies:
            </p>
            <p>
                F = G × m₁ × m₂ / (r² + ε²)
            </p>
            <p>
                Each body experiences the <strong>sum of all pairwise gravitational forces</strong> from every other
                body.
                For N bodies, this requires calculating N(N-1)/2 force pairs each timestep. The ε² term is a softening
                parameter that prevents numerical singularities when bodies pass very close together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation supports multiple integration methods. By default, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Velocity_Verlet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velocity Verlet integration method</a>, a symplectic
                integrator that provides superior energy conservation compared to simpler methods like Euler
                integration.
                This makes it ideal for long-term orbital mechanics simulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can switch to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)</a> method in the Advanced
                Settings,
                which offers higher accuracy per timestep and typically shows lower energy drift in short simulations.
                However, RK4 is not symplectic and accumulates systematic phase errors over long simulation times,
                causing orbits to gradually decay or expand. This makes RK4 better suited for short to medium duration
                simulations where minimizing instantaneous error is the priority, while Verlet excels at maintaining
                correct orbital shapes over extended periods.

            <h3>Energy Conservation &amp; Simulation Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                The simulator displays two important energy metrics in the Advanced Settings panel:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Energy:</strong> The sum of kinetic energy (½mv²) and gravitational potential energy
                    (-Gm₁m₂/r) of all bodies. In an ideal gravitational system, this value should remain constant over
                    time.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Drift:</strong> The percentage change in total energy from the initial state. This
                    measures
                    the numerical accuracy of the simulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In real physics, energy is conserved in isolated systems. However, numerical integration methods
                introduce
                small errors at each timestep. The energy drift indicator helps you evaluate simulation quality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green (&lt;1%):</strong> Excellent energy conservation - the
                    simulation is highly accurate</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow (1-5%):</strong> Moderate drift - acceptable for most
                    purposes but consider reducing timestep</li>
                <li><strong>Red (&gt;5%):</strong> Significant drift - simulation may be
                    unreliable, reduce timestep or try other integration methods</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Velocity Verlet integration method is &#34;symplectic,&#34; meaning it preserves the phase-space structure
                of Hamiltonian systems. While RK4 typically shows lower energy drift in short-term simulations (better
                local accuracy), Verlet prevents systematic phase errors that accumulate over extended simulations.
                This makes Verlet ideal for long-term orbital mechanics where maintaining orbital stability over
                thousands of periods is more important than minimizing instantaneous error.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why is Total Energy Negative?</strong> In gravitational systems, total energy is often negative,
                and this is
                perfectly normal! Gravitational potential energy is defined as zero at infinite separation and becomes
                increasingly
                negative as bodies move closer together (PE = -Gm₁m₂/r). When total energy is negative, it means the
                system is
                <em>gravitationally bound</em> - the bodies don&#39;t have enough kinetic energy to escape to infinity, so
                they remain
                in orbit. This is exactly what you see in stable orbital systems like planets around stars or the
                choreographed
                orbits in this simulator. A negative total energy that remains constant indicates a stable, bound
                orbital system.
