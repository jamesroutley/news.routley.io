Felt like doing that research? Felt like doing the dishes?</p><p>Most of us do.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to start when we feel like it.</p><p>Unfortunately, we often don&#39;t.</p><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src="/assets/illustrations/feel_like_it.png" alt="We probably feel like it 4-5 times a month." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></p><p>We don&#39;t feel ready. We don&#39;t feel like the work is going to be good enough. We don&#39;t feel like we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-find-motivation-3-key-strategies-to-get-you-motivated">have the motivation.</a></p><p>The list goes on.</p><p>But here&#39;s the thing: <strong>we don&#39;t have to feel like it to start.</strong></p><p>We can start writing, even if we think the words are rubbish.</p><p>We can start creating, sketching, planning,... even though we&#39;re uncertain of the results of our efforts.</p><p>This may sound like BS, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a simple fact. Everyone of us has started despite not feeling like it at some point in our lives because we promised something to a friend, or because it really mattered to us, or because we were tired off putting something off.</p><p>And we can all train this ability every day, to work effectively and without stress.</p><p>Every time we consciously go &#34;Okay, let&#39;s do this&#34; instead of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/4-most-common-ways-of-getting-distracted">checking Twitter for the tenth time</a> this hour, we&#39;re training this ability.</p><h2>Tricks on how to start</h2><h3>&#34;Screw it, let&#39;s do it&#34;</h3><p>Billionaire Richard Branson has a catchphrase: &#34;Screw it, let&#39;s do it&#34;</p><p>He even wrote a book by that title. The lesson of it is simple: despite all the doubt, all the fear, all the negativity, let&#39;s take the leap.</p><p>Publish that post. Message that person. Start that company.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple mantra that can inspire you to <em>approach</em>, instead of <em>avoiding</em>.</p><p><strong>When you catch yourself ruminating on why something could fail or doubting whether you can take a bold step, go &#34;screw it, let&#39;s do it!&#34;</strong></p><h3>Start sloppy</h3><p>Another trick to start sloppy. Why start sloppy?</p><p>You might have high expectations of your finished work.</p><p>You want to write a great book, not just a good one. Or create a stellar artwork, or start a great business.</p><p>All those expectations can put more pressure on you than you can bear. More pressure often equals more procrastination.</p><p>Instead, you can escape those expectations by <em>starting deliberately badly.</em></p><p>Write a chapter of a book by hand, without editing anything - you know that&#39;s not going to get published.</p><p><strong>When you know that you don&#39;t have to make the greatest thing ever right from the start, it&#39;s much easier to start. And then it&#39;s easier to continue.</strong></p><h3>Start small</h3><p>You probably don&#39;t feel like creating a 20 slide presentation right now from scratch and presenting it in 2 hours.</p><p>You don&#39;t feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know.</p><p>You don&#39;t feel like running a marathon.</p><p>But you might feel like looking up a couple pictures or articles for the presentation.</p><p>Or feel like writing a paragraph or two before lunch break.</p><p>Or feel like taking a 5km walk.</p><p>Those are the small steps along the longer journey.</p><p>We often underestimate the power of small steps, but they are essential because they help us get into the right routine.</p><p>If you start running a couple miles every other day, you&#39;ll get familiar with the routine and then you&#39;ll naturally want to start increasing the distance. And eventually, you might get to running a full marathon.</p><p>The small steps, while they may seem tiny at the moment, are what will gradually lead to completing the longer journey.</p><p><strong>Don&#39;t underestimate small steps. If you&#39;re at the start of something, look for small steps (not giant goals) and get them done. And if you stumble, re-focus on the next small step you can take.</strong></p><p>So there you have it.</p><p><strong>Is it time to go &#34;screw it, let&#39;s do it&#34;?</strong></p><p><strong>Could a deliberately sloppy start help you move forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Or what&#39;s the smallest step you can take right now?</strong></p></article></div>
