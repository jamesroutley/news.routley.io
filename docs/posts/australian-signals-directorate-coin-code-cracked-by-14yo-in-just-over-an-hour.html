Can you imagine being his mum?</p><p>&#34;So we&#39;re hoping to meet him soon ... to recruit him.&#34;</p><figure role="group" data-print="inline-media" aria-labelledby="101402166" data-component="Figure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/101402166"><div><p><img alt="A man and a woman, both in suits, smile at the camera, standing in front of a very large 50-cent coin." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1185d4a9f3a115c5ed4b8831303eaa79?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=2366&amp;cropW=3549&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=160&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div><figcaption id="101402166" data-component="Figure__figcaption"> <!-- -->Ms Noble and Royal Australian Mint chief executive Leigh Gordon launched the coin on Thursday.<cite data-component="Figure__cite">(<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text"><span>ABC News: Mark Moore</span></span></span>)</cite></figcaption></figure><h2 data-component="Heading">A fifth level of encryption</h2><p>Ms Noble yesterday said the coin celebrated the work of the agency&#39;s members and the evolution of code-breaking, and that those who crack the codes could be &#34;pretty well placed&#34; to get a job at the ASD.</p><p>&#34;We thought this was a really fun way to engage people in code-breaking with the hope that, if they make it through all four levels of coding on the coin, maybe they&#39;ll apply for a job at the Australian Signals Directorate.&#34;</p><figure role="group" data-print="inline-media" aria-labelledby="101393032" data-component="Figure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/101393032"><div><p><img alt="A silver, 50-centre Australian coin, with the Queen&#39;s head." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ea0f60bd75671c59f3b973e14c108958?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=2823&amp;cropW=2823&amp;xPos=1080&amp;yPos=1088&amp;width=862&amp;height=862" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div><figcaption id="101393032" data-component="Figure__figcaption"> <!-- -->Both sides of the coin contain parts of ASD&#39;s encrypted puzzle.<cite data-component="Figure__cite">(<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text"><span>Supplied: Royal Australian Mint</span></span></span>)</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Ms Noble said that while there were no classified messages on the coin, those who crack the codes could discover &#34;some wonderful, uplifting messages&#34;.</p><p>&#34;Like the early code breakers in ASD, you can get through some of the layers with but a pencil and paper but, right towards the end, you may need a computer to solve the last level.&#34;</p><p>She also revealed on Friday that there was a fifth level of encryption on the coin which no one had broken yet.</p></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2022-09-02T07:13:48.000Z">13h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2022-09-02T07:13:48.000Z">13 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Fri 2 Sep 2022 at 7:13am</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2022-09-02T14:23:40.000Z">6h ago</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2022-09-02T14:23:40.000Z">6 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Fri 2 Sep 2022 at 2:23pm</time></p></div>
