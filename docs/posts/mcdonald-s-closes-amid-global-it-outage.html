</figcaption>  </figure><h2>What We Know</h2><p>A spokesperson from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/mcdonalds" data-sys="1">McDonald&#39;s</a> U.S. told <em>Newsweek</em>: &#34;We are aware of a technology outage, which impacted our restaurants; the issue is now being resolved. We thank customers for their patience and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Notably, the issue is not related to a cybersecurity event.&#34;</p><p>In Australia, internal systems at some restaurants have been offline since about 3:10 p.m. local time. Some stores have been forced to close completely, while others are only taking cash orders, according to a report by news.com.au.</p><p>Posting on X, formerly <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter" data-sys="1">Twitter</a>, McDonalds Japan said there has been a &#34;system failure,&#34; and that the company apologizes &#34;for any inconvenience this may cause and ask that you please wait for a while until the service is restored.&#34; It does not give the reason for why the outage has occurred.</p><figure><div><div><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【お知らせ】</p>— マクドナルド (@McDonaldsJapan) <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1768531382136136024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></blockquote></div></div>
</figure><p>A McDonald&#39;s employee in New Zealand told the <em>New Zealand Herald</em> that a computer server crash meant they couldn&#39;t take any orders or serve any food, with screens used to take orders currently not working.</p><p>New Zealand based X user Germin van Royen said: &#34;The Mcdonalds outage is crazy. Went in tonight and drive thru + all kiosks were down. A system that can fail nation wide is bad but across multiple countries too!? Bonkers.&#34;</p><p>Customers in Hong Kong have been able to purchase food, but cannot use mobile and self-ordering kiosks, according to a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/facebook" data-sys="1">Facebook</a> post on Friday. It says the outage is down to a &#34;computer system failure.&#34;</p>	<figure data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"><div><div id="v_embed"></div></div>
