<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>
The Retro-Computing Society of Rhode Island, Inc. exists to further the
preservation of historic computers and to increase the awareness of the
history of computers and their development. One of our primary goals is
to restore historical systems to operational condition.  We currently
function as a users&#39; group for those with an interest in vintage
computer hardware systems and software.</p>

<p>
RCS/RI provide a forum for discussing, and a means for exchanging,
information about computer systems and software that is of historic
interest.  This is done through a mailing list and this WWW site.  We
meet in person on the third Saturday of each month at our facility in
Providence, RI and hold our monthly <a href="https://rcsri.org/news.shtml">Open
House</a> on that day.</p>

<p>
Founded in the autumn of 1994 as an informal association of computer-
history enthusiasts, RCS/RI incorporated on 1 January, 1998 under the
laws of the State of Rhode Island as a non- profit corporation and is
governed by a board of directors.</p>

<p>
We lease a 1,500 square- foot space in an old mill complex which serves
as our main facility. That location is used for office space, a
documentation library and media archive, and a workspace to repair
systems and storage for the RCS/RI collection of historic computers.
The collection may be viewed by appointment, but please
<a href="https://rcsri.org/info.shtml">contact us</a> at least a week in advance
to make arrangements if you&#39;d like to visit on a day other than the
monthly open house.</p>

<p>
RCS/RI are based in Providence, RI with individuals from throughout
southeastern New England (and a few more distant).  While it was
decided to start the group locally to encourage meeting in person, all
are welcome to participate.  There are no dues or membership fees for
casual association nor is admission charged to view the collection.</p>
