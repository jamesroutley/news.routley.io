    <h1>What 2023 will bring for PeerTube</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We (Framasoft, a small not-for-profit association!) are proud to present our roadmap for <strong>the developments and side projects we have planned for PeerTube in 2023</strong>. This roadmap combines both the progress we wanted to make to the software and the proposals you have sent us <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the last few months</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we are dedicating only one developer to PeerTube (yes, only one!), PeerTube being one of more than fifty projects led by our association.</p>
<h4>End of February: PeerTube 5.1</h4>
<p>We plan to release version 5.1 at the end of February. Here are the new features we are planning to release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier management of account registrations (with administrator approval)</li>
<li>Developers will be able to take advantage of an <strong>improved API for external authentication plugins</strong> (setting a quota, updating the user, etc.)</li>
<li>Optimize <strong>retrieval of video comments</strong></li>
<li>Adding a <strong>Resume Live</strong> button in the video player</li>
<li>Improvements and bug fixes (including bugs found during <a href="https://www.octopuce.fr/test-de-charge-dun-peertube-en-live-avec-auposte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of December load test</a>, in French)</li>
</ul>

<h4>May 2023: PeerTube 5.2</h4>
<p>This May we plan to release PeerTube 5.2, which will feature <strong>remote transcoding</strong> (<a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/posts/2/support-for-transcoding-by-remote-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature that received many votes!</a>). This will reduce the power required for a PeerTube server by delegating power consuming tasks to external machines.</p>
<h4>November-December 2023: PeerTube v6</h4>
<p>We plan to release the next major version of PeerTube at the end of the year, and the new features are all <strong>inspired by your suggestions</strong> on <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our feedback tool <em>Let&#39;s Improve PeerTube</em></a>. You will find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/posts/6/add-chapters-to-my-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adding chapters to videos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/posts/9/get-a-preview-thumbnail-in-video-progress-bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Displaying a preview thumbnail in the progress bar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/posts/7/protect-video-viewing-with-a-password-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protecting videos with a password/token</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/posts/3/upload-a-new-version-of-my-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The possibility to upload a new version of your video</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>But also...</h4>
<p>At the beginning of this year, we welcome Wicklow in the team, for a 6 months internship. This is an opportunity to support the PeerTube developer and to familiarize more people with the code base of the software.</p>
<p>We will also of course continue to <strong>fix bugs, clean up the code and improve the architecture</strong> of the software and <strong>support external and community development</strong>, such as <a href="https://www.john-livingston.fr/foss/article/peertube-chat-plugin-quick-feedbacks-about-a-live-stress-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Live-Chat plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we will work on <strong>content curation</strong> for our <a href="https://peer.tube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peer.tube</a> showcase platform (yes, with a dot in the middle!), to allow us to present <a href="https://framablog.org/2022/12/08/framasoft-2022-a-casserole-cooked-up-thanks-to-you-thanks-to-your-donations/#peerdottube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gateway to PeerTube</a>, which looks like Framasoft.</p>

<p>PeerTube, like all our projects, is <strong>mainly funded by donations to our association</strong>. On this roadmap, only the remote transcoding feature of v5.2 is already funded, thanks to a donation from the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLnet foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Do you want to help us achieve this roadmap? You can support us <strong>by contributing to PeerTube</strong>, <strong>by sharing this information</strong> and (if you can afford it) <a href="https://support.joinpeertube.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by making a donation to Framasoft</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support!</p>
