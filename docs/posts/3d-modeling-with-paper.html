    <h1>3D modeling with paper</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><span><p>August 31, 2025</p></span>

<p>Over the past several years, I&#39;ve enjoyed the hobby of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_model" target="_blank"><strong>paper
modeling</strong></a> (or papercraft), the art
of creating 3D models from cut and glued parts from paper sheets. This hobby is
a superset of origami, in that it allows for cutting and gluing, as well as for
multiple sheets of paper for a single model. The alleviation of these
constraints means that papercraft allows for more complex models that are easier
to assemble.</p>
<p>Over many years, I&#39;ve built models designed by others as well as designed my
own. In this post, I want to share everything I&#39;ve learned along the way,
covering the entire process from design to assembly.</p>
<p>I love this hobby for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It is extremely accessible.</strong> There is no fancy hardware or software
involved. As we&#39;ll see, the core tools are paper, scissors, and glue;
everything else is an addon to make the experience better. All software tools
can be free. Accidentally messed up during assembly and need a replacement
part? Just print out another page. The entire creation of a model can be done
in the ballpark of a few cents.</li>
<li><strong>It is equally technical and creative.</strong> As we&#39;ll see, many of the problems
faced in papercraft require an engineering-like approach and a willingness to
experiment and iterate on designs. While it may appear outwardly like a craft
project, the end-to-end process involves constraints and optimizing within
them.</li>
<li><strong>There&#39;s no limits on what you can make.</strong> What you decide to build is
limited by your patience and imagination. Theoretically, nearly any object can
be represented as a paper model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s dive in. My most recent model is a papercraft plane inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird" target="_blank">SR-71
Blackbird</a>, a
reconnaissance plane that to this day holds many records for being one of the
fastest aircrafts ever. It&#39;s now one of most iconic planes ever designed and an
engineering masterpiece. The program was ultimately retired in 1999.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to walk through the full model design and assembly process, while
referencing specific examples I encountered during creating this SR-71.</p>
<a href="#constraints"><h2 id="constraints">Constraints<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p>Let&#39;s set some constraints for how we&#39;re allowed to model our creation. These
are self-imposed limitations that fit my preferred-style for model design:</p>
<ul>
<li>All parts in the assembled model must be made of paper.</li>
<li>Each part must be a single, solid color. The parts must not use any printed
textures or designs.</li>
<li>The model must be represented as a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimplePolyhedron.html" target="_blank">simple
polyhedron</a>. There may be
no curvatures, holes, two-dimensional surfaces, or surface-to-surface contact.
If the figure we&#39;re trying to capture has any of these features, we must find
a way to approximate it using only flat faces. The object must be manifold (an
edge is only shared by 2 faces).</li>
</ul>
<a href="#why-constraints"><h3 id="why-constraints">Why constraints?<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>It may feel weird to impose constraints on an art. However, I find that these
constraints encourage a better designed model that can be <strong>assembled easily and
predictably, including by others</strong>.</p>
<p>Using features like curvatures, printing with textures, etc. are shortcuts. For
example, printing textures helps fill in details that aren&#39;t captured inherently
by the model; curvatures and 2d surfaces are flimsy and introduce variances in
how a model can be assembled. Simply polyhedral designs with single color parts
ensure that the 3D form itself captures the object being depicted, and can be
assembled in a structurally sound, predictable way.</p>
<a href="#goals"><h2 id="goals">Goals<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p>In addition to constraints, we also have some goals that we&#39;re optimzing for.
These goals will be considered in each step of our design process.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ease of assembly:</strong> By far the most important goal, our model should be
easy to put together. Given the nature of paper and glue, a model that is
difficult to assemble will almost certainly look bad. A model can have a
well-designed topology, but still be difficult to assemble based on the parts
design we put together.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic appeal:</strong> This is an art, after all. The model we design should
be aesthetically pleasing and resemble the object of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal consumption of resources:</strong> We should aim to minimize waste and use
our materials efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<p>As in engineering, we have to consider trade-offs between these goals, and
optimize for these goals within our constraints.</p>
<a href="#steps"><h2 id="steps">Steps<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p>The process of designing a paper model is iterative. Each iteration consists of
the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mesh modeling</strong> - using software to create a 3D polyhedron mesh of our desired form</li>
<li><strong>Mesh unfolding</strong> - unfolding the mesh into a 2D layout of parts</li>
<li><strong>Assembly</strong> - putting the parts together to create the final model</li>
</ol>
<p>The remainder of this article will be walking through each step in detail. The
discussion of each step will be centered around the goals and constraints
declared from above.</p>
<a href="#mesh-modeling"><h2 id="mesh-modeling">Mesh Modeling<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p><strong>Related goals:</strong> Ease of assembly, aesthetic appeal</p>
<p>In this phase, we design the mesh for our model. We aim to capture the essence
of an object in a way that can feasibly be built with paper. Depending on how
you approach this, this can easily be the most complicated step.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &#34;feasibly built with paper&#34;? Our mesh is a collection of
polygons that represent a 3D object. The closeness of that representation is
largely determined by how many polygons we use. We could use many <em>really small</em>
polygons to closely match the subtle curves of our plane, but this would be hard
to assemble in reality. Alternatively, we could simplifiy our representation
down to a triangular pyramid. This would be trivially easy to assemble, but it
wouldn&#39;t look a lot like our plane.</p>
<p>We can now see that our goals of ease of assembly and aesthetic appeal are at
odds. Imagine that we have a continuum, where on the left we have a triangular
pyramid (the simplest possible polyhedron) and on the right we have a mesh of
the SR-71 with an arbitrarily high number (millions) of polygons.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/resolution-continuum.png" alt="Our mesh can exist anywhere between the simplest polyhedron and a mesh with near perfect resolution.

The example on the right is by USSIowa on Thingiverse (Creative Commons - Attribution): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5508640</p></div>
<p>Generally, an &#34;easy&#34; to assemble model will have somewhere around a few hundred
polygons. Thus, our ideal model exists somewhere on the far left of this
spectrum.</p>
<p>The challenge here is what I call &#34;allocation of resolution&#34; - we have a finite
number of polygons to distribute across the features of our object. Certain
features will naturally require more polygons to be accurately captured than
others. For example, curved features require more polygons than flat features -
in this model, the cylindrical engines will require more detail, than say, the
flat wings.</p>
<p>In addition to the number of polygons and their concentrations, the arrangement
of the polygons themselves matters - this is the <strong>topology</strong> of the mesh. Most
discourse on 3D mesh topology is related to shading and animation. For our
purposes, we&#39;re considered with ease of assembly. Certain topologies are easier
to assemble and more structurally sound. Generally, here&#39;s some positive
topological qualities for papercraft:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetries: a good mesh design is symetrical when possible. Symmetrical shapes
are intuitive and easier to reason about when assembling.</li>
<li>No narrow shapes: really narrow shapes are hard to cut out, hard to fold, and
hard to glue. Avoid them at all costs.</li>
<li>Use quads: quad faces have an aesthetic appeal to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of this is sounding hard, we&#39;ve got some options, in increasing order of
difficulty:</p>
<a href="#easy-use-an-existing-mesh"><h3 id="easy-use-an-existing-mesh">Easy: Use an existing mesh<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>The easiest way past this step is to find an existing mesh. There&#39;s a whole
genre of 3D modeling called &#34;low-poly&#34; that you can find with a quick search on
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=low+poly&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a> or
<a href="https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=low+poly" target="_blank">Printables</a>. These are
usually designed for video games or 3D printing, but can be taken up for
papercraft.</p>
<a href="#medium-converting-an-existing-mesh"><h3 id="medium-converting-an-existing-mesh">Medium: Converting an existing mesh<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>Sometimes, you can find a high-resolution mesh of your desired object, but not a
low-poly one. In this case, there are tools available to reduce the polygon
count while preserving the overall shape. This is called &#34;mesh simplification&#34;
or &#34;mesh decimation.&#34;</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Create-faceted-paper-objects/" target="_blank">Instructable</a>
goes over the process of doing this with <a href="https://www.meshlab.net/" target="_blank">Meshlab</a>,
but there&#39;s many other software alternatives out there.</p>
<p>The pitfall of this approach is that automatic mesh decimation typically results
in some nasty topologies, and there&#39;s not a lot you can do to control the
output. To get around this, we <em>could</em> add an additional refinement step where
we take the raw decimated mesh output and &#34;clean it up&#34; using a mesh editor
software.</p>
<p>As an example, let&#39;s try this with a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5508640" target="_blank">SR-71 mesh on
Thingiverse</a>. The original mesh has
more than 1.2 million faces, and we&#39;re going to try decimating down to ~1,000.
Here&#39;s what we get from Meshlab:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/meshlab-decimation.png" alt="Result of mesh decimation in Meshlab"/></p><p>Result of mesh decimation in Meshlab</p></div>
<p>In this case, the output is not usable - it&#39;s wildly asymetric and is full of
self-intersections. Refining this topology would take just as long (if not
longer) as creating a model from scratch.</p>
<a href="#hard-creating-your-own-mesh"><h3 id="hard-creating-your-own-mesh">Hard: Creating your own mesh<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>The most difficult option is to create your own mesh from scratch. This option
gives you full control over the design, and is what I chose for the SR-71 model.</p>
<p>My software of choice for this is <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. Blender
has a steep learning curve, but the type of mesh design we&#39;re doing for this
project doesn&#39;t begin to scratch the surface of its full capabilities. I highly
recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbCW0Cs7aI8" target="_blank">this low-poly tutorial</a>
if you&#39;ve never used Blender before and need somewhere to start. Two things I
found very handy were the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror.html" target="_blank">mirror
modifier</a>
to enforce symmetry, and the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.0/addons/mesh/3d_print_toolbox.html" target="_blank">3D Print
Toolbox</a>
to auto-cleanup the mesh and check for manifoldness.</p>
<p>This process is very tedious. My advice here is: simplify your mesh to the point
where you feel uncomfortable. Recall that we&#39;re largely optimizing for ease of
assembly. When modeling, it&#39;s very tempting to capture finer details, but fine
details have costs (small parts, hard to glue regions, etc.) that are not worth
it during the assembly phase. Scrutinize every feature, and zoom out once in a
while. When you zoom out, your omissions won&#39;t feel as weird.</p>
<p>After many days, here&#39;s the initial mesh I created. It contains 732 triangles.
Note the symmetry along the y-axis.</p>

<a href="#mesh-unfolding"><h2 id="mesh-unfolding">Mesh Unfolding<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p><strong>Related goals:</strong> Ease of assembly, minimal consumption of resources</p>
<p>Once we have a mesh, we have to convert it into a 2D template of parts that can
be printed and assembled. This process is called <strong>unfolding</strong>. Each of the
faces of our mesh are grouped into <strong>parts</strong>, and the arrangement of our parts
is a <strong>layout, or template</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, we&#39;re going to turn to software again. The most popular unfolding
tool (and my favorite) is <a href="http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/" target="_blank">Pepakura
Designer</a>. Pepakura is not free (at the
time of this writing, it&#39;s a one time $70 purchase) and it only runs on
Windows. There&#39;s also <a href="https://www.unfolder.app/" target="_blank">Unfolder for Mac</a>, which is
$30. If you can&#39;t use either of these, Blender can save the day again with its
free <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.1/addons/import_export/paper_model.html" target="_blank">Paper Model
plugin</a>.</p>
<p>I believe that the unfolding step is one that does not get as much attention as
it deserves. There is a noticable difference between a good template and a bad
one. A good template has parts that make intuitive sense, with logical groupings
and clear flow. The faces themselves are grouped into parts that are easy to cut
out and handle. All of this equates to a better building experience, which means
a better looking model.</p>
<p>Part of unfolding is also deciding the scale of your model. You can make your
model as big or small as you want, but again, ease of assembly should be top of
mind when deciding. A model that&#39;s too small will end up with parts that are
hard to cut out and fold. Bigger models are easier to assemble, but you&#39;re
limited to the point where the faces of your model must fit on a page.</p>
<p>I ended up making this model 25 inches long. With the original SR-71 being about
107 feet long, this puts our model at around a 1:50 ratio.</p>
<a href="#creating-many-parts"><h3 id="creating-many-parts">Creating many parts<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>Let&#39;s start off with the creation of parts. In most unfolding software, the
software will auto-unfold for you, and from there you can regroup faces into
whatever parts you want. Here&#39;s Pepakura&#39;s auto unfold:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/auto-unfold.png" alt="Pepakura default unfolding produces complex parts"/></p><p>Pepakura default unfolding produces complex parts</p></div>
<p>The parts it generated are pretty complicated, so we have some work to do.</p>
<p>If you have a mesh with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>n</span></span></span></span> faces, you can have anywhere from 1 (all the faces
in a single part) to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>n</span></span></span></span> total parts (each part is a single face). We want our
model to be easy to assemble, and neither of these extremes are easy.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to fix the number of parts and going from there, I recommend
creating parts that are logical. Identify features that can be captured in a
single part, and go from there. For example, in the SR-71, each engine intake
spike makes sense as a single part. So does the nose cone.</p>
<p>If your mesh has an axis of symmetry, then your parts have symmetrical pairings
as well. The same feature on either side of the axis should be represented with
a mirrored part. In the SR-71, the entire plane is symmetrical on the vertical
axis, so all parts across this axis are mirrored. This is good because once
someone builds one side, they can more easily reason about the other side.</p>
<p>I ended up dividing this model into 42 parts. These parts were carefully divided
in such a way that I felt would make them easier to assemble. If you look at any
part in particular, chances are it&#39;ll have a symmetric counterpart.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/parts.png" alt="Finalized parts for the layout"/></p><p>Finalized parts for the layout</p></div>
<p>They&#39;re arranged pretty haphazardly right now, but we&#39;ll cleanup this up in the
next step.</p>
<a href="#arranging-the-parts"><h3 id="arranging-the-parts">Arranging the parts<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>Again, most software will automatically arrange the parts for you as part of
unfolding. Here&#39;s the 14 page arrangement Pepakura decided for the parts I created:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/auto-parts-layout.png" alt="Auto arrangement of parts by Pepakura"/></p><p>Auto arrangement of parts by Pepakura</p></div>
<p>I highlighted all the parts on the first two pages so you can see where the are
on the finished model. Notice that they&#39;re scattered throughout different
sections. That&#39;s why I typically don&#39;t like auto-arrangement - they&#39;re designed
to minimize paper usage, but they often result in a less intuitive assembly
process. You can&#39;t look at any particular page and loosely know where its parts
will go.</p>
<p><strong>A good part layout reads like a story.</strong> Parts are arranged in a logical
order, with related parts grouped together. I like to arrange mine left to
right, top to bottom on a page. Here&#39;s my layout, with the first two pages
highlighted.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/manual-parts-layout.png" alt="Manual arrangement of parts, which now has logical groupings"/></p><p>Manual arrangement of parts, which now has logical groupings</p></div>
<p>All the parts that are near each other in the layout are also near each other in
the final assembly. In this case, I even was able to reduce the page count down
to 12 from the starting 14.</p>
<a href="#flap-structure"><h3 id="flap-structure">Flap structure<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p><strong>Flaps</strong>, or <strong>tabs</strong>, are the appendages on each part that allow for gluing
parts together. Each flap has a singular counterpart edge that it&#39;s glued to -
this is known as an <strong>edge/flap pair</strong>. Most software will auto-assign a shared
number between an edge and its flap to make identify pairs easy during the
assembly process.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/edge-flaps.png" alt="Two edge/flap pairs, with arrows pointing to their matching number IDs"/></p><p>Two edge/flap pairs, with arrows pointing to their matching number IDs</p></div>
<p>For an edge/flap pair, most unfolding software will allow us to swap the flap
across parts. Doing this strategically is critical for creating an easy to
assemble model, and also has implications for the structural integrity of the
final build.</p>
<p>For example, consider the two example parts shown above. These two parts that
meet at two shared edges, so these parts have two edge/flap pairs between them.
We could arrange the flaps so that one part has both of them:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/same-side-flaps.png" alt="Arranging both flaps on the same side"/></p><p>Arranging both flaps on the same side</p></div>
<p>We could also interlace the flaps, so each part has one flap on each side.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/3d-modeling-with-paper/opposite-side-flaps.png" alt="Arranging flaps as interlaced, with one flap on each part"/></p><p>Arranging flaps as interlaced, with one flap on each part</p></div>
<p>Interlacing flaps between parts can create a more stable structure, since
there&#39;s only one way for the parts to meet. If two flaps are on the same side,
they can over-extend when glued to the edge. That being said, same-side flaps
can be easier to work with, especially when reaching the closing stages of a
model.</p>
<p>In general, I like to using interlaced flaps wherever possible to create an
overall stronger model, and use same-side flaps selectively.</p>
<p>Once we have an arrangement we like, we can export our layout as a PDF.</p>
<a href="#assembly"><h2 id="assembly">Assembly<span>#</span></h2></a>
<p>With our layout PDF ready, we can now print it and move on to assembly. We&#39;ll
finally get to see our design come to life.</p>
<a href="#materials-and-tools"><h3 id="materials-and-tools">Materials and Tools<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>For our materials, we&#39;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>65lb (176 <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g/m^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>g</span><span>/</span><span><span>m</span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span>2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>) cardstock: This is the ideal paper weight for creating
sturdy models, while still being thin/flexible enough to pass through a normal
printer and be easy to fold.</li>
<li>Adhesive. My recommended adhesive is tacky glue: it&#39;s strong, dries clear, but
is forgiving enough to allow for repositioning during assembly. Specifically,
I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aleenes-Purpose-Tacky-Glue-8-Ounce/dp/B00178KLEY" target="_blank">Aleene&#39;s Original Tacky
Glue</a>.
I&#39;ve also had past success with a glue stick.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ll also need some tools, which I&#39;ve listed these in order of importance. The
ones with asterisks are essential. Everything else is a nice-to-have.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Printer*</strong>: You&#39;ll need access to a printer to print the template on the
cardstock. Laser jet printers are great because the prints don&#39;t smudge.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting tools*</strong>: You&#39;ll need a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut
out the parts. Use sharp tools for clean cuts - it makes a difference.</li>
<li><strong>Ruler*</strong>: Cutting/scoring perfectly straight lines is a must. Steel rulers
are great for their consistent edge, and they don&#39;t catch against your tools.
That being said, I used a clear plastic ruler for this model. Being able to
see through the ruler helps with alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring tool*</strong>: This will help you prepare a part for folding. You can use
a bone folder or scoring wheel. I use an embossing tool I found at a dollar
store, but before that, I used a ballpoint pen than ran out of ink. Anything
with a precise (but not too sharp) tip will do.</li>
<li><strong>Toothpicks</strong>: I use toothpicks to spread blobs of glue into thin layers and
get into tight spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Assembly surface</strong>: A cutting mat or piece of cardboard will protect your
work surface and give you a stable surface to cut/score your parts.</li>
<li><strong>Tweezers</strong>: Tweezers are helpful for handling small parts and getting into
tight spaces, especially while holding parts together as glue dries.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get fancy, you can also purchase an automatic cutting machine,
like a <a href="https://cricut.com/" target="_blank">Cricut</a> or
<a href="https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/" target="_blank">Silhouette</a>. These machines can precisely
cut/score your parts from cardstock. Getting the template into their software
takes some extra effort, but it results in the best quality parts. I did not use
a machine for this project.</p>
<p>To match the real SR-71, I printed my template on black cardstock. Darker
cardstocks are harder to work with because of the low contrast between the ink
and the paper itself. If you&#39;re new to the hobby, I would recommend starting
with a lighter color.</p>
<a href="#assembly-phases"><h3 id="assembly-phases">Assembly phases<span>#</span></h3></a>
<p>The assembly of a model has 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Cutting the parts out from the paper with your cutting tool of
choice. Scissors are quicker, but the combination of ruler and craft knife
results in cleaner cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Running a scoring tool over fold lines to get cleaner folds. This
may be tempting to skip, but I cannot emphasize the importance of this step
enough. Scoring is especially important when dealing with thicker paper.</li>
<li><strong>Folding:</strong> Folding the parts in prep for gluing. There&#39;s only two types of
folds: mountain folds and valley folds.</li>
<li><strong>Gluing:</strong> Gluing the parts together.</li>
</ol>
<p>How you decide to batch these steps is up to you. For example, you could cut all
the parts out at once, then score all of them, etc. This approach is effective
because you can develop a rhythm by doing each phase only once, so you&#39;re not
constantly switching between tools; the downside is that you only get to start
assembly after a pretty lengthy process. Alternatively, you can do it per part:
cut one part out, score it, fold it, and secure it to the assembly. Here, the
pros and cons are flipped: you get to see the model come together quicker, but
there&#39;s a lot of context switching between phases. I&#39;ve tried both of these
approaches, and find that the latter results in a non-negligible increase in the
assembly time of the model.</p>
<p>To strike a balance, the approach I took for this model was performing the
phases at the granularity of sections (engines, wings, fuselage, etc.) of the
model. This approach has the added final step of assembling all the standalone
sections together into the final model.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some pictures I took during the assembly process. In total, assembly took
6-8 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Use little glue:</strong> When gluing parts together, apply as little glue as
possible. Using too much glue will result in spillover when the flaps/edges are
put together, and this spillover is hard to wipe away from a porous surface like
paper. Too much glue can even result in subtle paper warping. In the recommended
tools, I suggested a toothpick. I apply a small bead of glue to a flap and use
the toothpick to spread it into a thin film. This prevents any spillage and
keeps the model clean.</p>
<p><strong>Start in complex areas:</strong> As you progress further in gluing parts together,
the degrees of freedom of your model will reduce. This is why I recommend
starting with more complicated areas of your model where you&#39;ll need those
degrees of freedom. In this model, this meant starting with precise features,
like the engine inlet spikes or the vertical stabilizers.</p>
<p><strong>Finish in hidden areas:</strong> This goes hand in hand with the tip above. As you
reach to the end of your model, gluing the final parts together can be <em>very</em>
hard, which means the final edges may come out a bit sloppy. Why does this
happen? Any minor imperfections we made throughout the assembly process result
in stresses in our model that will be felt at the end. Gluing the last part may
be challenging because it&#39;ll feel misaligned, and it has the added challenge of
attempting to close a 3D object from the outside. That&#39;s why I always recommend
choosing an assembly order that results in the last parts being glued in an area
that is out of sight. For the SR-71, that happens to be the underside of the
fuselage.</p>

<p>No matter how much you scrutinize the modeling and layout phases, you will
inevitably find areas for improvement as you assemble. In the case of the SR-71,
I spotted a few minor assymetries in part tabs, and more importantly, an
opportunity to reduce face count by simplifying the topology of the bottom of
the plane and the nose cone.</p>
<p>I took my mesh back into Blender, and was able to get the triangle count down to
636, which is almost a full 100 faces fewer than the original mesh.</p>

<p>Below, you can see the old mesh (left) next to the new mesh (right). It&#39;s hard
to tell the difference, yet the new one has almost 15% fewer faces.</p>

<p>A faster way to iterate is to render the model rather than physically building
it. This allows you to quickly identify and fix visual issues without going
through the hours of assembly. Here&#39;s some renders (in Blender) of the final
iteration:</p>

<p>In total, the full cycle of designing the mesh, creating the parts layout,
assembly, and subsequent refinement iterations occurred over the course of a few
months. The process is long, but the results are well worth it.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in making this model yourself, you can download the PDFs for
the first iteration of the model below. I&#39;ve included a template for the stand as well.</p>
