<h3>Crust</h3>

The analogy with a meteorite fusion crust is good in that both crusts are caused by heating, the crusts have a distinct thickness, and both crusts are often shiny and usually darker than the interior bread or rock. The analogy breaks down in that the interior of leavened bread is full of vesicles (gas bubbles) and <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/meteoritesite/items/vesicles/">vesicles are rare in meteorites</a>.

<p><strong>Some people who contact me from non-English-speaking countries say “It has a fusion shell.” In English, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_snail">snails</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_shell">turtles</a> have shells; meteorites and bread have <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crust#:~:text=%3A%20a%20hard%20or%20brittle%20external,as%20of%20soil%20or%20snow)">crusts</a>.</strong></p>

<h3>Stony meteorites</h3>

<figure><div> <h4>A <em>fusion crust</em> is the most characteristic feature that distinguishes a meteorite from a plain old Earth rock. If a rock does not have a fusion crust and does not contain <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/meteoritesite/items/metal-iron-nickel/">iron-nickel metal</a>, then there is no reason to suspect that it is a meteorite, regardless of what other meteorite-like features it may have.</h4> <h4>If you send me a photo of a rock that does not have a fusion crust, then I am not going to mislead you by saying that it is possibly a meteorite. It <em>might</em><span> be a meteorite, but I am not going to suggest to you that it is.</span></h4> </div></figure>



<p><strong>Meteoroids, i.e., small rocks orbiting the sun, enter Earth’s atmosphere at speeds of many miles per second. At those tremendous speeds, the air in the path of the rock is severely compressed. When air is compressed rapidly, its temperature increases, like air in a bicycle tire pump. The hot air causes the exterior of stony meteoroids to melt. The melted portion is so hot and fluid that it immediately ablates (sloughs off) and new material is melted underneath. A meteoroid loses most of its mass as it passes through the atmosphere. When it slows down to the point where no melting occurs, the last melt to form cools to make a thin, glassy coating called a <em>fusion crust</em>. On stony meteorites, fusion crusts are seldom more than 1 or 2 mm thick. Except for some lunar meteorites (less than 1 in 1000 of all meteorites), fusion crusts are not distinctly <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/meteoritesite/items/vesicles-in-meteorites/">vesicular</a> – there are no obvious gas bubbles. Some fusion crusts will show flow features; others may be covered with <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/meteoritesite/items/regmaglypts/">regmaglypts</a>. During atmospheric entry any corners, edges, or protuberances are the first parts to ablate away – like putting an ice cube in water. The result is that a meteorite is rounded and aerodynamic in shape.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Even though the meteorites in these photos have been on Earth for hundreds or thousands of years, the fusion crusts are still shiny. For meteorites found in temperate environments where it rains more often, however, fusion crusts may not be so shiny and black. Meteorite fusions crusts consist of glass, but the underlying material is crystalline and sometimes weaker than the crust. As a consequence, the fusion crust sometimes break away if a meteorite has been on Earth a long time. Most terrestrial weathering crusts, varnishes, and rinds do not flake like this, so “flakiness” is a characteristic useful for identifying meteorite fusion crusts.</strong></p>

The stone is broken on the right side. Several regmaglypts are evident. Fusion crust has flaked off portions of the top. Notice that where the fusion crust is intact, the surface is smooth and shiny. Also, both on this stone and the large Saharan stones above, where the fusion crust is absent the surface texture is rough but still shiny. The shininess is a chemical weathering effect – desert varnish. The white material is chemical alteration (exposure to water vapor) that has occurred since the meteorite was collected in January of 1989. The meteorite is 7 inches wide.
