    <h1>A Daylight-Aware Clock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve always lived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_latitudes" rel="external" target="_blank">middle latitudes</a> of 35-40 degrees.
I notice the change in daylight / nighttime hours across the course of a year;
in the winter, ending work at a reasonable hour still feels like “working into the night”.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a little passive reminder about how much daylight I am / am not getting.
Not one tied to my computer or phone – something more <em>ambient</em>.
Naturally, a reminder of the passage of time is… a clock!</p>

<p>I have an <a href="#sketch">idea</a> of what I want, and what I <a href="#goals">want to learn</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve procured the <em>electronics</em>, written some working <em>software</em>, and prototyped the <em>physical design</em>.
I’ll be writing about each of those as they progress!</p>

<p>To start off with, I want a circular clock that tells me the time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/sketch-clock.svg" alt="The time 12:34 as digits, in a circle; apparently, a digital clock with a circular face."/><figcaption>
      <p>This is what a clock looks like, right?</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I decided to go digital rather than analog for the clock display, as a way of bounding my <a href="#goals">goals</a>
– I don’t want to add “motors” to the mix for this project.
(And I don’t think a <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/a-bulbdial-clock/" rel="external" target="_blank">Bulbdial-style clock</a>
would be easy to read!)</p>
<p>I thought about putting rise / set times alongside the current time.
But I want something a little less <em>discrete</em> and more <em>discreet</em>:
illuminating the edge of the clock with the portion of the day covered by daylight.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cceckman.com/writing/aclock/sketch-edge.svg" alt="The time 12:34 as digits, in a circle. The edge is indicated as glowing along the upper edge, between the times 7:22 and 18:25."/><figcaption>
      <p>Now with more lights!</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The edge represents a 24-hour clock in the local time zone: the top point is noon, the bottom midnight, and the left and right extrema 6AM/PM.</p>
<p>As I started the physical design, I decided I want the electronic components hidden
from a face-on viewer.
The edge illumination should cast light on the surrounding wall, not towards the room;
the display should have a diffuser that hides unlit LEDs.</p>

<p>In a lot of my projects, “build the thing” is the <em>nominal</em> goal;
“learn how to build the thing” is the underlying goal.</p>
<p>I’ve not made any <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/yak-and-duck/">non-fabric items</a>
since…elementary school?
So this project was a chance for me to refresh my electronic prototyping skills (breadboarding, soldering, etc), and to build some physical manufacuring skills (3d printing, woodworking).</p>

<p>I’ll be posting articles about the electronics, software, and physical design soon.
If you want to see them when they come out, you can follow <a href="https://cceckman.com/index.xml">my site’s RSS feed</a>.</p>
