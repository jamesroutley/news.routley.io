    <h1>US CFTC Sues Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao</h1>

Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.<p>The CFTC has alleged that &#34;Binance has taken a calculated, phased approach to increase its United States presence despite publicly stating its purported intent to &#39;block&#39; or &#39;restrict&#39; customers located in the United States from accessing its platform... All the while, Binance, Zhao, and Lim, the platform&#39;s Chief Compliance Officer (&#39;CCO&#39;), have each known that Binance&#39;s solicitation of customers located in the United States subjected Binance to registration and regulatory requirements under U.S. law. But Binance, Zhao, and Lim have all chosen to ignore those requirements and undermined Binance&#39;s ineffective compliance program by taking steps to help customers evade Binance&#39;s access controls.&#34;</p><p>The CFTC is only one of several US groups looking into Binance, with the SEC also reportedly scrutinizing the exchange and the <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=us-department-of-justice-is-considering-filing-criminal-charges-against-binance" target="_blank">Department of Justice considering charges</a>.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/crypto-exchange-binance-sued-by-us-cftc-for-alleged-derivatives-rule-lapses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;Binance Sued by US Watchdog for Alleged Derivatives Rule Lapses&#34;</span></a><span>, <i>Bloomberg</i></span></li><li><a href="https://www.docdroid.net/60YAbCz/cftc-binance-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>CFTC v.

Altogether the full collection brought in $316,000, with 60% of the NFTs going for less than Sotheby&#39;s estimates. This is a marked change from the barn burner NFT sales at Sotheby&#39;s in 2021, including one in which a CryptoPunks NFT sold for $11.8 million.<p>It seems perhaps even Sotheby&#39;s prestige is not sufficient to overcome the NFT downturn.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/222703/sothebys-nft-auction-disappoints" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;Sotheby&#39;s &#39;Oddly Satisfying&#39; NFT auction disappoints, top work lands paltry $54,600&#34;</span></a><span>, <i>The Block</i></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2><a id="collector-accidentally-burns-their-123000-cryptopunk"><span>Collector accidentally burns their $123,000 CryptoPunk</span></a></h2><p><span>The new owner of a CryptoPunk, one of the most popular early NFT projects, accidentally <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#burn" target="_blank">burned</a> the NFT they had only just purchased. After spending 77 ETH ($123,434) on the NFT, the owner tried to <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#wrapped-token" target="_blank">wrap</a> it so they could borrow against it.<p>However, some confusing instructions resulted in the owner sending the punk to the burn address, effectively destroying the NFT. &#34;I was trying to wrap it and don&#39;t know what I was doing... Thought I was following the directions exactly...&#34; they later wrote. They also later shared that they had borrowed money in order to purchase the CryptoPunk.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1639375139547795456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet thread by NFTstatistics.eth</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2><a id="sec-sends-a-wells-notice-to-coinbase"><span>SEC sends a Wells notice to Coinbase</span></a></h2><p><span>The SEC sent Coinbase a Wells notice, which is basically their way of saying &#34;we&#39;re about to file a complaint against you, here&#39;s your chance to convince us not to.&#34;<p>According to Coinbase, the Wells notice related to &#34;aspects of the company&#39;s exchange, our staking service Coinbase Earn, and Coinbase Wallet&#34;. It&#39;s not terribly surprising that the SEC might have Coinbase Earn in its crosshairs, as it has recently taken action against similar products, such as <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=kraken-ends-staking-pays-30-million-fine-in-settlement-with-us-sec" target="_blank">Kraken&#39;s staking service</a>. In the wake of the action against Kraken, Coinbase seemed to try to pre-empt SEC arguments by sending an email to customers emphasizing things like &#34;You earn rewards from the protocol, not Coinbase&#34;. It doesn&#39;t look like this has shifted the SEC&#39;s thoughts much, though.</p><p>This should be an interesting saga to watch, partly because Coinbase has expressed willingness in the past to go head to head with the SEC.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/222084/sec-investigating-coinbase-for-its-earn-product-wallet-service-and-exchange-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>&#34;SEC investigating Coinbase for its Earn product, wallet service and exchange activity&#34;</span></a><span>, <i>The Block</i></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2><a id="lindsay-lohan-jake-paul-and-other-celebrities-charged-for-illegally-touting-justin-suns-tokens"><span>Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and other celebrities charged for illegally touting Justin Sun&#39;s tokens</span></a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/lohan-tron-tweet_300.webp" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/lohan-tron-tweet_300.webp 1x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/lohan-tron-tweet_500.webp 1.5x, https://storage.googleapis.com/primary-web3/entryImages/resized/lohan-tron-tweet_500.webp 2x" alt="Tweet by Lindsay Lohan on February 11, 2021: &#34;Exploring #DeFi and already liking $JST, $SUN on $TRX.
