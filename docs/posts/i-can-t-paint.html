    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I&#39;m not very good with a paintbrush, so I made a bot that paints for me. It&#39;s called <a href="https://twitter.com/shinupaint">shinupaint</a> and updates every 10 minutes while I&#39;m online. It&#39;s still a little buggy, but it produces relatively pretty results. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/shinu">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>A bit of background: shinupaint (or 死ぬ, which is Japanese for &#34;to die&#34;) started out with me fiddling around with <a href="https://github.com/inconvergent/snek">snek</a>, a system for producing generative art in Common Lisp. The project is in its infancy and there is little documentation, so I took one of the examples and started from there. It is still very much inspired by the original product, made by the infallible <a href="http://inconvergent.net/">inconvergent</a>.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed playing around with snek and hope to find my way back into the generative art world. I&#39;ve always just dabbled and never really deeply understood what I was doing, but it&#39;s always been tremendous fun.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the paintings as much as I do. See you soon!</p>
