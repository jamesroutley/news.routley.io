The result was a console that combines radical innovation with cost-effectiveness. In there, users found imaginative interaction methods while developers had to deal with the legacy technology underneath them.</p><p>The new issue of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">Architecture of consoles</a> has arrived. This time, we take a look at what would be Nintendo’s <em>last</em> joint project with IBM and AMD.</p><h3 id="references-to-its-predecessor-and-competitor">References to its predecessor and competitor</h3><p>You’d be surprised that the Wii U shares its DNA with two somewhat distinct consoles: The <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/">Wii</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/">Xbox 360</a> (which, in turn, inherit technology from the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/">GameCube</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/">PlayStation 3</a>!). For that reason, I strongly recommend you read those write-ups first, as many of the technologies introduced here are related to their predecessors.</p><p>Furthermore, Wii backwards compatibility is a recurrent topic of this article. In contrast with the software emulation on the Xbox 360 and the provisional PS2 hardware on the PlayStation 3, the Wii U takes it to an obsessive level. It does come at a cost, though, which you’ll eventually see as well. In any case, the main goal of this article is to analyse the Wii U. So, Wii-related capabilities will be discussed separately from the main functions.</p><hr/><h2 id="next-gen-controller">Next-gen controller</h2><p>When it comes to Nintendo, the controller tends to be an engaging topic of discussion. Here is no exception, so I found it more captivating to start the analysis with this component before we dive into the main box.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/gamepad.20bb73ea5e39a872fbaaf3b9cfbffd5a57c88c61897abe07d4173d9e2f53fe5b.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/_hud1790fb641c5ec9bb7a8000323fbee28_61670_ad2866ea79cad897a15d18ff17e72451.webp 500w,

It’s twice the size of a traditional controller but bundles twice the functionality. Its technical name is <strong>Display Remote Controller</strong> (DRC) but users better know it as <strong>GamePad</strong>. In there, we find a touchscreen, a set of buttons, a hidden stylus and many, many sensors. All in all, it’s one interesting <em>brick</em>.</p><p>Due to its abundance of hardware, you could consider it an independent computer by itself. However, due to its software, the GamePad ultimately behaves as a <strong>terminal linked to the console</strong>, with duties including:</p><ul><li><strong>Input device</strong> by forwarding sensor data and button presses to the console.</li><li><strong>Output device</strong> by receiving audio and video streams from the console and reproducing them on the internal display and speakers.</li><li><strong>Signal processing</strong> by seamlessly encoding and decoding data streams traveling from or to the console.</li></ul><p>In doing so, apart from being a controller, the GamePad was marketed with two functionalities in mind: A ‘second screen’ and a ‘mirror screen’. In the first case, the console may display exclusive information on the GamePad without consuming TV space. In the other, the user may use the console without requiring a TV anymore.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/zelda_extended.df7a8a0b72c77d8f35b5deea821bbf1b3411953ccea56468c6da915005c1c9d4.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/_hu982cba4729473650b602d5163493a906_98638_f7b51e989ffafb318a0c298ab4c880d5.webp 500w,

So, the adoption of either style completely depended on how the game was programmed.</p><h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3><p>Let’s now see what the GamePad is made of, a tricky task by itself since the internals of the GamePad aren’t documented whatsoever. Luckily, a hacking group called ‘Memahaxx’ took matters into their own hands and completely reversed-engineered the device. If that wasn’t enough, they also took the time to share their discoveries with the public.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gamepad/overview.cfdbd79aa2b87ab955185339e91c3a88fc4aca03ec1f71eaf3bd3e79907a4ce5.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="1188" height="804" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gamepad/overview.cfdbd79aa2b87ab955185339e91c3a88fc4aca03ec1f71eaf3bd3e79907a4ce5.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>The internal architecture of the GamePad</figcaption></figure><p>The device bundles three main chips <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:io-controller_overview" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup> or, better yet, three independent computers:</p><p>Firstly, we’ve got <strong>DRC-WUP</strong> which is a System-on-Chip (SoC) hiding yet-another <strong>ARM926EJ-S</strong> (the same one from the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-hidden-co-processor">Wii</a>, <em>how many of these do they have in stock?</em>) along with <strong>4 MB of RAM</strong> and a special <strong>H.264 accelerator</strong> for encoding and decoding H.264 streams. This is the main chip that controls the peripheral. It has access to the screen, audio and NFC functionality.</p><p>Next to the SoC, you’ll find the <strong>Broadcom BCM4319</strong>, another tiny computer that houses an <strong>ARM Cortex-M3</strong> and the radio-frequency infrastructure that provides <strong>802.11 a/b/g/n</strong> connectivity <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:io-controller_bc" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>. It’s worth emphasising that Broadcom’s choice of CPU is a bit more ‘contemporary’ than Nintendo’s, considering that the Cortex-M3 (with its second version of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>) was designed for embedded systems of the 2010s decade. To be fair, it’s known that Nintendo’s choices are not always based on ‘cutting-edginess’ but on cost and supply. In any case, the BCM4319 will be providing Wi-Fi connectivity using the 5 GHz band.</p><p>Finally, <strong>UIC-WUP</strong> is another Nintendo-branded component where we can find an <strong>STMicroelectronics STM8</strong>, <strong>2 KB and 28 KB of EEPROM</strong>. The STM8 is one of those modern 8-bit microcontrollers used for small but repetitive tasks. That said, UIC-WUP is delegated with handling the remaining I/O.</p><p>The GamePad’s firmware (or firmwares) are stored in a separate Flash chip. This provides <strong>32 MB</strong> worth of space accessed through an SPI bus. Curiously enough, the firmware code <strong>is not encrypted</strong> (facilitating the work of Memahaxx).</p><p>The rest of the GamePad’s motherboard is filled with I/O endpoints and unusual sensors. So, I will go over them in the ‘I/O’ part of this article.</p><h4 id="talking-to-the-mothership">Talking to the mothership</h4><p>The Wii U’s motherboard includes a tiny chip called <strong>DRH</strong> which relies on the Wi-Fi protocol to communicate with the GamePad and the USB protocol to communicate with the rest of the motherboard. This includes the GPU, which streams frame-buffers directly to the DRH so they get displayed on the GamePad.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gamepad/connections.7772b3edc58be82b908fde6113d7118bcd712d0467c82d94c28cf56d8545bff2.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="860" height="273" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gamepad/connections.7772b3edc58be82b908fde6113d7118bcd712d0467c82d94c28cf56d8545bff2.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the GamePad-Wii U connection</figcaption></figure><p>DRH runs a Real-time Operating System (RTOS) which implements the µITRON 4.0 specification. It’s quite sophisticated, offering cooperative multitasking and inter-task communication. Finally, it’s worth noting that the Wii U-GamePad communication over Wi-Fi is not mixed with the internet capabilities of the Wii U, that’s handled by a separate chip (and antenna).</p><h3 id="background-functionality">Background functionality</h3><p>Apart from the personalised implementation of the network stack (which will be explained in a bit), the GamePad does a lot of processing behind the scenes.</p><p>Once the GamePad is up and running, the device is capable of displaying an H.264 video stream by decoding it on-the-fly. The screen resolution is <strong>854x480 pixels</strong> with a refresh rate of <strong>60 Hz</strong>, which isn’t exactly HD, but it maintains 16:9 proportionality.</p><h4 id="strange-use-of-standards">Strange use of standards</h4><p>Similarly to how the Wii Remote <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wiiu/%60ref%20(%22wii#next-gen-controllers%22)%60">mangles the Bluetooth protocol</a> to avoid third-party usage, the GamePad breaks two Wi-FI standards, namely WPS and WPA2-PSK, so they only work with the Wii U <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:io-controller_wifi" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>.</p><p>In summary, the Wii U and the GamePad communicate with each other using <strong>802.11n in the 5 GHz band</strong>. The console acts as an access point (AP) and the GamePad acts as its single client. Be as it may, Memahaxx also reported that the console’s operating system implemented the possibility of using two GamePads at once, albeit left unused.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/setup.c083e0e65d990f3debb8855c468cfd5d28356494e007e5205ce86ea2a83c1481.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/_hu5ebd6ccc0654fb8d5a6c768c2cb903a0_75434_091db628f5ae15001c9fb6857a2c2389.webp 500w,

This is done using the <strong>Wi-Fi Protected Setup</strong> (WPS) protocol, however, it’s not as easy as pressing the <code>SYNC</code> button and waiting until both devices pair. The process also involves the user selecting specific poker symbols shown on the GamePad as instructed on the TV (rendered by the console). Behind the scenes, the user is inputting part of the password, the GamePad then adds a hardcoded <code>5678</code> at the end of the password and sends it to the console. If the process has finished successfully, the GamePad receives the console’s SSID, BSSID and PSK values so it can automatically connect from now on.</p><p>From there on, subsequent connections rely on the <strong>WPA2-PSK</strong> protocol and both devices transfer their information using TCP/IP packets.</p><p>As a curious fact, the GamePad takes advantage of <strong>timestamps</strong> to keep Audio and Video streams synchronised. Timestamps are an attribute found on ‘Beacon Frames’, broadcasted by access points for many reasons, one of which is to synchronise the internal clocks of in-range devices.</p><hr/><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>I hope you’ve got some time left as we still have to check out the internals of the Wii U, starting with the <em>central</em> chip.</p><h3 id="origins-and-hypotheses">Origins and hypotheses</h3><p>Since the Wii U was announced (then known as <strong>Project Cafe</strong>), there’s been significant speculation about what would the new CPU be made of. At some point, journalists speculated that Nintendo would embrace a modern version of IBM’s <strong>POWER</strong> line <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-early_cpu" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>. I guess audiences were expecting a ground-breaking CPU as Cell and Xenon proved six years before. Moreover, with the decline of PowerPC (most apparently with Apple switching to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#p6-and-the-end-of-pentium-numbers">Intel Core</a> in 2006), the idea that any new CPU from IBM would come as a derivative of POWER wasn’t too far-fetched.</p><p>Well, there is one fault with the previous logic, which is that <strong>Nintendo doesn’t favour emerging technology</strong>. Their formula focuses instead on grabbing existing technology and finding innovative and clever uses. This is not necessarily a bad characteristic, as Nintendo engineers have been very clever in showing state-of-the-art applications with technology deemed ‘outdated’. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/#cpu">Z80-hybrid</a> of a Game Boy, or the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">under-clocked ARM9</a> on the Nintendo DS, or even the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#cpu">partially-updated</a> GameCube called ‘Wii’. If there’s something common among all of these, is that all have broken sales records. Now, will the Wii U be part of that club? You’ll be the judge of that.</p><h3 id="the-8th-generation-architecture">The 8th-generation architecture</h3><p>In the past generation, Sony and Microsoft made strong bets (some riskier than others) on contemporary technologies at a reduced cost. With the Wii U, Nintendo looked at a slightly different direction, focusing on low-cost, low-power consumption and backwards compatibility <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:games-devsecrets" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>. The latter will have a strong impact on the final design of this console. Consequently, the new CPU doesn’t deliver any radical component and instead tries to catch up with the latest advancements in the industry (multi-core processing, GHz speeds, etc).</p><p>That being said, Nintendo partnered with IBM to deliver their new CPU. The result was <strong>Espresso</strong> and runs at <strong>1.24 GHz</strong> <sup id="bibref:6"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>Now, let’s bring Espresso forward:</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/espresso.add469b7e627cb2a1aa292b687af9d3e5eacdf5f194fd6e0ad034aee2cfdfec7.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="764" height="450" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/espresso.add469b7e627cb2a1aa292b687af9d3e5eacdf5f194fd6e0ad034aee2cfdfec7.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of Espresso</figcaption></figure><p>… and as with any other article in this series, I’ll explain how it works.</p><h4 id="familiar-faces">Familiar faces</h4><p>Before we start the real analysis, let me go back to the previous diagram. As you’ve seen there, Espresso is a symmetric multi-core system, just like <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#cpu">Xenon</a>. But that’s not all, as each of Espresso’s cores appears to be a <strong>replica of IBM’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#cpu">Broadway</a></strong>, the exact same core used with the Wii (which in turn, is a tweaked version of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#cpu">Gekko</a>, found in the GameCube).</p><h3 id="study-of-espresso">Study of Espresso</h3><p>We’ll now take a look at how Espresso is constructed. As I’ve already explained how <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#cpu">Broadway</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#cpu">Gekko</a> work, I’ll focus on the novelties of Espresso, namely its multi-core layout, cache system and memory.</p><p>At this point, it’s fair to say that neither Nintendo nor IBM have publicly documented the inner workings of Espresso (unlike Xenon and Cell from which many IBM engineers published papers on IBM’s now-defunct developerWorks portal). I guess that neither planned to commercialise Espresso outside the Wii U. As a consequence, this section has been possible due to the countless hours spent by hacking groups like fail0verflow (a.k.a Team Twiizers) which not only managed to reverse-engineer this system, but also take the time to publish documentation about it (don’t forget to look at the cited documents if you enjoy the topic). For this study, I’ve combined third-party research with public information from IBM (related to Broadway) and Freescale, and the result is what you see below.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-multi-coring-broadway-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-multi-coring-broadway">‘Multi-coring’ Broadway</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-a-recallable-bus-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-a-recallable-bus">A recallable bus</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-more-cache-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-more-cache">More cache</a></li><li id="tab-1-4-room-for-improvement-link"><a href="#tab-1-4-room-for-improvement">Room for improvement</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-multi-coring-broadway"><h4 id="tab-1-1-multi-coring-broadway">‘Multi-coring’ Broadway</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/motherboard/soc.38a8a1efada68b5df61254c204caac8a6b6705512b93c3fc7165a64a4e9f4da8.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/motherboard/_hu3cb9986b960e12b3863a28e0372dfb70_201597_422c26986cc566490a56f6c450a7ea9f.webp 500w,

The design of these dates all the way back to 2001, meaning that the datapath and instruction set are roughly in the same state as they were 10 years before. For comparison, the PowerPC Processing Element (the main core of Xenon and Cell) grabbed the design of the POWER4 and re-engineered it for the requirements of the respective console.</p><p>Moving on, Espresso implements a <strong>symmetric multi-core layout</strong>… but how is this possible with those old cores? Well, in a (now defunct) FAQ portal, IBM has explained that the 750 already supports a multi-processing environment <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-750faq" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>, it just needs extra work for maintaining cache integrity (between the different L1, L2 and the TLB). However, doing this through software cancels out the advantages of having a multi-processor design, so the idea was never taken forward… That is, until Nintendo reached IBM again.</p><p>In the end, IBM grabbed three Broadway CPUs, stepped up the clock to 1.24 GHz and wrapped them with extra L2 cache and the necessary circuitry to arbitrate bus contention and cache coherency (so it doesn’t have to be done with software). That’s Espresso.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-a-recallable-bus"><h4 id="tab-1-2-a-recallable-bus">A recallable bus</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/cores.c8e511540af8910cf7b7e205acb372d1c03e110500eca81e3d039aaef80e81d5.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="764" height="555" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/cores.c8e511540af8910cf7b7e205acb372d1c03e110500eca81e3d039aaef80e81d5.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Layout of the internal cores of Espresso</figcaption></figure><p>The external bus that connects the CPU cores with external components has an interesting history, dating back to 1993, with the launch of the <strong>Motorola 88110</strong>. After the formation of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#cpu">AIM alliance</a>, IBM and Motorola created a joint CPU based on their best inventions. IBM contributed with their POWER architecture and Motorola chipped in with the bus design of their 88110 CPU. In 1993, the PowerPC 601 was unveiled.</p><p>The PowerPC 601 featured a bus protocol called <strong>60x bus</strong>. This was quite advanced and flexible for the time, already supporting 64-bit operations, fast clock speeds, cache coherency and multiprocessor configurations (hence the fact IBM stated the 750 could work with multi-CPUs right away) <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-60x" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>. All of this reminds me of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/sega-saturn/#cpu">anticipation of the Hitachi SH-2</a>.</p><p>Back to the Wii U, IBM grabbed the 60x bus again to interconnect the three cores in Espresso. Additionally, they implemented a variant of the bus to connect Espresso (as a chip) with the rest of the motherboard.</p><p>If you wonder about the current adoption of the 60x bus, I’m afraid it’s been long superseded by an improved protocol called ‘MPX’ which Motorola implemented for their PowerPC 74xx line (also known as ‘G4’). The MPX bus solves deficiencies of the 60x like slow data throughputs with the use of ‘data streams’ to reduce wait states <sup id="bibref:9"><a href="#bib:cpu-mpc" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></sup>. IBM, on the other side, presented their ‘Elastic Interface’ bus with their PowerPC 970 line (G5) and POWER4 <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:cpu-ibm970" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-more-cache"><h4 id="tab-1-3-more-cache">More cache</h4><p>With the Wii (and GameCube), Broadway/Gekko only disposed of 256 KB of L2 cache and 64 KB of L1 cache. With the Wii U, L1 cache stays the same with each core of Espresso, but two of them are now provided with <strong>512 KB of L2 cache</strong> and the third’s got a whopping <strong>2 MB of L2</strong>. In reality, this doesn’t mean there’s 2.5 MB of ‘practical’ cache, as different cores may need to cache the same portion from RAM, something that wouldn’t happen if cache <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#shared-cache">were shared</a> (but then, other problems would arise!).</p><p>All L2 caches found in Espresso are <strong>4-way associative</strong>. Compare this to the 8-way associations in Xenon and Cell, which in the case of Xenon, was meant to alleviate the 3 cores competing for 1 MB of shared L2. With Espresso, iterating through cache associations will take less time, but there will be more frequent cache misses.</p><p>To handle cache coherency between the three independent L2 cache blocks, Espresso’s internal Bus Interface abides by the <strong>MERSI</strong> protocol (same as Cell/Xenon). For reference, Broadway (a single-core system) used the MEI protocol.</p><p>As a side note, L2 memory in Espresso is of type <strong>eDRAM</strong>, as opposed to SRAM. Furthermore, the L1 block still offers locked and RAM-to-L1 DMA instructions (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#ibms-enhancements">as the GameCube’s CPU did</a>).</p></div><div id="tab-1-4-room-for-improvement"><h4 id="tab-1-4-room-for-improvement">Room for improvement</h4><p>As emphasised by fail0verflow, the Wii U, as a system, is in fact <strong>not cache coherent</strong>. External I/O can alter memory without the awareness of Espresso, therefore cache is not automatically refreshed in those situations. By contrast, the Xbox 360’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#clever-l2-access">Southbridge</a> notifies the caches after peripherals DMA to main RAM.</p><p>Moreover, two existing PowerPC instructions made for multi-processing environments, <code>lwarx</code> (Load Word and Reserve Indexed) and <code>stwcx</code> (Store Word Conditional Indexed), no longer function as intended. As fail0verflow also noted <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:graphics-smp" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>, these now need a manual cache flush to work as intended. At least it’s not the first PowerPC variant to ship with broken instructions (see <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#a-new-but-short-lived-instruction">Xbox 360’s <code>xdcbt</code></a>).</p><p>It’s not all bad news, luckily. At least Espresso inherits Gekko’s ability for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#features">out-of-order instruction execution</a>, something that had to be <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#revisiting-old-paradigms">cut from Xenon and Cell</a>.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="memory-available">Memory Available</h3><p>This section is simple and complicated at the same time. In summary, there are three places to store volatile data:</p><ul><li>A hefty chunk of <strong>2 GB of DDR3 SDRAM</strong> called <strong>MEM2</strong>.</li><li>A smaller block of <strong>32 MB of EDRAM</strong> named <strong>MEM1</strong>.</li><li>An even smaller piece of <strong>3 MB of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T-SRAM</a></strong> called <strong>MEM0</strong>.</li></ul><p>The reason for such disparity is that you may remember MEM1 and MEM0 from the times of the Wii and GameCube. They’ve been carried forward with the Wii U, albeit with a slight increase of MEM1.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/memory.663a09037a070767b06c7a947d853242a1359dd713a49e6da25b128e23892243.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="945" height="452" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/espresso/memory.663a09037a070767b06c7a947d853242a1359dd713a49e6da25b128e23892243.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Memory layout of general-purpose memory (in ‘Wii U’ mode).</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, from the developer’s point of view, only MEM2 and MEM1 (the two bigger blocks) are accessible. The 2 GB of DDR3 may hold any kind of data (supplying both CPU and GPU), while the other two have more limited functions. MEM1 is used for graphics data (more details in the ‘Graphics’ section) and MEM0 is used by the operating system (more details in the ‘Operating System’ section).</p><p>In some ways, this system follows the Unified Memory architecture (UMA). Though, with MEM1 and MEM2 in the middle, I wouldn’t say this system is fully compliant with the UMA model (unlike some of its competitors).</p><h4 id="gddr3-or-ddr3">GDDR3 or DDR3?</h4><p>The old Wii employed GDDR3 memory, which is particularly fast for graphics operations. The Wii U’s choice is not only larger but also features a new type called <strong>DDR3</strong> (without the ‘G’ at the start). Does this mean the Wii U has been downgraded? Confusingly enough, no.</p><p>GDDR3 memory is an improved version of DDR2 for graphics-related functions. Years later saw the arrival of DDR3, which succeeds both DDR2 and GDDR3. Have I lost you already? Well, to make matters more baffling, the follow-up GDDR4 and GDDR5 are enhancements over DDR3 and no other.</p><p>The nomenclature is unnecessarily deceptive. But let’s not lose our focus, the Wii U employs DDR3 and that means higher bandwidth compared to the Wii’s GDDR3.</p><h3 id="becoming-a-wii">Becoming a Wii</h3><p>I’m eager to say that, while the new hardware may look underwhelming in some areas, the logic behind Wii backwards compatibility reaches the same level of dedication as the Nintendo DS or Game Boy Advance.</p><p>The methodology applied shares the same principles of those two consoles as well. Instead of resorting to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#backwards-compatibility">software emulation</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#backwards-compatibility">provisional hardware</a>, <strong>the Wii U has been built as a superset of the Wii</strong>. Thus, it can easily replicate the hardware of the Wii by just hiding its modern features.</p><p>Having said that, whenever the Wii U decides to ‘become a Wii’, Espresso deactivates two of its cores (leaving a single Broadway core) and MEM2 hides 1984 MB of RAM (leaving the previous amount of 64 MB). Once in ‘Virtual Wii’ (<strong>vWii</strong>) mode, the old Wii game can safely assume it’s running on top of a real Wii.</p><p>There are more nooks and crannies behind this compatibility mode involving <em>obscure</em> I/O (explained in due time), so keep on reading if you are curious about this process!</p><h3 id="the-last-venture-of-powerpc">The last venture of PowerPC</h3><p>As we reach the end of the CPU section, it looks like this will be my last analysis of a PowerPC-based system (at least chronologically, I haven’t talked about the Apple Pippin yet).</p><p>The PowerPC has been an interesting development, with its ups and downs. And while it didn’t manage to dethrone x86, it did conquer three generations of consoles.</p><p>In any case, <em>our beloved</em> Espresso is, at its essence, a modern improvement to a fundamentally outdated platform. Both IBM and Motorola already dismissed the 750CL line in favour of the 7400 and the 970 lines, respectively. Yet, it’s curious to see how IBM had to dig up their old designs to produce a console that could compete in the 2010s. I guess the lack of a consumer version of Espresso is proof that IBM wasn’t interested in pushing Espresso any further.</p><p>But hey, just like with Xenon or Cell, it’s all part of an evolutionary line. I don’t believe these kinds of technologies are forgotten or abandoned, but their designs and expertise eventually merge into other projects.</p><hr/><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>So while the CPU can be considered a <em>tribute</em> to legacy technologies, let me tell you that the GPU is <em>officially</em> part of the next generation.</p><figure><ul><li id="tab-2-1-mario-3d-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-mario-3d">Mario 3D</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-hyrule-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-hyrule">Hyrule</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-pikmin-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-pikmin">Pikmin</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-splatoon-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-splatoon">Splatoon</a></li><li id="tab-2-5-zelda-link"><a href="#tab-2-5-zelda">Zelda</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-2-1-mario-3d"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/screenshots/mario3d.c881d1bd1b6ed8aea0170c2455b1b14769084737f05a3c292ece99a8459d7a70.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/screenshots/_hu01821754da05a9d44c053e235f1294d9_138556_c58befb160668d09b8af36caa27e4513.webp 500w,

Years later, after being acquired by ‘ATI’, they supplied <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#graphics">GX</a>, a sped-up version of Flipper for the Wii. But most importantly and around the same time, ATI had been working on a cutting-edge invention for Microsoft. The result was <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#graphics">Xenos</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#a-new-foundation-on-the-way">its new shader model</a> for the masses.</p><p>Years after the release of the Xbox 360, ATI got acquired by a silicon company named ‘AMD’, which brings us to explain a bit of AMD history…</p><h4 id="titans-in-the-ring">Titans in the ring</h4><p>Initially known as the sidekick of Intel, AMD used to be the second supplier of Intel’s CPUs (i.e. 8086 and 80286), although this relationship broke down as soon as AMD started selling an unauthorised version of the 80386 that, to Intel’s dismay, improved upon the original designs of the chip <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:cpu-am386" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup>. This didn’t sit well with Intel and, soon enough, the two became head-to-head competitors.</p><p>Such was the competition, that in the late 90s, Intel’s plans to captivate the 64-bit market with their new line of ‘Itanium’ CPUs were soon thwarted by AMD’s simpler alternative: an extension of x86 called ‘amd64’ (also referred to as ‘x86-64’). Thus, Intel was forced to adopt AMD’s standard instead. For reference, amd64 still serves as the ISA of current x86 CPUs (as of 2022).</p><p>It’s never been all jolly for AMD, however. As the pressure from competing with Intel also brought a share of flops out of them (i.e. the abandoned 3dNow! extension, the delay of Fusion, etc) and now, with the acquisition of ATI in 2006, AMD found itself facing two fronts: Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia on the graphics side.</p><h4 id="the-next-radeon">The next Radeon</h4><p>Now that we’ve positioned AMD on the map, let’s analyse the state of ATI’s Radeon line.</p><p>After the introduction of Xenos and its new architecture based on the ‘unified shaders’ model, ATI was still too busy with Microsoft’s project so they couldn’t allocate enough resources to bring Xenos to the PC market in the short term. Thus, the remaining teams focused on maintaining their classical x1000/R500 series, which left enough gap for Nvidia to ship their unified card named <strong>GeForce 8</strong> (featuring the <strong>Tesla</strong> architecture) before ATI. Finally, in 2007 (two years after Xenos), ATI presented the <strong>Radeon 2000</strong> series (codenamed <strong>R600</strong>) and its <strong>TeraScale</strong> architecture. The new design, now free of Microsoft’s budget and licensing control, brought all the advancements of Xenos along with optional extras for those users who were willing to pay the premium pricing.</p><p>Now, for the Wii U, ATI prepared a Terascale-based card for Nintendo, but it’s never been officially confirmed which model they based it on. In any case, Nintendo calls it <strong>GX2</strong> and fail0verflow relates it to the Radeon HD 4000 series (codenamed <strong>R700</strong>) <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>. R700-based cards launched in 2008 and were an incremental update to the R670 and R600 series. The most apparent changes are the inclusion of faster video decoding hardware and support for OpenCL, though only the former will be usable on the Wii U.</p><h3 id="architecture-of-gx2">Architecture of GX2</h3><p>The TeraScale architecture is the materialisation of Xenos/Crayola ported to the PC market… and GX2 is TeraScale brought back to a console. Its most identifiable treat is the use of an <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#a-new-foundation-on-the-way">unified shader model</a> that centralises both vertex and pixel units into a single block, now called <strong>SIMD unit</strong>.</p><p>It’s worth emphasising that when Xenos arrived, the API model was still based on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#graphics">segregated shader model</a>, so the libraries didn’t provide additional functionality that was now possible with a consolidated compute unit. Well, thanks to the subsequent updates (Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.3), that’s not the case anymore (albeit only OpenGL is available on the Wii U).</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><p>Most of the content related to graphics resides in the aforementioned <strong>2 GB of DDR3 RAM</strong> called <strong>MEM2</strong>, which is shared between the CPU and GPU. That means the GPU must place its materials there, but MEM2 is relatively slow and not prepared for the contention that concurrent CPU and GPU work leads to. Therefore, Nintendo implemented something <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#organising-the-content">similar to the Xbox 360</a>, and that is the inclusion of a dedicated and closer <strong>32 MB of EDRAM</strong> (called <strong>MEM1</strong>) for fast operations (i.e. render targets and other high-demanded buffers). Consequently, not only large frames may be rendered, but also have extra space to perform post-processing (i.e. anti-aliasing) with acceptable performance.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/gpu_content.b73ec5b757bb8aea0ceeb8707629bea905b54b7d08efd402a2f77c09bbd9c37a.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="836" height="620" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/gpu_content.b73ec5b757bb8aea0ceeb8707629bea905b54b7d08efd402a2f77c09bbd9c37a.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Example of how data is organised across the memory available.</figcaption></figure><p>Conversely, the Wii U’s EDRAM is larger than the Xbox 360’s (meaning the need for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/#graphics">tiling</a> is reduced).

Nevertheless, in this article the explanations will be a bit different as the fundamentals of TeraScale were already explained in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#overview">Xbox 360 article</a>.</p><p>The most important changes since Xenos is the implementation (or better said, standardisation) of <strong>Geometry Shaders</strong> and <strong>Compute Shaders</strong>, both of which take advantage of the new capabilities of the unified shaders. This doesn’t mean GX2 had to be completely re-designed to make way for these two stages, what happened is that APIs had been expanded to enable new applications without considerably changing the existing circuitry.</p><p>Being an AMD/ATI chip built for a Nintendo console, GX2 supports two shader APIs, <strong>OpenGL’s GLSL 3.3</strong> and <strong>OpenGL ESSL</strong>. The SDK also comes with some extensions to provide functionality only available on GX2, but it doesn’t support OpenCL and certainly not Direct3D.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/gpu_pipeline.5be667ec9c1e24d1067810bed52f9ebde075d30e262becc188450db07c28285e.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="548" height="479" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/gpu_pipeline.5be667ec9c1e24d1067810bed52f9ebde075d30e262becc188450db07c28285e.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the graphics pipeline in GX2.</figcaption></figure><p>Be as it may, GX2 still inherits the designs of the Radeon R700 series, so GX2’s pipeline is somewhat aligned to Direct3D 10.1 and OpenGL 3.3 standards, even though not all shader languages are supported.</p><p>As a side note, typical Radeon cards for the PC market use AGP or PCI-e bus interfaces.

As we’ve seen many times before, this is the door between the GPU and the outside world (i.e. the CPU).</p><p>In the case of the GX2, the Command Processor reads commands stored in RAM and activates the necessary engines within the chip. Most notably, GX2 features a dedicated <strong>Direct Memory Access</strong> (DMA) controller to manipulate data between MEM1 and MEM2 without the intervention of the CPU.</p><p>Furthermore, DMA may work asynchronously (out of pace with the rest of the circuitry), so GX2 provides a few commands to refresh its cache and synchronise with DMA (in the form of a semaphore) to maintain order.</p></div><div id="tab-3-2-vertex"><h4 id="tab-3-2-vertex">Vertex</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_vertex.8be48f709d8ca4a28cd54da118a415909778dd958b731b1fcad26c062e7b37c0.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="783" height="602" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_vertex.8be48f709d8ca4a28cd54da118a415909778dd958b731b1fcad26c062e7b37c0.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the vertex stage. You’ll soon find that this stage and the pixel stage are not <em>that</em> different.</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, this stage is pretty much in line with Xenos/Crayola except that some blocks have been expanded (increased cache) while others have contracted (reduced number of ALU units and the Memory Export path is shorter). None of this necessarily means a performance decrease, however, as let’s not forget GX2 is ~7 years ahead of Xenos.</p><p>To start with, let’s take a look at the ALUs. Xenos resorted to three shader pipes (blocks of 16 ALUs) to execute the vertex shaders. GX2 only bundles two blocks of 16 ALUs, but each block is now wrapped around a larger circuitry named <strong>SIMD processor</strong>, which I assume denotes the addition of larger circuitry (dedicated <strong>8 KB of L1 cache</strong>, plus the extra interfaces and control units) to sustain more concurrent traffic. Furthermore, each ALU is made of four ‘sub-ALUs’, allowing the former to compute <strong>vectors made of four scalars</strong> at once. ATI/AMD calls these sub-ALUs <strong>stream processors</strong> and it’s a common marketing term.</p><p>Now, instead of the Sequencer dispatching the calculations right away as they come, they are first combined into a larger batch of <strong>64 vertices</strong> along with some meta-data to control the operation <sup id="bibref:17"><a href="#bib:graphics-r7xxacceleration" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></sup>, this is called a <strong>Wavefront</strong>. The batch is then sent to the two SIMDs and, considering the fact there’re only 32 ALUs in GX2, they take <strong>four cycles</strong> to be computed.</p><p>I assume this new design is what enables manufacturers to devise different ranges of graphics cards, with the most expensive including more SIMD units (thus taking fewer clock cycles to complete). As game consoles are not particularly famous for embedding high-end hardware (instead, they compensate by being more efficient), four clock cycles are what it takes in the Wii U to process a Wavefront.</p></div><div id="tab-3-3-geometry"><h4 id="tab-3-3-geometry">Geometry</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_geometry.10337223aa3d50bb61caeabec6d8f43268551ea330ed4b07b980e759b7085e6b.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="726" height="452" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_geometry.10337223aa3d50bb61caeabec6d8f43268551ea330ed4b07b980e759b7085e6b.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the geometry stage.</figcaption></figure><p>The geometry shader is a new stage of the graphics pipeline that appeared right after the two famous APIs (Direct3D and OpenGL) incorporated the unified shader into their specification. The purpose of this new stage is to allow developers to manipulate primitives (points, lines or triangles) as opposed to single vertices <sup id="bibref:18"><a href="#bib:graphics-geometryshader" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></sup>. This can be useful for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#infinite-worlds">proceduraly generating</a> new geometry out of existing one (i.e. devise shadows, fur and so forth). The GX2, like the Radeon R700, inherits compliance with OpenGL 3.3 and therefore supports this new shader type.</p><p>Behind the scenes, however, the geometry stage is just another ‘mode’ of the vertex stage. To make a long story short, if geometry shaders are activated, the vertex stage doesn’t forward the data for rasterisation right away. Instead, the outputted data is saved into a dedicated buffer in MEM2 and the vertex stage starts over but fetches data from the geometry buffer. Then, Wavefronts are assembled to grab the indices of up to 64 primitives along with meta-data denoting a geometry shader will be executed. Afterwards, the Sequencer reads the new Wavefront, parses the primitives and sends them to the two SIMDs for computing. The process is repeated until all primitives are processed.</p><p>Finally, the pipeline continues to the rasterisation stage.</p></div><div id="tab-3-4-rasterizer"><h4 id="tab-3-4-rasterizer">Rasterizer</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_raster.b051cefd5bc4eee237bd3a7e7d35813c94558c56c22124217ec9e3449118840a.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="834" height="347" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_raster.b051cefd5bc4eee237bd3a7e7d35813c94558c56c22124217ec9e3449118840a.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the rasterizer stage.</figcaption></figure><p>The rasterisation stage tends to be much simpler than other stages. The main reason being the act of converting vertices into pixels is mostly systematic, and no extra programmability is needed (aside from a few parameters available to tweak). As such, this stage is identical to Crayola/Xenos.</p><p>Be as it may, the Z and stencil buffers are not allocated on dedicated memory anymore. Instead, the new <strong>Render backend</strong> block (performing Z and stencil testing, with support for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#tab-6-3-rasterization">hierarchical testing</a> as well) must access RAM to work (either EDRAM or main RAM).</p><p>The rasteriser can compose frames of up to 8192 x 8192 pixels using 128-bit pixel formats <sup id="bibref:19"><a href="#bib:graphics-r7xxreference" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></sup>. This would allow massive frames with HDR colour quality. However and for obvious reasons, developers don’t need frames <em>that</em> big (1280 x 720 will suffice for this console), except HDR which will be used thoroughly.</p></div><div id="tab-3-5-fragment"><h4 id="tab-3-5-fragment">Fragment</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_pixel.64c9b6c4986463d3872c084f3a373a6ec2f8fe6f02f1ac46e250a554e3d9cf37.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="786" height="482" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_pixel.64c9b6c4986463d3872c084f3a373a6ec2f8fe6f02f1ac46e250a554e3d9cf37.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the Pixel/Fragment Shader stage.</figcaption></figure><p>The pixel shader stage follows the same methodology as the vertex shader except it’s now pixels being shuffled around.

Additionally, they can perform up to 16x Anisotropic filtering on the spot and can also fetch cube maps (used for environmental mapping/reflections).</p><p>I guess it’s worth pointing out that the shader model (OpenGL GLSL 3.3) adds an abundance of new routines (i.e. new types of texture blending, bitwise operators, texture swizzling) for manipulating textures and removes many constraints (such as the number of instructions allowed per shader). All of which makes the life of developers a bit easier.</p></div><div id="tab-3-6-pixel-operations"><h4 id="tab-3-6-pixel-operations">Pixel Operations</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_post.eb5772d10f1369f596a9cd3814a71a7fa255693015225e5e010c247588d6ff54.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="696" height="408" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/gpu/pipeline_post.eb5772d10f1369f596a9cd3814a71a7fa255693015225e5e010c247588d6ff54.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of pixel operations available.</figcaption></figure><p>Once the frame has been rendered, developers can apply more Z-testing (in case it wasn’t activated at an earlier stage), colour blending and, finally, export the pixels to the frame-buffer for display.

This modus operandi matches the one of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#a-unified-video-output">PlayStation 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#new-attitudes-towards-resolutions">Xbox 360</a>.</p><h3 id="a-secondary-gpu">A secondary GPU</h3><p>With all being said, how come this console can still play Wii games? is there some sort of GX2-to-GX emulator running behind the scenes? Well, the short answer is no. It may surprise you Nintendo went straight ahead and added the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#graphics">old GX circuit</a> inside Latte as well <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. This block only works when a Wii game is running. Although, GX houses the old <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">3 MB of 1T-SRAM</a> which is the one we know as <strong>MEM0</strong>. So, at least the extra memory is used by the new hardware.</p><p>Furthermore, Nintendo also fitted an extra chip called <strong>DMCU</strong> to replicate the old <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#internal-io">Video Interface</a>. According to fail0verflow, the DMCU is just a <strong>Motorola 68HC11</strong> controller programmed to behave like the precursor. Its only purpose is to receive commands from Wii games and forward the frame to GX2, so the latter can broadcast it to the TV. Due to the fact Wii games are made for PAL/NTSC screens, the GX2’s video encoder must upscale it (which, in my experience, is not very good at doing so…).</p><p>If you wonder, there’s no ‘GX and GX2’ co-processing available for Wii U games. It would’ve been ‘interesting’ though, albeit knowing one would bottleneck the other…</p><hr/><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>At first, I had assumed the Wii U implemented its audio functions through software (like its competitors <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#audio">started doing</a>). But then, other questions arose: How is the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#audio">complex DSP</a> of the Wii emulated? is Espresso powerful enough?</p><p>Well, that’s not all. Unlike the Wii, the audio pipeline of the Wii U must service three endpoints:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Television</strong>, expecting up to 6 channels (typically only 2/stereo).</li><li>The <strong>GamePad</strong> with up to 4 channels (a.k.a surround audio).</li><li>Up to four <strong>Wii Remotes</strong> (with one <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#next-gen-controllers">low-quality</a> channel each).</li></ul><p>Lo and behold, <strong>Latte also houses a custom DSP</strong> that performs audio synthesis. It’s operated through Nintendo’s libraries, although developers can extend the audio pipeline through software (at the cost of CPU cycles) if it’s not enough for them.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/audio.8338b436daa23f7c171e2f1015da9cf85ea1d5e03ddd9d266530bbfefde0fca6.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="710" height="362" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/audio.8338b436daa23f7c171e2f1015da9cf85ea1d5e03ddd9d266530bbfefde0fca6.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the audio pipeline. In this example, the game is loaded from the disc drive.</figcaption></figure><p>The DSP helps with mixing and sequencing tasks, the rest (i.e. filtering, effects, etc) is done with software (part of Espresso’s workload). Moreover, Nintendo’s libraries take care of workload management, where audio tasks are first assigned to the DSP and, in the event of full capacity, these are sent to Espresso.</p><p>The amount of workload and the resulting performance will depend on many factors, including the type of encoding streamed (i.e. ADPCM takes up more resources than PCM). Programmers must first test their code using the audio profiling tools provided to come up with an efficient implementation.</p><hr/><h2 id="io">I/O</h2><p>When it comes to I/O and interaction methods, Nintendo still manages to break the status quo. From the hardware perspective, the choices and internal organisation of these components tend to reach cost-effectiveness at obsessive levels. It may be because this area is under the complete direction of Nintendo’s engineers, and they strive for keeping the console at an affordable price.</p><h3 id="a-familiar-arm-chip">A familiar ARM chip</h3><p>Remember the old <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-hidden-co-processor">ARM926EJ-S</a> that had <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-fall-of-encryption">complete control over the Wii’s hardware</a>?

The main difference, however, is that Starlet is now surrounded by larger amounts of memory (<strong>96 KB of SRAM</strong>) and implements better algorithms for security-related tasks.</p><p>By the way, in the absence of an official name for the ARM9 CPU in the Wii U (after all, in the eyes of Nintendo, you shouldn’t know about this chip…), fail0verflow came up with their identifier: <strong>Starbuck</strong>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/diagram.b689628b68d33803dffe010b431309bbeaeb4ef55e9bcdfee59d2dff4db3550a.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/_huf6d86270bb156956d84b0a7c1e376f7c_60921_2303d382a6e21b8315143b3f7f506c04.webp 500w,

Initially, Nintendo didn’t share the goals of such capabilities and some outlets even speculated that it would eventually enable NFC payments <sup id="bibref:23"><a href="#bib:io-nfc_note" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></sup>. It wasn’t until 2014 that Nintendo finally unveiled their intentions with NFC technology: Figurines, which they called <strong>Amiibos</strong>. These embed a unique NFC tag <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:io-nfc_e3" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup> and games that support them allow the user to ‘scan’ their Amiibo (by placing them on top of the reader area of the GamePad). Then, the game will detect which type of figurine is placed and react accordingly (i.e. unlock premium content, create a special avatar and so forth). Tags may also bundle small storage (just 512 Bytes <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:io-gamepad_brew" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>) that games may use to store user data.</p></div><p>Overall, not only these figurines opened up another market for Nintendo but they also quickly turned into a rare collectible (for the enjoyment of scalpers). Though the market of these figurines wasn’t exactly ‘new’ as other companies like Activision and Disney were already commercialising this type of product.</p><hr/><h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2><p>What if I tell you there are a total of <strong>four operating systems</strong> stored in this console? Two of them run in ‘Wii U’ mode, while the other two are only used for backwards compatibility.</p><p>As this topic can get very confusing, let’s start with the native Wii U-only systems.</p><h3 id="with-age-comes-wisdom">With age comes wisdom</h3><p>Just like in the original Wii, <strong>the Wii U runs two OSes</strong> concurrently, one in the CPU (Espresso) and another one in the I/O processor (Starbuck). However, both have been designed with thicker layers of abstraction and a more sophisticated security model. Hence, <strong>Wii U games do not run on bare metal</strong> anymore.</p><h4 id="starbucks-improved-os">Starbuck’s improved OS</h4><p>To start with, Starbuck’s operating system is now called <strong>IOSU</strong> (another name given by fail0verflow, meaning <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#starlets-os">IOS</a> + Wii U) and you will only find one variant of it. This means there’re no more <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#starlets-os">update slots</a>, although there’s an alternative IOSU referred to as ‘IOSU255’ which is only loaded when installing system updates.</p><p>IOSU is still composed of a <strong>multi-threaded microkernel</strong>, which is now able to allocate up to 180 threads (previously 100), along with <strong>drivers</strong> and <strong>modules</strong> to take care of I/O access and security.</p><p>One interesting aspect is that Starbuck disposes of two secured memory blocks for loading its kernel: Its internal <strong>96 KB of SRAM</strong> and <strong>3 MB of 1T-SRAM</strong> (known as ‘MEM0’) from the old GX block. This is for performance and security reasons, as it prevents Starbuck from being exposed to tampering and reduces congestion.</p><h4 id="espressos-new-os">Espresso’s new OS</h4><p>First things first, Espresso now runs an actual operating system. That’s the most obvious change considering Wii games run on bare metal. This is called <strong>Cafe OS</strong> and it’s made of multiple components, not necessarily stored in the same medium <sup id="bibref:26"><a href="#bib:operating_system-cafe" role="doc-biblioref">[26]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>A <strong>bootloader</strong> that bootstraps the system.</li><li>A <strong>Kernel</strong> that provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware (in this case, through Starbuck) and applications. In doing so, it runs under the highest privileges of the CPU and provides many low-level functions (memory management, security, etc). Curiously enough, this component runs on the middle core (Core 1) as it provides more cache <sup id="bibref:27"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow_espresso" role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></sup>.</li><li><strong>User applications</strong> that run on top of the Kernel and provide functionality for the user. This includes the interactive shell, the game and other applications installed.</li></ul><p>Moving on, the Kernel runs in <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#os-security-hierarchy">supervisor mode</a> and communicates with Starbuck using the same <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#starlets-os">Inter-Process Communication</a> (IPC) channel that the Wii relied on. This component can load multiple programs (processes) in memory, but it’s very limited in the amount of processes it can run at the same (especially if they require foreground capabilities), I’ll talk more about it in a bit.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/os_levels.3563981f5f6b36f3d78ccafcd7cace33e92dac03f6a11083c72d35197f02409b.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="762" height="519" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/os_levels.3563981f5f6b36f3d78ccafcd7cace33e92dac03f6a11083c72d35197f02409b.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Overview of the privilege levels in the Wii U, after combining both operating systems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cafe OS loads system and user applications using a proprietary binary structure called ‘RPL’, which is used for both executables and libraries. Moreover, the main executable is referred to as ‘RPX’. One of Cafe OS’ utilities, <code>Loader</code>, takes care of loading them up into memory (with the cooperation of IOSU) and executing them. <code>Loader</code> also performs <strong>dynamic linking</strong> to connect references of Cafe OS in the program with the physical Cafe OS installed in the console. Finally, applications are installed in the form of ‘channels’ which later show up in the ‘System Menu’ (the interactive shell).</p><p>Due to the way the Kernel organises the memory layout, the user is only able to run <strong>up to two types of programs</strong> at the same time. One is the ‘foreground’ program with the most amount of memory available (i.e. the game) and the other is a ‘background’ app with significantly less memory allocated (i.e. the web browser). The user may switch between the two without having to close either, but only one can be displayed at a time and, again, there can only be one ‘foreground’ and one ‘background’ app loaded. Otherwise, either gets closed/deallocated.</p><h4 id="the-big-cost">The big cost</h4><p>It’s time to address something that may sound a bit outrageous: <strong>Cafe OS consumes 1 GB to run</strong>, that’s half of MEM2 that was supposed to be available for games. This means that the Wii U, having featured the immense amount of 2 GB of DDR3, only grants 1 GB to the most important application that users care about.</p><p>In my <em>humble</em> opinion, this is a real disappointment, especially considering an operating system like Mac OS X 10.4 “Tiger”, which also runs on similar PowerPC CPUs, provided a more sophisticated set of features and only asked for a minimum of 256 MB of RAM. Even so, game console manufacturers tend to design their operating systems so they consume the least amount of footprint possible, and it seems Nintendo couldn’t fulfill that requirement this time. On a curious note, it was even reported that Nintendo planned to ship new versions of SDKs and software updates that would reduce memory consumption from the OS side. Yet, here we are, with its successor already in stores and no further production of Wii Us in sight. Oh well!</p><p>Be as it may, there’s a slight compromise: <strong>‘foreground’ apps may claim an extra 40 MB</strong> as long as they are being displayed (a.k.a shown in the foreground). However, as soon as the user switches to a background app, this block gets automatically deallocated. This is not exactly a ‘simple’ feature, leaving it up to developers to find good use.</p><h3 id="maintaining-traditions">Maintaining traditions</h3><p>It all changes when a Wii game is played, as the Wii U enters a state called <strong>‘Virtual Wii’ (vWii)</strong>. There’s no emulator present, but re-shuffled hardware that makes Wii games think they are running on the original platform.</p><p>To enter vWii mode, Starbuck executes a program called <code>cafe2wii</code> that takes care of morphing the console into a Wii (a.k.a de-activating all the modern features) <sup id="bibref:28"><a href="#bib:operating_system-cafe2wii" role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></sup>. Now, there are different sets of binaries available to use (each with a variant of cafe2wii), specifically, <code>OSv0</code> and <code>OSv1</code>. The choice depends on the type of vWii mode needed. In summary:</p><ul><li><strong>Normal vWii</strong> launches the good-old <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#broadways-os">System Menu</a>, exactly what a real Wii does after pressing the power button. This is useful for playing a disc-based Wii game or for launching any <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#broadways-os">channel</a> installed.</li><li><strong>HAI vWii</strong> directly launches a Wii game (bypassing the System Menu). This is used for executing Wii games bought from the Virtual Console store. Hence, the Wii game may be installed in the Wii U’s dedicated storage (eMMC or external USB).</li></ul><p>Luckily, not all the modern hardware in vWii mode is wasted, as the GamePad can turn into a mirrored screen with a controller as well. If that’s not enough, the front of the GamePad contains infrared lights that behave as a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#next-gen-controllers">sensor bar</a>, so Wii Remotes don’t require a TV at all.</p><p>Just like with any Nintendo console with backwards compatibility, once in Wii mode, the only way back is by rebooting the console.</p><h3 id="storage-medium">Storage Medium</h3><p>The Wii wasn’t shy in providing multimedia-centred storage options (the SD card was a nice addition).

Yet, the appliance was still exposed to the vulnerabilities resulting from combining off-the-shelf components with in-house ones. As console manufacturers couldn’t tailor the design of third-party chips, custom security components had to reside in separate locations within the motherboard, thereby being exposed to tampering and reverse engineering.</p><p>With the 7th generation, IBM presented a new range of PowerPC CPUs that embedded a hidden mask ROM within the silicon. This enabled the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 to house sensitive code in plain form (as CPUs only understand unencrypted code) without fear of being read by hackers. That being said, it’s now the turn for the Wii U so IBM also had something prepared for it: Inside Espresso, there is a hidden <strong>16 KB of ROM</strong> connected to one of the cores. This is used as the first boot stage of Espresso and, once it’s been executed, it makes sure subsequent binaries are approved by Nintendo.</p><p>Combined this with Starbuck’s own <strong>4 KB of Boot ROM</strong> (inherited from the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#boot-sequence">previous Wii model</a>), you’ve got two CPUs enforcing Nintendo’s security model as soon as they start up.</p></div><div id="tab-4-2-sensitive-roms"><h4 id="tab-4-2-sensitive-roms">Sensitive ROMs</h4><p>Nintendo also bundled other ROMs scattered around Latte containing <em>very sensitive</em> information.</p><p>The first one is <strong>1 KB of One-Time-Programmable (OTP)</strong> memory where many encryption keys are stored.

Remember this may also include Wii titles downloaded from the Virtual Console store (which can only be launched from the Wii U’s System Menu).</p></div><div id="tab-4-4-extra-storage"><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/hdd_usb.9e6a2cab35d2399868053099a38093b87c6dbab427bd0cf59c0e44ec6dd3e9af.jpg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="868" height="690" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/photos/hdd_usb.9e6a2cab35d2399868053099a38093b87c6dbab427bd0cf59c0e44ec6dd3e9af.jpg" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Typical external HDD connected to a USB Y cable so it works on the Wii U.</figcaption></figure><p>For those users that run out of space pretty quickly, the Wii U came with support for <strong>external USB storage</strong> out-of-the-box. The only limitations, however, are that the medium will have to be formatted using the Wii U’s proprietary file system and only user data can be stored. As a side note, the Wii U’s USB ports only output up to 500mA of current <sup id="bibref:32"><a href="#bib:operating_system-current" role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></sup>, which ironically is not enough for typical USB HDDs (around 900mA). So, users had to resort to USB Y cables to combine the current of two USB ports.</p><p>Moving on, there’s also an <strong>SD card slot</strong>, but that’s only taken advantage of by certain programs and games that store exchangeable multimedia (such as images). Luckily, it supports FAT32 so no formatting will be needed.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="boot-process">Boot process</h3><p>Having two independent CPUs can be difficult the setup. Still, <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#cpu">Nintendo is no stranger to this practice</a>. So, how does the Wii U manage to coordinate Espresso and Starbuck so the console ends up running an interactive shell on top of a secured environment? Let’s take a look.</p><h4 id="multicore-chaos">Multicore chaos</h4><p>Before we start I want to address the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#multicore-chaos">same problem</a> that was present on other symmetric architectures like the Xbox 360: Symmetric cores must be coordinated so each one doesn’t take over the system at the same time. Well, Espresso adopts similar practices to x86, where only one core is activated upon switching on the CPU. Then, it’s up to the program loading in the master core to wake up the other two <sup id="bibref:33"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow_espresso" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></sup>.</p><p>Nonetheless, all cores contain the same reset vector. Consequently, the program is responsible for asking itself which type it is running from and then proceed based on the answer. This modus operandi is similar to ARMv7.</p><h4 id="boot-procedure">Boot procedure</h4><p>It’s time to see the boot routines and, let me tell you, they are not particularly simple. After all, it’s two independent processors with their unique security model being initialised in a serialised way, so that requires a lot of coordination. For simplicity’s sake, my summary is somewhat shortened to avoid feeding you up with lots of information, so don’t forget to check out the citations if you are curious for more.</p><p>On the other side, you don’t need to completely understand this to follow the rest of the article, so feel free to move on if it’s not your area of interest!</p><p>Alrighty, let’s begin already. Once the user presses the power button, the following happens <sup id="bibref:34"><a href="#bib:operating_system-boot" role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></sup>:</p><ol><li>Starbuck wakes up and proceeds to…<ol><li>Execute code found in its reset vector (<code>0xFFFF0000</code>) <sup id="bibref:35"><a href="#bib:operating_system-boot0" role="doc-biblioref">[35]</a></sup>, which points to its mask ROM (where the first boot stage, <code>boot0</code>, is). The first routine tells Starbuck to copy <code>boot0</code> into Starbuck’s SRAM, so it runs faster.</li><li><code>boot0</code> then initialises part of the I/O and nearby blocks by reading the flags found on OTP memory and SEEPROM. It then proceeds to fetch the next bootloader stage (<code>boot1</code>) from NAND.</li><li><code>boot1</code> is encrypted and signed, so Starbuck first checks its signature (RSA type), the integrity of the content (by comparing the SHA-1 hashes) and then proceeds to decrypt it (using AES). All of the keys and certificates needed are fetched from OTP memory.</li><li>More I/O is initialised. Then, SEEPROM and part of OTP is locked down from being accessed again. Finally, <code>boot1</code> kicks off.</li><li><code>boot1</code> initialises even more I/O and prepares MEM2 and MEM0 for use <sup id="bibref:36"><a href="#bib:operating_system-boot1" role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></sup>. It then transfers <code>IOSU Firmware</code> from NAND to MEM1 and performs the same verification &amp; decryption process. If everything went well, Starbuck disables the used OTP memory and zeroes out sensitive data. Finally, it jumps to <code>IOSU Firmware</code>.</li><li><code>IOSU Firmware</code> is a collection of binaries. The first one launched is <code>IOSU Loader</code>, which moves the rest of the firmware (a.k.a <code>IOSU</code>) to specific memory locations (SRAM and MEM0). It then clears itself from MEM1 and jumps to SRAM, where <code>IOSU Kernel</code> awaits.</li><li>The <code>IOSU Kernel</code> first does a quick MEM1 check <sup id="bibref:37"><a href="#bib:operating_system-iosu" role="doc-biblioref">[37]</a></sup>, but after that finishes, that’s <strong>Starbuck up and running with IOSU</strong>. To perform its functions, IOSU’s modules are found on MEM0.</li><li>Espresso is next, so IOSU copies <code>Cafe OS</code> (in encrypted form) into MEM2 and kickstarts Espresso.</li></ol></li><li>The first core of Espresso powers on, then…<ol><li>The reset vector is at address <code>0x00000100</code>, which at this point is masked by the Boot ROM, so it starts execution there.</li><li>MMU, L1/L2 caches and registers are cleared. Then, Espresso switches to ‘Translated mode’ (activates <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#organising-memory-and-sorting-out-aram">virtual memory</a>).</li><li>By fiddling with locked L1 cache and empty memory writes, the BootROM is copied to L1 (to run faster) without reaching external RAM.</li><li>The reset vector becomes an infinite loop (to prevent intruders attempting to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#tab-23-1-the-glitcher">reset the CPU</a>).</li><li>AES keys from OTP are copied into L1. Then, OTP is disabled.</li><li><code>Cafe OS Kernel</code>’s header is copied to L1 and its signature is verified using the stored keys.</li><li><code>Cafe OS Kernel</code>’s data is hashed and decrypted by using the DMA engine to send blocks to L1 back and forth.</li><li>The now-unencrypted <code>Cafe OS Kernel</code>, in RAM, is mapped and ready for execution. L1 and L2 are flushed; and the Boot ROM is disabled. Finally, execution jumps to <code>Cafe OS Kernel</code>.</li><li>Espresso, now running <code>Cafe OS Kernel</code>, checks configuration files that instruct it to launch the <code>System Menu</code> application.</li><li><code>System Menu</code> is fetched from NAND into MEM2 and processed like any other encrypted binary. If that goes well, <code>System Menu</code> is launched.</li></ol></li><li>The <strong>user is now in control</strong>!</li></ol><h4 id="vwii-boot-process">vWii boot process</h4><p>As soon as a Wii title is launched, the system proceeds with an ‘extra’ loader stage that turns the Wii U into a Wii.

Therefore, both Wii binaries have been modified to comply with this.</li></ul></li><li>Kickstart Espresso and let it process and run the designated binary.</li><li>The user is now in control (again!).</li></ol><h3 id="interactive-shell">Interactive shell</h3><p>The Wii U’s graphical user interface is called <strong>System Menu</strong> (or ‘Wii U Menu’) which, as you’ve seen before, it’s an application launched right after Cafe OS finishes loading.</p><p>Most of the services that the Wii U offers (i.e. disc game launcher, settings, online store, etc) are found in the form of foreground applications, the user can pick either from the System Menu. On the other side, a small set of functions (like an <strong>Internet Browser</strong>) are implemented as background applications and can only be launched from the ‘Home’ menu.</p><p>The System Menu interface has been designed with <strong>Touchscreen</strong> in mind.

The experience is not sluggish, but switching between the apps (a necessary common recurrence) takes considerable time.

Here is where we analyse how resilient the Wii U proved itself against the attempts of hackers. To be fair, no console (in this article series) has ever achieved 100% success rate. Yet, it’s the amount of time a console remains ‘unhackable’ and the effort required that will, to some degree, affect whether game studios will invest in the platform.</p><p>Having said that, let’s get on with the analysis!</p><h3 id="main-targets">Main targets</h3><p>Nintendo had to defend three fronts with code-execution capabilities:</p><ul><li>The <strong>optical drive</strong> with its capacity of reading game discs.</li><li><strong>IOSU</strong> (running on Starbuck) with its exclusive ability to access most of the I/O and memory; and control Espresso.</li><li><strong>Cafe OS</strong> (running on Espresso) which is where the game runs on top of.</li></ul><h3 id="protection-implemented">Protection implemented</h3><p>First things first: The disc drive.</p><p>… Well, to this date, <strong>the drive hasn’t been cracked</strong>.</p><p>Considering the low adoption of Blu-Ray drives throughout the Wii U’s lifecycle, I presume there wasn’t enough enthusiasm to crack the drive and/or deeply research its new protection methods. For the curious, the Wii U’s motherboard now authenticates with the drive in a similar way to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#tab-19-1-first-party-security">Xbox 360’s drive</a> and, from there, all communication appears encrypted <sup id="bibref:43"><a href="#bib:games-drive" role="doc-biblioref">[43]</a></sup>.</p><p>That leaves us with two remaining targets (IOSU and Cafe OS) and, this time, there’s plenty of research done.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-7-1-dedicated-hardware-link"><a href="#tab-7-1-dedicated-hardware">Dedicated hardware</a></li><li id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust-link"><a href="#tab-7-2-chain-of-trust">Chain of trust</a></li><li id="tab-7-3-operating-system-protection-link"><a href="#tab-7-3-operating-system-protection">Operating System protection</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-7-1-dedicated-hardware"><h4 id="tab-7-1-dedicated-hardware">Dedicated hardware</h4><p>In general, there are many methodologies IBM and Nintendo employed to secure this console efficiently and cost-effectively.</p><p>First is a <strong>separation of concerns</strong> model present to limit hardware access between Espresso and Starbucks. This makes sure that if the main CPU (Espresso) is ever hijacked, the I/O is still protected somehow. Additionally, both CPUs contain a <strong>Memory Management Unit</strong> to disguise the physical memory map as they see fit.</p><p>Secondly, as I mentioned before, both Espresso and Starbuck bundle their own hidden <strong>Boot ROMs</strong> (with 16 KB and 4 KB, respectively) so they always come prepared with some degree of protection (RSA and AES encryption) before reaching out outer areas that are susceptible to tampering. In doing so, all subsequent code processed must be encrypted and only authored by Nintendo.</p><p>Thirdly, Starbuck disposes of <strong>considerable amounts of memory within Latte</strong> to boot up its operating system (IOSU) without having to reach out to external memory. This adds another layer of tampering protection.</p><p>Next, Starbucks embeds <strong>SHA-1</strong> and <strong>AES-128</strong> accelerators on its hardware to hash, encrypt and decrypt data without performance penalties.</p><p>Moving on, while Stabuck is technically an outdated <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">ARM9 CPU</a>, Nintendo enhanced it with a custom <strong>eXecute Never</strong> (XN) controller that restricts which memory locations Starbuck may execute <sup id="bibref:44"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-xn" role="doc-biblioref">[44]</a></sup>. The XN block fulfils the role of an <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#the-hypervisors-duties">NX bit</a>.</p><p>Finally, encryption keys and certificates are stored in <strong>OTP memory</strong> inside Latte and both Espresso and Starbuck can seal access to each entry as soon as they are finished with it.</p></div><div id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust"><h4 id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust">Chain of trust</h4><p>As per any software involving signatures and encryption, there must be a hierarchy in place from which signatures are trusted.</p><p>From Espresso’s side, the master core always starts in a blank state, but as soon as it finishes executing the Boot ROM, it will only run binaries in the form of <strong>Ancast images</strong> (fail0overflow’s nomenclature). Ancast images contain a header signed by Nintendo using a <strong>RSA-2048 private key</strong> (which only Nintendo knows) and its payload (the actual program) is signed with an <strong>AES-128 key</strong>. The OTP block provides Espresso with the AES key to decrypt Cafe OS’ Kernel (the starting point of Espresso in Wii U mode). Afterwards, it’s up to Cafe OS to enforce the security model.</p><p>Starbuck, on the other hand, uses the Ancast image format for their bootloader stages after the Boot ROM. After IOSU is loaded up and running, one of its kernel modules called <strong>IOS-MCP</strong> is responsible for verifying and decrypting the AES key. Afterwards, the encrypted Ancast image and AES key are uploaded to MEM2 for Espresso to finish decrypting it and finally execute the payload.</p><p>Applications in Wii mode <strong>share the same nature</strong>, Espresso is provided with a separate key for decrypting the <code>Wii System Menu</code> or <code>NAND Boot Program</code> <sup id="bibref:45"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-keys" role="doc-biblioref">[45]</a></sup>, thereby enabling Espresso to Wii execute applications without downgrading its security model. Starbuck is also provided with two extra keys in OTP to decrypt <code>cafe2wii</code> (in Ancast format) and Wii system updates (installed as part of a larger bulk of Wii U updates), respectively.</p></div><div id="tab-7-3-operating-system-protection"><h4 id="tab-7-3-operating-system-protection">Operating System protection</h4><p>To further complement the chain of trust, each operating system adds extra layers on top of it.</p><p>To start with, Cafe OS implements <strong>process isolation</strong> so programs under Espresso can’t fiddle with the memory space of their neighbours.</p><p>Moreover, the manipulation of Cafe OS applications is a complex process involving the two CPUs and different security mechanisms. To make a long story short, to install and/or boot up applications, the <code>IOS-MCP</code> kernel module is responsible for all the necessary routines <sup id="bibref:46"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-coreinit" role="doc-biblioref">[46]</a></sup>. Before being installed, the application’s signature (found in its header) is checked against the respective certificate stored in OTP, thereby making sure the application has been approved by Nintendo (as they are the sole possessors of the certificate’s private key). Afterwards, the <code>title key</code> of the application is decrypted using the OTP-stored <code>Wii Common key</code>, this allows Espresso to execute the binary later on (as the payload is still encrypted). Finally, whenever the application is launched at any time, Cafe OS’ <code>Launcher</code> is used to prepare the binary for execution and linking. Nevertheless, IOSU checks the signature again before transferring it to Espresso.</p><p>Finally, <strong>IOSU is aware of Espresso’s applications</strong> and only grants certain I/O permissions depending on the app’s <strong>entitlements</strong>. That means that particular applications like the Web browser will never have access to the SD card.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="flaws">Flaws</h4><p>At first glance, the Wii U’s security model looks more resilient and gratefully solves <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-fall-of-encryption">many deficiencies</a> of its predecessor. However, it’s not without apparent flaws:</p><ul><li>Espresso, being an off-the-shelf CPU at its heart, <strong>only understands unencrypted code</strong> and, unlike the Xbox 360’s Xenon <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#a-hidden-cryptographic-system">with its hidden encryption logic</a>, Espresso will have to store the unencrypted data somewhere after decrypting it. In practice, that data is exposed on MEM2, meaning it’s at the mercy of external tampering.</li><li><strong>OTP lacks console-unique encryption keys</strong> (a big difference from the Xbox 360 and PS3), meaning that if they are ever extracted on a remote console, they will work on others.</li><li>The Boot ROMs are secure mediums, but the <strong>code itself may contain vulnerabilities</strong>. Plus, the way the chain of trust is constructed makes the boot code a single point of failure.</li><li>Data encryption/decryption relies on AES-128, <strong>a symmetric encryption</strong> system. While AES is faster than the asymmetric RSA, if the AES keys ever get extracted somehow, all encryption is therefore nullified.</li><li>One of the pre-installed applications is a Web browser. Its rendering engine is a fork of WebKit and JavaScriptCore. The WebKit project provides a public report of security vulnerabilities continuously being discovered and fixed (as expected from any responsible and large open-source project). However, this also makes it an attractive starting point with <strong>many potential attack surfaces</strong>. To make matters worse, JavaScript engines tend to <strong>bypass memory execution protections</strong> as the engine needs to compile streams of JavaScript code on-the-fly (it’s worth emphasising that’s code coming from an arbitrary network server).</li><li><strong>Cafe OS lacks Address Space Layout Randomisation</strong> (ASLR), enabling exploits based on <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#homebrew-revival">Return Oriented Programming</a> (ROP).</li><li><strong>The Wii has already been completely hacked in advance</strong>, which leads us to think that vWii mode will share the same fate (and potentially spread to take over Wii U mode as well).</li></ul><p>But of course, most of these weren’t discovered right away (especially on launch day). So, we’ll now take a look at how different security researchers and homebrew developers managed to crack this console.</p><h3 id="defeat">Defeat</h3><p>Breaking the Wii U’s security model was a slow process. Yet, it eventually happened and thus opened the door to many types of homebrew applications. The journey was not without periods of long silence, super-secret discoveries, piracy-focus developments, unnecessary drama and <em>golden eras</em>.</p><p>Let’s start from the beginning.</p><p>As soon as a device makes employs a symmetric encryption model like AES, it’s a matter of time before hackers manage to extract the keys. It <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-fall-of-encryption">happened to the Wii</a> and, lo and behold, the Wii U followed suit. Remember, once you have the keys, you can encrypt the content just like Nintendo would do, so that’s one layer of protection nullified.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/fail0verflow.afd3e72e6d0a0a9de513f9e3d3c329db879a8318fdec9985b16e9d11c4b51cb3.jpeg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="854" height="480" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/fail0verflow.afd3e72e6d0a0a9de513f9e3d3c329db879a8318fdec9985b16e9d11c4b51cb3.jpeg" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>fail0overflow (Sven, Marcan and Comex) presenting their findings at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress (2013) <sup id="bibref:47"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow" role="doc-biblioref">[47]</a></sup>.</figcaption></figure><p>On 2013, during the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, fail0overflow published a vast amount of discoveries <sup id="bibref:48"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow" role="doc-biblioref">[48]</a></sup> and, shortly after, kickstarted a chain of reaction for other researchers and developers. To give an overview, fail0verflow noted:</p><ol><li>Old Broadway and Starlet exploits from the Wii era <strong>still work on vWii mode</strong>. This grants researchers control of Starbuck, which can then be used to fiddle with memory and/or zap Espresso. In other words, a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#tab-23-1-the-glitcher">glitcher</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-9-2-bootstrap-search">snooper</a> in-house.</li><li>As soon as Boot ROM finishes decrypting an Ancast image, <strong>nothing verifies the unencrypted data against third-party alterations</strong>. So, by altering decrypted memory (using a hijacked Starbuck in vWii mode), <strong>Espresso will end up executing arbitrary code</strong>. So much for having a Boot ROM…<ul><li>This was a starting point for fail0verflow and it enabled the group to extract system code (only in vWii mode for now) for research purposes. Thus, paving the way for new discoveries. Although, this didn’t include the Boot ROM and OTP keys as access is disabled before arbitrary code can be executed.</li></ul></li><li>With control of Starbuck, latching the <code>SREST</code> (soft reset) line on Espresso while it’s executing its Boot ROM induces it in an infinite loop (as the Boot ROM adds traps in Espresso’s reset vector). However, if Espresso is soft reset at its last stages of Boot ROM execution (particularly, just after flushing the caches), the reset vectors point to a writable location in MEM2. Hence, <strong>enabling arbitrary code execution while the Boot ROM is still visible</strong>.<ul><li>Consequently, Boot ROM was finally extracted (and subsequently studied).</li></ul></li><li>Still with Starbuck, latching the <code>HREST</code> (hard reset) at shorter pulse widths than expected may induce Espresso in an unstable/unpredictable state, but that can work in the hacker’s favour as <strong>Espresso may ignore instructions to hide OTP memory</strong> (where the keys reside). Furthermore, with the help of custom code, this enables to <strong>dump the encryption keys</strong>.<ul><li>With this, fail0overflow managed to extract the AES keys used by Espresso to decrypt binaries.</li></ul></li><li>Starbuck’s Boot ROM (<code>boot0</code>) is hidden after this CPU updates a register. Well, the same register <strong>can still be re-enabled in vWii mode</strong>…<ul><li>…allowing fail0verflow to extract Starbuck’s Boot ROM without much hassle.</li></ul></li><li>The Wii U web browser’s source code is public (as dictates WebKit’s LGPL license). Well, <strong>the commit history of the project exposes references to past vulnerabilities</strong>. One of them was able to produce a heap overflow that leads to arbitrary code execution.<ul><li>Reproducing this vulnerability allowed the group to execute code in Wii U mode and subsequently extract Cafe OS for study purposes. Moreover, this environment also interacts with IOSU, which leads to the next discovery…</li></ul></li><li>An exploit of IOSU was eventually found by the team, which led to code execution with Starbuck’s kernel privileges in Wii U mode.<ul><li>… Resulting in Starbuck’s encryption keys being extracted.</li></ul></li></ol><h4 id="new-possibilities">New possibilities</h4><p>Taking into account that this was the first security-related presentation about the Wii U, the immense amount of work and achievements presented were astonishing. With this, homebrew developers could now start fiddling with vWii entry points.</p><p>Be as it may, there were still some gaps to be solved. Native homebrew was still not possible as Wii U executables are still checked for their RSA checks. Plus, there was system code (i.e. <code>boot2</code>) remaining to be extracted and decrypted.</p><p>In any case, fail0verflow didn’t publish their Wii U exploits right away, as they worried it would lead to piracy developments before homebrew or Linux support <sup id="bibref:49"><a href="#bib:cpu-fail0verflow15" role="doc-biblioref">[49]</a></sup>.

It boots from a custom web browser exploit that takes over the UI thread and gains control of the frame buffer. The implementation of this game also managed to call native system routines to draw over the screen.</p><p>Back in the headquarters, Nintendo also began pushing frequent system updates to patch userland exploits using the now-famous “Further improvements to overall system stability” changelog motto. The cat-and-mouse game had started.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/browser_exploit.7a6a5bfa0308f6e0604468f36a8f98e9833cd471079671cd791721c4703c6358.jpg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/browser_exploit.7a6a5bfa0308f6e0604468f36a8f98e9833cd471079671cd791721c4703c6358.jpg" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Example of website specifically crafted for triggering an exploit chain on the Wii U. The chain may also bundle a payload to perform something of use.</figcaption></figure><p>Soon after, homebrew development under web browser exploits became the de-facto standard. In the same month, to ease the effort, a new group of developers released <code>libwiiu</code> <sup id="bibref:53"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-libwiiu" role="doc-biblioref">[53]</a></sup>, a toolkit for developing software under a web browser exploit. <code>libwiiu</code> relied on the devKitPro compilation suite and provided additional CafeOS headers for accessing system functions (only those available under the web browser’s user-land). Finally, their toolchain automatically embedded a payload with the necessary exploits and packaged everything up in ready-to-host HTML files.</p><p>In August 2015, a new milestone was reached: the libwiiu team published a kernel exploit <sup id="bibref:54"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-libwiiu_driver" role="doc-biblioref">[54]</a></sup>. The new discovery takes advantage of a multi-threaded racing condition by altering the contents of a structure called <code>OSDriver</code> before the Kernel can lock it <sup id="bibref:55"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-osdriver" role="doc-biblioref">[55]</a></sup>. This allows neighbouring cores to fill it with data that eventually gets uploaded into the kernel’s memory space. Consequently, arbitrary kernel syscalls can be added to read and write to memory without enforcing permissions.</p><p>In spite of everything, Nintendo already patched the <code>OSDriver</code> exploit with system version <code>5.5.0</code> (released only two days before the exploit became public). Furthermore, IOSU still couldn’t be controlled (meaning no arbitrary I/O).</p><h4 id="fooling-iosu">Fooling IOSU</h4><p>For those who didn’t update past <code>5.3.2</code> (as <code>5.4.0</code> patched the last userland web exploit and <code>5.5.0</code> fixed the kernel exploit), there was still more functionality to be unlocked. While IOSU remained unconquered, the tri-core Espresso was now under the user’s control. So, as a workaround, IOSU could now be tricked into thinking it’s executing an application and thus give out greater entitlements.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/loadiine.7831704d65f7e20acf44428ff222d0b629bc54dc034d92a8df82023fba0580da.jpeg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="854" height="480" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/loadiine.7831704d65f7e20acf44428ff222d0b629bc54dc034d92a8df82023fba0580da.jpeg" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Golden45 showing his new homebrew application which enables users to launch game dumps from the SD card <sup id="bibref:56"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-loadiine_video" role="doc-biblioref">[56]</a></sup>.</figcaption></figure><p>In October 2015, developers Golden45 and Dimok released <strong>Loadiine</strong> <sup id="bibref:57"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-loadiine" role="doc-biblioref">[57]</a></sup>. This application relied on the Espresso kernel exploit to run pirated Wii U games from the SD card. To work, Loadiine is launched from the web browser and uses kernel privileges to kickstart an official application. Right after, Loadiine proceeds to mangle memory on-the-fly so execution is redirected to the game stored on the SD card. Initially, only Super Smash Bros. was used for this trick, then, Mii Maker was added as an alternative. In any case, all this memory fiddling is done to make IOSU think it’s still running the same official program and thereby grants enough privileges for the pirated game to work. This method can’t completely rely on the web browser as IOSU doesn’t provide it with access to the SD card, for instance.</p><p>You may now think that further aspirations for homebrew were completely eclipsed after Loadiine brought piracy-related advancements. However, in February 2016, Dimok released <strong>Homebrew Launcher</strong> <sup id="bibref:58"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hbl" role="doc-biblioref">[58]</a></sup>, another web browser payload that, this time, launches ELF binaries from the SD card. In an apparent tribute to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#a-permanent-state">classic Homebrew channel</a> by Team Twiizers/fail0verflow, the Homebrew Launcher lists the ELF applications stored on the SD card, and then allows users to launch any as they wish. This was a departure from having to embed programs into an HTML file and, similarly to Loadiine, the Homebrew Launcher hijacks the Mii Maker to operate.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/homebrew_launcher.9880140aae7b8a92248371f330acaa2818ff0d5d919bab47ffdbf312c61c8688.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/_hub095aabfc0a273c100a4c84665c927a7_61493_489bf3540dd90f97c21a467342ea491b.webp 500w,

The new exploits relied on buffer overflows induced after pulling an MP4 file from a crafted PHP server <sup id="bibref:59"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-fright" role="doc-biblioref">[59]</a></sup>.</li><li>It seems a new kernel exploit compatible with the latest firmware was being beta-tested among a private group. That is, until May 2016, when the exploit got leaked by one of its testers <sup id="bibref:60"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-gxleak" role="doc-biblioref">[60]</a></sup>. The new vulnerability relied on GX2’s direct access to MEM2 which inherently allows it to override parts of the kernel heap. Hackers used this finding to reconstruct the old trick that exploited <code>OSDriver</code> <sup id="bibref:61"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-flaws" role="doc-biblioref">[61]</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, users on <code>5.5.0</code> were now able to enjoy the latest homebrew developments. In fact, these exploits haven’t been patched to this day.</p><h4 id="reaching-semi-permanency">Reaching semi-permanency</h4><p>Once the homebrew scene reaches a certain maturity, there’s always one that asks… is there a way to make this more enjoyable? In other words, can we get rid of the need for the web browser?</p><p>Well, that’s one challenging task, as IOSU is still enforcing code signatures before running any application on the System menu (hence, the need for the web browser and hijacking Mii Maker). All in all, without a method of installing unsigned channels and being able to launch them, it’s back to the chicken-and-egg problem.</p><p>That brings us to the year 2016, which turned out to become an ‘interesting’ year for independent security research (and unnecessary drama <sup id="bibref:62"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-drama" role="doc-biblioref">[62]</a></sup>…):</p><ul><li>Hackers yellows8, smea and WulfyStylez discovered that certain application assets don’t go through the typical security checks, allowing a third party to exchange them with others carrying potential exploits. To alter these packages, however, one would need an IOSU exploit that enables Espresso to move data in and out of NAND without special privileges.</li><li>New IOSU exploits, with userland and kernel permissions, were developed independently by two separate hacking groups (plutoo and naehrwert on one side; and Hykem on the other). These found many vulnerabilities in IOSU’s system calls and subsequently allowed to run arbitrary code with high permissions on Starbuck (meaning unlimited access to I/O).</li></ul><p>In any case, neither of these discoveries was made public until the end of that year. The reason being most authors planned to publish them once they’ve got a proper end-user solution in place, and for that, they needed more time.</p><p>Regarding the game asset exploit, smea also discovered the emulator bundled with Nintendo DS games sold over the eShop (called ‘hachihachi’) carries dynamic code execution entitlements and, most importantly, its ROM parser is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution <sup id="bibref:63"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-haxchi" role="doc-biblioref">[63]</a></sup>. Meaning that with the help of an IOSU kernel exploit, one could alter the assets of a purchased DS Virtual console game so, once the game launched, it could provide arbitrary code execution (in the same fashion the web browser was being used for). Well, this exploit chain was finally published in November 2016 and called <strong>haxchi</strong>.</p><p>Soon afterwards, developer FIX94 forked haxchi and made it work with the PAL version of <em>Dr. Kawashima’s Brain Training</em> <sup id="bibref:64"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-haxchi_fork" role="doc-biblioref">[64]</a></sup>, with support for more games added in the following days. Furthermore, FIX94 implemented a straightforward ‘installer’ that automatically converts a DS game into a ‘haxchi launcher’ (facilitating the task of deploying haxchi for the average user). The installer additionally relies on an IOSU userland exploit discovered by Hykem.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough, here’s another discovery: Cafe OS’s config files can also be altered to boot up any installed channel instead of the System Menu. Well, DS games are channels, so it should be possible to automatically boot up haxchi (to run Homebrew) as soon as the Wii U starts. Lo and behold, this was packaged up as <strong>Coldboot Haxchi</strong>. Unlike the rest of Homebrew apps, however, this scared some people off, as permanently altering Cafe OS’ boot configs could also lead to devastating results!</p><p>As a curious note, once Haxchi had become popular, you could also observe <em>Dr. Kawashima’s Brain Training</em> climbing the charts on the eShop, happy coincidence?</p><h4 id="unlocking-iosu">Unlocking IOSU</h4><p>Now that users can run homebrew without depending on the web browser, is there something missing? Well, signature checks are still enforced, so Starbuck may need a bit more tweaking.</p><p>And here is where the good-old term of <strong>Custom Firmware (CFW)</strong> surfaces. Now that we’ve got IOSU kernel exploits and all necessary encryption keys, we could force Starbuck to boot an alternative system image (<code>fw.img</code>) from the SD card. The new system could have many ‘annoyances’ removed, like entitlements and signature checks. Well, this is what the Wii U homebrew scene called a ‘CFW’.</p><p>Still, a CFW needs a bootstrapper, such as a homebrew application (with its set of IOSU exploits) that reboots Starbuck into our arbitrary image. Well, that task was taken care of by Dimok and his <strong>CFW booter</strong> utility released on October 2016 <sup id="bibref:65"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-cfw_booter" role="doc-biblioref">[65]</a></sup>.</p><p>Now, regarding the actual CFW, hackers like smea released a set of utilities called <strong>IOSUHAX</strong> that facilitated the authoring of a customised IOSU firmware image <sup id="bibref:66"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-iosuhax" role="doc-biblioref">[66]</a></sup>.</p><p>A notable utility included with IOSUHAX was ‘Redirected NAND’ (<strong>redNAND</strong>). This enabled users to dump the contents of the NAND into an image file stored in the SD card, and then make both Espresso and Starbuck boot from there instead. The main advantage of this environment is that any change in IOSU or Cafe OS would not permanently affect the primary operating systems (found in NAND). Hence, any accidental damage done within redNAND could not break the console, meaning hackers and developers could use redNAND to play with the system files without worrying about permanent damage. Just another utility to make the life of security researchers a bit easier.</p><p>And so, CFWs (in the form of <code>fw.img</code> files) began surfacing on the net, each providing different types of customisations, including the <strong>removal of signature checks</strong> and even the addition of new system calls (interacting with IOSU Kernel modules) for homebrew programs to enjoy. All in all, allowing to install and run homebrew programs as ‘official’ channels on the System Menu.</p><h4 id="tweaking-cafe-os">Tweaking Cafe OS</h4><p>As running a CFW quickly became the chosen method for any hacked Wii U, subsequent years focused on simplifying the steps required.</p><p>December 2016 saw the developments of CFWs that didn’t require an <code>fw.img</code> anymore. Instead, the exploits altered the running IOSU and Cafe OS on-the-fly, they also disabled signature checks and added new system calls. FIX94’s fork of Haxchi and Dimok’s Mocha CFW <sup id="bibref:67"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-mocha" role="doc-biblioref">[67]</a></sup> are examples of these.</p><p>Moreover, the turn of 2017 saw the flourishment of sophisticated Wii U homebrew apps. To name a few:</p><ul><li><strong>SwapDRC</strong> allows to swap the TV’s framebuffer and audio with the GamePad ones on-the-fly <sup id="bibref:68"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-swapdrc" role="doc-biblioref">[68]</a></sup>. This is particularly useful for games that don’t provide mirroring capabilities.</li><li><strong>Nintendont</strong> (another authoring of FIX94) maps the legacy hardware on unsupported Wiis (or vWii mode) so GameCube games can be played without resorting to any kind of emulation <sup id="bibref:69"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-nintendont" role="doc-biblioref">[69]</a></sup>. While originally a Wii-only app, Nintendont can also be packaged with a GameCube game and installed as a Wii U channel (meaning it would take advantage of the Wii U’s native storage). Then, the GameCube game would run on vWii mode but with extra support for the GamePad (as any other vWii virtual console game enjoyed).</li><li>The <strong>Homebrew App Store</strong> provides a catalogue of hundreds of free homebrew apps ready to be downloaded directly from the Wii U (and then launched from the Homebrew Launcher) <sup id="bibref:70"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hbappstore" role="doc-biblioref">[70]</a></sup>.</li><li><strong>WUP Installer</strong> to install channels on the Wii U’s System Menu <sup id="bibref:71"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-wupinst" role="doc-biblioref">[71]</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>Much later on (now entering the year 2021), developer ‘Maschell’ published a new set of tools that eventually replaced the haxchi suite as the default tools for hacking a Wii. In it, Maschell brought a forked version of the Mocha CFW which could now be bootstrapped from the ‘Health and Safety’ app (using a new revision of the exploit that tampered with game assets <sup id="bibref:72"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-failst" role="doc-biblioref">[72]</a></sup>), thereby not requiring to purchase a Virtual Console DS game anymore. The new CFW suite also exposes a consolidated set of APIs to help developers implement plugins for Cafe OS, this was packaged up under a new suite/environment called <strong>Tiramisu</strong> <sup id="bibref:73"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-tiramisu" role="doc-biblioref">[73]</a></sup>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/tiramisu.29a89ae7c4c450f0e56ba3d41bff773e6f3d5e51a2443acac45e2569472cfcac.jpg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wiiu/homebrew/tiramisu.29a89ae7c4c450f0e56ba3d41bff773e6f3d5e51a2443acac45e2569472cfcac.jpg" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>The new Environment Loader (part of Tiramisu) lets the user select a particular set of patches and plugins before booting up the System Menu (or any other app of choice).</figcaption></figure><p>And here is when the story comes to an end.
