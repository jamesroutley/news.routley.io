<h3>Who Chooses C++Builder CE?</h3>
<p data-translate-id="17512">Individual C++ developers, hobbyists, and students who are learning new programming languages, starting to develop powerful high-performance native Windows and iOS apps, maintaining open source C++Builder projects, or learning the C++Builder IDE, who are making less than $5000 in revenue and want to get started with professional-level developer tools.</p>
<p data-translate-id="23023">It’s also perfect for early stage startups who are bootstrapping their product vision before securing capital! Develop your professional app with the CE, knowing that you can skip the learning curve your competition faces when building for multiple platforms.</p>

<h3>Am I Eligible for C++Builder CE?</h3>
<p data-translate-id="17513">If you&#39;re an individual you may use C++Builder CE to create apps for your own use and apps that you can sell until your revenue reaches $5,000 per year.</p>
<p data-translate-id="17514">If you’re a small company or organization without revenue (or up to $5,000 per year in revenue), you can also use the C++Builder CE. Once your company’s total revenue reaches US $5,000, or your team expands to more than 5 developers, you can move up to an unrestricted commercial license with Professional edition.</p>
