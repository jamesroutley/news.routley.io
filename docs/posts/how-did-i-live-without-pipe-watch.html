    <h1>Show HN: How did I live without Pipe Watch?</h1>

<p><code>pw</code> stands for Pipe Watch. Pipe-Watch is a new monitoring utility for
Unix-like systems, developed starting in April 2022.</p>
<p>Scroll down for a demo video.</p>
<p><code>pw</code> can monitor anything that produces output. <code>tail -f /var/logfile</code>,
<code>tcpdump</code>, you name it. In particular, it&#39;s suitable when the output
is spewing at a fast rate.</p>
<p><code>pw</code> does not show you everything. Of course, it reads all the data, but it
does that in the background. It continuously pumps lines of input through a
small FIFO buffer. This buffer is sampled, and displayed.  When the sampling
occurs is controlled in various ways.</p>
<p><code>pw</code> is a little over 1200 lines of code, all in one source file, compiling to
a tiny executable. It depends on no libraries other than the POSIX standard
functions; all terminal control is via ANSI sequences. It does like to have a
<code>struct winsize</code> and an <code>ioctl</code> to fill it in. Since it only retains the last
portion of the real-time input, it doesn&#39;t need a lot of memory. There is
a seven line GNU Makefile to build it. If that doesn&#39;t work for you, try it
some other way. It tested it on on Solaris 10, and older Mac OS, Cygwin and a
few GNU/Linuxes. It built on OpenBSD, but didn&#39;t run properly; I didn&#39;t
investigate into it. Patches welcome.</p>
