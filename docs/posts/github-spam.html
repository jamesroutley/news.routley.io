Any site that accepts user-generated content will need to figure out how to prevent people from submitting spam, whether that is for scams, malicious software, or X-rated material. I have been getting tagged in Crypto related for the past 6 months or so. In the past 24 hours I have been tagged in two of them.</p><h2>The Issue</h2><p>Today, though, was my “lucky” day. I got tagged in two scams, but one of them is still up! So let’s take a look into it.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="1024" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_800,h_1024/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-800x1024.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_800/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-800x1024.png 800w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_234/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-234x300.png 234w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_768/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-768x983.png 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_1200/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-1200x1536.png 1200w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_211/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM-211x270.png 211w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossless,ret_img,w_1476/https://djanes.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-28-at-1.47.02 PM.png 1476w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></figure><p>As we can see in the screenshot above, there is a copy and paste message from a seemly auto-generated user and a bunch of real users tagged below as “Winners”.

Do you know the process of reporting this? <strong>Copy Link</strong> -&gt; <strong>Go to user’s profile page</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Block &amp; Report</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Report Abuse button</strong> -&gt; <strong>*New page* Click “I want to report harmful… cryptocurrency abuse”</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click “I want to report suspicious cryptocurrency or mining content.” button</strong> -&gt; <strong>FINALLY</strong> paste the link you copied 10 years ago into the form box and give your justification on why this user did a bad thing and hope that the link still works/content is still up by the time they get around to looking at it…</p><h2>The Fix</h2><p>So what can be done about this? What can GitHub do? I have a couple of “simple” ideas. I say simple because I realize that not only is user-generated content moderation an uphill battle, but doing it at scale adds another level of complexity to it all.<br/></p><p>If a user is posting multiple comments in a relatively short period of time (lets say a day), have some system that checks to see if it’s a 95% copy and paste to all of their other issues? Ok, this could snag some real users who, say, use templates in their PRs or issues. Fine, there must be some way to rate that account on a number of other factors and their past activity. If they have no repos, no commits in any repos (public or private), no profile picture, no bio, no SSH keys, etc etc, and all they are doing is making comments…. That is a lot of red flags to me personally. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With the rise of generative AI and ChatGPT being able to write endless variations of 1 spam template to bypass the similarity check I just proposed above, content moderation will continue to be an uphill battle. It most likely will get even harder! I am a bit surprised though about GitHub’s, seemingly, lack of ability to handle this sort of spam. I am 100% sure (no proof, though) that intelligent people are already working on this at GitHub, but it’s a clear that they need a concrete plan moving forward. They need to put some real effort into it. Hell, train some AI to auto-filter or auto-rank comments before they get posted. If there are too many red flags, then hold those comments for human moderation before letting it be posted. Spam is nothing new, and I am sure that spam on GitHub is nothing new, but it seems to be getting worse and the only thing getting better are the spammers.</p></div></article></div></div>
