<p>Having grown up in the 2000s, I love when I discover that something I presumed was banal back then was, in fact,
part of some untold history.</p>
<p>I remember a lot of websites at that time said “this website is better viewed with Firefox”, or
“download Firefox with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929112157/http://tools.google.com/firefox/toolbar/FT5/intl/en/features.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Toolbar</a>”
banners. I mostly ignored those since every website just looked ok in Internet Explorer (sorry) and I also could
install the Google Toolbar for IE — eventually, I would give Firefox a chance and end up switching, but that’s another history.</p>
<p><em>Ready for some nostalgia?</em></p>

<p>So, now I know that, in fact, it was <em>not from the benevolence of bloggers</em> that Firefox was recommended, but
<strong>because Google was paying them $1 for every user</strong> they could convince to download the infamous “Firefox <em>with Google Toolbar</em>”
browser since 2005 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051124122645/http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3562286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through an AdSense program</a>.</p>
<p>The Firefox community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051203013537/http://www.spreadfirefox.com:80/node/19678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the referral program very well</a>
and even developed scripts to convince more people to switch to Firefox:</p>

<p>Google also sponsored Firefox in its search page home for a brief period of time:</p>

<p>Of course, people back them thought that this kind of partnership could harm the open web, because — <em>*cough*
*cough*</em> — Google <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/a-dangerous-conflict-of-interest-between-firefox-and-google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had too many conflicts of interest</a>
with web browsers to be so close to one of them. How little they know…</p>
<p>Anyway, by 2008 the AdSense referrals program was <a href="https://problogger.com/adsense-retire-their-referrals-program-and-launch-the-google-affiliate-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued</a>,
and getting your users to download Firefox was no longer an income stream for bloggers. At that time, Firefox already
had <a href="https://www.w3counter.com/trends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about one-third of the browser market share</a>. It was also about the same time
when Chrome was announced, but this time Google bet on
<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/google-advertises-chrome-giant-uk-newspaper-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more traditional ad-formats</a>,
before going all-in and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/firefox-install-google-chrome-home-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoting it on the search page too</a>.</p>
