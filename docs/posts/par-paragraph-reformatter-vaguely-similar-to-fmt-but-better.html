<h2><a name="building">Building It</a></h2>

<p>On most UNIX-like systems, “<samp>make -f
protoMakefile</samp>” will work, but you might
want to read the comments in <samp>protoMakefile</samp>,
or use the <a href="http://www.nicemice.net/par/Par152-autoconf.tar.gz">autoconf
add-on for Par 1.52</a> contributed by <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/">Nelson H. F. Beebe</a>, or take a look at some <a href="http://www.nicemice.net/par/build-hints.var">hints</a> for building <code>par</code> on
various platforms.


</p><h2><a name="apologies">Apologies</a></h2>

<p>Par began in July 1993 as a small program designed to do one narrow
task: reformat a single paragraph that might have a border on either
side.  It was pretty clean back then.  Over the next three months, it
very rapidly expanded to handle multiple paragraphs, offer more options,
and take better guesses, at the cost of becoming extremely complex, and
very unclean.  It is nowhere near the optimal design for the larger task
it now tries to address.  Its only redeeming features are that it is
extremely useful (I find it indispensable), extremely portable, and very
stable since version 1.41 released on 1993-Oct-31.

</p><p>Back in 1993 I had very little experience at writing documentation
for users, so the documentation for Par became rather nightmarish.
There is no separation between how-it-works (which is painfully complex)
and how-to-use-it (which is fairly simple, if you can ever figure it
out).

</p><p>Someday I ought to reexamine the problem, and redesign a new, clean
solution from scratch.  I don&#39;t know when I might get enough free time
to start on such a project.  Text files may be obsolete by then.
