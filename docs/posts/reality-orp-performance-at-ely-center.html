              <p>
                Last Thursday, Andrei and I performed again as
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/art/reality-orp">REALITY ORP</a> at another
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weirdmusicnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird Music Night</a>
                event. This one was New Haven, which is where we live and also
                where that event series normally takes place.
                <a href="https://elycenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ely Center</a>
                is moving locations soon, so this will be the last Weird Music
                Night in their current space, an ornate, crumbling mansion with
                carved banisters. I am glad that we got to play in that space
                before they moved. Because there are so many rooms, everyone
                usually gets to set up in their own area and then the audience
                just moves from one room to the next when another act begins.
                Compared to hasty set changes in cramped spaces in Brooklyn
                where everyone has to move their tables around or break down
                gear right after playing, it is quite luxurious, and makes for a
                fun experience as each new space becomes activated.

                Our friend
                <a href="https://videoactiveavocado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kit Young</a>
                also performed as New Haven Noise Machine, a collaborative
                project with his friend Tryx. They live-scored a bunch of video
                portraits that Kit shot at the
                <a href="https://videosync.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Sync</a>
                event last month in Portland, OR (which Andrei helped organize!)
              </p>
              <p>
                Some local friends came out, as well as a couple who came from
                neighboring towns in Connecticut. I was given a CBD seltzer and
                a slice of very diversely topped pizza. Many thanks to
                <a href="https://www.johnodonnellprojects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John O&#39;Donnell</a>
                for hosting and organizing again, and to Merlin and the amazing
                crew of Ely Center elves for all their work and energy.

                Below, you can find some artifacts, including a video recording
                of (most of) our set, and some images. I actually remembered to
                snap a few photos, possibly mostly because I wanted to show off
                my outfit in which I dressed as much as possible like my own
                visuals.
