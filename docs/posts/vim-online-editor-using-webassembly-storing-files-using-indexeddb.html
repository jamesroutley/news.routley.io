    <h1>Show HN: Vim online editor using WebAssembly, storing files using IndexedDB</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
Hey! This is still in beta, which means LOTS of exciting new features are being developed! And yes, it&#39;s OPEN SOURCED! You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/programmerhat/vim-online-editor">Github: programmerhat/vim-online-editor</a>
</p>

<p>
Got a feature request? I&#39;d love to hear it! I&#39;m on <a href="https://twitter.com/programmerhat">Twitter @programmerhat</a>. I will occasionally do product decisions via polling on Twitter! You can also send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@programmerhat.com">hello@programmerhat.com</a>.
</p>

<p>NOTE that this is downloading 2 MB, so give it a second for it to fully download.</p>

<p>To open a file, you can drag &amp; drop file into the canvas/vim frame, and it will open. I&#39;m working on adding a &#34;Open From Computer&#34; button.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

We used github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm as a starting point. However there were a lot of missing stuff. This is a changelog of stuff we added.

<ul>
  <!-- <li></li> -->
  <li>Rename vim.data.bmp to fs.txt, because bmp files were not getting compressed by the web server for some reason.</li>
  <li>different starting screen</li>
  <li>make vim&#39;s starting directory $HOME instead of `/`</li>
  <li>Make NEW files persist between edit sessions</li>
  <li>Make &#34;tryit.js&#34; persist between edit sessions</li>
  <li>Make vimrc persist on WRITE and not on vim quit</li>
  <li>Focus the editor properly to top of canvas instead of top of webpage when the canvas is clicked on.</li>
  <li>Make vim canvas fill up as much of the screen as possible</li>
  <li>One button click &#34;Load vimrc&#34; to configure vimrc. This was a dealbreaker for me to personally use vim online</li>
  <li>One button click to paste into vim. Make it super easy to paste a custom vimrc in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vim Editor Online TODO</h2>

<p>
&#34;github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm&#34; is a great starting point. However we plan on adding
a lot more features to make this as good as the vim you&#39;re used to. This is our TODO list.
</p>

<ul>
  <!-- <li></li> -->
  <li>TODO: &#34;Upload file&#34; button</li>
  <li>TODO: implement delete file, which should correspondingly delete file in IndexedDB</li>
  <li>TODO: Able to directly edit the filesystem.</li>
  <li>TODO: Implement loading of vim sessions from a persistent file.</li>
  <li>TODO: Implement support for a plugin such as Vundle.</li>
  <li>TODO: mouse support</li>
  <li>TODO: vim command history (`:e ~/.vim` and uparrow should go up history)</li>
  <li>TODO: vim account management. Be able to open source code from anywhere in the world. Use vimrc across machines/browsers</li>
  <li>TODO: allow creation of new directories.</li>
  <li>TODO: When user loads a file not in filesystem, then load NEW files from IndexedDB. This is VERY technically challenging. Requires a sleep in the Web Worker to make IndexedDB call look synchronous.</li>
  <li>TODO: Make paste work in Vim&#39;s command line mode `:`</li>
  <li>TODO: check what is the string limit on Web Worker name, which impacts how large the filesytem can be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the Vim Online Editor?</h2>

<p>
  This is &#34;Vim Online&#34;, a vim editor in browser. It&#39;s a online vim editor that allows you can install your vimrc, and this app will remember your vimrc between visits to a vim editor online.
</p>

<p>
  The Online Vim Editor is building off groundbreaking efforts by @rhysd and @coolwanglu to bring vim to the browser.
</p>

<p>
  While those projects did a great job getting started on an online vim editor, there are still many missing pieces. The most important missing feature in my opinion is being able to install a vimrc to your vim editor online get back all the keybindings you&#39;re used to.
</p>

<p>
  Another really important missing feature of a vim editor online is being able to save files easily and navigate between files easily.
</p>

<p>
  Another really important feature of a vim editor online is being able to git clone a repo into the browser.
</p>

<p>
  What would really be cool is being able to edit files from the filesystem, using the WASI API.
</p>

<p>
  Even if direct access to the filesystem isn&#39;t possible, an autosync with the source code so that you could easily test the code would be super cool.
</p>

<h2>What is the vision for the Vim Editor Online?</h2>

<p> I&#39;m thinking this is going to take inspiration from these projects: </p>

<ul>
  <li>gvim</li>
  <li>online notepad</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project is going to use vim.wasm as a starting point because that project actually supports clipboard.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, the vim.wasm project by rhysd appears not to have had any serious progress for several years. Not since Sep 18, 2021. I last checked Dec 16, 2022.
</p>

<h2>Who made the Vim Online Editor?</h2>

<p>
  &#34;Vim Online&#34; was built by the lovely folks at <a href="https://www.programmerhat.com">programmerhat.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We happen to be huge Vim enthusiasts ourselves. Using Vim for many years. It&#39;s the best editor in the world.
</p>

<p>
  And of course we&#39;re software engineers! We like building software.
</p>

<p>
  What we&#39;d LOVE to hear from you are FEATURE REQUESTS! We know there&#39;s a lot of work needed to make this as good as the Vim you&#39;re used to in the terminal. So interact with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/programmerhat">Twitter @programmerhat</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@programmerhat.com">hello@programmerhat.com</a>
</p>

<h2>How to use Vim Online Editor?</h2>

<p>
  If you&#39;ve got your own vimrc, you&#39;ll probably want to install that straight away. Click on &#34;Load vimrc&#34;, then copy your vimrc, and click &#34;Paste&#34; to install your vimrc. Do &#34;:write&#34; and reload the tab. The vimrc will be installed.
</p>

<p>
  Caveat is that this app currently does not support plugins.
</p>

<p>
  Then just click the vim box and you&#39;re good to go!
</p>

<p>
  It&#39;s free. Doesn&#39;t cost anything. There will be some ads to help fund feature development. There are a lot of features I want to build.
</p>

<h2>Why use Vim Online Editor?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Because you love vim.</li>
  <li>Because you don&#39;t have access to vim somehow (maybe you&#39;re on a Chromebook that doesn&#39;t allow access to the system)</li>
  <li>Especially if you&#39;re on Windows and you still want to use vim.</li>
  <li>Because you want a notepad of some sort in the browser, and you want to use vim bindings instead of normal notepad.</li>
<ol>
