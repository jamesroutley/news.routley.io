    <h1>Grug Notes, A tool for text: simple, fast, self-organizing notes</h1>

Hi! This is a work in progress. Instead of a fancy landing page, here&#39;s a wall of text explaining. <del>Demo video coming soon.</del> And a 1st draft demo video:

We&#39;re in early (pre-alpha) and rapid development. At the same time, we already find Grug Notes useful, so feel free to sign up. Just expect some bugs and ongoing changes! Follow, and send questions or feedback to @grugnotes on Twitter.

</p><h2>Tell me more</h2><p>
Our goal is to be the most straightforward note-taking application in the world. Keep track of whatever&#39;s on your mind, whether it be the name of someone you just met, meeting notes, or any text you might need to reference later. We aim to reduce friction at every level with a no-frills interface and with modern artificial intelligence to pull structured data out of each note.

</p><h2>Okay, but what makes you different?</h2><p>
We are not like others. We are a product from a canoe-building company. No joke. We are born out of Kamanu Composites, a local manufacturer in Hawai&#39;i that uses aerospace technology to build the best canoes in the world. GrugNotes is a rewrite/spin-out of a DIY ERP software started in 2008. In 2020, Kamanu stepped outside its box and made 900,000 face shields in four months -- quickly learning some lessons on scale, efficiency, and the value of note-taking in that process. Now we&#39;re thinking, why not make some software too? It seems easier than canoe building if you ask us.

</p><h2>Wait, what?! </h2><p>
Yeah, that&#39;s our story.

</p><h2>What are you trying to be like?</h2><p>
For a boring application like note-taking, we take design inspiration from websites like Hacker News, Craigslist, and McMaster Carr. Functionality over everything. Fewer clicks, less friction, fewer tags, less fluff. We literally load 100% of the notes on one page because CMD/CTRL F is awesome. We will do this until we find it doesn&#39;t scale.

</p><h2>Who is this for?</h2><p>
Anyone. If you&#39;re an AI researcher at MIT or a student at Stanford, that&#39;s cool, but we&#39;re building this for the everyday grug, i.e. ourselves first. Main grug @keizo is incredibly unorganized and excels at procrastination. He needs all the help he can get. He wants to spend zero time organizing or thinking about his notes and will happily spend years of his life trying to achieve that. Classic engineer.

</p><h2>I&#39;m a PKM, TFT nerd. Gimme the leet details.</h2><p>
We have #tags, [[tags]], and backlinks. We have tag synonyms.

We like to call each tag a &#34;prompt.&#34; Each prompt has a URL of grugnotes.com/username/prompt-name/. For every prompt, you can have one block (simply a text box) for each day. We are not a &#34;block-level&#34; app, as many outliners call it (where each line has an address), but instead, we think of each text box as an individual plain text file.

Any prompt/tag can be a datatype to collect structured data. Datatypes can be assigned to other prompts/tags. Some datatypes are auto-extracted with AI: natural language dates, people, companies, and locations. For example, AI will identify names in your notes -- say we type John John Florence. He will be tagged and also assigned the datatype &#39;Person.&#39; You can add attributes to the person prompt like phone number, email, etc. We are working on books next and will continue to add functionality like this.

We have implemented some outliner-like functionalityâ€”tab in with tab or down with return. Indentation is four spaces. Colors change on indentation to identify outline levels (eventually will be customizable). Backlinks (mentions) use indentation to decide what to show from the original note. In our opinion, bullets are unnecessary clutter -- although markdown is an option if you like your bullets. Some markdown syntax is supported, like links, bold, and italics. Although, in general, we don&#39;t want anyone to memorize syntax. Ctrl-return cycles through a customizable list of characters at the start of any given line. We like to use ðŸ‘‰ and âœ… for to-do lists.

When we started this, we had no idea what PKM (personal knowledge management) or TFT (tools for thought) was. Yes, it&#39;s the software category we&#39;re in, and you can call this a second brain if you want. But at the end of the day, our focus is on improving productivity and record-keeping in the context of a canoe manufacturing company (that has an unreasonable tendency to DIY everything). We hope others find it useful too.

</p><h2>Tell me more about the software development side.</h2><p>
Infinite javascript stacks developed in the past decade have made web apps bloated and slow. User interfaces have gotten worse. We&#39;ve seen it firsthand with many SAAS apps used in small businesses over the last 15 years. Even apple notes would hang and show blank screens often, at least in our experience. But we couldn&#39;t go back to paper and pencil!

Main grug @keizo learned web development optimizing for 56k modems, so a lightweight progressive web app seemed the right way to build a note app. Fast and simple. Why load 20 MB of javascript when you can load all your notes instead? The tech stack is Python, Django, and SQL database, with HTMX (big fans and of grugbraindev -- no relation) on the front end.

We host on google cloud, and yes, we use Open AI.

</p><h2>Who should not use this?</h2><p>
If you&#39;re adamant about local first or end-to-end encryption, stick with Apple Notes, LogSeq, or Reflect Notes. For us, those features add friction. And we&#39;re building canoes over here, not storing nuclear codes.

Also, if you need other media besides text, like images, pdfs, etc. Those features are low on our priority list, and unless a VC wants to give us a fat wad of cash (promise we&#39;ll only use half to build canoes), they will take time.

</p><h2>Mobile Support?</h2><p>
Add to home works, and we&#39;ll keep trying to improve there.

</p><h2>This SUCKS</h2><p>
We can&#39;t stress how early this is. You&#39;ll see unimplemented features all over the place (no delete block, for example) and occasional rendering errors. So yes, we think it&#39;s both magical and sucks all at the same time. The beauty of software is that improvement compounds! We just started four months ago, part-time at that. Patience! Please send us feedback directly by dm @grugnotes on Twitter.

</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p>
$15/mo to start. We have yet to determine our numbers and costs of AI processing, but we want to make sure we cover that and can cover our costs from day 1. Kamanu Composites has been around for 15 years but cannot sponsor our operating costs, and we are not VC backed.

</p><h2>You expect me to pay for an app in development? </h2><p>
Yes. Actually, you can&#39;t yet, but payment options will be up soon. Go ahead and use it for free until then. :)

</p><h2>Referral Program</h2><p>
As soon as paid plans start, we&#39;re going to try a referral program for early adopters:

The first 99 paying users are &#34;Founding Grugs.&#34;
For any referral you get to sign up for a paid account, we&#39;ll pay you 25% of the persons recurring revenue.

Paying users 100-999 are &#34;Early Grugs.&#34;
Same deal, at 20%

Paying users 1000-9999 will be &#34;Grug &#39;Ohana.&#34;
Same deal, at 15%

*In the longshot that anyone starts making over 100k annually, we may donate excess beyond that to charity or other causes. Also, if we realize this is financially, legally, or otherwise impossible, don&#39;t sue us if we change it.
