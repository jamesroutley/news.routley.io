    <h1>Book Review: DNFs in 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent between a third and a full half of this year “reading” two books. I put reading in quotations because in
reality, reading a book that I’m not enjoying ends up with me reading the book less and articles on my phone more. When
I’m reading a good book, I get through 10-20 pages a night before falling asleep. I went weeks to months without picking
these books up at all.</p><p>I felt some obligation to finish these books, so didn’t start anything else for a while. Too long. 2025 rule is that if
something is slow for longer than a week, I’m on to the next book.</p><p>Anyway, the two books that occupied too much of my reading time this year are:</p><ol><li>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami</li></ol><p>I read this book in high school and recall liking it. I remembered how brutal parts of it were, but not how long it was
and slow a lot of it is. About a third of the way in, I dropped it.</p><ol start="2"><li>One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel García Márquez</li></ol><p>I loved the first half of this book, then I had a stressful month of moving and when I fully refocused on this book, I
found that I’d lost the plot. All the characters started to be named after other characters and the weirdness got less
delightful. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1cmcrda/what_am_i_missing_from_one_hundred_years_of/">This reddit thread</a> provides some interesting perspectives and makes me feel a bit better.</p><p>So what did I learn this year? I probably should avoid Magical Realism. If I’m not loving the book, drop it. I’m very
sucked in to my current read, and it’s very refreshing.</p></div></div>
