    <h1>&lt;a href=&#34;/blog/birds-east&#34; hreflang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;Birds of the East&lt;/a&gt;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><div><p>I’ve been a big advocate of nature for as long as I can remember and growing up in a city hasn’t always been the best way to get a healthy dose of it. Like many of us, I’ve had to find pockets of wild spaces, alongside parks, (which London delivers in heaps) and canals that wind through our wonderful boroughs - to get out of the hustle and bustle when it all gets too much.</p>
<p>I’m no expert but taking a walk through these areas is my idea of a perfect day in the city. If you decide to do the same, armed with or without binoculars, you too will notice our charming city dwellers – who might be a little closer than you think.</p>
<p>I’ve curated a list of some of the main birds that you can easily spot and the best locations to find them.</p>
<h3>Up first – the house sparrow</h3>
<p>These little guys are small, but mighty. Soon you will be able to spot them with your eyes closed and ears open as they have a very distinct chirping sound. They don’t come alone, you’ll usually see them in hosts playfully flying around their homes together. Unfortunately, house sparrows are on the red conservation status list, which means that they could use some of our help.</p>
<p>The male house sparrows look is serving a stocky guy named Steve who is a troublemaker at his local boozer. The females are less stout, lighter in colour and don’t have the black bib and grey cap characteristic that the males have. Their bill also changes colour as they tend to be black during mating season and grey during the rest of the year. The juvenile birds are a slightly shorter version of the females.</p>

      </div><div>
          <div><div><p>The best way to help these little guys if you’re able to, is to hang bird feed where you can. They have mini beaks that are hard and chunky which are perfect for pecking away at nuts and seeds. Make sure you do not hang these in areas which could be harmful for them, go for any bushes that are tucked away, large hedges outside your homes, or hanging them from your windows.</p>
<p>One of the best spots in east London to find these birds is along the Regent’s Canal. I walk through this canal regularly and head towards Victoria Park. The canal is adorned with scruffy bushes running throughout and is a great spot for the house sparrow to nest within. There is a little nook tucked away off the canal that is a great area to spot them in. It also has a lovely Japanese Café that does great coffee!</p>
<h3> A little bigger – the woodpigeon</h3>
<p>The classic woodpigeon  coo sums up the sound of a warm Sunday evening laid in a park. A calmer sound for us to hear the woodpigeon’s coo can be relaxing in comparison to our house sparrows which are high pitched and relentless. A popular noise that has made its way into mainstream social media and Tik Tok videos. Woodpigeons are part of the pigeon and dove family and tend to be larger than our average street pigeon. They have a rounder puffed out chest and a nicer plume of feathers but are not out and about on the streets as much as their feral pigeon counterparts. Tending, to visit parks and wooded areas instead. Distinguished by their larger size and wider frame along with the white patches on the side of their neck, which are ringed with a dull green or purple line.</p>
</div></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><div><p>In my opinion woodpigeon are the most romantic bird, mating for life they will always be seen in their pairs perched on a tall tree. Thankfully woodpigeons have a green status on the conservation list and seem to be doing well.  As their diet varies from berries and fruit, as well as seeds and they often forage on the ground in the morning and evening. I have hit the jackpot with having the privilege of watching a woodpigeon nest outside my window this summer and we call her ‘mama’, as she patiently protects her eggs by sitting on her nest all day.</p>
<p>If you want to come across a woodpigeon visit a park or small square - a great spot for them as they like to be surrounded by suburban areas. Look high up as they are usually perched on tall trees - or if you’re lucky, sat on your fence at the bottom of your garden. Regardless once you see them, look out for them snuggling up to one another as they’ll make you want to re-download your hinge app and find the one.</p>
<h3>The blue tit</h3>
<p>The blue tit needs no introduction and is a common sight, with a quick flash of blue and yellow they are easily identifiable - you may see these guys whizzing from tree to tree during summer.</p>
<p>Although they are similar to the great tit they are in fact smaller, and can be distinguished by their round blue head and white forehead. They are commonly seen in gardens as they love to fly around bird feeders and nest boxes. You can also identify them in parks with their bird song as they tend to make a lot of noise. Blue tits are very social birds and like to vocalise their location to their pals. It may be harder to spot them in parks as they will be hidden amongst the tall trees so a pair of binoculars may be a smart idea to spot them.</p>
</div></div>
      </div><div>
          <div><div><p>They like to nest in the small holes in trees and are known to use nest boxes so look out for a nest box at your local park. Although the blue tit is on the green list, they have struggled to feed this year as the wet and slightly colder weather has halted their ability to forage for winter moths from oak trees. The blue tit cleverly times hatching their chicks, to the caterpillars that feed off the buds from oak trees. As the buds have taken longer this year, the blue tit has not had an abundance of food for their chicks, therefore not being able to feed as normal. If you have a garden, pop some hanging bird feed in a secluded area where they won’t be disturbed and watch them come and go from a distance. They are a big fan of insects as well as seeds so mealworms are preferred. Give them a variety to choose from and they will always come back and give you a show.</p>
<h3><u>Lastly – the starling </u></h3>
<p>The starling is a beautiful sleek bird that gives ‘the wet look’ a whole different meaning. They may seem dull at first glance but when you look closer you will spot its beautifully iridescent colouring of green and purple feathers, with spotted white flecks. It can sometimes be harder to distinguish the female starling as they tend to be the same size as the males, however if you’re able to get a closer look the male bills have a blue-ish base, while the female birds have a pink-ish base. The juvenile starling, although young, is the same size as an adult starling, however their feathers are brown before they get their glow-up.</p>
