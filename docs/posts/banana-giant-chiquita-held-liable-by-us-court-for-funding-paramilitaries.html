at a time when Chiquita was expanding its presence in regions controlled by the AUC.<!-- --></p><p>The regular payments continued even after the AUC was designated by the US as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2001. <!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While the AUC claimed to have been created to defend landowners from attacks and extortion attempts by left-wing rebels, the paramilitary group more often acted as a death squad for drug traffickers.<!-- --></p><p>At its height, it had an estimated 30,000 members who engaged in intimidation, drug trafficking, extortion, forced displacement and killings. <!-- --></p><p>It also launched brutal attacks on villagers they suspected of supporting left-wing rebels.<!-- --></p><p>The group demobilised in 2006 after reaching a peace deal with the government, but some of its members went on to form new splinter groups which continue to be active. <!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The class-action lawsuit against Chiquita which ended on Monday focussed on nine cases, which were chosen out of hundreds of claims against the banana company. <!-- --></p><p>The jury found that the AUC was responsible for eight of the nine murders examined as part of the lawsuit.<!-- --></p><p>The jury also ruled that Chiquita had knowingly provided substantial assistance to the AUC, to a degree sufficient to create a foreseeable risk of harm.<!-- --></p><p>Chiquita said in a statement released after the verdict that the situation in Colombia was &#34;tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,&#34; it added. <!-- --></p><p>The company said it remained confident that its legal position would ultimately prevail. <!-- --></p><p>Agnieszka Fryszman, one of the leading lawyers for the plaintiffs, meanwhile praised the families she represented, saying that they had &#34;risked their lives to come forward to hold Chiquita to account, putting their faith in the United States justice system&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>She added that &#34;the verdict does not bring back the husbands and sons who were killed, but it sets the record straight and places accountability for funding terrorism where it belongs: at Chiquita&#39;s doorstep&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>Another lawyer for the Colombian families, Leslie Kroeger, said that “after a long 17 years against a well-funded defence, justice was finally served”.<!-- --></p><p>A second case against Chiquita brought by another group of plaintiffs is due to start on 15 July. <!-- --></p></div></article></div>
