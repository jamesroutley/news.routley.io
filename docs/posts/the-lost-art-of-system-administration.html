    <h1>The Lost Art of System Administration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><p><span><div><p>Sep 8, 2022</p><article><div><p>I spent a good chunk of my adolescence learning Linux systems administration. I attribute some of my success as a software engineer to the scripting and systems knowledge I picked up while installing, maintaining, and tinkering with Linux distros. </p><p>Now, one rarely needs to know things like that – runtimes are &#34;serverless,&#34; and <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/ssh-in-cloud-era">ssh is disappearing</a>. Macbooks are the developer machine. Init systems and daemons have been replaced by single-process containers. General-purpose operating systems have been replaced with small (e.g., <code>alpine</code>) or even smaller ones (e.g., microkernels). Hardware </p><p>This is the natural progression of things. Here are a few things I learned from tinkering over the years.</p><ul><li>Learning how to effectively use the command line. Unix philosophy. Pipes, scripting, and tooling. So much of programming is stitching things together.</li><li>Running and observing databases, proxies, and other self-hosted software. Sometimes it&#39;s quicker to learn something when you can watch it crash and burn up close.</li><li>Operating system primitives – filesystems, kernels, bootloaders, display managers, partitions. Dual booting or setting up a minimal distro like Arch Linux teaches you a lot about what the operating system is doing. Installing (and debugging) a display manager.</li><li>Debugging. Lots of things go wrong. It&#39;s up to you to fix it.</li></ul><p>What is the &#34;systems administration&#34; for developers today? Maybe it&#39;s playing with models like Stable Diffusion. Or maybe it&#39;s running services in the cloud.</p></div></article></div><div><div><p>Subscribe for daily posts on startups &amp; engineering.</p></div></div></span></p></div></div></div></div>
