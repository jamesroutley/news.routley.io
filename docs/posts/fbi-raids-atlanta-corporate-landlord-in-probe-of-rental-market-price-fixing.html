    <h1>FBI raids Atlanta corporate landlord in probe of rental market price fixing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cpi-posts/fbi-raids-corporate-landlord-in-major-rent-price-fixing-probe/">conducted</a> an unannounced raid of national corporate landlord Cortland Management on May 22, ramping up an investigation into an alleged rental price-fixing conspiracy that may have already impacted millions of Americans.</p><p>The surprise search was reportedly part of a criminal antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into RealPage, a <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/realpage/marketcap/">$9 billion</a> software company that recommends rent raises on millions of housing units across the U.S.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.realpage.com/blog/realpage-accounting-helps-cortland-grow-without-growing-accounting-staff/">RealPage</a> <a href="https://www.realpage.com/testimonials/cortland-achieves-peak-performance/">blog</a> <a href="https://www.realpage.com/videos/spend-management-boosts-bottom-line/">posts</a>, Atlanta, Georgia-based Cortland, which <a href="https://cortland.com/in-the-news/cortland-acquires-1700-unit-multifamily-portfolio/">owned</a> nearly 85,000 apartment units as of June 2022, used RealPage&#39;s algorithm to &#34;ensure consistent vendor pricing for their communities from Arizona to Georgia.&#34;</p>
  
  
  

  <p>RealPage&#39;s effects can be seen most noticeably in Atlanta, where software-based pricing affects more than 80% of rentals. Since 2016, rents in the city have grown by <a href="https://upriseri.com/fbi-raids-corporate-landlord-in-major-rent-price-fixing-probe-what-it-means-for-you/">80%</a> — and higher vacancy rates have not driven prices down.</p><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" role="presentation" src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1717526835_Apartments-GettyImages-1470198654.jpg?width=1000" width="1000" height="667"/><i><sup>Apartment buildings.

  <p>The problem with RealPage, according to multiple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/realpage-antitrust-lawsuits-over-rent-prices-consolidated-tennessee-2023-04-10/">lawsuits</a> filed in the past two years in California, Arizona, New York, and other states, is that its algorithm increases rental prices in response to data collected from landlords — not according to demand.</p><p>Landlords &#34;were not competing at all,&#34; Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/realpage-sued-again-over-rent-hikes-illegally-set-prices/470471">stated</a> in a February lawsuit announcement against RealPage.</p><p>&#34;They were colluding with one another,&#34; Mayes said.</p><p>According to the Arizona lawsuit, and others filed, landlords gave RealPage detailed information about rent prices, lease terms, amenities, move-out dates, and occupancy rates.</p>

  <p>&#34;Using this sensitive data RealPage directed the competitors on which units to rent, when to rent them, and at what price,&#34; Mayes stated. &#34;This was not a fair market at work, this was a fixed market.&#34;</p><p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/realpage-sued-again-over-rent-hikes-illegally-set-prices/470471"><b>State Attorney Generals Sue RealPage, Landlords Over &#39;Astronomical&#39; Rent Hikes: &#39;This Was Not A Fair Market At Work&#39;</b></a></p><p>RealPage&#39;s reach is undeniable. A <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-sues-realpage-residential">D.C. lawsuit</a> showed that 60% of apartment buildings in the area set prices using RealPage.

  <p>&#34;That&#39;s a very large chunk of the total inventory in the country when you consider that there are about 22 million investment-grade apartments in the US today,&#34; Tracy Saffos, industry principal at RealPage, said in the same post.</p><p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/where-are-rents-dropping-the-most-in-the-us/463415"><b>Where Are Rents Dropping the Most in the U.S.?</b></a></p><p>RealPage&#39;s impact on renters has been noticeable — even to executives at the company.</p><p>When asked about the role RealPage&#39;s technology played in rising apartment rents, company executive Andrew Bowen <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent">said</a> that the software was &#34;driving it.&#34;</p><p>&#34;As a property manager, very few of us would be willing to actually raise rents double digits within a single month by doing it manually,&#34; Bowen said.</p><p>Even though RealPage <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/03/realpage-antitrust-lawsuits-allege-collusion-among-corporate-landlords.html">told CNBC</a> that its landlord customers aren&#39;t required to use the rent increases its algorithm recommends, a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent">2022 investigation by ProPublica</a> revealed that landlords accepted <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2022/10/20/renters-sue-richardson-based-realpage-landlords-over-artificially-inflating-prices/?outputType=amp">80-90%</a> of the algorithm&#39;s suggestions.</p><p>RealPage sent out &#34;pricing advisors&#34; to meet with landlords in person to follow up on their use of its recommended rates, according to the February Arizona lawsuit against the company.</p><p>In the past ten years, rent inflation has outpaced overall inflation numbers by <a href="https://www.doorloop.com/blog/average-rent-by-year-in-the-united-states">40.7%</a>.</p><p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/cpi-report-rising-rent-gas-prices-keep-inflation-up/474217"><b>CPI Report: Rising Rent, Gas Prices Keep Inflation Up</b></a>
