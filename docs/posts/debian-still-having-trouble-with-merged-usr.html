<p>
The addition of the &#34;<tt>/usr</tt> merge&#34; feature has been something of longstanding mess
in the Debian world.  It seems like a relatively innocuous change, which
is in keeping with the practice of most other distributions at this point; it effectively
eliminates the top-level <tt>/bin</tt>, <tt>/sbin</tt>, and <tt>/lib*</tt>
directories in order to move their contents to the corresponding locations
under <tt>/usr</tt>.  But ever since we first <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/670071/">covered</a> the feature introduction for
Debian—more than six years ago—it has a been a recurring series of
headaches within that community.  Recent events have seemingly simply
prolonged the pain, though perhaps the end is in sight.
</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
The <tt>/usr</tt> merge idea was first <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/477467/">raised</a> in &#34;<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/">The
Case for the /usr Merge</a>&#34; by Lennart Poettering in 2012.  It came
out of the systemd community, but was not meant to be systemd-specific, as
described in, though, as the comment thread
on that LWN post indicates, the idea was controversial at least in part
because of its association with systemd.  At its core, it was a
straightforward plan to move the files in <tt>/bin</tt> to
<tt>/usr/bin</tt>, then make a symbolic link so that <tt>/bin</tt> would
resolve to <tt>/usr/bin</tt>; the same would be done for the other
top-level directories of interest (<tt>/sbin</tt> and <tt>/lib*</tt>).
</p>

<p>
The main reason behind the merge was for compatibility with other Unix
systems and to make building packages for Linux distributions easier;
upstream software, build tools, and the like would no longer have to treat
Linux specially.  Anything that relied on <tt>/bin/foo</tt> or
<tt>/usr/bin/foo</tt> would find what they were looking for, but everything
would live under <tt>/usr</tt>.  That would permit things like an immutable,
distribution-supplied <tt>/usr</tt>, snapshots of the system state would be
simpler, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Fedora, as is often the case, took the lead and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/483921/">implemented merged <tt>/usr</tt></a>, for
Fedora 17 in 2012.  Other distributions followed suit, with most of
the mainstream distributions following the Fedora approach of having a
&#34;flag day&#34; switch; new or upgraded versions of the distribution would
either install a merged <tt>/usr</tt> or switch the system to use that as
part of an upgrade.  Supporting both the old and the new layout
simultaneously was not something those distributions chose to support. 
</p>

<p>
Debian took a more incremental approach, in part because it strives not to
make wholesale changes to users&#39; systems like those required by a flag-day
upgrade to a merged <tt>/usr</tt>.  In 2016, the ability to voluntarily
switch to that scheme was added, then some attempts were made for newer
versions of the distribution to be installed with a merged <tt>/usr</tt> by
default.  In 2018, the Debian build systems were switched to use that
layout, but <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/773342/">problems cropped up</a> because
packages built under a merged <tt>/usr</tt> would sometimes fail to work on
non-merged systems.  The location of some files was being resolved at build
time to point into <tt>/usr/bin</tt> (for example), but those files only
existed in <tt>/bin</tt> on the non-merged. systems.
</p>

<p>
The build system changes were reverted, so that both types of systems could
be supported. But the problem led Ian Jackson to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=914897">ask</a> 
the Debian <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte">technical
committee</a> (often abbreviated as CTTE or ctte), which
is the ultimate arbiter of technical disputes within the project, to
override the decision by the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap">debootstrap</a> developers to
make merged <tt>/usr</tt> be the default.  Debootstrap is used to create a
base system into a directory that can then be used as a chroot environment
for building additional packages, though it has other uses as well.
</p>

<p>
The committee <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/03/msg00001.html">declined
to overrule the debootstrap maintainers</a>, but did give  a lengthy summary of
the cases for and against <tt>/usr</tt> merge.  The committee also used its advisory role to
note that the then-under-development Debian 10 (&#34;buster&#34;) would
support both system types in a &#34;weak&#34; form, but 
suggested that it was desirable that Debian 11 (&#34;bullseye&#34;) move
toward a &#34;middle&#34; ground with better support for merged <tt>/usr</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Debian, being Debian, discussed the issue multiple times along the way, at
varying levels of intensity and rancor.  Supporting both types of systems
was difficult in various ways, leading some to say that either
<tt>/usr</tt> merge should be made mandatory—or scrapped entirely.
At the end of 2020, Ansgar Burchardt <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636">asked</a> the
technical
committee to decide
whether Debian 12 (&#34;bookworm&#34;) should only support merged
<tt>/usr</tt> systems.  At the end of January 2021, the question was
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636#20">put
to a vote</a>, and the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636#178">result</a>
was unanimous in favor of doing so:
</p><blockquote>
    The Technical Committee resolves that Debian &#39;bookworm&#39; should
    support only the merged-usr root filesystem layout, dropping support
    for the non-merged-usr layout.
<p>
    Until after the release of &#39;bullseye&#39;, any implementation of this
    resolution must be done in the &#39;experimental&#39; distribution, or
    otherwise kept out of the critical paths for the release of
    &#39;bullseye&#39;.
</p></blockquote>


<h4>Symlink farms</h4>

<p>
That would seem to resolve the situation, in favor of a flag day for
Debian 12, but, as might be guessed, things did not quite work out
that way.  During the discussion on the vote, committee member Simon
McVittie expressed <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636#30">concern</a>
that there were two competing visions of what a merged <tt>/usr</tt>
meant. He wondered: &#34;<span>Should we be more specific than this in what we
vote on, to avoid 
later having to adjudicate between developers who say that a particular
implementation is or isn&#39;t merged-usr?</span>&#34;  That comment would
foreshadow the events to come.
</p>

<p>
The &#34;standard&#34; way to support <tt>/usr</tt> merge, as described above, is
sometimes called &#34;<span>merged /usr via aliased
directories</span>&#34;.  It is what the usrmerge tool, which got the ball
rolling for Debian in 2016, does; that mechanism is tracked on the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge">UsrMerge page</a> on the Debian
wiki.  An alternative, which is championed by <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/dpkg">dpkg</a> maintainer Guillem Jover, uses
&#34;symlink farms&#34;, which McVittie described as follows:
</p><blockquote>
an arrangement where all regular files that have traditionally been
   in /bin, /sbin, /lib and /lib64 are physically located in /usr,
   with /bin etc. becoming &#34;symlink farms&#34; containing symlinks like
   /bin/sh -&gt; /usr/bin/sh, /lib/ld-linux.so.2 -&gt; /usr/lib/ld-linux.so.2
   and so on
</blockquote>


<p>
There was some discussion in the bug entry about the advantages of the two
different arrangements, but most of the participants seemed to think that
the symlink-farm approach was not desirable, viable, or both.  Along the way, McVittie
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636#75">realized</a>
that the earlier decision on debootstrap seemed to indicate that the
committee thought that the aliased-directories mechanism was the singular
approach to solving the <tt>/usr</tt> merge problem.  His <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=978636#128">vote</a>
reflected that understanding.
</p>

<p>
The discussion moved to the mailing lists, where a certain amount of
consensus was found, at least in some areas.  
McVittie opened a
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=994388">bug</a>
asking the committee to resolve the aliased directories versus symlink farm
question along with others swirling around the 
upcoming <tt>/usr</tt> merge transition for bookworm. He was asking the
committee to use its formal advisory role to offer guidance on how that
transition should proceed.
</p>

<p>
A lengthy <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YWcvxFvmcK1HTQ40@momentum.pseudorandom.co.uk/">statement</a>
was put out for a vote by the committee; once again, it passed
unanimously.  The advice clearly rejected the symlink-farm approach, in favor of
aliased directories, and made it clear that packages could not assume that
systems have a merged <tt>/usr</tt> until Debian 13 (&#34;trixie&#34;)
development starts.  Beyond that, 
upgrading from either type of system to Debian 12 should work and
packages should build and function on both types of systems (until
after Debian 12), and a few other items.  The bug was marked as &#34;done&#34; on
October 18 and, once again, it seemed that the situation was resolved.
</p>

<h4>Dpkg resistance</h4>

<p>
Meanwhile, though, the dpkg maintainer was adamantly opposed to the
aliased-directories approach; his complaints were described in a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/MergedUsr">MergedUsr page</a> in
the dpkg team&#39;s section of the wiki.  It presented a long list of problems
with that approach because the mechanism is handled outside of dpkg
itself:
</p><blockquote>
This approach goes behind dpkg&#39;s back, and has caused and [does] now cause
problems due to the aliased directories, as multiple pathnames canonicalize
into different pathnames that point to the same dentry, which can mess up
anything that handles pathnames in databases and similar. Note: dpkg has
supported for a long time symlinked directories as a way to allow local
admins to manage filesystem size constraints, by moving directories
contents into other partitions, but has <b>never</b> supported aliased directories
via symlinks pointing to other directories already tracked by dpkg. This
approach makes it impossible to know what is the canonical (from dpkg&#39;s
PoV) pathname for an object just by looking at the filesystem, so it is
trivial for users use the wrong one.  
</blockquote>


<p>
Many of the entries in the list were marked with a symbol indicating:
&#34;<span>This approach is considered broken by design and is unsupported by
dpkg. dpkg-buildinfo marks packages built on these systems as tainted in
the .buildinfo file.</span>&#34;  The symlink-farm approach is superior, the
page says, even
though it still has the aliasing problem for the symbolic links that get
installed:
</p><blockquote>
This still suffers mild aliasing problems, but only for pathnames that will
end up in both locations due to backwards compatibility symlinks, which
should keep decreasing, and any such issue will self-heal over time,
eventually ending up being just a handful of them. The big difference is
that in the long term this is a tiny and decreasing bounded set of
pathnames that might end up causing problems, while the other layout is an
unbounded set affecting all pathnames permanently. Another thing that makes
a difference is that the object is a symlink, and not the same object being
accessed from different pathnames.  
</blockquote>


<p>
Both that page and the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ#Q:_Does_dpkg_support_merged-.2Fusr-via-aliased-dirs.3F">dpkg
FAQ entry</a> recommend using the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/dpkg/dpkg-fsys-usrunmess.8.en.html">dpkg-fsys-usrunmess</a>
utility, which &#34;<span>undoes the merged-/usr-via-aliased-dirs
mess</span>&#34;.  So it was perhaps unsurprising when Josh Triplett <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YjEPzAtAyfq4599F@localhost/">reported</a> in
mid-March that dpkg
had started to emit a warning when it was installed or upgraded:
</p><blockquote>
<pre>Setting up dpkg (1.21.2) ...
dpkg: warning: System unsupported due to merged-usr-via-aliased-dirs.
dpkg: warning: See &lt;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ#broken-usrmerge&gt;.
</pre>
<p>
This escalation seems in direct contradiction to the tech-ctte decision
in 994388. Moreover, this seems to effectively use package maintainer
scripts as a means of directing a complaint at Debian users that has not
gotten traction in other forums, and then directing such users at a wiki
page that contradicts a prior project decision.
</p></blockquote>


<p>
His report was aimed at the committee bug that resulted in the decision
back in October.  As Russ Allbery <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/87v8wdao3x.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">noted</a>, that kind
of a warning &#34;<span>will be perceived by users as an official declaration from Debian as
a project that their system configuration is unsupported, while
simultaneously this is the default installation mode for new systems and
something that we have elsewhere said is a correct system
configuration</span>&#34;. Burchardt <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/44664044d4c0bb886204957a6316b9f1f8b1c791.camel@43-1.org/">said</a>
that the warning was already causing confusion and asked the committee to
decide quickly on how to handle it &#34;<span>to
avoid this becoming yet another energy drain (we had several
sufficiently long enough threads about this topic already)</span>&#34;. 
</p>

<h4>Bugs and fixes</h4>

<p>
There is a question of what &#34;supported&#34; means in the context of
<tt>/usr</tt> merge, Helmut Grohne <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/Yjx21oJc2hrPmCRG@alf.mars/">said</a>; he was added to
the committee at the beginning of the year after two members reached their
term limit and retired from it.  He said:
</p><blockquote>
 At this point, neither
merged-/usr nor unmerged-/usr is supported well. Both are broken in one
way or another and nobody steps up to fix the mess. In particular, the
dpkg maintainer does not support merged-/usr in dpkg (which is his
constitutional right as long as he does not block reasonable patches),
but neither does anyone else. As such I find it difficult to disagree
with the content of the warning. I do see how it confuses people. It
definitely does not reach people who could do something about [it]. Rather it
takes users as hostages.
</blockquote>


<p>
As had been mentioned in some of the (many) threads surrounding this issue,
Ubuntu has successfully made the move to a merged <tt>/usr</tt>; as Luca
Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/1e6007352a7ccc2b0a3e7f518f66accb4736e772.camel@debian.org/">put
it</a>: &#34;<span>And on top of new installations, old installations of Ubuntu upgrading
to 21.10 and/or the soon-to-be-released 22.04 have been [forcefully]
migrated too. They are not blocked, unsupported, or broken.</span>&#34;  There
have been few problems with that transition, at least according to
<tt>/usr</tt> merge proponents, so whatever bugs exist are not
show-stopping.  But Allbery <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/87y20zckz5.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">cautioned</a> against
taking that too far:
</p><blockquote>
We know that merged-/usr is buggy, in that one can construct a
set of package operations that leave the system in an invalid state.  We
have a project disagreement over how serious those bugs are.  No one is
stepping forward to fix those bugs, which is indeed quite unfortunate.  I
personally strongly disagree with the belief that simply because Ubuntu
hasn&#39;t seen many instances of this class of bugs while using a package set
where people have not moved files between packages and out of /lib and
/bin very much if at all, it is acceptable to leave dpkg in that buggy
state.
<p>
[...]  I personally am disappointed that the folks who have been
pushing merged-/usr forward are willing to leave dpkg in a known-buggy
state without attempting to patch it to fix the remaining issues.  I
realize that there are various obstacles in successfully doing that, not
all of which are technical, but I want to believe that Debian is the sort
of project that will do the hard work (both technical and social) to fix
edge cases and maintain a high level of consistency and correctness.
</p></blockquote>


<p>
But Triplett <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YjzM0Itt6v7zE1FC@localhost/">disagreed</a> with that
characterization:
</p><blockquote>
It does not
seem at all obvious that such patches would have been accepted, given
the repeated vehement objections from the dpkg maintainer about the
chosen approach. Those objections did not invite contribution; at every
point, the assertion was that usrmerge was broken, not that dpkg needed
help supporting it.
</blockquote>


<p>
Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/a25fe9a10b08dbab534944a528b2057fb773976e.camel@debian.org/">said</a>
that looking at Ubuntu&#39;s experience is legitimate; the problems identified
are relatively small and &#34;<span>it&#39;s believed to be impossible
to get them fixed</span>&#34; over the maintainer&#39;s objections.  He asked what
else would be a reasonable way forward.  Allbery <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/87r16r0wch.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">replied</a> that
proponents of the change should create a patch to fix the problems that
have been identified in dpkg even though it might be rejected.  In part, it
comes down to finding something that is actionable under the powers of the
technical committee, he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/87h77m29m3.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">said</a> in a
follow-up: &#34;<span>It&#39;s difficult, procedurally, for the TC to do anything about a
theoretical patch that someone could write but hasn&#39;t written.</span>&#34;
</p>

<p>
Committee chair Sean Whitton <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/878rsyydkt.fsf@melete.silentflame.com/">agreed</a>
with that analysis, though he did say that he thought the committee could
take action to get the warning changed or removed; other members concurred
with that view.  Shortly thereafter,
Triplett <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/Yj1ngAk5x1Hx2h9g@localhost/">pointed
out</a> that the warning message had changed, though it was not really any
better in his view.
</p>

<p>
Grohne also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/Yj3EB241IuwjOs1C@alf.mars/">wanted to
see</a> fixes for dpkg to better support merged <tt>/usr</tt>.  He even
mentioned the possibility of reverting the change:
</p><blockquote>
If the resulting bugs do not get fixed, we may need to consider
other means for limiting their impact. The most obvious method here is
revisiting the decision and considering whether the /usr-merge may have
failed. On a process level, it certainly has failed. At some point, we
may need to look at a bigger picture than the technical one. If the
people driving the change are not able to do it, then maybe we should
not have that change in the first place and revert back to the known
working state. Of course that route is not without cost.
</blockquote>


<h4>A patch arrives</h4>

<p>
But as the thread progressed, Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/3241eaf8ecc70a65c79c7a754a509fbf3746d841.camel@debian.org/">noted</a>
that a link to a dpkg patch had just been posted to IRC by a user named &#34;uau&#34;.
Allbery (among others) <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/87zglevw1h.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">was elated</a> to
see the patch and immediately had some feedback on ways to improve it.
Committee member Gunnar Wolf <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/Yj38m9CajeXTNkoK@mosca.iiec.unam.mx/">thought</a>
that the &#34;<span>patch seems sane from a first, very much
10000m-point-of-view</span>&#34;; he wondered if it had &#34;<span>been shared with
Guillem, or included in any relevant 
bug report</span>&#34;. 
</p>


<p>
Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/268b468712e13c98d2da451adcd11b62d46170cd.camel@debian.org/">followed
up</a> with some more information from the author of the patch, again from
IRC. The author said &#34;<span>that some time ago the patch was presented to the dpkg
maintainer, who rejected it with an answer along the lines of the usual
&#39;usrmerge is broken by design&#39;, with no further comment</span>&#34;.   Boccassi
wondered if those who had been looking for a patch of this nature would &#34;<span>try and
take it forward themselves</span>&#34;.   Based on that conversation with the
author, the license of the patch is the same as for dpkg, so that should not be
a barrier.
</p>

<p>
Grohne <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YkKmMmM+5oO7hqLQ@alf.mars/">said</a> that
he remembered some more concrete criticism of the patch and that the patch
itself says that it is incomplete, so it cannot go into dpkg in its current
form.  He lamented the state of the transition, and once again raised the
specter of reverting the whole thing:
</p><blockquote>
The more and more I have to deal with the /usr-merge the more I get
disappointed by how badly this transition is planned and carried out. In
principle, the technical merits seem solvable to me, but the total
failure on the process level leaves me wish for a revert. I am really
surprised that instead of improving the process, you carry on with that
destructive attitude. Given this, it seems unsurprising that Guillem
does not want to interact with you. Of course that&#39;s not an excuse for
implementing the recent changes to dpkg. The communication is clearly
failing on both sides, which is why we&#39;re here at the ctte again.
</blockquote>


<p>
Burchardt <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/43d36b5fd721df92694a4478d16b491a524e9e55.camel@43-1.org/">asked</a>
that Grohne stop suggesting a revert unless he wanted to start the process
of asking the committee (or the developers by way of a general resolution)
to do so.  There are lots of problems with making that change at this
point, so: &#34;<span>If you don&#39;t want that solution, please don&#39;t suggest it repeatedly:
it&#39;s non-motivating to spend any further time.</span>&#34;  

</p><p>
Things went further off the rails on March 29, with a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/NonMaintainerUpload">non-maintainer
upload</a> (NMU) for dpkg made by Bastian Blank  that removed the warning
and stopped installing 
dpkg-fsys-usrunmess.  An NMU is something of a hostile act for a package
with an active maintainer.  As <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YkPgwKw7UbZhFfor@localhost/">reported</a> by
Triplett, the NMU was quickly overridden by Jover with a comment:
&#34;<span>This also clears a bullying NMU.</span>&#34;  As Triplett put it:
&#34;<span>we&#39;re now even further into full-blown &#39;fights in the archive&#39; 
territory</span>&#34;. 
</p>

<p>
In his <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-ctte/YknjGJ0XOOailvNi@alf.mars/">most recent
message</a> (as of this writing), Grohne said that Boccassi was not being
constructive and that he was not surprised Jover did not want to
communicate with him about the problems.  He reiterated some of the
problems that have occurred with the feature, noting that the current problem was
largely not technical:
</p><blockquote>
 It has a history of its
proponents not fixing the resulting bugs, but deferring them to others
and/or denying/downgrading them. I&#39;ve definitely spent more than a week
on fixing /usr-merge breakage excluding the time discussing it. It is
not working fine at all. Possibly, it is fixable on a technical level,
but it is totally broken socially. Please stop this unconstructive
behaviour.
<p>
While this may sound single-sided, Guillem&#39;s behaviour wrt /usr-merge
cannot be described as constructive either. Rest assured, that side of
the picture is not being ignored. That should also be evident from
dpkg.git at this time.
</p></blockquote>


<p>
The <a href="https://git.dpkg.org/cgit/dpkg/dpkg.git">dpkg Git
repository</a> does show a <a href="https://git.dpkg.org/cgit/dpkg/dpkg.git/commit/?id=75fe33f1e2f2790c75850db51b80a82bb8b2926f">recent
change</a> by Jover that removes the offending warning, but only on Debian systems.
The commit message could certainly be interpreted as non-constructive, as
well, however.  For example: &#34;<span>On Debian some people seem so offended by a
(factual) warning, that the 
obvious recourse has been for them to bully and abuse.</span>&#34;  The
communication between proponents of <tt>/usr</tt> merge and the
maintainer of the critical package-manager for the distribution seems utterly broken
at this point—probably irretrievably so. 
</p>

It is not clear where things go from here.  The technical committee has
repeatedly made its feelings known on the path it wants to see the project
take, but it cannot order anyone to do anything, exactly.  Debian developers are
volunteers and its packages are the personal fiefdoms of their maintainers.
The <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">Debian
Constitution</a> does allow the committee to override developer
decisions—to not accept a patch, for example—but someone has to voluntarily
do the work to bring the late-breaking dpkg patch up to snuff.

It seems like some project elder (in terms of experience, not necessarily
age) could steer this kind of change through the rocks.  While it would
appear to be
vanishingly unlikely that the committee would backtrack on its three
earlier decisions,
even though there are two new members since they were made, it is not
impossible, at least in theory.  The bugs that
exist in dpkg with the aliased-directories version of <tt>/usr</tt> merge
may simply live on as irritations for a time, since they do not really seem
to rise to the level of a release-blocking bug, at least so far.  We will
all have to wait and see how it turns out in the next episode of &#34;As the
Debian Turns&#34; ...
