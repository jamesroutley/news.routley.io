    <h1>Pop_OS 24.04 LTS with COSMIC desktop environment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-7773bbb7="" data-v-7773bbb7=""><p><strong>epoch /ĕp′ək, ē′pŏk″/</strong></p><h2><strong>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with COSMIC Desktop Environment Epoch 1</strong></h2><p>If you’re ambitious enough, or maybe just crazy enough, there eventually comes a time when you realize you’ve reached the limits of current potential, and must create something completely new if you’re to go further.</p><p>This year, System76 turned twenty. For twenty years we have shipped Linux computers. For seven years we’ve built the Pop!_OS Linux distribution. Three years ago it became clear we had reached the limit of our current potential and had to create something new. Today, we break through that limit with the release of Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the COSMIC Desktop Environment.</p><p>Today is special not only in that it’s the culmination of over three years of work, but even more so in that System76 has built a complete desktop environment for the open source community. We’re proud of this contribution to the open source ecosystem. COSMIC is built on the ethos that the best open source projects enable people to not only use them, but to build with them. COSMIC is modular and composable. It’s the flagship experience for Pop!_OS in its own way, and can be adapted by anyone that wants to build their own unique user experience for Linux.</p><p>Thank you for your patience while we built COSMIC. We know it’s been a long ride, and appreciate you taking it with us. Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS doesn’t feel like moving forward three years. It feels like leaping forward a decade. This day marks the foundation for our next twenty years and the first of what will be many rapid innovations.</p><p>And thank you to System76 customers. COSMIC is entirely funded by System76 hardware sales. Not only are you getting the best Linux hardware on the planet, you&#39;re investing in the future of the Linux desktop that we all love.</p><p>I hope you love what we’ve built for you. Now go out there and create. Push the limits, make incredible things, and have fun doing it!</p><p>Carl Richell</p></div><div data-v-7773bbb7="" data-v-7773bbb7=""><h3><strong>Download Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS</strong></h3><p>Download Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://system76.com/pop/">https://system76.com/pop/</a></p><h3><strong>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li>New COSMIC Desktop Environment Experience</li><li>New Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS for ARM computers</li><li>New hybrid graphics support for longer battery life</li><li>Easy installation with full disk encryption</li><li>Refresh install feature by holding Space at boot or from the ISO</li><li>Broad hardware support</li></ul><h3><strong>COSMIC Desktop Environment Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li>Intuitive window tiling that can be used with the mouse or keyboard</li><li>Featureful Workspaces</li><li>Smooth multi-display experience</li><li>Customization galore</li><li>Fast desktop navigation and easy keyboard shortcuts</li><li>Stacks, snapping, and sticky windows</li></ul><ul><li>Faster, more responsive applications</li><li>Written in the Rust programming language</li></ul></div><div data-v-7773bbb7="" data-v-7773bbb7=""><h3></h3><p>Download Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://system76.com/pop/">https://system76.com/pop/</a></p><h3>Upgrading from Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS to Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS</h3><p>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS users will receive an upgrade notification in the OS starting January 2026.
