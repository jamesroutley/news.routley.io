TOC Stories #2: &#34;Blue Light&#34; creating capacity for nothing
</h3>

<div id="post-body-8019545759566798366" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
This is one of my favorite stories from all of my years in applying TOC. I use it frequently in my consulting work and again it&#39;s totally true. In fact I&#39;ve told it enough times that I finally came across someone who was in the room who said he used to work at that company and he validated in 100%. And if you were to go into one of the dozens of places where I&#39;ve told this story, you are likely to find that they still talk about &#34;Blue Light.&#34;</p></div>
