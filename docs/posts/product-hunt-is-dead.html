    <h1>Product Hunt is dead</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  



<p>First, the good news.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been one week since <a href="https://finfam.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FinFam</a>&#39;s <a href="https://sedimental.org/announcing_finfam.html">beta launch</a>!
The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45252031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Show HN post</a> trended nicely,
netting enough eyeballs to make me confident that FinFam is the world&#39;s first and only <a href="https://finfam.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative financial planner with a marketplace of interactive, open-source expert opinions</a>.
I&#39;m especially gratified by the users I&#39;m meeting <em>through</em> the product.
Nothing like it.</p>
<p>So, launch is going great, no regrets, right?</p>

<p>That brings us to the subject of today&#39;s PSA.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Hunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a> is <em>dead</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t planning this post.
PH wasn&#39;t even much of a launch priority for FinFam.
But after seeing what I saw, I knew this had to skip the queue.
The world had to know.</p>
<p>After all, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373298636744617984/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my launch post on LinkedIn</a>
mentioned our Product Hunt launch.
And now I&#39;m cringing thinking about how I even sent an email out to a few product-oriented friends linking them to our launch, perpetuating the myth.</p>
<p>Hours later I would realize that Product Hunt is sadly no more.
Gone was the site I knew from my days on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/stripe/launches/stripe-invoicing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Invoicing</a>.
What&#39;s left is a husk, active in appearance alone.</p>
<h3 id="i-missed-the-memo"><a href="#i-missed-the-memo">I missed the memo</a></h3>
<p>Turns out this has been happening for a while.
Just last year, Fabian Maume asked, <a href="https://www.tetriz.io/blog/is-product-hunt-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#34;Is Product Hunt Dying?&#34;</a>
He&#39;s got lots of data and background, so I&#39;ll stick to filling in the now-obvious answer:
<strong>Yes. Product Hunt is dead.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_zombie.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_zombie.jpg" alt="Product Hunt has zombified" width="30%"/></a></p>
<p>And Fabian&#39;s not alone.
A quick search will <a href="https://webdesignerdepot.com/how-producthunt-com-became-overrun-with-ai-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mnc3nu/i_analyzed_500_product_hunt_saas_launches_487_are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1mstags/is_product_hunt_losing_its_value_for_real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nails</a> in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41679768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the</a> <a href="https://creativerly.com/what-happened-to-product-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffin</a>.
I guess that&#39;s inevitable when the founder exits and in 2022 <a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a16z merges your mature platform</a> with a crypto venture that no one remembers.</p>
<p>But how does a dead platform appear to live on?</p>
<h3 id="the-zombie-grift"><a href="#the-zombie-grift">The Zombie Grift</a></h3>
<p>Product Hunt has a weird quirk where it resets every day at midnight Pacific time.
Unlike Hacker News, Reddit, etc., PH doesn&#39;t have a rolling front page.
This fixed daily scheduling idiosyncrasy leads to <a href="https://byvi.co/2022/04/19/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-step-by-step-guide-with-tips-and-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-nighters as launch best practice</a>,
and systemically, this means a platform originating in Silicon Valley is unlikely to have its front page content meaningfully decided by anyone in the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>Much like with Hacker News, the first few hours of a post determine its impact.
Instead, Europe, APAC, and in particular India have an outsized influence.</p>
<p>So what really happens when you launch on Product Hunt?</p>
<p>Well, your LinkedIn inbox turns into this:</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_linkedin_invites_redacted.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_linkedin_invites_redacted.png" alt="My LinkedIn inbox, full of product hunt vote solicitors" width="65%"/>
  </a></p><p><i>None of them signed up for FinFam, even</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was taken by surprise.
What hurt the most was these midnight solicitors sharing screenshots of success stories from companies I recognized.
They&#39;d been instrumental in &#34;launching&#34; apps that I respect, and I&#39;d hoped they wouldn&#39;t have to stoop to this.
I even had personal connections to some of these founders.</p>
<p>It was 4am, but I put on my investigative hat and I engaged with a couple.
Here&#39;s how their process looks:</p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_the_price_and_process_redacted.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_the_price_and_process_redacted.png" width="45%" alt="100 bucks for 200 PH upvotes, enough to get into the top 5 for a weekday"/>
  </a>
</p>

<p>$100 is all it takes to make it into the Top 5 for a weekday.
One has to admit, it&#39;s tempting.
If you&#39;ve spent months building, $100 feels like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>It <em>is</em> nothing.</strong> These aren&#39;t real users and PH&#39;s audience has never been a source of sticky users.
$100 is too much to spend on vanity.
And it&#39;s predatory to foster a &#34;community&#34; where clout peddlers can prey on susceptible, good-faith founders.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re curious, you can see the paid votes landing via spikes in upvote speed on <a href="https://hunted.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hunted.space</a>.
It&#39;s not hard to eyeball products which get more upvotes in the first two hours than they do in the next twenty-two.</p>
<p>Suffice to say I didn&#39;t get any emails or LinkedIn invites from HN vote peddlers,
despite HN sending us more than 10x the traffic.</p>
<h3 id="can-product-hunt-be-revived"><a href="#can-product-hunt-be-revived">Can Product Hunt be revived?</a></h3>
<p>To be fair, PH tries to mitigate front page manipulation.
They &#34;feature&#34; certain launches to curate the front page.
The main outcome is that the majority of launches are simply never shown to most users.
No non-featured launches appear on the mobile app.
The process is <a href="https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/9883485-product-hunt-featuring-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a>,
but still opaque and inconsistently applied.
Almost certainly ties into revenue somehow.</p>
<p>A better question is &#34;<em>Should</em> Product Hunt be revived?&#34;</p>
<p>This is far from PH&#39;s only problem.
They&#39;ve killed Ship and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/p/general/product-hunt-discontinued-coming-soon-teaser-pages-did-they-work-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other features</a> without replacements.</p>
<p>At the crux, I just don&#39;t think a &#34;launch&#34; or a &#34;product&#34; is enough to tie together a community to develop a healthy ecosystem.
The focus on the <em>new</em> draws a fast flow of products and builders that erodes the core community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_x_eyes.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_x_eyes.jpg" alt="RIP kitty" width="30%"/></a></p>
<p>Alternatives exist, but if Product Hunt suffers from the above, I suspect these do, too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://betalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betalist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://peerlist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peerlist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pitchwall.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitchwall</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sideprojectors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Side Projectors</a></li>
<li><a href="http://uneed.best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uneed.best</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Edit: Someone even made a <a href="https://launchdirectories.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directory of directories</a>.
Early reports are not promising!</em></p>
<p>Contrast this with <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indie Hackers</a>, which is united by at least one value / work ethic.</p>
<p>Or contrast to one of my personal faves: <a href="https://alternativeto.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AlternativeTo</a>,
which takes a wiki approach toward the mission of cataloging all software, not just the newest.</p>
<h3 id="goodbye-product-hunt"><a href="#goodbye-product-hunt">Goodbye Product Hunt</a></h3>
<p>I guess if this ends up being PH&#39;s epitaph I should get this out of my system:</p>
<p>Google Glass Kitty has always been a terrible mascot.</p>
<p>The obvious choice for an iconic hunt has always been the duck:</p>
