    <h1>Winamp deletes entire GitHub source code repo after a rocky few weeks</h1>

          <p>Winamp, through its Belgian owner Llama Group, posted the source for its &#34;Legacy Player Code&#34; on September 24 so that developers could &#34;contribute their expertise, ideas, and passion to help this iconic software evolve.&#34;</p>
<p>Less than a month later, that <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop">repository has been entirely deleted</a>, after it either bumped up against or broke its strange hodgepodge of code licenses, seemingly revealed the source code for other non-open software packages, and made a pretty bad impression on the open-source community.</p>
<h2>&#34;Collaborative&#34; licensing</h2>
<p>Winamp&#39;s code was made available in late September, but not very open. Under the &#34;<a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.1</a>,&#34; you may not &#34;distribute modified versions of the software&#34; in source or binary, and &#34;only the maintainers of the official repository are allowed to distribute the software and its modifications.&#34; Anyone may contribute, in other words, but only to Winamp&#39;s benefit.</p>
<p>Justin Frankel, a key developer of the original Winamp and founder of Nullsoft, which also made SHOUTcast streaming software, was <a href="https://www.askjf.com/index.php?q=7357s">asked on his Q&amp;A site</a> about contributing to the code. Frankel responded that, even if he had some desire, the license terms &#34;are completely absurd in the way they are written.&#34; Even taking them &#34;as they are likely intended,&#34; Frankel wrote, &#34;they are terrible. No thank you.&#34;</p>
<p>Despite how this license would seem to bar forks, or perhaps <em>because</em> of that, the code has been <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/forks">forked at least 2,600 times as of this writing</a>. In forking and examining the source when first released, coders have noticed some, shall we say, anomalies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large portions of <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/265">other projects&#39; code</a>, offered under other, more robust licenses, were seemingly included (<a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/commit/e721b2e039742c12c1f9c93b1b779ca3b7fc061e">if later deleted</a>) from Winamp&#39;s repository</li>
<li>The original Winamp code may have <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/11">leaked the source code for SHOUTcast server software</a></li>
<li>In seeking to remove offending files with a simple deletion instead of a rebase, <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/11#issuecomment-2371838502">Winamp kept it available</a> to those who know Git mechanics</li>
<li>Proprietary packages from Intel and Microsoft were also seemingly <a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/pull/1378">included</a> in the release&#39;s build tools</li>
</ul>
