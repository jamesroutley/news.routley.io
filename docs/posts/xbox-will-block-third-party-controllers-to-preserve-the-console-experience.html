<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-policy-say-goodbye-to-unofficial-accessories-after-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Windows Central</em> </a>reported that players have been encountering error “0x82d60002” when they attach a third-party accessory in an article from October 29.</p>
<p>“Using unauthorised accessories compromises your gaming experience. For this reason, the unauthorised accessory will be blocked from use on 11/12/2023,” read the pop-up on the console. It then advised the player to return the product to the store or talk to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>In a statement supplied to<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-will-block-unauthorized-third-party-controllers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, Microsoft explained that the error is in fact part of its new policy which will be rolled out worldwide from November 17.</p>
<p>“Microsoft and other licensed Xbox hardware partners’ accessories are designed and manufactured with quality standards for performance, security, and safety,” it said.</p>
<p>“Unauthorised accessories can compromise the gaming experience on Xbox consoles (<a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/xbox-series-xs">Xbox Series X/S</a>.) Gamers may receive a pop-up warning that their accessory is unauthorised.</p>
<p>“Eventually, the unauthorised accessory will be blocked from use to preserve the console gaming experience. For a full list of accessories that are supported on Xbox consoles, please visit www.xbox.com/accessories.”</p>
<p>Sources who spoke to<em> Windows Central</em> suggested that through this Microsoft is attempting to make the manufacture of official third-party controllers easier.</p>

<p>This way, new controllers will be allowed to use wireless features that work with the Xbox, potentially by putting a security chip inside them. However, it will spell the end of those that already exist if they were not approved by Microsoft.</p>
<p>In other gaming news, <a href="https://www.nme.com/games/the-finals"><em>The Finals</em> </a>has been criticised for <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/the-finals-sloppy-ai-voice-acting-criticised-by-voice-actors-3525621">the use of AI to voice its commentators and contestants</a>, though the developer explained that this “gets [the team] far enough in terms of quality”.</p>
