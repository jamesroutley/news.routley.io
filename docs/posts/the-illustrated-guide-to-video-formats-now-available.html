<p><span>06 Aug 2022</span></p><p>Hey, I made a book! <a href="https://archivesoftomorrow.com/books/">The Illustrated Guide to Video Formats</a> is widely available through most booksellers.</p>

<p>And I made a website too! <a href="https://archivesoftomorrow.com/">Archives of Tomorrow</a> has everything the book has and a bit more.</p>

<p>I have a lot of process-y things to say but haven’t found the time to put them to paper, and this announcement post is already 3 weeks late!</p>

<p>Here are a few of the things I hope to write about soon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some thoughts around the publishing/printing experience</li>
  <li>Comparing print quality of the two print-on-demand services I went with</li>
  <li>Money $ money $ money or some transparency around self-publishing</li>
  <li>Technical notes on the archivesoftomorrow website in general (and possibly specific, as I’m chasing down a weird bug that would really be worth writing about if I can sort out what is going on! DNS and firewalls and IT services, oh my!)</li>
  <li>All the mistakes I made, because I made a lot</li>
</ul>
