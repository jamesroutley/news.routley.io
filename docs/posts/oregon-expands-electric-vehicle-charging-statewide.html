    <h1>Oregon expands electric vehicle charging statewide</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Oregon wants 90% of new vehicle sales to be zero emission vehicles by 2035. An increase in electric vehicle charging stations is coming to seven corridors statewide.</p><div>
                    <p>PORTLAND, Ore. — The transportation sector accounts for about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). One of the fastest ways to reduce those emissions in the fight against <a href="https://www.kgw.com/climatechange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate change</a> is getting drivers out of gas-powered cars, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT).</p>
                    <p>The state&#39;s goal is to have 90% of new vehicle sales be electric vehicles by 2035. To achieve that, ODOT needs to overcome “range anxiety,&#34; a driver’s fear of running out of electricity on the road before reaching a charging station. That remains one of the biggest impediments to drivers purchasing an electric vehicle (EV).</p>
                        
                    <p>ODOT, with the help of the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/odot/Pages/IIJA.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 federal infrastructure bill</a>, will apply $100 million to expand EV charging statewide along seven designated corridors.</p>

                    <p>&#34;We&#39;ll have quad charging, which means we&#39;ll have four chargers in each site,&#34; said Amanda Pietz, ODOT&#39;s administrator for data, policy, and analysis. &#34;Each charger will be fast-charging. We&#39;ll have three that are 150 kilowatts. So when somebody plugs into that expect, maybe a 15 to 20 minute time to charge your vehicle. So pretty quick. But we&#39;ll also have a 350 kilowatt charger, which is much closer to the experience of filling up at a gas station.&#34;</p>
                    <p>The five-fold increase in statewide EV charging will also focus on smaller, rural communities where charging has been less available. The added benefit is that local tourism may be bolstered. </p>
                    <p>&#34;So when they stop... they can shop, so they&#39;re charging and then they can shop in the local community,&#34; said Pietz.</p>
                    <p>ODOT said the new charging stations are designed to be somewhat future proof and can be adapted as charging technology evolves. </p>
                    <p>&#34;I&#39;m not just talking about cars and trucks, but electric bikes and scooters. All different kinds of mobility options to really get people to where they need to go,&#34; said Pietz.</p>
