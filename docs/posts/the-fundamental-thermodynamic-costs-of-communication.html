      <span>Abstract:</span>  In many complex systems, whether biological or artificial, the thermodynamic
costs of communication among their components are large. These systems also
tend to split information transmitted between any two components across
multiple channels. A common hypothesis is that such inverse multiplexing
strategies reduce total thermodynamic costs. So far, however, there have been
no physics-based results supporting this hypothesis. This gap existed partially
because we have lacked a theoretical framework that addresses the interplay of
thermodynamics and information in off-equilibrium systems at any spatiotemporal
scale. Here we present the first study that rigorously combines such a
framework, stochastic thermodynamics, with Shannon information theory. We
develop a minimal model that captures the fundamental features common to a wide
variety of communication systems. We find that the thermodynamic cost in this
model is a convex function of the channel capacity, the canonical measure of
the communication capability of a channel. We also find that this function is
not always monotonic, in contrast to previous results not derived from first
principles physics. These results clarify when and how to split a single
communication stream across multiple channels. In particular, we present Pareto
fronts that reveal the trade-off between thermodynamic costs and channel
capacity when inverse multiplexing. Due to the generality of our model, our
findings could help explain empirical observations of how thermodynamic costs
of information transmission make inverse multiplexing energetically favorable
in many real-world communication systems.
