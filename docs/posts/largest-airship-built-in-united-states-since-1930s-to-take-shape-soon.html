Prototype carbon fiber and titanium framing has been put together inside the airdock for testing. Pilots are undergoing flight training using sophisticated simulators. And the airdock itself is undergoing renovations and updating.</p><p>&#34;LTA is standing on the shoulders of its predecessors here at the airdock,&#34; said Alan Weston, the company&#39;s chief executive officer. LTA – as in Lighter Than Air – was founded in California by billionaire Google co-founder Sergey Brin. &#34;Because of their efforts, we are going to be able to build airships that are faster, that are safer, more environmentally friendly and have greater capabilities than any airship built before.&#34;</p><figure><img data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/ecf2d8c9-2094-4472-8920-871c1f3569b8-airdock_1.jpg?width=980&amp;height=657&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/ecf2d8c9-2094-4472-8920-871c1f3569b8-airdock_1.jpg?width=1960&amp;height=1314&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Alan Weston, CEO of LTA Research, talks about bringing airships back to Akron."/></figure><h2>LTA previews its work at Akron Airdock</h2><p>On Thursday, LTA publicly previewed its work in the facility, including showing off the test framing and a &#34;baby airship,&#34; a flying model of its 400-foot-long Pathfinder 1 airship that will be built in California.</p><p>&#34;[Pathfinder 3] will be the largest airship built in the United States since the Macon was built [by Goodyear] in 1932,&#34; Weston said. </p><p>LTA&#39;s goal is to build huge airships to provide humanitarian aid in places where conventional transportation can&#39;t reach, such as in the aftermath of a disaster. Pathfinder 3, at 600 feet long and 100 feet in diameter, is designed to carry about 20 tons and be able to traverse as many as 10,000 miles using electric-only, zero-emission propulsion.</p><p>&#34;We believe that lighter-than-air technology has the potential to revolutionize humanitarian relief efforts with its ability to reach remote locations that have little or no infrastructure,&#34; Weston said.</p><figure><img data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/176adee1-114c-46f2-bf21-93aa4b9ee944-airdock_3.jpg?width=980&amp;height=694&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/176adee1-114c-46f2-bf21-93aa4b9ee944-airdock_3.jpg?width=1960&amp;height=1388&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Denny Carter, chief engineer at LTA Research, talks about airships as he holds a model of Pathfinder 3 Thursday in the Akron Airdock."/></figure><h2>LTA expected to add jobs in Akron</h2><p>LTA already has about 70 employees in Akron, including Weston, a former aerospace engineer and director of programs at the NASA Ames Research Center who moved to the area. By next year, LTA should have as many as 200 people working at the former Lockheed Martin, and before that Goodyear Aerospace, campus next to Akron Fulton International Airport. </p><p>The iconic airdock, completed in 1929, is being transformed into a state-of-the-art facility, Weston and others said. </p><p>&#34;We have to build the next-generation production facility,&#34; said Harry Harris, the Pathfinder 3 program manager.</p><p>Eventually, LTA expects to start making carbon fiber and titanium airship parts at the airdock as well, Weston said. The company also expects that some of its vendors will locate nearby.</p><p>Pathfinder 3 will initially be powered by batteries, Weston said. But the goal is to have the helium-filled airship powered by hydrogen fuel cells, he said.</p><figure><img data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/1dec1f7d-21d7-4894-9d09-00cce93f3070-airdock_6.jpg?width=980&amp;height=850&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/05/05/NABJ/1dec1f7d-21d7-4894-9d09-00cce93f3070-airdock_6.jpg?width=1960&amp;height=1700&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Mechanical engineer Jillian Hilenski and test engineer Karl Bates talk about the scaled-down test airship at the Akron Airdock."/></figure><p>University of Akron President Gary Miller said the university has been a partner with LTA from the early goings. <a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/opinion/columns/2021/03/06/university-akron-city-celebrate-research-deal-airdock/4592896001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}">The city of Akron</a> and<a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/03/08/akron-airdock-got-closer-to-having-lockheed-martin-as-its-new-owner/4627305001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}"> the Development Finance Authority of Summit County</a> are also key players in the venture.</p><p>&#34;There are many cool things about being a college president,&#34; Miller said. &#34;I think this is the coolest.&#34;</p><p>UA graduates already make up a substantial number of local employees.
