If you work for, or are connected with an archive that might be interested in taking them and saving the contents for posterity, I would love to talk to you. Please get in touch!</strong></em></p><p><span>This week marks the 50th anniversary of a major technological milestone: The advent of teletext services in the UK, with the launch of Ceefax on the BBC</span><span>.</span></p><p>Until the mainstream adoption of the internet two decades later, teletext was an incredibly important source of news and information. Tens of millions of people used it on their TV every week – far more than read any newspapers or magazines at the time.</p><p>And in an era when papers only contained yesterday’s news and TV bulletins were just 30 minutes long, a few times a day, it was the closest thing we had to real time news.</p><p><span>I used to spend </span><em>hours</em><span> every week reading teletext. I grew up on the cusp of the internet era – but I remember how every night, with wifi not yet a thing, that I would scroll through virtually every page of Ceefax on the BBC, and Teletext on ITV and Channel 4, reading the news, the editorial features and even the proto-message-boards, in the form of Ceefax’s </span><em>Backchat</em><span> and </span><em>Chatterbox</em><span> pages.</span></p><p><span>And one of the most exciting days of my childhood was when my parents bought a TV with “fast text” – as it meant that I could finally play the Channel 4 quiz game </span><em>Bamboozle</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>My favourite thing on teletext though was the on-screen videogame magazine </span><em>Digitiser</em><span>, which was also on Channel 4. Created and mostly written by Paul Rose, it wasn’t like the rest of teletext, which was fairly dry in its presentation – </span><em>Digi</em><span> had an anarchic sense of humour, and exploited the medium to its full extent, with gags that made use of the “press reveal” button, and cartoon characters formed of blocks in the eight colours that the technology could handle.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

subject matter of the magazine.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Even if you don’t remember these specific things though, if you’re British and over the age of 30 you probably remember using it. Because what’s striking looking back is how utterly ubiquitous teletext was – and yet today it has completely disappeared from our collective memory, like </span><em>Avatar</em><span>, Liz Truss and COVID-19.</span></p><p>This is where we get to some maddening digital history.</p><p>Obviously, teletext not going to stick around for the internet era. But unlike newspapers and books published in the 1980s and 90s, which historians and nostalgic millennials can go back and rediscover, nobody thought to keep an archive of teletext.</p><p><span>This means there is no great vault containing the millions of words that were written by thousands of people, and read by tens of millions more. A Library or Alexandria’s worth of journalism and culture, some of the most widely read works of the 80s and 90s, have disappeared </span><em>forever</em><span>.</span></p><p>Teletext Ltd, which operated the ITV and Channel 4 services, is today a holiday website. It didn’t retain an archive of its pages, because why the hell would it?</p><p><span>But perhaps more surprisingly, beyond holding a few representative pages of what Ceefax used to be like, the BBC didn’t either</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>And in retrospect it seems like a bizarre omission. An act of cultural vandalism, akin to how the BBC famously destroyed recordings of </span><em>Doctor Who</em><span>, </span><em>Dad’s Army</em><span> and the like in the 1970s to save money.</span></p><p><span>It pains me in particularly that today that a fan archive of </span><em>Digitiser</em><span>, which was clearly very formative to me and is partially what inspired me to become a writer, is </span><a href="https://www.superpage58.com/digitiser-vault-teletext-screenshot-image-archive-1999.htm" rel="">only about half complete</a><span>.</span></p><p>But there is some good news for historians: There just might be a way to go back in time.</p><p>In 2011 something amazing happened.</p><p>A coder called Alistair Buxton discovered a box of old VHS tapes in his attic. And then he did something that I consider to be, essentially, witchcraft.</p><p>If you ever put a VHS tape recorded from the TV into your VCR, you may remember that hitting the “text” button didn’t show whatever teletext was on TV at the time of your recording – it was just a blank page.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic" width="386" height="482.5" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1280,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:386,&#34;bytes&#34;:208817,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/heic&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bc6ea94-fd45-43c7-8612-e8df21b59d48_1024x1280.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>The only problem from having this many 90s VHS tapes is the grim inevitability of Blobby.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>That’s because of the way VHS tapes save data. VHS compresses the TV signal so that it fits on the tape in a similar way to how a JPEG doesn’t contain as much detailed picture information as a bitmap image.

But instead of this leading to an unwise romantic entanglement or almost destroying the Labour Party, it led to me trying to be the hero, and save teletext myself.</p><p>I saw on Twitter that a friend of mine was trying to find a home for an incredible archive of around 2000 VHS tapes. Each contained around six hours of off-air recordings from British TV from the mid-90s to mid-2000s – as well as meticulous notes on the contents of each tape. </p><p><span>Apparently there were so many tapes because the original owner, a now elderly man, had made the recordings for his neighbour. Together they make for an incredible snapshot of TV from the time – everything from </span><em>Blue Peter</em><span> to </span><em>Eurotrash</em><span>.</span></p><p>Anyway, because the owner was getting on a bit, his son passed the tapes on to my friend – who had saved them from a trip to the dump. And now a few years on from that, my friend had decided that it was now the time to offload them, so he could reclaim the space in his house.</p><p>That’s when I saw his tweet – and I immediately realised the teletext goldmine stored within. Unwittingly, this old guy might be a hero, who has accidentally saved a decade of teletext data from oblivion.</p><p><span>So I did the only logical thing I could do, and volunteered to take on the tapes. And that’s why today they take up around a quarter of the physical space in my garage.</span></p><p>My thinking at the time was that this could be a new hobby – and an opportunity to do something good for the world, instead of spending all of my time doomscrolling on Twitter.</p><p>So I setup a desktop PC with the right hardware to support an ancient TV capture card and a relatively modern GPU. I installed Ubuntu and Alistair’s software. And I began to capture the tapes, saving both the video footage and the teletext data within.</p><p>And it was genuinely thrilling to see Alistair’s software working before my eyes.</p><p>As the first teletext data reemerged in front of me, it sent chills through me as I realised that I was the first person in two decades to see the contents, after it had been essentially lost forever.</p><p><span>I felt like an archaeologist, unravelling an ancient scroll that had been entombed in volcanic ash.

You’ll have to watch to find out why.</em></p><p>However, it was only once I began capturing my enormous archive of tapes that I realised I had bitten off far more than I could chew.</p><p>Even though I had written some code of my own to try and speed up the capturing workflow, it quickly became apparent just how big the task ahead would be if I wanted to go through all 2000 tapes.</p><p><span>After around six months, I’d processed only maybe 40 tapes. And even worse for the project, my life was getting </span><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/substacking-on-substack" rel="">significantly busier</a><span> again after a protracted pandemic social lull.</span></p><p>So for the past year or so, my VCR has remained on standby mode, the tapes in their boxes, gathering dust.</p><p>I’ve reached a point where the tapes are just gnawing away at me too much.</p><p>When I look around my office and see the piles of unprocessed tapes, I feel a pang of anxiety in my stomach. My inaction is a disservice to our teletext forefathers. And when I see the brave face of my partner as she looks at the piles of VHS boxes in our garage, I just wonder if she is regretting the life choices that led to her living with me.</p><p>And it is deeply frustrating as someone who cares about this historic data too. I know I’ve got this rich, historic archive in my garage – potentially the only copies of thousands of teletext pages still in existence. And thanks to Alistair Buxton and the other teletext heroes building out the software, we have the means to save it.</p><p>But the one resource I don’t have is time.</p><p>And this is why, dear readers, I need your help.</p><p>I think now is the time to find a new home for this incredible archive of tapes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg" width="456" height="456" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1280,&#34;width&#34;:1280,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:456,&#34;bytes&#34;:836102,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702ee48-d257-48bb-bbb1-4d1a21dec437_1280x1280.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Some boxes in my garage containing some tapes. This is maybe about one sixth of them.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I want them to go to an institution, organisation, or a person who will be able to give them the dedication they need to save the treasures within. The mild ticking clock is that VHS, as an analogue format, will deteriorate over time – so if the teletext data isn’t saved pretty soon, it could one day be too late.</p><p><span>I also want the archive to remain intact – to recognise the incredible contribution of the archive’s original accidental compiler.</span></p><p>In terms of physical logistics: The tapes are located in my home, just outside of London, in Kent. And there are around 30 boxes – which take up quite a lot of physical space.</p><p><span>So here’s my ask: If you know someone who can take them, and either preserve the tapes as they are, or even better do the work of saving the teletext data and the video contents within, please get in touch with me. My contact details are on </span><a href="https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/about" rel="">my “about” page</a><span>.</span></p><p>I know there are data nerds, archivists and historians out there who care about stuff like this. Please do send this on to anyone you think might be able to help.</p><p>Alistair Buxton and the teletext recovery nerds have offered us a means to preserve this history before it is too late. If you’re someone out there who can help save it, now is the time to act!</p><p><em>If you’ve read this far in an article about teletext then you will definitely like my newsletter.
