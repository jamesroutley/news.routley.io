									</div><div><p><span>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed 45 claims against the bankrupt FTX and its subsidiary companies.</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-ClaimInfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>bankruptcy filings</span></a><span> on April 27 and 28, the IRS filed claims worth nearly $44 billion against the firms, including FTX.US and Alameda Research.</span><span>¬†</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the department‚Äôs assessment, Alameda Research LLC owes a whopping $20.4 billion in unpaid partnership taxes and federal payroll taxes. </span></p>
<p><span>A snippet of the tax bill shared online details several hundred million dollars-worth of claims filed under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) ‚Äì taxes that correspond to full-time employees. This suggests that the department reclassified all of FTX‚Äôs contractors to full-time employees in order to arrive at such a large tax payroll-related tax claim.</span></p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The insane Alameda Research LLC tax bill circulating is real. The major balances don&#39;t have detail, but in part it appears the IRS went back and reclassified ALL employees from contractors to employees and hit them for unpaid employer-side employment taxes. <a href="https://t.co/GuY6czcgMn">pic.twitter.com/GuY6czcgMn</a>

<p><span>The IRS also filed claims against West Realm Shires, the legal entity behind FTX.US, Ledger Holdings, BlockFolio and other entities associated with the bankrupt crypto exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>The claims are filed under ‚ÄúAdministrative Priority,‚Äù meaning that they take priority over most other unsecured creditors of the exchange. Unsurprisingly, this was not well received by the average FTX creditor with funds stuck on the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWould love to understand how they came up with these numbers and what their plan is to acquire these assets‚Ä¶FTX/Alameda never even had this much money,‚Äù </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_van_Eck/status/1656396177716256773" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>said</span></a><span> Nick van Eck, a partner at General Catalyst.</span></p>
<p><span>Last month, Unchained </span><a href="https://unchainedcrypto.com/ftx-could-reopen-crypto-exchange-recovers-7-3-billion-in-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>reported</span></a><span> that the FTX bankruptcy estate had recovered $7.3 billion worth of assets ‚Äì a figure that is nowhere near what the IRS now claims the firm owes in taxes. Attorneys for the bankrupt exchange were considering reopening the exchange as part of a reorganization plan that would return value to creditors.</span></p>
