    <h1>Sljit: Platform independent low-level JIT compiler</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><div><pre>                     SLJIT - Stack Less JIT Compiler

Purpose:
  A low-level, machine independent JIT compiler, which is suitable for
  translating interpreted byte code into machine code. The sljitLir.h
  describes the LIR (low-level intermediate representation) of SLJIT.

Key features:
  - Supports several target architectures:
    x86 32/64, ARM 32/64, RiscV 32/64, s390x 64,
    PowerPC 32/64, LoongArch 64, MIPS 32/64
  - Supports a large number of operations
    - Supports self-modifying code
    - Supports tail calls
    - Support fast calls (non-ABI compatible)
    - Supports byte order reverse (endianness switching)
    - Supports unaligned memory accesses
    - Supports SIMD / atomic operations on certain CPUs
  - Direct register access, both integer and floating point
  - Stack space allocated for function local variables can be
    accessed as a linear memory area
  - All-in-one compilation is supported
  - When sljitLir.c is directly included by a C source file,
    the jit compiler API can be completely hidden from
    external use (see SLJIT_CONFIG_STATIC macro)
    - Code can be generated for multiple target cpus
      by including sljitLir.c in different C files, where
      each compiler instance is configured to target a
      different architecture
  - The compiler can be serialized into a byte buffer
    - Useful for ahead-of-time compiling
    - Code generation can be resumed after deserialization
      (partial ahead-of-time compiling)

Compatible:
  C99 (C++) compilers.

Using sljit:
  Copy the content of sljit_src directory into your project source directory.
  Add sljitLir.c source file to your build environment. All other files are
  included by sljitLir.c (if required). Define the machine by SLJIT_CONFIG_*
  selector. See sljitConfigCPU.h for all possible values. For C++ compilers,
  rename sljitLir.c to sljitLir.cpp.
