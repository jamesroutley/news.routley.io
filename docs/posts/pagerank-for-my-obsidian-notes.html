    <h1>pagerank for my Obsidian notes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, January 17, 2023</em></p><p>I recently learned a little more about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Pagerank</a> algorithm works. I thought it was cool, and it made me wonder what the ranks for my <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> vault looked like, so I built a little tool. It&#39;s fairly simple: it just parses <code>[[links]]</code> out of the vault with a regex and then uses the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simple-pagerank">simple-pagerank</a> crate for Rust to calculate the ranking.</p><p>For my vault, the most centrally connected node is my employer. It&#39;s the top node by quite a lot (with a score of 4.9), followed by the town where I live (2.0), then members of my family (around 2) and notes on projects I&#39;m doing and tools I use (around 1.) This makes a lot of sense to me; I primarily use Obsidian as a way to keep a work log and write about things related to that, <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/digital-gardening-in-obsidian/">as I wrote about previously</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to try this for yourself, you can get the code at <a href="https://git.bytes.zone/brian/obsidian-pagerank">bytes.zone/brian/obsidian-pagerank</a>, although you&#39;ll need to have either <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> or <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> installed in advance. If you decide to try it, let me know if you find anything interesting!</p></article></div>
