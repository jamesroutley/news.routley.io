    <h1>Studio Ghibli marks 40 years, but future looks uncertain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                      <p>Japan&#39;s Studio Ghibli turns 40 this month with two Oscars and legions of fans young and old won over by its complex plots and fantastical hand-drawn animation.</p>

<p>But the future is uncertain, with latest hit <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2023/07/14/films/ghibli-how-do-you-live-release/">&#34;The Boy and the Heron&#34;</a> likely — but not certainly — the final feature from celebrated co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, now 84. In March, the <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2025/04/02/japan/bbg-reidy-everything-was-ghibli/">internet was flooded with pictures</a> in Studio Ghibli&#39;s distinctively nostalgic style after the release of OpenAI&#39;s newest image generator — raising questions over copyright.</p>

<p>The studio behind the Oscar-winning &#34;Spirited Away&#34; has become a cultural phenomenon since Miyazaki and the late Isao Takahata — he passed away in 2018 — established it in 1985. Its popularity has been fueled of late by a second Academy Award in 2024 for &#34;The Boy and the Heron,&#34; starring Robert Pattinson, and by Netflix streaming Ghibli movies around the world.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2022/10/13/travel/ghibli-park-preview/">newly opened Ghibli Park</a> has also become a major tourist draw for central Japan&#39;s Aichi region.</p>

<p>Julia Santilli, a 26-year-old from Britain living in northern Japan, &#34;fell in love with Ghibli&#34; after watching the 2001 classic &#34;Spirited Away&#34; as a child. &#34;I started collecting all the DVDs,&#34; she says.</p>

<p>Ghibli stories are &#34;very engaging and the artwork is stunning,&#34; says another fan, Margot Divall, 26. &#34;I probably watch &#39;Spirited Away&#39; about 10 times a year, still.&#34;</p>

<p>Before Ghibli, most cartoons in Japan — known as anime — were made for children. But Miyazaki and Takahata, both from &#34;the generation that knew war,&#34; included darker elements that appeal to adults, Miyazaki&#39;s son Goro says.</p>

<p>&#34;It&#39;s not all sweet — there&#39;s also a bitterness and things like that which are beautifully intertwined in the work,&#34; he adds, describing a &#34;whiff of death&#34; in the films. For younger people who grew up in time of peace, &#34;it is impossible to create something with the same sense, approach and attitude,&#34; Goro says.</p>

<p>Even &#34;My Neighbor Totoro,&#34; with its cuddly forest creatures, is in some ways a &#34;scary&#34; movie that explores the fear of losing a sick mother, he explains.</p>

<p>Susan Napier, a professor at Tufts University in the United States and author of &#34;Miyazakiworld: A Life in Art,&#34; agrees. &#34;In Ghibli, you have ambiguity, complexity and also a willingness to see that the darkness and light often go together&#34; unlike good-versus-evil U.S. cartoons, she says.</p>

             Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, now 84, has stepped back a few times before returning with &#34;The Boy and the Heron&#34; which is likely to be his final feature.

<p>The post-apocalyptic &#34;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&#34; — considered the first Ghibli film despite its release in 1984 — has no obvious villain, for example. Featuring an independent princess curious about giant insects and a poisonous forest, the film felt &#34;so fresh&#34; and a change from &#34;a passive woman... having to be rescued,&#34; Napier says.</p>

<p>Studio Ghibli films also depict a universe where humans connect deeply with nature and the spirit world. A case in point was 1997&#39;s &#34;Princess Mononoke,&#34; distributed internationally by Disney. The tale of a girl raised by a wolf goddess in a forest threatened by humans is &#34;a masterpiece — but a hard movie,&#34; Napier says. It&#39;s a &#34;serious, dark and violent&#34; film appreciated more by adults, which &#34;was not what U.S. audiences had anticipated with a movie about a princess. &#34;Ghibli films &#34;have an environmentalist and animistic side, which I think is very appropriate for the contemporary world with climate change,&#34; Napier adds.</p>

<p>Miyuki Yonemura, a professor at Japan&#39;s Senshu University who studies cultural theories on animation, says watching Ghibli movies is like reading literature.</p>

<p>&#34;That&#39;s why some children watch &#39;My Neighbor Totoro&#39; 40 times,&#34; she says, adding that audiences &#34;discover something new every time.&#34;</p>

<p>Miyazaki and Takahata could create imaginative worlds because of their openness to other cultures, Yonemura says.</p>

<p>Foreign influences include writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery and animator Paul Grimault, both French, and Canadian artist Frederic Back, who won an Oscar for his animation &#34;The Man Who Planted Trees.&#34;</p>

<p>Takahata studying French literature at university &#34;was a big factor,&#34; Yonemura says. &#34;Both Miyazaki and Takahata read a lot,&#34; she adds. &#34;That&#39;s a big reason why they excel at writing scripts and creating stories.&#34;</p>

<p>Miyazaki has said he was inspired by several books for &#34;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,&#34; including the 12th-century Japanese tale &#34;The Lady who Loved Insects,&#34; and Greek mythology.</p>

<p>Studio Ghibli will not be the same after Miyazaki stops creating animation, &#34;unless similar talent emerges,&#34; Yonemura says.</p>

<p>Miyazaki is &#34;a fantastic artist with such a visual imagination,&#34; while both he and Takahata were &#34;politically progressive,&#34; Napier says.</p>

<p>&#34;The more I study, the more I realize this was a unique cultural moment,&#34; she says.</p>

<p>&#34;It&#39;s so widely loved that I think it will carry on,&#34; says Ghibli fan Divall. &#34;As long as it doesn&#39;t lose its beauty, as long as it carries on the amount of effort, care and love,&#34; she adds.</p>

<h3>Studio Ghibli’s heavy hitters</h3>

<p>Here are the studio&#39;s top five films that have delighted fans over the decades:</p>

<p><strong>&#34;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&#34; (1984) </strong></p>

<p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985, but this post-apocalyptic story featuring a young, independent princess curious about giant insects is considered its first film. It was based on a comic-strip series that Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki wrote for a magazine targeted at anime fans.</p>

<p>Set 1,000 years after a war that destroyed human civilization, the story takes place in a valley protected from toxic air emitted from poisonous forests.</p>

<p>Miyazaki won critical acclaim and a cult following for the film about Nausicaa, who discovers the forests&#39; secrets after getting embroiled in conflicts between countries trying to revive a lethal &#34;giant warrior.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>&#34;My Neighbor Totoro&#34; (1988) </strong></p>

<p>This beloved Ghibli classic is set in the 1950s Japanese countryside where two young sisters with a sick mother move from the city. They encounter the cuddly yet mysterious forest spirit Totoro and Catbus, a 12-legged grinning cat with a hollow body in the form of a bus — two characters who have since become worldwide-known Studio Ghibli mascots.</p>

<p>The film was also turned into a play for the first time by Britain&#39;s Royal Shakespeare Company in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>&#34;Princess Mononoke&#34; (1997) </strong></p>

<p>The tale of a girl raised by a wolf goddess in a forest threatened by humans was a smash hit in Japan and raised Miyazaki&#39;s profile internationally.</p>

<p>A young prince on a journey to find a cure for his curse meets San, also known as Princess Mononoke — meaning a spirit or monster in Japanese. The prince sets out to find ways to avoid wars between destructive humans and animal gods, centered around the ultimate god which is nature itself.</p>

<p><strong>&#34;Spirited Away&#34; (2001) </strong></p>

<p>Miyazaki won his first Oscar with this film about a girl who gets lost in a mystical world of gods and spirits where she tries to save her parents, who are turned into pigs.</p>

<p>In order to survive, 10-year-old Chihiro is told by a mysterious boy to get a job at an enormous Japanese bathhouse run by a witch.</p>

<p>In a story infused with Japanese beliefs and traditions, Chihiro gains confidence through her work and solves the boy&#39;s curse before rescuing her parents.</p>

<p><strong>&#34;The Boy and the Heron&#34; (2023) </strong></p>

<p>Miyazaki&#39;s second Oscar-winning film — and likely the 84-year-old&#39;s last feature — follows a boy struggling to accept his new life after his mother dies in the haunting fire-bombing of Tokyo during World War II.</p>

<p>Everything changes when he meets a talking heron and embarks on a journey to an alternate universe, shared by the living and the dead, to find his missing stepmother.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2025/01/31/film/kaku-arakawa-hayao-miyazaki-interview/">In a documentary,</a> Miyazaki, visibly affected by the 2018 death of Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata, said the pair had had a &#34;love-hate relationship&#34; and that he had based the character of the grand-uncle on him.</p>
