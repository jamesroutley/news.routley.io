                                      <p>Japan&#39;s Studio Ghibli turns 40 this month with two Oscars and legions of fans young and old won over by its complex plots and fantastical hand-drawn animation.</p><p>But the future is uncertain, with latest hit <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2023/07/14/films/ghibli-how-do-you-live-release/">&#34;The Boy and the Heron&#34;</a> likely — but not certainly — the final feature from celebrated co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, now 84. In March, the <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2025/04/02/japan/bbg-reidy-everything-was-ghibli/">internet was flooded with pictures</a> in Studio Ghibli&#39;s distinctively nostalgic style after the release of OpenAI&#39;s newest image generator — raising questions over copyright.</p><p>The studio behind the Oscar-winning &#34;Spirited Away&#34; has become a cultural phenomenon since Miyazaki and the late Isao Takahata — he passed away in 2018 — established it in 1985. Its popularity has been fueled of late by a second Academy Award in 2024 for &#34;The Boy and the Heron,&#34; starring Robert Pattinson, and by Netflix streaming Ghibli movies around the world.</p>
