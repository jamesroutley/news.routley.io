    <h1>A Dotfile History</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Much has changed since <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2019-01-28-dotfiles.html">I made a brief post</a> about my dotfiles and which tools I
use, but my fondness for managed dotfiles has not changed. Being able to track
the changes I make to setup on one machine <em>greatly</em> reduces the complexity of
setting up new ones or apply the changes to the other machines that I use.</p>
<p>This post started as a sub-section of a more elaborate post describing to how to
manage full system configurations using <code>nix flakes</code>. However, as I continued
writing I realized that what was intended as a slight digressions grew out of
proportions and would probably be better as an individual post entirely.</p>
<p>I respect that not everyone cares about how I managed dotfiles in the past, but
I’m sure most people have a turbulent relationship with dotfiles in one way or
another so the following post might be interesting to you. In any case, I write
this mostly for myself to remember.</p>
<h2 id="primordial-soup-aka-rotfiles">Primordial soup, aka rotfiles</h2>
<p>In my early days of <code>Linux</code> I’m fairly certain I didn’t have any management of
dotfiles at all. The first memory I have of any kind of “dotfile curation” was a
<code>.vimrc</code> copied between myself and a few friends. I definitely did not use any
form of version control. No application to manage or install configurations. No
consideration regarding which version or even which <em>applications</em> were
installed on a machine nor any means of <em>upgrading</em> existing applications and
configurations.</p>
<p>Configuration files were left to rot or forgotten on decommissioned machines and
through the means of “customization” Darwinism only the most fit<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> tweaks
would stand a chance of surviving. While without sensible tracking and diffing,
useful changes to configuration files on one system would easily be forgotten
and eventually lost.</p>
<h2 id="missing-links-git-init-home">Missing links: <code>git init $HOME</code></h2>
<p>One of the first attempts I remember of keeping my dotfiles on a leash was to
turn my user home directory into a <code>git</code> repository. By this I mean to simply
<code>git init</code> inside of <code>$HOME</code>. At the time it must have felt like the greatest
idea ever, but it quickly turns out there are a bunch of issues with this
approach. Most of which I no longer remember, but I imagine just the fact that
any <code>git</code> related tool (like a <code>bash</code> prompt status) used under <code>$HOME</code> will
<em>always</em> detect that it’s running in <em>some</em> <code>git</code> worktree would suck quite bad.
Similarly, without smart use of e.g. <code>excludes</code> there will always be a bunch of
untracked files in the worktree.</p>
<p>It must have felt promising then to stumble over the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797">Ask HN: What do you use to manage dotfiles?</a> post over at the orange site. The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754">top-rated comment</a> details how
to rather use a <em>bare</em> git repository somewhere under <code>$HOME</code> and defining a
shell alias setting the <code>--git-dir</code> and <code>--work-tree</code> to point to the bare repo
and <code>$HOME</code> respectively:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>git</span> init <span>--bare</span> <span>$HOME</span>/.myconf</span>

<p>The date of the Hacker News thread <em>(February 10th, 2016)</em> suspiciously
coincides with <a href="https://github.com/myme/dotfiles/commit/61a3f80babec8c1339391462590dafe7ff30fe7f">the first commit</a> of my <a href="https://github.com/myme/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a> that I still have to this

    Switch to a GNU Stow based setup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="link-farming-the-gnu-stown-age">Link farming: The (GNU) stown age</h2>
<p>As the commit message above hints at I made the decision to stop having <code>git</code>
mess about with files in my user home and use a more specialized tool the job.
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU stow</a> is a general purpose “link farm” manager which merges and replicates
distinct directory structures in a single location using symbolic links. In fact
it’s actually quite similar to how complete <code>nix</code> profiles are built from
merging together the build outputs of many smaller <code>nix</code> packages using
symbolic links.</p>
<p>This is quite useful for dotfiles management as the symbolic links allow for all
the configurations to be stored in a git repository in an arbitrary location on
disk, but then installed into <code>$HOME</code>. At the same time the symbolic links
ensure that changes made to files <em>under</em> <code>$HOME</code> are reflected back into the
repository.</p>
<p>One thing that I think makes the <code>Stow</code> approach superior to the bare <code>git</code> repo
approach is that <code>Stow</code> can manage sub-parts of the configurations
independently. It’s relatively easy to exclude or remove unwanted sections of
the configurations simply by <em>not</em> installing them or using <code>Stow</code>’s remove
action. <code>git</code> on the other hand would see such a removal as a file deletion
forcing either keeping a dirty local configuration state or having to create
dedicated branches for host configurations<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of <code>Stow</code> is that it forces the directory structure in the
source location to match how it’s supposed to end up in the destination
location. This can put unwanted restrictions on the structure of a configuration
repository. Additionally, since <code>Stow</code> only manages files and directory
structures it does not provide much help in building and managing <em>applications</em>
(this is a major selling-point for e.g. <code>Home Manager</code>, as we’ll get to).</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the applications (and plugins) that I use were available
I resorted to a combination of <code>git submodules</code>:</p>

<p>I shudder looking back at this “crap”, but to be honest things could probably
have been much worse. At least with a <code>Makefile</code> there <em>is</em> a place listing
which packages and processes <em>likely</em> were run on a machine. I say “likely”
because there’s no guarantee all commends were ever run.</p>
<p>Of course there are a number of obvious flaws here:</p>
<p>Building <code>emacs</code> from source this way requires system-wide installation of
<code>emacs</code>’s build dependencies. There were a bunch of auxiliary applications to
ensure <code>i3</code> ran the way I wanted, kept “miles” away from the <code>i3</code> configuration.
Installing <code>Haskell</code> and <code>Python</code> tools <em>system-wide</em> with <code>apt</code>, while having a
much more manually download process for fonts and theme manager applications.
Perhaps most of all there seems to be very little cohesion between applications
and their associated configurations, as well as no consistent tracking of
installed content. Cleanup must have been a pain (or I never did).</p>
<h2 id="the-age-of-enlightenment-nixos">The Age of Enlightenment: NixOS</h2>
<p>Fate eventually lead me to <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2019-07-01-nixos-into-the-deep-end.html">install NixOS</a> on my first couple of machines back
in 2019. And for a while I stuck with my <code>stow</code> based dotfile setup.</p>
<p>There’s really not a whole lot of configuration necessary to have a fully
functional <code>NixOS</code> installation. The defaults are often enough to get a machine
running, with the exception of some hardware or network configuration. In fact,
I found the <code>NixOS</code> text-based installation flow is so surprisingly simple I
fear people run a risk of gaining unfounded<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> confidence early on in their first
<code>NixOS</code> encounter.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">NixOS options search</a> <code>NixOS</code> has thousands of options. Not only
has <code>NixOS</code> the appeal of reproducibility and declarative configuration, but
every part of a system configuration can be tweaked and molded into whichever
shape.</p>
<p>However, I suspect for the majority of people who venture into the world of
<code>NixOS</code> and who do not have a pre-existing experience with <code>nix</code> start off by
only managing <em>system</em> configurations declaratively using
<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>. There’s no obvious way for newcomers to include
their user profiles and everything else under <code>$HOME</code> in the global system
<code>NixOS</code> configuration.</p>
<p>Even when using <code>NixOS</code> it’s easy to miss out of the <em>full</em> advantage of using
<code>nix</code> through and through. I assume many newbies (like myself at that point)
start by managing <code>$USER</code> apps imperatively using <code>nix-env</code>. Then eventually
thinking that this is weirdly inconsistent with the declarative <code>nixos-rebuild</code>
workflow. I turned to the <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-declarative-package-management">Declarative Package Management</a> section of the <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/">nixpkgs manual</a>:</p>

<p>This would allow installing everything using <code>nix-env -iA nixpkgs.myPackages</code>,
which surely felt a whole lot better. It’s a nice complement to the <code>stow</code> based
approach providing a means of installing <em>applications</em>. This means I couldn’t
yet purge <code>Stow</code> from my setup as it was responsible for providing the configs
of all the apps I might choose to install. Perhaps worse is the fact that there
are scary impurities of using <code>packageOverrides</code> (and global <code>overlays</code>) that I
won’t elaborate on now.</p>
<h2 id="the-industrial-age-home-manager">The Industrial Age: Home manager</h2>
<p>It’s inevitable for anybody who survive long enough in the <code>NixOS</code> world to
encounter <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">Home Manager</a>. The <code>README.md</code> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project provides a basic system for managing a user environment using the
<code>Nix</code> package manager together with the <code>Nix</code> libraries found in <code>Nixpkgs</code>. It
allows declarative configuration of user specific (non global) packages and
dotfiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Home Manager</code> reuses the same concepts and conventions found in the <code>NixOS</code>
configurations to create a way to manage user profiles and dotfiles in pretty
much the same declarative way. Not only does <code>Home Manager</code> provide a
<em>framework</em> for building such configurations, but also curates and exposes
modules for a <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.html">multitude of options</a> for many well-known applications and
services.</p>
<p>One major shift of switching over to <code>Home Manager</code> is that not only does it
generate <em>configuration</em> files, it also ensures all the required <em>software</em> for
the given configuration is built. This is <em>huge</em>! With every approach I’ve used
up to this point executables had to be installed separately from configurations.
This could easily lead to inconsistencies between application versions and their
respective configurations. <code>Home Manager</code> ensures that applications and
configurations stay in sync through community effort.</p>
<p>I was skeptical at first to what I felt was handing over control of all
configurations to pre-written “templates”, so I didn’t immediately jump on the
band wagon. However, I eventually made the switch and quickly realized which
superior solution to dotfile management it is. Furthermore, not only did it make
my <code>NixOS</code> machines configuration better, it also works well on non-<code>NixOS</code>
machines greatly simplifying the configuration management across all the
machines I use.</p>

    nix: Add home.nix

    Initial commit of Home Manager
</code></pre>
<p>At this point I had a fairly automated and reproducible setup. My <code>NixOS</code>
configuration was managing all system setup, then separately invoking <code>Home
Manager</code> to generate my <code>$USER</code> configuration. Life was good, and has been good
for a long time. In fact so good that I didn’t really see the flaw with this
setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey yo! I know you like your config and all, but you know, it’s still not like
managed as a <em>single</em> declarative unit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aw, poop… You’re right.</p>
<p>Re-provisioning a new or existing machine to match a certain configuration still
requires a <em>combination</em> of commands for updates in addition to some first-time
initial setup of e.g. <code>Home Manager</code>. Without up-to-date documentation this is
bound to be non-reproducible and can easily lead to some pain.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-ice-snowflake-age">The Next <del>Ice</del> Snowflake Age</h2>
<p>What we want is a machine configuration where pretty much <em>everything</em> is
declaratively defined in a single <code>nix</code> configuration hierarchy. <code>Home Manager</code>
has a <code>NixOS</code> module, which allows it to be <em>integrated</em> into the build of
<code>NixOS</code> generations. This removes the disconnect between system and user
settings.</p>
<p>One remaining issue is that typically such a setup relies on <code>nix</code> channels to
determine the specific version of <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">nixpkgs</a> being used to build the current
<code>NixOS</code> generation. Channels are designed to be moving targets and which means
that a configuration that built or ran successfully at some point can break in
the future if the channel has been updated.</p>
<p>This non-determinism is one of the problems that <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/">flakes</a> tries to address. For
the last year or so I’ve increasingly adopted <code>flakes</code> into my workflow and have
really begun to enjoy the benefits they bring. Locking down software project
inputs is done by <em>default</em> and with less ceremony than earlier, which ensures I
won’t forget to <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/FAQ/Pinning_Nixpkgs">pin</a> manually.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p>By combining the <code>Home Manager</code> module for <code>NixOS</code> and integrating everything
into a <code>flake</code> I’ve eventually reached the point where pretty much everything
required to get my machines up and running is handled through a single build
step. Not only that, by using <code>git</code> to track configuration history and <code>flakes</code>
pinning dependencies I can be much more certain that configurations that have
worked in the past will continue to work in the future. This is great for
rolling back experimental updates. Furthermore, with an automatically pinned
configuration there’s much less hassle to follow the rolling release of <code>NixOS</code>
unstable. Should stuff break, it’s just a matter of rolling back and sitting
quietly for a little while.</p>
<p>I feel it’s a very exciting setup and would like to dive into the details, but
those are saved for another post… Stay tuned!</p>
