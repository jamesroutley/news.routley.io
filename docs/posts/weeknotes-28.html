    <ul>
<li>this is the one in which i decide whether i&#39;m moving platform from this bearblog to ghost or beehiiv or what. i DO want to take writing more seriously, but i was thinking more &#34;edited, and in other people&#39;s publications&#34;. i fucking love being edited. the issues with substack are getting louder every day, but do i want to directly monetise my writing on my own platform at this stage? i wish there was a way to send a newsletter completely for free (and that bearblog had maybe one or two more of my pet features). if i could get an editor-for-hire who wasn&#39;t way out of &#34;giving writing away&#34; budget, i would be so up for that. tell your friends who edit words?</li>
<li>i think i maybe just join more tipping platforms and ask for tips more, and keep just writing what i write on here?? I don&#39;t really like newsletters for what I&#39;m doing currently, but I get the value of knowing how to get the attention of people who like your stuff. I&#39;m gonna make a big push to try and put out one non-weeknotes thing a week at least next year (plus weeknotes, obviously), whether writing or video or podcast or something else BUT how do i keep the attention of my obviously rapt, growing, amazing audience? who knows, i will figure it out. nerds can subscribe to the <a href="https://olu.online/feed">rss feed</a>, i am <a href="https://olu.online/contact">contactable</a> on all the social medias, but i do get the one to one thing. do i have to set up a patreon? or a discord? i welcome opinions and advice.</li>
<li>gonna try and finish <a href="https://piccalil.li/complete-css/">complete css</a> by the time i get back to work, i have decided. i&#39;m also trying a bit of rust. look at me, coding!</li>
<li>it&#39;s the most wonderful time of the year, and i&#39;m really glad i don&#39;t have to do any work until january 6th. if you want to hang out, virtually or nah, hit me up now is an excellent time.</li>
<li>debating whether posts on social media that are short videos count towards to my one artifact a week thing, but we&#39;ll see. i find short video hard cos i feel wooden if i script, and forget what i&#39;m trying to say if i don&#39;t.</li>
<li>i&#39;m also pissed because whatever spell capacities had on me, for a year and a fucking bit, has finally broken. i feel like i need to move back to obsidian, cos i want to have my longer form writing be like, feasible to actually write where i take my notes, which isn&#39;t currently true in capacities. maybe i have to suck it up and content-thinking and planning-thinking live in different apps, but i refuse for now and will see where i end up. not being able to pre-populate a past and future time period (year/quarter/week/etc) without using a plugin is annoying me so much, but we move, i tell myself. i had to do that manually in capacities anyway which had no templating, so why does it even annoy me?!</li>
<li>made amazing pizza with a friend. it had fancy deli meat and radicchio and homemade pizza sauce that was slightly sweet, and it was banging, i thought i kinda hated bitter things. also non-coca-cola cheap cola bangs but in a different way to true coke, i will try them more often i think. what even is cola flavouring? she&#39;s mysterious and elusive. dare i say dashing??</li>
<li>i have been neglecting <a href="https://notes.olu.online">my digital garden</a> but maybe now i&#39;m back in obsidian i can work in there?? or maybe that&#39;s the solution to my notes issue, go really hard on notes and thinking in there and leave capacities alone? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</li>
<li>my word for 2025 is greathearted which will inform my word for each quarter, can&#39;t remember if i&#39;ve told youse that.</li>
<li>i feel like i&#39;m really clear on what i want this year without a big chunk of planning, but i also want conflicting things e.g. fancy sleeve tattoo vs. saving a big emergency fund.</li>
<li>since i guess i won&#39;t write another thing on here weeknotes wise till after xmas i hope you all have a fantastic one if you celebrate, and a great day otherwise too! happy solstice for tomorrow, even if you don&#39;t celebrate it too (brighter days are coming, northern hemisphere! the hateful sun is going back in her cage, southern hemisphere!) xo</li>
