<li>hey! hi! hello! welcome to this week&#39;s weeknotes!</li>
<li>i was very tempted to skip this one, please clap.</li>
<li>been trying using tldraw as a way to mind map as it&#39;s currently free and i don&#39;t really need all my mind maps to stick around forever, but typing that sentence reminded me i have a use case for something recommended to me by <a href="https://www.henryfellerhoff.com/">henry</a> via <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse</a>. it&#39;s called <a href="https://linkdump.connie.surf/">link dump</a>. it lets you create ephemeral mind maps, and also lets you pull in <a href="https://www.are.na/explore">arena</a> boards, so sounds super useful for a scratchboard or mapping ideas!</li>
<li>been really struggling with coming up with a concept for &#39;r&#39; for alphabet superset but i promise you and myself that i will get <em>something</em> out this week, probably just won&#39;t be my best work.</li>
<li>been trying out <a href="https://www.yourfocusfriend.com/">hank green&#39;s bean app</a>, and it annoys me how much something being cute encourages me to use it, same with habit rabbit. i don&#39;t really like the illustration style with finch so it&#39;s a lot less sticky for me!</li>
<li>still looking at backpacks despite myself, i love the colours of the cotopaxi backpacks made of remnants but i somehow don&#39;t trust that mine will turn out to be cute, since it seems to be a lucky dip what colours you get. need to work out if a 26l bag is ridiculous for everyday carry too! their bags seem very floppy if not full, and apparently don&#39;t stand up very well on the floor/tables, but do i care if it is very cute??</li>
<li>thinking of starting up some actual coding notes on this blog, i was inspired by someone else at recurse to call it &#34;lab notes&#34; but maybe just &#34;dev log&#34; or &#34;/til&#34; (today i learnt!) but definitely taking suggestions. i&#39;ll be working on the <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash page</a> search idea first, but there&#39;s lots of stuff i want to work on.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been struggling a bit with music and might have to sign up for youtube music as a stopgap between spotify and my own cloud streaming, as i am both a bit too time and cash poor to immediately get all the music i want to populate stuff. i can listen to music on desktop pretty easily through youtube but my phone is an issue at the moment. i aspire not to be perfect, but to reflect on what works, what doesn&#39;t and what makes sense, so i don&#39;t mind doing this for now.</li>
<li>excited to get back into bike learning after the move, i still hope i take to it quickly with more practice but i get that it might be hard. i strongly suspect i&#39;m dyspraxic because of a lot of things, but many people with it learn so i&#39;m not writing it off, don&#39;t worry. and i&#39;m wearing a helmet!</li>
<li>trying to read more poetry, and listen to more new-to-me artists. i&#39;m taking suggestions!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating veggie sausages, cheesy mash, and turkish food. i have been drinking copious amounts of tea and orange fizzy drinks.</li>
<li>how has your week been? hope you had a great one. see you next week ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
