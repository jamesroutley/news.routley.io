    <h1>CloudSeed Rust - A Fullstack Rust Boilerplate for Building Webapps in Minutes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://www.chainlift.io/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>Today I&#39;m launching <a href="https://cloudseedrust.com/">CloudSeed Rust</a> - a Rust boilerplate for spinning up fullstack webapps in minutes.</p>
<p>I started learning Rust as a potential candidate for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_missing-programming-language">The Missing Programming Language</a>. I was always hesitant to start learning / building with it as I was afraid of the infamous learning curve. But as I got deeper, I realized that while it does have its edges Rust is first and foremost a high level language and there&#39;s ways to write <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_high-level-rust">High-Level Rust</a> where you get 80% of the benefits with only 20% of the pain.</p>
<p>Since then I&#39;ve been hooked. IMO it fills a very big gap in the current programming language landscape. And naturally I wanted to encapsulate all my favorite paradigms of building into a boilerplate so I can start each future project from a good place.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cloudseed-rust">What is CloudSeed Rust?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cloudseedrust.com/">CloudSeed Rust</a> is a fullstack webapp boilerplate for Rust. It&#39;s the seed you grow into a web service / business.</p>
<p>It provides a solid foundation from which to develop your app by handling the table-stakes features most apps need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API foundations</strong> - Axum web framework with routing, middleware, CORS, error handling</li>
<li><strong>Auth</strong> - Passwordless login with magic links, sessions, rate limiting, auto user creation</li>
<li><strong>Background jobs</strong> - PostgreSQL-backed job queue with retries, exponential backoff, cron scheduling via apalis</li>
<li><strong>CSS pipelines</strong> - Tailwind + DaisyUI pre-configured with build pipeline</li>
<li><strong>SSR</strong> - Type-safe server-side rendering with Maud</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong> - Structured logging with Open Telemetry so you can easily export to your aggregator of choice (Datadog/Grafana/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Its aim is to give you everything you need out of the box but nothing you don&#39;t so it&#39;s both quick to setup and easy to change as your app requires.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_high-level-rust">High-Level Rust patterns</a> throughout to provide good ergonomics without sacrificing much performance - immutable data, service-level traits for easy DI / testing, generous cheap cloning with <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-02_announcing-lightclone">LightClone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-build-cloudseed-rust">Why build CloudSeed Rust?</h2>
<p>I build a lot of projects and most projects require the same plumbing:</p>
<ul>
<li>API scaffolding</li>
<li>Auth flows + data models</li>
<li>Background jobs</li>
<li>CSS pipelines</li>
</ul>
<p>These are interesting to build the first time but by the 5th or 6th it&#39;s just overhead. They don&#39;t differentiate your app / product and is time lost from building features that are actually interesting / useful. Plus there&#39;s always edge cases with these things so when you&#39;re bored and likely generating parts with AI, it&#39;s easy to miss smth important that ends up hobbling your app.</p>
<p>I typically solve for this by building up templates / boilerplates for the types of apps / systems I build frequently. Then every time I build a new app and learn smth / find an edge case, I can push a fix / change upstream so all future builds start in a better spot.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done this before with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudseed.xyz/">CloudSeed for F#</a> - fullstack F# webapp template</li>
<li>C# + Raylib, TS + Phaser, Sveltekit + ThreeJS templates</li>
<li>Various markdown blog implementations in F#, C#, SvelteKit which I&#39;ve shared in my <a href="https://github.com/HAMY-LABS/hamy-labs-code-examples/tree/main">HAMY LABS Example Repo</a> for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/haminions">HAMINIONS Members</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And now we&#39;re doing this with Rust.</p>
<p>Why Rust? Because it captured my attention as a potential candidate for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_missing-programming-language">the missing programming language</a>. The language has everything on paper - great types, great performance, a large, stable, and growing ecosystem but the devx overhead / learning curve is scary and well-documented. So my <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_high-level-rust">High-Level Rust</a> paradigm and <a href="https://cloudseedrust.com/">CloudSeed Rust</a> boilerplate is my attempt to reduce that devx burden to see if we can elevate Rust to an S-Tier language.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Web API</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">Axum</a>, the most popular Rust web framework built on Tokio</li>
<li><strong>SSR</strong> - <a href="https://maud.lambda.xyz/">Maud</a>, compile-time type-safe HTML templates (no template files, just Rust code - which I find more ergonomic, understandable, and composable esp if you go <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-05_htmx-faster-mpa">the HTMX / Datastar route</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Styling</strong> - <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> + <a href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a> with a Docker multi-stage build pipeline</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">SQLx</a> for compile-time checked queries + <a href="https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query">sea-query</a> for composable query building</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - PostgreSQL by default (can be easily swapped to anything sqlx supports)</li>
<li><strong>Auth</strong> - Passwordless magic links with HMAC-signed sessions</li>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/geofmureithi/apalis">Apalis</a> for PostgreSQL-backed job queue with retries and cron</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong> - OpenTelemetry with dual output (stdout always, optional OTLP export)</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Integration tests with Testcontainers (real Postgres in tests) - taking a pragmatic testing diamond approach to validation</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Dockerized with multi-stage builds - if your server can run Docker, it can run CloudSeed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>CloudSeed Rust is available now at an early access pricef of $29 at <a href="https://cloudseedrust.com/">cloudseedrust.com</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been this excited about a programming language and ecosystem <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-01_how-i-got-into-fsharp">since I found F#</a>. I&#39;ll be actively building with Rust and developing CloudSeed as I go. Any feedback you have is welcome - can reach me on any of my socials.</p>
