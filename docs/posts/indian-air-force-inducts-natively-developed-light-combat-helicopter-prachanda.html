<p><span>Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh boosted the efforts of Aatmanirbharta in Defence sector by formally inducting Light Combat Vehicle (LCH), Prachanda in October 2022. The helicopter has been designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and was inducted into the India Air Force (IAF) in Jodhpur.  </span></p>
<p><span>General Anil Chauhan, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS); Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhary; Air Marshal Vikram Singh; the Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southwestern Air Command, Chairman and Managing Director of HAL Shri C.B. Ananthakrishnan and several other senior representatives from the Ministry of Defence, IAF and local dignitaries were in attendance at the occasion. </span></p>
<p><span>Shri Rajnath Singh lauded the efforts of IAF for its role in addressing both internal and foreign challenges of the country. The introduction of the LCH, with its incredible power and versatility, not only improves IAF&#39;s combat prowess but also marks a significant step toward the country&#39;s goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production of defences, as envisioned by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. &#34;The introduction of LCH emphasises the fact that the Indian Air Force (IAF) equally trusts indigenous equipment, just as the nation does,&#34; he continued.</span></p>
<p><span>Shri Rajnath Singh added that the development of domestic attack helicopters did not receive the proper priority earlier. However, since the Kargil War in 1999, the necessity for LCH has increased, and the LCH that exists now is the culmination of 20 years of research and development and local initiatives. He continued by saying that LCH was powered not only by its rotors, engines, and blades but also by the perseverance, commitment, and patriotism of our scientists, engineers, and specialists.</span></p>
<p><span>He also pointed out that the LCH satisfies current combat needs and essential quality standards under a variety of operational circumstances. It is capable of speedy delivery to the field, carrying a range of ammo, and self-defence. According to him, the LCH is the best platform for both our Army and Air Force since this adaptable helicopter precisely fits the requirements of our armed services in all terrains.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>About Light Combat Vehicle</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The LCH, created by HAL, is the company&#39;s first homegrown Multi-Role Combat Helicopter. It is capable of fierce ground and aerial attacks. Inducted in the IAF&#39;s newly created No. 143 Helicopter Unit, it is a testament to India&#39;s rising strength in homegrown design, development, and production as well as an important step toward achieving &#34;Atmanirbharta&#34; in the field of defence. </span></p>
<p><span>The helicopter has strong armour protection, contemporary stealth abilities, and a powerful capacity for night attacks. The LCH is ideally adapted for the current battlefield with its powerful air-to-air missiles, close-combat weapons, and superior navigation system. The helicopter is a powerful addition to the IAF&#39;s arsenal since it can operate from high-altitude terrain and execute precision strikes at high-altitude targets. </span></p>
