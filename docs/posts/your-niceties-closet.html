      <p>If you&#39;re challenging yourself and taking on risks, you&#39;re probably not going to bat 100%. Sometimes you&#39;ll have missteps and you&#39;ll mess up. The resulting feelings of self-doubt you&#39;ll encounter are inevitable, but how you handle them is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>I think this is all natural, and maybe even necessary. Just like how there&#39;s such a thing as an optimal fraud rate for a payments processor, maybe there&#39;s such a thing as an optimal failure rate. There&#39;s a reason it feels bad when you mess up, but far more concerning than a small mistake is the inability to recognize a mistake. </p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re going to challenge yourself more and more, you&#39;re probably going to have more moments when you feel dumb. So you&#39;ll need a ritual for working with it. Ask: 1) how did you want it to turn out? 2) how did it turn out? 3) why, and what would you do differently next time?</p>

<p>Great, we&#39;ve processed it. Failure still sucks but it&#39;s probably not anathema. Let&#39;s not make the same mistake again. But zoom out now: you&#39;ve done great things before and you&#39;ll do great things again: no use in trying to chalk this one up as a win. And trying to convince yourself it&#39;s a win probably won&#39;t work, but you&#39;re welcome to try.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re dealing with the recency bias and focused on a mistake. Sit with it and then do something to remember who you are and how far you&#39;ve come. That&#39;s where your niceties closet comes in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple. Here&#39;s what you do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a folder on your desktop (or anywhere easily accessible) and call it &#34;niceties&#34;</li>
<li>When something good happens, take a screenshot and put it in your niceties folder.</li>
<li>Whenever something doesn&#39;t work and you&#39;re feeling overly self-critical, pause for second, look through your niceties folder, and remember how far you&#39;ve come already. This isn&#39;t the first time this happens and it probably won&#39;t be the last. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now get back to it. ðŸš€</p>
