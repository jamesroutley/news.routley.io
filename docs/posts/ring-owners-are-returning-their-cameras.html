    <h1>Ring owners are returning their cameras</h1>

Users claim they&#39;re doing so because the Amazon-led company joined forces with Flock Safety and forced users to opt in to certain features. These Ring owners claim that the company is allegedly providing information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It&#39;s a problem that is calling into question what home security can mean for users.</p><p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">There is a way to ask for a Ring camera refund, should you choose. According to several Reddit users, Amazon is honoring these returns so long as you speak to customer service and explain that Ring has broken its terms of service. Users claim to be receiving a full refund for their Ring cameras and also successfully returning Ring doorbells, indoor cameras, multiple batteries, and a battery charger.</p> <p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Read more: <a href="https://www.bgr.com/2034581/amazon-basics-gadgets-users-swear-by/?zsource=msnsyndicated" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">5 Amazon Basics Gadgets That Users Swear By</a></p> <h2>Why the refund is happening and how to claim it</h2><p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Ring security systems are no strangers to scrutiny, despite being <a href="https://www.bgr.com/2078105/top-rated-amazon-gadgets-worth-buying/" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">top-rated Amazon gadgets</a>. In 2019, the company was accused of <a href="https://www.bgr.com/tech/ring-camera-customer-feeds-accessed-creepy-privacy-violation/" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">spying on customer camera feeds</a>. More recently, its new Search Party feature, announced in a Super Bowl commercial, gives users reason to believe it&#39;s allegedly leading to a surveillance state disguised as a lost dog search tool.</p><p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Now, users are asking for their money back. In a post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FlockSurveillance/comments/1r0m509/request_a_refund_for_your_ring_cameras_even_for/" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">on Reddit</a>, user &#34;aawolf&#34; posted an image explaining how and why you should return your Ring camera. The post also claims that Ring footage can fall into the hands of Flock Safety, which is also responsible for license plate readers throughout the U.S.. This Reddit user is alleging that Flock has been working with ICE to locate &#34;susceptible&#34; individuals. The post also cites that another reason to return products is that Ring reportedly enabled AI and facial recognition features, previously optional, without user consent.</p><p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Essentially, so long as you state that Ring has changed the terms of service and that you disagree with Flock, Amazon may begin processing your return. If you wish to request a refund for your Ring camera, the fastest way is to speak to customer service through Rufus on the Amazon home page. From there, request your refund by stating that the company&#39;s agreement with Flock invalidates the reason you purchased the product, and that the terms of service have been changed. You may need to provide an order number, but buyers did confirm that they have successfully returned cameras.</p> <p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Enjoyed this article? <a href="https://subscribe.bgr.com/newsletter-syndicated?utm_source=msn&amp;utm_medium=bgr-NL-feed" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">Sign up to BGR&#39;s free newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=bgr.com" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">add us as a preferred search source</a> for the latest in tech and entertainment, plus tips and advice you&#39;ll actually use.</p><p data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;blueLinks&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:76}">Read the <a href="https://www.bgr.com/2098762/ring-camera-return-how-much-they-get/?zsource=msnsyndicated" target="_blank" data-t="{&#34;n&#34;:&#34;destination&#34;,&#34;t&#34;:13,&#34;a&#34;:&#34;click&#34;,&#34;b&#34;:1,&#34;c.t&#34;:7}">original article on BGR</a>.</p><p>This article may contain affiliate links that Microsoft and/or the publisher may receive a commission from if you buy a product or service through those links.</p><!--fe-b$$end$$0$$FsfmyN2K7V$$fe-b--><!--fe-b$$end$$3$$xnR1RAsVWS$$fe-b--></div></div>
