<p id="speakable-summary">Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is closing the doors on her consumer software startup Sunshine, and is selling the company’s assets to her new AI startup, Dazzle. The news was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/marissa-mayer-sunshine-startup-shut-down/">first reported by Wired</a>, which cited an email sent to Sunshine’s shareholders.</p>

<p>Dazzle is setting out to build an AI personal assistant, the report cited anonymous sources as saying, and added that all of Sunshine’s employees will move to the new company.</p>







<p>Almost all of Sunshine’s investors, who include Norwest Venture Partners, Felicis Partners, and SV Angel, have signed off on the deal, Wired cited the sources as saying. </p>

<p>Originally founded in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management, dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” That product saw little adoption due to privacy concerns about privacy, and pretty much languished. In 2024, the service added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/marissa-mayers-startup-just-rolled-out-apps-for-group-photo-sharing-and-event-planning-and-the-internet-isnt-sure-what-to-think/">event management and photo sharing</a> — with a touch of AI, of course — but with little success. Both apps have been downloaded just over 1,000 times on the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>The company had raised about $20 million in 2020, and according to Meyer, was largely self-funded. </p>
