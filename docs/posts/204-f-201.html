      <p>Today is a hot, slow day, so I&#39;ll get up on my soap box to share a little gem with you: the debut album of Puerto Rican Band ÌFÉ—a brainchild of Mark Underwood, also known as DJ Nature—, titled “IIII+IIII”. A hipster album name if I&#39;ve ever seen one. But I quite enjoy the record, so what the heck.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by the first song, though, not all the material on the album is so radical and unconpromising. Some of the songs are actually a little bland, but the rhythm is infallible and often a bit spicier than what you might find in other projects; delicious spring soul food to wake up your tired limbs.</p>
<p>And with that I wish you a great sunny day, wherever you may be.</p>
