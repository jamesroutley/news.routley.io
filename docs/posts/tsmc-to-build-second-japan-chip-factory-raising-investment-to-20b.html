    <h1>TSMC to build second Japan chip factory, raising investment to $20B</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC said on Tuesday it will build a second Japanese plant to begin operation by the end of 2027, bringing total investment in its Japan venture to more than $20 billion with the support of the Tokyo government.</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co announced plans in 2021 to build a $7 billion chip plant in Kumamoto in southern Japan&#39;s Kyushu.</p><p>TSMC said last month the first Japanese factory would open in February with volume production in the fourth quarter, and that the company was also exploring building a second factory in the country.</p><p>In a statement, TSMC, the world&#39;s largest contract chipmaker, said its majority-owned unit Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing in Kumamoto would build a second fabrication plant, or fab, in response to rising customer demand.</p><p>The second fab will begin construction by the end of this year and with both factories the site is expected to have total monthly capacity of more than 100,000 12-inch wafers to be used for automotive, industrial, consumer and high performance computing-related applications, TSMC said.</p><p>The capacity plan may be further adjusted based upon customer demand, it added.</p><p>TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, holds an 86.5% stake in the Japanese venture, with Sony Group 6%, auto parts maker Denso 5.5% and carmaker Toyota 2%.</p><p>TSMC&#39;s expansion in Kyushu is central to the Japanese government&#39;s efforts to rebuild the country&#39;s position as a leading chip manufacturing centre and ensure the stable supply of chips amid trade tensions between the United States and China.</p><p>The decision to build a second fab is a vote of confidence by TSMC in Japan where construction of the first fab has run smoothly and which, Reuters has reported, it sees as a source of diligent workers with a government that is easy to deal with.</p><p>Japan&#39;s chip-making sector, the world&#39;s biggest in the 1980s, has struggled to maintain its competitive edge, going into a steady decline in the past three decades, while rivals such as Taiwanese manufacturers gained ground.</p><p>While both TSMC and the Taiwan government have said the majority of the company&#39;s most advanced manufacturing would continue to take place in Taiwan, TSMC has been expanding its global manufacturing footprint in response to what it says is customer demand.</p><p>TSMC&#39;s flagship overseas investment is a $40 billion project to build two fabs in Arizona, supporting Washington&#39;s plans to boost U.S. chipmaking capacity.</p><p>TSMC is also planning its first European factory, in Germany, which will mainly supply the auto industry.</p><p>TSMC&#39;s Taipei-listed stock has risen 8.9% so far this year on the back of a boom in demand for chips for artificial intelligence applications, outperforming a 0.9% gain for the broader index.</p><p>(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Sam Nussey in Tokyo; Editing by Louise Heavens, Kirsten Donovan)</p></div></div>
