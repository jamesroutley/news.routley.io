<p dir="auto">I&#39;m so happy to see the amount of interest and participation here!</p>
<p dir="auto">Please join our brand new Discord server with this link <a href="https://discord.gg/kyMRF958" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/kyMRF958</a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can expect some big commits coming soon. We&#39;ll be merging in some code that other developers did in parallel and/or after this code was archived.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>We will support c++17 going forward</li>
<li>We are using clang in LLVM mode for code formatting. Please run clang-format before submitting a PR</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the &#39;1.5&#39; patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley wrote several years ago. At the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make a converter so the old cutscenes work. It&#39;ll take some effort to stub out that code so it compiles.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less experienced back then.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you&#39;re interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message. Otherwise, I&#39;m happy to take pull requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!</p>

<p dir="auto">Thanks to Jeff Slutter, who did most of the work modernizing the code from the 90&#39;s. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what the community does with it!</p>
