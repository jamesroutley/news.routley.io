					<p>It’s that time of year for .NET when we get a new major version and a bunch of exciting features. <a href="https://dotnetconf.net">.NET Conf 2025</a> kicked off earlier today, bringing with it the release of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-10/">.NET 10</a>, as well as ASP.NET Core 10, C# 14, and F# 10. Congrats (and a big thank you) to the .NET team and everyone who helped get .NET 10 out the door.</p>
<p>At Heroku, we believe you should be able to use language and framework releases when they launch, and we prepare accordingly. You can <strong>now build and run .NET 10 apps on Heroku</strong>, with buildpack support for new SDK features like <strong>file-based apps</strong>, <strong><code>.slnx</code> solution files</strong>, and more.</p>

<h2>Migration and support timelines</h2>
<p>This year’s release is significant because .NET 10 is the new <strong>Long Term Support (LTS)</strong> release, which will be supported for three years. This extended support, including regular updates and security patches, makes it the best release for businesses and developers to build on and migrate to, offering a stable foundation with access to the latest features.</p>
<p>With .NET 10 now available, the clock is ticking on previous versions. Both .NET 8 and .NET 9 will reach End of Support on November 10, 2026. In other words, now is a good time to start planning your migration.</p>
<p>We will continue to support .NET 8 and .NET 9 with consistent, timely updates alongside .NET 10. Our .NET support follows the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dotnet-heroku-support-reference#net-versions">official .NET support policy</a>, and we are fully committed to providing a stable and secure platform for your .NET applications.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into using .NET 10 on Heroku today!</p>
<h2>Zero-config deployment with .NET 10 file-based apps</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting features in .NET 10 is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/sdk#file-based-apps-enhancements">file-based apps</a> – .NET applications defined in a single C# file without project or solution files, making it easier than ever to deploy .NET apps to Heroku.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a complete ASP.NET Core 10 web application, <code>HelloHeroku.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// Use the new #sdk directive to pull in the ASP.NET Core SDK
#:sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();  
  
app.MapGet(&#34;/&#34;, () =&gt; &#34;Hello from .NET 10 on Heroku!&#34;);

app.Run();
</code></pre>
<p>When you push this to Heroku, the platform detects the <code>*.cs</code> file and uses the .NET buildpack. Since there are no solution or project files, the buildpack treats it as a file-based app, installs the latest .NET SDK, builds and publishes the app, detects and configures it as a web application, and deploys it to serve traffic.</p>

<h2>SLNX: A modern solution for a modern .NET</h2>
<p>For decades, .NET developers have used <code>.sln</code> solution files, a proprietary format introduced in 2002 for Visual Studio. Unlike .NET itself, they haven’t changed much since. In a step towards modernization, the .NET 10 SDK is making SLNX the default format. Heroku ensures a seamless deployment experience by fully supporting both formats.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;solution&gt;
    &lt;project path=&#34;MyApp\MyApp.csproj&#34;&gt;&lt;/project&gt;
&lt;/solution&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>*.slnx</code> files are easier to read and edit, less likely to cause merge conflicts, and support a wider range of workflows and environments, from Linux shells to Visual Studio on Windows. To migrate existing <code>.sln</code> files, run <code>dotnet solution migrate</code> or see the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/new-simpler-solution-file-format/">.NET blog announcement</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Heroku CI and the Microsoft Testing Platform</h2>
<p>The .NET 10 SDK integrates the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/microsoft-testing-platform-intro?tabs=dotnetcli">Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP)</a> directly in the <code>dotnet test</code> command. Since Heroku CI runs <code>dotnet test</code> by default, your test suite works out of the box after you migrate your apps.</p>
<p>For more control over the test setup and execution, you can <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci#specify-custom-test-commands-scripts">specify custom test commands</a> in your <code>app.json</code>.</p>
<h2>Ready to migrate? We’re here to help</h2>
<p>To support your .NET 10 migration, we’ve updated all our documentation and resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/heroku/dotnet-getting-started">.NET Getting Started app</a> now runs on .NET 10.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/aspnetcore-app-configuration">ASP.NET Core configuration article</a> includes new guidance for ASP.NET Core 10, including migration away from the now-obsolete <code>IPNetwork</code> and <code>ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownNetworks</code> APIs (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/aspnet-core/10/ipnetwork-knownnetworks-obsolete">learn more</a>) often used to integrate with Heroku’s router.</li>
<li>Apps currently using .NET 10 RC builds on Heroku (with <code>TargetFramework</code> set to <code>net10.0</code>) will automatically be built with the stable .NET 10 release on the next <code>git push</code>. You can pin to specific SDK versions using a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dotnet-heroku-support-reference#advanced-net-sdk-version-configuration"><code>global.json</code> file</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For teams migrating from earlier versions, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/10.0">.NET 10 breaking changes documentation</a> covers important upgrade considerations.</p>
<h2>Get started today</h2>
<p>We can’t wait to see what you build with .NET 10 on Heroku. From new features like file-based apps to the stability of an LTS release, this is a great time to be a .NET developer.</p>
