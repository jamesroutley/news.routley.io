Just a few pictures of the rare car-choked street. But I soon learned that cities like Amsterdam used to have just as much traffic and air pollution as cities in the United States do today. </p><p>After learning this, I became obsessed with this question: How did the Netherlands go from having traffic-clogged cities to having some of the world&#39;s best bike infrastructure?</p><p><span>The 1920s and 1930s were the first golden age of Dutch biking. In 1930, there were </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">2.7 million bikes</a><span> in the country compared to just 68,000 cars. </span></p><p><span>“The bicycle was very practical,” said Marjolein de Lange, co-author of </span><em>Bike City Amsterdam.</em><span> “It was affordable for many people, the distances were not so large, and it was faster than going by foot.”</span></p><p>But World War II changed everything for cycling in The Netherlands. In 1940 the Germans invaded and began a 5 year long occupation of the country. </p><p><span>During the occupation the Germans imposed tire rations, which made it difficult to buy a new bike or repair an existing one. They also stole bikes from Dutch residents. The exact number of bikes stolen is disputed, but </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">some estimates</a><span> put it as high as half of all bikes.</span></p><p><span>Because of all this, cycling traffic fell by </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">over 50%</a><span> during and after the war.</span></p><p><span>But the war had another major influence on cycling. According to </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">one estimate</a><span>, 60% of all Dutch transportation infrastructure was destroyed during World War II. Roads, bridges, and tunnels were all bombed during the invasion. Some cities, like Rotterdam, were completely flattened. </span></p><p>All of this destruction forced The Netherlands to rebuild their country almost entirely from scratch.</p><p>With this blank canvas, the Netherlands didn’t immediately set out to build a biking utopia. In fact, the opposite happened. Like many countries around the world, the post-war era was a golden age for the personal automobile.</p><p><span>In 1950, there were 139,000 cars in The Netherlands. 20 years later there were </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">3.4 million</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>There were a few reasons for this dramatic growth. First, cars got a lot cheaper making them more affordable to middle class Dutch people. Second, the Netherlands became very wealthy. Between 1945 and 1970, GDP per capita in the country grew by </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us?tab=chart&amp;country=NLD" rel="">a factor of 5</a><span>.

For example The Hague and Tilberg built a few bike lanes and painted them bright red. But biking rates </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">didn’t go up</a><span> after they built these bikes lanes.</span></p><p>City planners learned that it wasn’t enough to just build a few dedicated bike lanes. No, they needed an entire network of bike lanes throughout the city. </p><p><span>Around the same time, Delft began running their own experiments. Rather than build a few bike lanes, </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">they spent</a><span> the equivalent of about 12 million dollars building a city-wide biking network. Bicycle use went </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">up by 6%</a><span> of driving went down by 3%. It was considered an early success. </span></p><p><span>In the 1980s, the Dutch government went on a bike lane building spree. Over the course of 10 years, the government </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">built</a><span> about 7,000 kilometers of bike lanes, growing the total number of bike lanes in the country by about 70%. </span></p><p><span>But despite the growth of this network, people weren’t biking that much more. In 1990 Dutch people biked 12.8 billion kilometers. 4 years later in 1994, they biked </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">12.9 billion kilometers</a><span>, a difference of about 100,000 kilometers.</span></p><p><span>As Ton Welleman wrote in what’s now </span><a href="https://hembrow.eu/studytour/TheDutchBicycleMasterPlan1999.pdf" rel="">a famous study</a><span> for the Dutch Ministry of Transport:</span></p><blockquote><p>“The construction of a network of bicycle routes is insufficient in itself for bringing about a sustainable increase in bicycle use. The simultaneous execution of a policy discouraging car use is deemed necessary.”</p></blockquote><p>In other words, if you want people to bike you can’t just make it pleasant to bike. You have to make it a pain to drive.</p><p>Over the last 20 years, Dutch cities like Amsterdam and The Hague have done just that. One way they’ve discouraged car use is by making parking expensive.</p><p>“In the city centre, you pay seven euros per hour [to park],” de Lange said. “If it&#39;s expensive, people will think about going by car twice.” </p><p>But policies like this don’t just discourage people from driving. They also provide income for the government. And most Dutch cities use that income to fund bike and pedestrian infrastructure. </p><p><span>In addition to making parking expensive, Dutch cities also use a city planning strategy called “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAxRYrpbnuA&amp;ab_channel=NotJustBikes" rel="">traffic calming</a><span>” to slow down cars. The basic idea of this is to make roads more narrow, reduce speed limits, add bumps, and make it difficult to drive fast.</span></p><p>This makes driving less desirable. But it also makes it safer for pedestrians and cyclists. The result is less driving and more biking and walking. </p><p><span>Many cities have also begun converting roads into </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlXNVnftaNs&amp;ab_channel=NotJustBikes" rel="">car-free zones</a><span>. As the name implies, these are areas of the city where cars can’t travel with the exception of delivery trucks and emergency vehicles. </span></p><p><span>All of these changes have had an incredible impact on The Netherlands. In the 1970s about 500 children were dying from car fatalities per year. Four decades later in 2010, </span><a href="https://swov.nl/en/fact-sheet/road-deaths-netherlands" rel="">14 children died</a><span>, a decrease of about 97%. </span></p><p><span>Compared to the United States, the Netherlands has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/u-s-lessons-from-the-dutch-traffic-safety-revolution" rel="">3 times less</a><span> car fatalities per capita. If the US could replicate this, we’d save 20,000 lives per year. </span></p><p><span>All of this biking is also improving people’s health. Everywhere in Europe, obesity rates are growing with one exception: The Netherlands. As Melissa and Chris Bruntlett point out in their book, </span><em><a href="http://www.modacitylife.com/curbing-traffic" rel="">Curbing Traffic</a></em><span>: “Similar bicycling rates in the United States would save a staggering 125,000 lives each year.”</span></p><p><span>These policies have also cut the Netherlands carbon emissions. In the United States the average person emits about </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/united-states" rel="">5.4 tons of CO2 per year</a><span> from driving. Dutch people, on the other, drive much less and as a result their cars emit </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/netherlands" rel="">3 times less CO2</a><span> per capita.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png" width="1456" height="805" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:805,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:10267341,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f4c4027-5a10-4f68-9665-f717a156d47c_3710x2052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We often look at our societies as fixed and stuck in their ways. We think “The United States will always be a land of strip malls and highways.” Or we think the world will always run on fossil fuels.</p><p>The reality is that none of these things have to be true. </p><p>The Netherlands is proof that societies can and do change - and sometimes they can do it quickly. But as we saw, these transformations don’t happen on their own. </p><p>They happen because people like the activists that started the Stop de Kindermord movement. They happen because of smart decisions by government employees that rarely get the credit that they deserve. They happen because of people who show up to their local town meetings. </p><p>But the first step in making these changes and building better cities is believing we can do it in the first place. </p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.distilled.earth/p/how-the-netherlands-built-a-biking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://www.distilled.earth/p/how-the-netherlands-built-a-biking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
