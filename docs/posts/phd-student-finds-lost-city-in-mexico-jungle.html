which they have called Valeriana - using Lidar, a type of laser survey that maps structures buried under vegetation.<!-- --></p><p>They believe it is second in density only to Calakmul, thought to be the largest Maya site in ancient Latin America.<!-- --></p><p>The team discovered three sites in total, in a survey area the size of Scotland&#39;s capital Edinburgh, “by accident” when one archaeologist browsed data on the internet.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>“I was on something like page 16 of Google search and found a laser survey done by a Mexican organisation for environmental monitoring,” explains Luke Auld-Thomas, a PhD student at Tulane university in the US.<!-- --></p><p>It was a Lidar survey, a remote sensing technique which fires thousands of laser pulses from a plane and maps objects below using the time the signal takes to return.<!-- --></p><p>But when Mr Auld-Thomas processed the data with methods used by archaeologists, he saw what others had missed - a huge ancient city which may have been home to 30-50,000 people at its peak from 750 to 850 AD.<!-- --></p><p>That is more than the number of people who live in the region today, the researchers say.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Auld-Thomas and his colleagues named the city Valeriana after a nearby lagoon.<!-- --></p><p>The find helps change an idea in Western thinking that the Tropics was where “civilisations went to die”, says Professor Marcello Canuto, a co-author in the research. <!-- --></p><p>Instead, this part of the world was home to rich and complex cultures, he explains.<!-- --></p><p>We can’t be sure what led to the demise and eventual abandonment of the city, but the archaeologists say climate change was a major factor.<!-- --></p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/443d/live/f774e910-95b8-11ef-bf59-99b64fa9486e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A photograph of the Calakmul Mayan temple pyramid ruins in Campeche, Mexico"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>There are no pictures of the city but it had pyramid temples similar to this one in nearby Calakmul<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Valeriana has the “hallmarks of a capital city” and was second only in density of buildings to the spectacular Calakmul site, around 100km away (62 miles).<!-- --></p><p><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46374651">It is “hidden in plain sight”<!-- --></a>, the archaeologists say, as it is just 15 minutes hike from a major road near Xpujil where mostly Maya people now live.<!-- --></p><p>There are no known pictures of the lost city because “no-one has ever been there”, the researchers say, although local people may have suspected there were ruins under the mounds of earth.<!-- --></p><p>The city, which was about 16.6 sq km, had two major centres with large buildings around 2km (1.2 miles) apart, linked by dense houses and causeways. <!-- --></p><p>It has two plazas with temple pyramids, where Maya people would have worshipped, hidden treasures like jade masks and buried their dead.<!-- --></p><p>It also had a court where people would have played an ancient ball game.<!-- --></p><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241028-lost-cities-how-maya-ruins-have-withstood-the-test-of-time">How ancient Maya cities have withstood the ravages of time<!-- --></a></li></ul><p>There was also evidence of a reservoir, indicating that people used the landscape to support a large population.<!-- --></p><p>In total, Mr Auld-Thomas and Prof Canuto surveyed three different sites in the jungle.
