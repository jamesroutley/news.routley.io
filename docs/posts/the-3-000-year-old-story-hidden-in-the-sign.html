It&#39;s &#34;dog&#34; in Russian, &#34;strudel&#34; in Hebrew and &#34;monkey&#39;s tail&#34; in Dutch. The @ sign is a mirror, and its story goes back thousands of years.</b></p><p>In 2010, Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at New York&#39;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), made a bold choice. &#34;I wanted to have an exhibition of objects that shows everybody can have a museum-quality exhibition in their drawer. It includes the Post-it Note, M&amp;Ms, the paper clip, the OXO Good Grips [a popular series of kitchen tools], objects that are so embedded in our lives and work so well that we don&#39;t even notice them anymore,&#34; she says.</p><p>&#34;Part of what a museum does, especially when you isolate these objects, is to create distance and drama, and let people look at that with different eyes,&#34; Antonelli says. &#34;All of a sudden, you&#39;re stunned by the story that&#39;s behind them. You realise it&#39;s a whole universe.&#34; As she rounded out the exhibit, it felt like an obvious decision. Antonelli acquired the @ sign for MoMa&#39;s permanent collection.</p><p>Stop for a minute and gaze across the hills and valleys of your keyboard. If you set aside the symbols for currency, there is perhaps no character that holds more cultural weight than @. It&#39;s the plumbing of the internet. It ties your email together. It highlights your username in a wall of text. Chances are you used it today.</p><p>But &amp;, #, %, *, these are all useful and ubiquitous marks. How did the @ sign get its power? It may seem like a distinctly modern phenomenon, yet buried in the curls of this decorated little &#34;a&#34; is a story that goes back thousands of years, bridging national, cultural and linguistic barriers as it twisted its way across the pages of human history.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m4jr24.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/ Getty Images/ BBC Merchants in Renaissance Europe used @ to mark shipments of wine and grain (Credit: Serenity Strull/ Getty Images/ BBC)"/><span>Serenity Strull/ Getty Images/ BBC</span></p><figcaption>Merchants in Renaissance Europe used @ to mark shipments of wine and grain (Credit: Serenity Strull/ Getty Images/ BBC)</figcaption></figure><p>&#34;It&#39;s an abbreviation,&#34; says Keith Houston, author of the book Shady Characters: The Secret History of Punctuation. <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35744456">The only question</a> is what it originally stood for. One thing is clear: there&#39;s a connection to pottery.</p><p>The ancient Greeks were fond of a style of clay pot called an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/art/amphora-pottery">amphora</a>. You&#39;ve seen them – tall and shapely with two handles and a long neck. Amphoras were used to store wine, grains, olive oil and more, a practice that continued in the Mediterranean and beyond for centuries. As time went on, an amphora became a standard unit of measure.</p><p>&#34;Merchants had to communicate the idea that &#39;I&#39;m going to sell you a certain number of amphoras of something or other at a particular price&#39; quite a lot,&#34; Houston says. And eventually, people started drawing an &#34;a&#34; with a long tail wrapped around the it and skipping the rest of the letters.</p><p>On 4 May 1536, a merchant named Francesco Lapi wrote a letter going from Seville to Rome, where he said that an amphora of wine was worth around 70 or 80 ducats, <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Shady_Characters_The_Secret_Life_of_Punc.html?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ">using an @ for amphora</a>. That&#39;s the first example we&#39;ve found of @ used in the modern sense, but it&#39;s not the oldest copy of the symbol. You can find an @ <a target="_blank" href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.slav.2/0145">in the pages of 1375 Bulgarian manuscript</a>, but it has no discernable meaning – it&#39;s just a flourish on the first letter in the word &#34;amen&#34;.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><div><figcaption>Elephant&#39;s trunk? The story of the @ sign</figcaption></div><p>After hundreds of years, amphoras fell out of usage, but the @ stuck around as accountants and record keepers used it to denote how much things were selling for.</p><p>&#34;The root of this is in typewriters, which really spread in the United States, primarily, in the 19th Century,&#34; says Gerry Leonidas, a professor of typography at the University of Reading in the UK. In part, that&#39;s because of the explosion of mail order catalogues in the US, he says, which created massive administrative needs and eventually an entire class of professional typists.</p><p>&#34;The typewriter is essentially a way to minimise the risk of people&#39;s bad handwriting and increase the efficiency and predictability of office administration,&#34; Leonidas says. Typewriters were so complex and expensive that some early models didn&#39;t even have ones and zeros – you just typed the letters &#34;O&#34; and &#34;I&#34; instead – but by the late 1800s, <a target="_blank" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2011/08/the-symbol-part-2-of-2/">@ was important enough to include</a>. &#34;And because typewriters are tied into business and accounting processes, the @ survives across all different generations of typewriters, exactly because it fulfils this critical role.&#34;</p><p>When computers got keyboards, @ came with them. If you weren&#39;t an accountant, though, it wasn&#39;t particularly useful. That changed thanks to <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35741116">Ray Tomlinson</a>, a computer scientist working at Arpanet, the US government <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241028-the-failure-that-started-the-internet">project that laid the foundation for the internet</a>. He had the idea that people might want to send each other messages. As Tomlinson wrote out the code, he needed a way to indicate where a particular person sat in the network. Looking at the keyboard, there it was. He plucked @ out from the world of business jargon and stuck it in the middle of the address, and in 1971, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/03/102702118-05-01-acc.pdf">he sent the first email</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>As the internet burst out of the US and dominated human culture over the next half century, the @ rode with it. But as the symbol spread across the globe, a curious thing happened. <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20160307-how-do-you-say-in-other-languages">It started getting new names</a>.</p><p>Today, Italians call the @ sign &#34;<i id="chiocciola">chiocciola</i>&#34;, or &#34;snail&#34;. You can see the resemblance. In Hebrew it&#39;s sometimes &#34;strudel&#34;. In Czech it&#39;s &#34;<i id="zavináč">zavináč</i>&#34;, meaning &#34;rollmops&#34;, the name for pickled herring wrapped in a cylinder, usually around a savoury filling. Russians sometimes call it &#34;<i id="sobaka">sobaka</i>&#34;, meaning &#34;dog&#34;, and it does look like a pet curled up to sleep, at least if you squint. That&#39;s led to a long history of cutesy jokes. If you learn to speak Russian, and someone tells you &#34;write me at the doggy&#34;, you&#39;ll know what they mean.</p><p>&#34;These days everybody just calls it &#39;at&#39;. A lot of things have been anglicised over the last 25 years,&#34; says Nick Fransen, a freelance management consultant from Belgium, where you might grow up speaking Flemish (sometimes called Belgian Dutch), French or German, depending on where you live. &#34;But a few days ago, I was speaking to an older person who was very unanglicised, and I just reverted back to calling it &#39;<i id="apenstaartje">apenstaartje</i>&#39; without even thinking about it,&#34; he says. <i id="apenstaartje">Apenstaartje</i>, the traditional Dutch name for @, means &#34;monkey&#39;s tail&#34;.</p><p>It’s just &#34;at&#34; in English, though sometimes it&#39;s referred to as the &#34;commercial at&#34;, due to its business connection.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0m4jrjs.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/ Getty Images/ BBC The @ symbol forces us to create new identities: our usernames.

Somebody hands you a computer, and you look at it, and you describe what it looks like as opposed to looking up what the name is. In Greek we call it &#39;little duckling&#39;.&#34;</p><p>But just as Tomlinson adopted this curly symbol for his own work, the @ continues to be reinterpreted for other purposes. In Spain and Portugal, the word for @ is &#34;<i id="arroba">arroba</i>&#34;, a term related to amphora that is also a standard unit of weight and measure. But today, @ is sometimes used as a gender-neutral character in Spanish, in place of the letter &#34;O&#34; which is used for the masculine forms of words, and &#34;A&#34; which is used for the feminine. When writing the words for &#34;friends&#34;, you might type &#34;amig@s&#34; to be more inclusive.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s something very interesting about &#39;at&#39; though, which I think is unique. It&#39;s what happens after the symbol,&#34; Leonidas says.</p><p>When you write your name, you use capital letters and there&#39;s a space between your first and last name. &#34;The @ however, as a handle, forces both a unicase rendering of names and the complete elimination of any spaces,&#34; he says. &#34;We have to invent a unique, single word for ourselves. It forces us to think about how we present our identity.&#34;</p><p>Research demonstrates something you&#39;ve probably experienced: on some level, choosing a username can be an emotionally charged process. Typically, people don&#39;t just want their handles to be unique, <a target="_blank" href="https://jfml.org/article/download/20/version/32/49">people want them to feel right</a>, to represent them, to look and feel good and express something about their personality or identity. <a target="_blank" href="https://ans-names.pitt.edu/ans/article/view/2364">Usernames are harnessed to express who we are</a>, or to create and online persona separate from their real-world identity. Linguists who study online culture have found <a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/13/1/141/4583054">usernames are so tied to our sense of self</a> that changing them can be strangely intimate, almost like changing your name or your appearance offline.
