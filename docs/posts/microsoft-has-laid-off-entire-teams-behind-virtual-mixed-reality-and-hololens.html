<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-3">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>In the latest update in the massive Microsoft layoffs, we now have a better idea of how deep the cuts run in Microsoft&#39;s Mixed Reality team. </li><li>The team behind AltSpaceVR and also the Mixed Reality Tool Kit have been laid off in their entireties. </li><li>Potentially, these layoffs throw serious doubt on the future of HoloLens, which is currently struggling to retain its military contract with the U.S. government. </li></ul><hr/><p>The scale of the Microsoft layoffs keeps revealing itself through social media posts, as we get to grips with just how deep and broad Microsoft is looking to restructure. </p><p>This past week, Microsoft revealed its joining Amazon, Google, and others in laying off thousands of employees. The cuts reduces Microsoft&#39;s global workforce by 5%, which grew rapidly to take advantage of opportunities that were presented during the pandemic. With work-from-home culture ending, inflation spiraling, and Putin&#39;s war of aggression in Ukraine disrupting energy markets, Big Tech is scaling back to keep shareholders happy in a tough economic environment. </p><p>Microsoft is rearranging its bets for the future of the company as a result. Despite having <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-has-purchased-altspacevr-leading-virtual-reality-social-platform">acquired AltSpaceVR</a> back in 2017, Microsoft culled the entire team behind the virtual reality workspace project this past week. As a result, AltSpaceVR will shutter for good in March, effectively ending Microsoft&#39;s &#34;metaverse&#34; efforts with it. Supposedly, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/mesh-microsoft-teams-metaverse">Microsoft Mesh</a> will be AltSpaceVR&#39;s successor, but it remains to be seen just how serious the company is about the so-called &#34;metaverse,&#34; despite CEO Satya Nadella&#39;s buzzword-laden speeches on the topic at recent events. </p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have some sad news, Altspacers. #AltspaceVR is shutting down on March 10th. Though we hate saying goodbye, we also feel such pride and gratitude for all the magic that happened here. ✨Thanks for joining us on this epic adventure. #socialvr https://t.co/peCwpaaBl3<a href="https://twitter.com/AltspaceVR/status/1616491365793427457" data-url="https://twitter.com/AltspaceVR/status/1616491365793427457">January 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p><span role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></p></div><p>In addition to the death of AltSpaceVR, Microsoft has also culled the entire team behind the popular MRTK framework. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=wp-us-5947016083961213000&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fmixed-reality%2Fmrtk-unity%2Fmrtk3-overview%2F" data-url="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fmixed-reality%2Fmrtk-unity%2Fmrtk3-overview%2F" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="microsoft.com" data-merchant-id="1855" data-merchant-url="microsoft.com" data-merchant-network="LS">MRTK</a><span> (opens in new tab)</span> is Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Mixed Reality Took Kit,&#34; which is a cross-platform framework for spatial anchors in virtual reality spaces. MRTK was built for Unity VR integrations, and works with Meta&#39;s headsets with a focus on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/hololens">HoloLens</a>. </p><p>HoloLens has been scaled back already in recent years following the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/a-new-report-calls-out-alex-kipman-and-other-microsoft-execs-for-verbal-abuse-and-sexual-harassment">departure of its chief architect Alex Kipman</a>. Microsoft has been pursuing a HoloLens contract with the U.S. military, which was recently scaled back by the U.S. Congress, owing to reported problems with the program. </p><p>For Microsoft to cull the entire team behind MRTK, which was due to release a new version just next month, it paints a picture of a company that perhaps no longer believes in virtual reality. There are many who believe the &#34;metaverse&#34; represents the next big opportunity in human-computer interfacing, but even Facebook, who rebranded its entire company to Meta in the belief of this technology, is scaling back in this area as well — laying off 11,000 staff back in November. </p>
