        <p>There&#39;s nothing like laughing until your stomach hurts while playing a game with your friends and family — especially when it&#39;s a game where <em>you </em>make the rules.</p><p>Comedian <a href="http://eecunningham.com">Eric Cunningham</a> has always loved making up games. So much so, in fact, that he decided to turn it into a way of life, and one that now pays him to do it.</p><p>Cunningham was a writer for <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em> and <em>Holidays with the Houghs</em>, and is currently a writer for the first season of <em>The Kids Tonight Show </em>where he has created games for the tween hosts such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4id05feotzU"><em>Flip Your Sheet</em></a>. He describes himself as a &#34;grown up kid.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I did a show at [Upright Citizens Brigade] called <em>Night Late</em>, where we would take a different celebrity and give them their own late night talk show. And I just found myself, as we did different shows for different celebs, I would just always end up gravitating toward... stupid games,&#34; he says.</p><p>The seed of Cunningham&#39;s inventive nature, which eventually grew into a career in comedy and TV writing, came from his mom. When he was a kid, she would make up games for him and his two brothers, of which he had one particular favorite:</p><p>&#34;So me and my brother would get off the bus from elementary school, and when we would get to the house, it would just be a note taped to the front door and it would say, &#39;Find the Cookie.&#39; It was essentially a surprise scavenger hunt, treasure map type thing,&#34; he explains.</p><p>According to the fun aficionado himself, even if <em>you</em> don&#39;t have fun uncle or auntie energy, you too can create your own games. Here&#39;s how.</p><h3>Think of something specific in your life.</h3><p>Do you come from a family of amateur food critics? Why not try a taste test? Blindfold everyone and see if they can tell the difference between different colors of bell peppers or different brands of coffee.</p><p>For example, Cunningham and his brothers are big fans of the Olympics. So for the 2008 Beijing Games, they held their own &#34;Brolympics.&#34; &#34;We got up early. We lit the opening ceremony torch and did the whole thing,&#34; he says.</p><p>Cunningham explains the key to good game making is finding inspiration from real life events and experiences. &#34;Basically what you want to do when you&#39;re creating a game is to be aware of something that is already fun in your life and then kind of have that mindfulness to sort of pause and think, &#39;Oh, I just had some fun. Can I verbalize why that was fun?&#39;&#34; he says. &#34;Then you create the artificial version of that where you heighten all the fun elements in real life.&#34;</p><h3>Don&#39;t take it too seriously.</h3>

This can certainly lead to some silly results. Ugly but beloved ornaments or holiday shirts, anyone?</p><p>For his &#34;Brolympics,&#34; Cunningham says the fun came from their lack of athleticism. &#34;We&#39;re not athletes. At all,&#34; says the 37-year-old Cunningham, who admits he knows a little about all of the sports &#34;but not enough to actually play anything.&#34;</p><h3>&#34;Build a playground, not a cage.&#34;</h3><p>Be open to having few or no rules to your game, Cunningham also says. Maybe the first time you play, you&#39;ll notice loopholes in the rules that you want to change. And that&#39;s OK, too! Remember, half of the fun of inventing your own game is making things up as you go along.</p><p>&#34;Sports are, you know, there&#39;s a lot of rules and all this stuff, but when you build a playground, you just kind of set it up. I&#39;m not telling you how to use it, I am not forcing you to do it this specific way. It&#39;s just like, here it is. Have fun,&#34; he explains. &#34;The more rules you latch onto, the more it&#39;s sort of restrictive and you&#39;re not having fun.&#34;</p>

Here&#39;s How Parents Can Help</a></p><hr/><p>For the &#34;Brolympics,&#34; the Cunningham brothers made up 10 to 15 &#34;events.&#34; Things that were like hammer throwing or shot put. &#34;But in hammer throwing, we would literally throw a hammer,&#34; he says. (Uh, don&#39;t do this at home, kids!)</p><p>The more absurd, random aspects helped to make the games more memorable. Cunningham recalls that another one of the events was &#34;who can air guitar to the <em>Law &amp; Order</em> theme song the best. It was very dumb.&#34;</p><h3>Chaos is a team sport!</h3><p>Years later, Cunningham still cherishes his &#34;bronze&#34; medal — but more importantly, the three brothers had fun bonding and made lasting memories, and for Cunningham, that&#39;s one of the best parts of game making.</p><p>&#34;Play and games are things that human beings do automatically,&#34; he says. &#34;We&#39;re just kind of wired for it.&#34;</p><hr/><p><em>We&#39;d love to hear from you.
