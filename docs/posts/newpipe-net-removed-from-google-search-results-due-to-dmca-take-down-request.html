                <p>Dear NewPipe community and other beloved creatures,</p>

<p>You might have already noticed this: Searching “NewPipe” via Google will yield plenty information about the project, but a link to the official website is missing. This is because Google submitted to a DMCA takedown notice from a French record label, “Because Music”. The notice demands removing our homepage <a href="https://newpipe.net">newpipe.net</a> from their search listings along with a set of other domains completely unrelated to our project. The DMCA takedown notice was published <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34149383">in the Lumen database</a> by Google themselves.</p>

<p>While worse things could have happened as the result of such a takedown request, Google’s unlisting of our homepage creates a variety of problems. Given the fact that Google no longer counts visits to our site, it will lose relevance. As a result, websites for fake clones of NewPipe that mimic our homepage will tend to rank higher in the results. This could ultimately cause users to fall for such scams.</p>

<p>The team is currently discussing what to do about the situation. We are considering taking legal action. <strong>If you are a lawyer and have experience with this and would like to help us, please contact us via email (team(at)newpipe.net).</strong></p>

<p>Regards,
Schabi</p>
