    <h1>Ask HN: Are Linux HowTos dead? Why?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Somehow it just got me: Linux HowTos haven&#39;t been created or maybe even updated since ca. 2007.<p><a href="https://www.linuxhowtos.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linuxhowtos.org/</a></p><p>I haven&#39;t been using them for last 20 years... I still remember how useful they were in my early Linux days in 1999-2002. I will never forget the one about making coffee (<a href="http://fotis.home.cern.ch/fotis/Coffee.html" rel="nofollow">http://fotis.home.cern.ch/fotis/Coffee.html</a>). I made the relay circuit built into a power supply and that was so much fun!</p><p>But now they are all forgotten. Dead even. Why?</p></div></div>
