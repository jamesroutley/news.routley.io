    <h1>I&#39;m Done with Coding</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In my high school days, I was a huge server and networking person. My homelab was basically my identity, and not even a good one: consumer-level networking gear running Tomato and a then-7-year-old homebuilt desktop PC running FreeBSD.</p>



<p>Then I joined <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/">NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering</a> for Computer Science. It was a full 180 into software engineering. I didn’t just code for assignments, I started with <a href="https://github.com/neelchauhan/TorNova">toy</a> <a href="https://github.com/neelchauhan/OnionLauncher">projects</a> and went to <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/commits/main?author=Neel Chauhan">major Tor contributions</a> writing very complex patches, had two internships and ultimately a job at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Primarily due to “Big Data” experience at NYU CUSP, Microsoft placed me on the <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/insights">Viva Insights</a></em> team. I’ve always hated the product, feeling it was unnecessary surveillance. I wanted out.</p>



<p>In fact, the disdain of Viva Insights was big enough to make me lose passion for coding and get into obsessive browsing and shopping because facing the music of working on a surveillance product would bother me even more. Open source work outside of package maintenance went to zero.</p>



<p>I’ve tried to discuss this with my mom, and she kept telling me how “lucky” I am for working at Microsoft saying “it’s big tech” and “you’re neurodivergent” and “you won’t survive at a smaller company.” She even bought into the marketing material telling me how it’s “not surveillance.”</p>



<p>I’ve decided that in the shitty job market, it’s not worth being a software engineer even if I make much less. Part of it is being “specialized” in over-glorified surveillance so even if I change employers, what’s the guarantee I won’t be working on another surveillance product. Assuming I can even get another job.</p>



<p>In fact, I’ll just live off dividend income and try to get my new IT startup <a href="https://www.fourplex.net/">Fourplex</a> off the ground. Sure, I won’t be able to buy shiny homelab equipment as often as I did in the past, but I at least have the guarantee I’m not working on an unethical product.</p>



<p>While six figures is certainly <em>nice</em>, it’s only nice if it’s ethically done. I’d much rather flip burgers or bag groceries than work on surveillance for six figures. After all, Edward Snowden had a “stable” federal government job (not so stable now thanks to “DOGE”) and he gave it up to stand up for the right to privacy.</p>



<p>And I care more for my values than the name or salary. It’s not like I use Windows at home, I haven’t since 2012. I kept self-hosting email <em>despite</em> having worked at Microsoft 365 and <a href="https://bgp.he.net/dns/neelc.org">still do even now</a>. And I sacrificed job performance for my values of strong privacy.</p>



<p>Little did I know that my father (who was previously a big Big Data and AI advocate) would come out to hate Viva Insights. He says it’s “bullshit” and nobody uses it. Even when I worked at Microsoft I <em>never</em> used it. Not even once. It’s bloatware. Microsoft is 100% better off porting Office apps to Linux (despite me using a Mac now) or beefing up cybersecurity.</p>
