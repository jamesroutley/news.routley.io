    <h1>Tuple: Pair Programming Tool for macOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
        Developers deserve purpose-built tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, it&#39;s not terrible pairing with Zoom.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it wasn&#39;t built for the highly-interactive process of remote pairing;
        a world where you want mouse cursors for all participants and
        high-fidelity remote control (like Command+Tab support).
      </p>

      <p>
        With something like Slack Calls, not having remote control ought to be a
        deal-breaker. Dictating code to your pair token by token is a total
        antipattern. Google Meet has similar issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, if you’re going to type on a remote machine, the connection has
        to be low-latency. This is the sort of thing that generic screen
        sharing tools just don’t care much about.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we couldn&#39;t find a tool we loved, the three of us (<a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Robamaton">Joel</a>,
        and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerCDixon">Spencer</a>) quit our cushy dev jobs, started living off our savings, and dove into the problem
        full-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s been a ton of work, but we finally have something we&#39;ve always wanted: a fast,
        lightweight tool built for nitpicky developers like ourselves. One that sweats the details
        programmers care about like efficient CPU usage, no UI chrome, and a
        5K-quality video stream. A tool that fades into the background and
        lets you focus on being a great pair.
      </p>
      <p>We&#39;re proud of Tuple, and we hope you like it.</p>
      <p>Love,</p>
      <p>Ben, Joel, and Spencer</p>

        P.S. We&#39;re fully self-funded, have no intention of raising money or selling, and are
        sustainably profitable. We&#39;re in this for the long haul. :)
