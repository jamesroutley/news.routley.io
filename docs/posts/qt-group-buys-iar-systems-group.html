<p><span><span><span><span>The Offer, the information and documents relating to the Offer are not being made and have not been approved by an authorised person for the purposes of section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#34;<strong>FSMA</strong>&#34;).

<p><span><span><span><span>Statements in this stock exchange release relating to future status or circumstances, including statements regarding future performance, growth and other trend projections and the other benefits of the Offer, are forward-looking statements. These statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as &#34;anticipates&#34;, &#34;intends&#34;, &#34;expects&#34;, &#34;believes&#34;, or similar expressions. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to many factors, many of which are outside the control of Qt Group. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Qt Group has no obligation (and undertakes no such obligation) to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except for in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Information for shareholders in the United States</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Offer by The Qt Company described in this stock exchange release is not made by Qt Group and, as made by The Qt Company, is made for the issued and outstanding shares of IAR, a company incorporated under Swedish law, and is subject to Swedish disclosure and procedural requirements, which may be different from those of the United States. The Offer is made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#34;<strong>U.S. Exchange Act</strong>&#34;) and Regulation 14E thereunder, to the extent applicable and otherwise in compliance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Swedish law, including with respect to withdrawal rights, the Offer timetable, notices of extensions, announcements of results, settlement procedures (including as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered) and waivers of conditions, which may be different from requirements or customary practices in relation to U.S. domestic tender offers. The Qt Company&#39;s ability to waive the conditions to the Offer (both during and after the end of the acceptance period) and the shareholders&#39; ability to withdraw their acceptances, are not the same under a tender offer governed by Swedish law as under a tender offer governed by U.S. law. Holders of the shares in IAR domiciled in the United States (the &#34;<strong>U.S. Holders</strong>&#34;) are encouraged to consult with their own advisors regarding the Offer. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>IAR&#39;s financial statements and all financial information included herein, or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of companies in the United States or other companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Offer is made to the U.S. Holders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of IAR to whom an offer is made. Any information documents, including the offer document, are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to IAR&#39;s other shareholders. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Offer, which is subject to Swedish law, is being made to the U.S. Holders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws, and applicable exemptions thereunder. To the extent the Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws, those laws only apply to U.S. Holders and thus will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person. The U.S. Holders should consider that the price for the Offer is being paid in SEK and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>It may be difficult for IAR&#39;s shareholders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or U.S. state securities laws in connection with the Offer, since IAR and The Qt Company are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their respective officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. IAR&#39;s shareholders may not be able to sue IAR or The Qt Company or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel IAR or The Qt Company and/or their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To the extent permissible under applicable law and regulations and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, The Qt Company and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers&#39; affiliates (acting as agents for The Qt Company or its affiliates, as applicable) may from time to time and during the pendency of the Offer, and other than pursuant to the Offer, directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase shares of IAR, or any securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for such shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices, and information about such purchases will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. Holders of such information. In addition, the financial advisors to The Qt Company may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of IAR, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with the applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be announced in Swedish and in a non-binding English translation available to the U.S. Holders through relevant electronic media if, and to the extent, such announcement is required under applicable Swedish or U.S. law, rules or regulations. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Holder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither The Qt Company nor any of its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of the Offer. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>NEITHER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE OFFER, PASSED ANY COMMENTS UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE OFFER, PASSED ANY COMMENT UPON THE ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THIS STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE OR PASSED ANY COMMENT ON WHETHER THE CONTENT IN THIS STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE IS CORRECT OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE IN THE UNITED STATES.</span></span></span></span></p>
