    <h1>The Fulbright Program: Chock Full of Bright Ideas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One of the most memorable events in my career so far was being selected
as a host for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program">Fulbright Program</a>.
When <a href="https://emsimons.github.io/me">Emily (Simons)</a> approached me with her idea
of applying for this type of scholarship, I was already blown away by
her enthusiasm—but little did I imagine how immensely enriching her
visit to <a href="https://aidos.group">the lab</a> would turn out to be!</p>
<p>We initially discussed a project aligned with our shared interest in
healthcare topics; specifically, I proposed making Emily part of
a planned project with cardiologists, the aim being to study circulatory failure
via certain machine learning methods. The project fell through,
however, since our collaborators were unable to provide data due to
privacy concerns.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Hence, we pivoted, and I suggested a couple of
other projects that Emily might be interested in.</p>
<p>Having developed a taste for all things graphs and networks, it was only
a matter of time before Emily started contributing to our work on
<a href="https://apparent.topology.rocks">physician–patient referral networks</a>,
showing her skills in data science and visualization. Working together
with <a href="https://jeremy-wayland.me">Jeremy (Wayland)</a>, Emily quickly also got
enthralled by our efforts to better understand
datasets in graph learning. She and Jeremy thus joined a project that
<a href="https://www.coupette.io">Corinna (Coupette)</a> and I had been dreaming of
for some time. As an intrepid fellowship, we finally brought it to
fruition as our joint ICML 2025 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379"><em>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</em></a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This was already outstanding, but Emily did not stop there! Like a
breath of fresh air, she also started working on dissemination strategies for
our projects, improved our repositories, and helped revamp our website.
Watching her grow as a researcher, writer, and software
developer was truly awe-inspiring. And, from what I can
tell, the research stay was rewarding for her as well. New friends, new
colleagues, new experiences—these are things that cannot (and
should not) be easily quantified.</p>
<p>So <em>why</em> am I writing all of this? There are two reasons: First, Emily is
on the job market and I cannot sing her praises highly enough. Second,
this is a time of uncertainty; a time in which funding is cut, in
particular for programs that may not yield direct results. Are the
United States richer or better off because of our joint research projects? Probably not—or maybe not <em>yet</em>. Like any type of fundamental
research, our projects are but a small part of the grand and eternal
conversation that is science.</p>
<p>It is precisely for this reason that we must resist the urge to see
everything as a <em>commodity</em> or as a <em>fungible good</em>. The true value of
the Fulbright Program lies in connecting bright minds with others and
giving them new opportunities.
This brings about changes whose
beneficial consequences we cannot possibly fathom in the moment.
To misquote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius">Boethius</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it is because you don’t know the end and purpose of things that
you think these programs have no worth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the Fulbright Program, we all got to meet someone we would not
have met otherwise. Through the Fulbright Program, we created
connections that would not have happened otherwise. Through the
Fulbright Program, we have all been intellectually enriched. I hope
that the politicians responsible for these programs see them for what they
are, i.e., a <em>unique</em> opportunity to foster change, innovation, and
mutual understanding across cultural barriers. I, for one, would love to
support such a program. <strong>Let us not sell <em>tomorrow</em> in a feeble attempt
to save money <em>today</em>.</strong></p>
