    <h1>SEC&#39;s X Account Hacked, Bitcoin Spot ETFs Not yet Approved</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_96">
<div><p>According to the SEC chairman&#39;s statement, the post announcing the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs was made by the hacker who took over the SEC&#39;s official X account.</p>
<p>So currently Bitcoin Spot ETFs have not received official approval. On the other hand, the relevant confirmation post was deleted from the SEC&#39;s Twitter account.</p>


<p>Gensler said the following in the development he shared on his official X account:</p>
<p>“The SEC Twitter account was compromised and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of products traded on the spot Bitcoin exchange.”</p>

<p>*This is not investment advice.</p>
