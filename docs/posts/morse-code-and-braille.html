<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>CS50 Web:
<ul>
<li>Worked on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/projects/4/network/">CS50 Web Project 4: Network</a> (a little bit)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Worked on Python problems on Codewars</li>



<li>Read <em>Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview</em> (section 6)</li>



<li>Read <em>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em> by Charles Petzold</li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<blockquote>
<p>The key word here is <em>two. </em>Two types of blinks, two vowel sounds, two different anything, really, can with suitable combinations convey all types of information.</p>
<cite>Petzold</cite></blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Started reading <em>Code </em>by Charles Petzold, which has been on my reading list for a while. I like the way the book starts from the premise that code is a way to communicate. “A code is useful if it serves a purpose that no other code can,” Petzold writes. Morse code and Braille were created as a more convenient way to communicate than existing alternatives. Both are made up of binary elements—a dot or a dash for Morse code, a raised dot or flat dot for Braille.  From here, we’ll go on to see how code is used to store and communicate information in computers.</li>
