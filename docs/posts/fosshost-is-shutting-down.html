    <h1>Fosshost Is Shutting Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
        <h2>Fosshost to be considered EOL</h2>
        <p>At this time, Fosshost is deeply sorry to announce we are no longer able to continue offering our services.</p>
        <p>Due to circumstances outside of the control of the Fosshost volunteers, we are now in a situation where <a href="https://twitter.com/fosshostorg/status/1598510697524203521"><strong>we cannot guarantee our servers will stay online, and in fact expect them to go offline shortly.</strong></a>
        </p><p>Because of this, we strongly recommend all Fosshost tenants to <strong>backup their data immediately, and migrate elsewhere as soon as possible.</strong>
        </p><h2>Starting New</h2>
        <p>As Fosshost began showing signs of failure, former volunteers and others who care deeply about the sustainability of free software have begun building alternatives; new homes for projects who had previously relied on Fosshost.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://radixproject.org/">The Radix Project</a></h3>
        <blockquote>The Radix Project is committed to providing free-of-charge need-based hosting on request for your FLOSS/open source endeavors.</blockquote>
        <p>The Radix Project is one such initiative, founded in part by one of the original architects of Fosshost.</p>
