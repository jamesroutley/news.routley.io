    <h1>Camp that imprisoned 7000 Japanese Americans could become National Historic Site</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Guard towers with searchlights. Barbed wire stretching around the camp. Military jeeps that circled the perimeter. This is what survivors recall of Amache, the former incarceration camp in Granada, Colorado that imprisoned over 7,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>Saturday marks the 80th anniversary of <a data-vars-link-text="Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s Executive Order 9066" data-vars-click-url="axios.com/japanese-american-incarceration-anniversary" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.axios.com/axios.com/japanese-american-incarceration-anniversary" target="_blank">Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s Executive Order 9066</a> — which legalized the forced removal and mass incarceration of anyone with Japanese ancestry.
