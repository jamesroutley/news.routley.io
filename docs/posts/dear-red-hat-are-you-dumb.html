    <h1>Dear Red Hat: Are you dumb?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;ve had a busy week, so I didn&#39;t have time until today to read <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">this news</a> about Red Hat locking down RHEL sources behind a Red Hat subscription.</p>

<p>I repeat the title: <em>Red Hat, are you dumb?</em></p>

<p>When Red Hat decided to turn the community CentOS distribution into a leading-edge distro instead of basically &#34;Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but free&#34;, users like me were justifiably angered.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t contribute to CentOS or Red Hat development much, if at all. But I have, for <em>over a decade</em>, provided software and tools that were compatible with RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and sometimes other more exotic distros.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> test my stuff against CentOS Stream... or UBI... or Fedora. Those are <em>mostly</em> like RHEL. Or I <em>could</em> try linking a Red Hat Developer subscription to my test runners and build tools so I could use a licensed copy of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, because that would be required for... actually ensuring compatibility.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s dumb.</p>

<p>So at this point, I have to say: <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/12/09/centos-is-dead-long-live-centos/">fool me once</a>, Red Hatâ€”shame on you. Fool me <em>twice</em>?</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m determining whether I want to continue supporting just Fedora, or just dropping all support for RHEL and RHEL-like distributions on my open source projects. It&#39;s not worth the hassle if I&#39;m not even sure projects like Rocky or Alma Linux can fill in the gap left by CentOS&#39;s demise for users like me.</p>

<p>And no, please don&#39;t post &#34;but you can use your Red Hat Developer Subscription!&#34; I don&#39;t have to with Debian. Or Ubuntu. Or Arch. Or... you get the point.</p></div></div>
