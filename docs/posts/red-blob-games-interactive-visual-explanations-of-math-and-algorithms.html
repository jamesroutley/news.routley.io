       In addition to helping game developers with my articles, I love
       to talk to people working with games and interactive
       education. Mostly it's informal chats over lunch, but
       occasionally I'll work with someone for a longer period of
       time.

       <li><a href="http://www.root-1.com/">Root-1</a> was building
       educational games for learning language, starting with
       vocabulary, spelling, and grammar, using machine learning to
       adapt to each student's needs. They're in Fast Company's list of
       <a
       href="https://www.fastcompany.com/company/root-1">the
       world's 50 most innovative companies</a>, and tested their games
       in classrooms in several countries.  Storylines, Word Joust,
       Word Kung Fu, and XWords are available <a
       href="http://www.root-1.com/products/">on the web, Facebook,
       Chrome Web Store, and iOS</a>. I worked Root-1 from 2010 until
       their <a

       <li><a href="http://blog.wildshadow.com/">Wild Shadow Studios</a> was a 2-man indie game company building innovative multiplayer games. They created <a href="https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/">Realm of the Mad God</a>, a cooperative massively multiplayer action / role-playing game, with thousands of concurrent players, and group battles with up to 85 players. Visit the web site and start playing in the browser, with no signup, no account creation, no email registration, no credit card required. Realm of the Mad God has gotten positive reviews from sites such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/realm-of-the-mad-god">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/07/realm-of-the-mad-god/">Ars Technica</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/realm-of-the-mad-god/">Metacritic</a> (score: 82), was a finalist in the Independent Games Festival 2012, and was nominated for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231222/https://www.gdconlineawards.com/archive/gdcoa_3rd.html">Game Developers Choice Online Awards</a>. Wild Shadow Studios was acquired by Kabam in 2012. I worked with Wild Shadow Studios from 2007 to 2011.</li>

     --><section><h2 id="about"><span><a href="#about">About me</a></span><a href="#about">#</a></h2><p>I’ve been helping people make games since 1990. I wrote games earlier in life, with <a href="https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Solar_Realms_Elite">Solar Realms Elite</a><sup>[28]</sup> being the <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2013/02/13/solar-realms-elite-memories/">most well known</a><sup>[29]</sup>, then worked on an environmental simulation game called <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/blobcity/">BlobCity</a>, then took a break for over a decade. The recent rise of indie, mobile, tablet, social, and web games have made me interested in game development again. My current passion is using interactivity on the web for learning, especially computer science and math. I’ve started with game development because it’s a rich source of interesting problems that can be explained visually. With modern web browsers, we can use explanations that don’t follow the formats used in magazines, technical papers, and books. We can combine learning by reading, learning by watching, and <a href="https://explorabl.es/">learning by doing</a><sup>[30]</sup>.</p><p>I previously worked with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/company/root-1">Root-1</a><sup>[31]</sup> on educational games, Wild Shadow Studios on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/realm-of-the-mad-god/">Realm of the Mad God</a><sup>[32]</sup>, Peter Norvig on interactive diagrams for <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artifical Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a><sup>[33]</sup>, and Nonagon Games on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171206123134/https://www.achronicleofmisdeeds.com/">A Chronicle of Misdeeds</a><sup>[34]</sup>.</p><p>If you’re in the Silicon Valley area and want to chat in person, email me at <a href="mailto:redblobgames@gmail.com">redblobgames@gmail.com</a>. I’m especially interested in algorithms related to maps, procedural generation, and pathfinding, but love to chat about anything.</p><!--
