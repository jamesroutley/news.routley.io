    <h1>Comics I Loved in 2023</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>They’re in your films, your TV shows, your video games, and they are, always, <em>central</em>. To entire generations of children, the superhero is an entity of the screen, not the comics page. And the DM as it exists caters to a perpetual aging audience of insular die-hards, the Wednesday Warriors, and so no shock that it is not particularly an avenue wherein audience expands. You’ll never get all those normal people who loved watching Endgame to pick up your Iron Man #3s or what have you. These comics are at present are as relevant as Video Game Tie-Ins are. The ‘actual thing’ is the media now. Kids don’t care about monthly Spider-Man comics. They care about the Spider-Verse animated films and the Spider-Man video games by Insomniac. They’re happy to wait until the next one, they don’t need to pick up workman-like comics that cost too much for what little they offer. It’s just how it is.</p>



<p>That aside, I do mean it–comics were <em>real</em> good this year. Now, the Direct Market wasn’t, and neither were the Corporate IP comics, but again, we must never conflate those circuits with the actual artistic medium, which had some true gems this year.</p>



<h3><strong>Shubeik Lubeik by Deena Mohamed</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/y3ZNm2u.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is, to me, the undisputed comic of the year. Mohamed’s been serializing this saga in Egyptian comics for a while now. But it’s finally been translated into English and presented to us in a beautiful package. Set in an alternate history Cairo, Shubeik Lubeik/Your Wish Is My Command is a sci-fi character drama built around intricate character portraits set in a ‘post-colonial’ context, wherein we see people from a variety of backgrounds wrestle with life. It’s Black &amp; White comics, with deliberate uses of color when necessary, and it’s as formally audacious and bold as you’ll ever see, from its deployment of Charts as a tool for intricate personal emotional expression to ‘aesthetic break-ups’ and world-building. Mohamed uses everything and anything to express feeling in this book, and the contents themselves are rooted in an exploration of Class, Capitalism, Colonialism, and what it really means to wish and dream in a world that puts a price on such things.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/27Rhy1W.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I’ve recommended it to everyone and their mother at this point, but it still doesn’t feel enough. This is a book that’s worth every second spent on it, and if by the end, it leaves you with such impact that it feels impossible to forget. This is not only the best comic of this year, this is one of my favorite comics ever period. I adore the way Mohamed has chosen to translate the book from Arabic to English by drawing from Manga, wherein she chooses not to ‘flip’ the book but instead retain the original right-to-left reading experience. This is such a cool book, and I couldn’t be more glad it exists. A book about people in all their complexity and mess, written with such understanding, such compassion, as they live amidst the shadow of empire. </p>



<h3><strong>20th Century Men by Deniz Camp/Stipan Morian/Aditya Bidikar</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zLqw9kq.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Possibly the best Direct Market comic of the past 10 years? One of the best comics ever published in the Direct Market period? Both statements would be fitting and true. This one is another all-time favorite and even made my 2022 list. But it had its breathtaking final issue come out last year, and came out as a collected edition in 2023 as well. Reading this month-to-month was legitimately an experience I will never forget, and one of the greatest experiences with serialized comics I’ve ever had.</p>



<h3><strong>Rare Flavours by Ram V/Filipe Andrade</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://riteshbabudotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/rareflav3.jpg?w=2048" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://riteshbabu.net/2023/09/28/the-delight-of-rare-flavours/">I’ve already written about this at length before</a>. It’s probably the best Direct Market comic being published right now. This and 20thCM are the only two DM books/floppies I have on here. Set across all over India, Rare Flavours follows Rubin the Rakshas (a demon) and filmmaker Mo as they try to make a documentary on food. Imagine an immortal man-eating monster obsessed with cuisine and the naive young man who just wants to succeed as an artist following him around. That’s the book, as each issue centers around a specific Indian dish and its recipe–with said dish’s recipe being built into the actual sequential storytelling of the comic. Every single issue tells a complete human story of people Rubin and Mo come across, to whom a specific dish means a great deal. It’s a comic about food and people and culture–and how they’re rooted in the places they’re from. It’s a natural extension of Ram V’s work being so obsessed with psycho-geography.</p>



<p>But beyond that, it’s just as much a comic about cooking as art, as metaphor for artistry, and what that means. What is it to create vs consume? What is the way forward for an artist, amidst all the pitfalls one could perhaps fall into in our hyper-commercialized world that leads you astray? It’s a comic about cold spirits trying to rediscover the fire of life and the joy of existence, and also people get cooked and eaten. It’s unlike anything else out right now, and it’s the band behind The Many Deaths Of Laila Starr re-teaming to cook up something special.</p>



<p>After years of what feels like his tremendous talents being wasted on random superhero fare, it’s such a delight to see Filipe Andrade work on bangers like this that take full advantage of his skill set and push him forward. Andrade’s fluidity and range are on full display here and it makes for a magnificent read. Rare Flavours very much lives up to that title.</p>



<h3>Roaming by Jillian Tamaki/Mariko Tamaki</h3>



<figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1661975742i/62207006.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The long-awaited reunion of the Tamakis. The team that brought us modern classics like <em>This One Summer</em> is back yet again with what is, to me, their most mature work to date. Roaming centers on the relationships of three Canadian women as they visit New York city and are caught amidst the complex web of their own messy relationships. It’s set in that precipice of youth/adulthood and lets us roam with our three leads, as we get swept away in the grandeur of New York City.</p>



<p>No comic loves New York this year more than Roaming. It is a ode to the city the way only visitors could craft it, which is a distinct beast from the love of those who inhabit it every day. But more than anything, Roaming is a book about the gaps that shape human experience, whether it’s the gap between their Canadian homes or the American New York, or the gaps between the people themselves. There are always things about people we do not know, will never know, holes that will never be filled, yet we care anyway. We take a leap of faith, we try and connect, and we build bonds. At its heart, that’s where the book exists and sits–at the tumultuous, messy in-between spaces of human connection.</p>



<p>It’s a masterfully composed, breathtaking work you’ll want to pour over and re-read again and again, because Jillian Tamaki remains quite simply the best. What a gift.</p>



<h3>Monica by Daniel Clowes</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91RZ1p4IPXL.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A new Daniel Clowes is always an event. But particularly so when it’s a book as vivid as Monica. A lush character portrait constructed through a series of short-stories that feel in the vein of old school Warren Comics horror! How often do you see that? From playing around with type to cartooning the hell out of all manner of absurdity, there’s simply no one out there who’s doing it like Clowes still is. And what could just be a series of slick short-comics becomes a vivid illustration of a whole life lived, the communities it was bound to, the people it touched and didn’t touch, and what it all amounted to in the end. There are cults, conspiracies, monsters, and the whole thing is really striking dive into the way people break, and where that takes them. It feels human every step of the way, and the end result is a hauntingly real bit of cartooning.</p>



<p>There’s a scene at the very end of the book wherein the titular Monica finally learns something that she’s been after the entire book, and her reaction surprises her. But it surprises you, too, as the realizations she has about herself in light of her quest for answers really hits home. There’s one line in particular, which it feels like the entire book is building to, which made me go ‘Jesus’. And then the book goes on after it, and still finds a way to surprise you all over again.</p>



<p>It’s a strange, weird, cool comic that could only ever be what it is, and it’s a real pleasure to read another Clowes home run like this.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Mobilis: My Life With Captain Nemo by Juni Ba</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9142+m795ZL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I did not realize how much I needed this book until I actually got it. French writer Jules Verne’s ultimate construct of The Other, the fearsome Captain Nemo, is reinterpreted here by Senegalese French cartoonist Juni Ba. I’ve never been huge on Captain Nemo, particularly given how much he is a product of White imagination, even going into the efforts of Alan Moore/Kevin O’Neill’s League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen–a comic that has a real case for being The Ultimate Cracker Comic.</p>



<p>But seeing Juni Ba’s take on him here really gave me an appreciation for the possibilities with the good ol’ Captain. To start with, I adore the killer block of a beard Ba gives Nemo, which looks like it could be used as a murder weapon to kill. It’s a great, striking visual that I just adore, and makes for a sick silhouette. But besides that, Nemo as the brooding, complex, lonely, and depressed man trying to be a good mentor/parental figure to a little girl he finds named Arona. If you’ve ever enjoyed Doctor Who, particularly the older and meaner Peter Capaldi interpretation, this will work just fine for you. As a total mark for such a thing, seeing a fucked up South Indian explorer guy reckoning with his failures while trying to be better for this little brown girl he wants to help totally landed for me.</p>



<p>Ba is perhaps the best pulp artist of the moment, wherein he can walk the pulp terrain but decidedly avoid its Euro-centrism or Orientalist tendencies, with Djeliya being a perfect illustration of how he wielded the aesthetics for a decidedly West African context. He’s a confident artist at the height of his powers, and watching him take Verne’s anti-imperialist figure and try and make him relevant for <em>the now</em> in the 2020s was a thrill. Ba’s illustrations and usage of pulp storytelling never feels retro or throwback, and here he frames the Nemo story as a sci-fi apocalypse saga wherein it’s just two people and we explore their relationship. It’s a decidedly different approach and book from Ba. Djeliya was a sprawling epic that drew from West African oral storytelling, folklore, epics like The Epic Of Sundiata. Monkey Meat was a pulp sci-fi anthology about capitalism, colonialism, and the horrors of modern living that felt closer to, say, The Twilight Zone. Both are Big and are going for a wide scope with a massive cast of characters. But here in Mobilis, Ba cuts it all down to just two people, while retaining all the grandeur and scope you expect from his work.</p>



<p>The end result? A really beautiful reflection on failure, endurance, and legacy. It may not be as frenetic as Djeliya, or as openly experimental as Monkey Meat, but this feels like an evolution for Ba as a creator. He’s drilling down and doing character work here and refining his storytelling on that front, beyond just the sheer conceptual power and idea-storm one associates with his work. And building on his exploration of rapacious capitalist imperialism, this book feels like the natural extremity of the apocalypse after that. It plays Nemo against the climate collapse and the hubris of humankind that feels very now. Ba is unmissable in my book, and this latest voyage is no different.</p>



<h3><strong><strong><a href="https://erikapriceart.itch.io/">Disorder</a> by Erika Price</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3Yv0ocG.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is, without question, the best horror comic I read in the past year. And you know that means something because I am not at all a horror person. So for a horror comic to move me purely on the basis of being a horror comic primarily, that takes some doing. That takes some real effort and work. And every page of this feels like a real effort and work. You can feel on every page the pain-staking amounts of care and detail put into this. Erika Price might just be the most potent horror image-maker in Western comics right now. I know that feels strange to say about a visual form built around image-making, but seldom have I read horror comics in Western publishing that are filled with SO MANY memorable, striking images.</p>



<p>Disorder, which numbers at about 150-ish pages, is indie work in the truest sense of the word, and my god is it amazing. The body horror and surrealism that Price leans into with an unrestrained freedom and daring when it comes to composition? It is simply astonishing. It’s a book about the gnashing, gnawing horror of existing in a mortal coil, the primordial terror of feeling like your very existence is wrong in some way, and the crushing path to make yourself anew, even as the entire world stands against you. It feels like a scream from the soul, like a river of expression flowing out of the heart and onto the page, turned into ink. Every time I kept flipping through, I’d just go ‘holy shit, holy shit’, while transfixed. Every page is packed, and so carefully composed, and this is paced with such care too. </p>



<p>This is quite simply some of the most powerful comics I’ve read in the last little bit, and once I finished, I went ‘…I wanna go over it all again, there’s so much I’ve missed’, which is the best feeling. There are a lot of comics that feel ‘produced’, but this feels ‘crafted’, like truly put together by human hands, with a real personal quality that just resonates. Erika is just one of the most exciting talents we have now in comics, and I cannot wait to see what she does next. She’s brilliant, and I would love for more people to engage with her work and see it. Disorder, no matter how much I describe it, has to be experienced to be truly known. It’s that kind of book. It’s an aesthetic assault on the senses in the best possible way. Go out and <a href="https://erikapriceart.bigcartel.com/product/disorder-complete-edition">seek it</a>.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>River’s Edge by Kyoko Okazaki</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1FXzocqNjL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Okazaki’s teen drama is collected in this volume, and boy is it special. It swims in the naked cruelty, mess, and pain of those teenage years in a way that feels so visceral because of how tangible it feels. It’s soaked in a nihilism, as no one in the book is terribly good, and we’re watching very broken people make poor choice after poor choice. But amidst all the cruelty and disaster, there is a humanity in those gaps that holds the whole thing together. When all is said and done, you’ll go ‘jesus christ’, and it’s a book that will stick with you. </p>



<p>I was surprised by how the impact of this book kept bubbling up in me every time I thought of it, in ways I can’t quite say about other books I read this year and quite liked. It’s why it’s here. It definitely leaves an impact.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Blood Of The Virgin by Sammy Harkham</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XVs-BEzGL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The collected edition of Harkham’s long-running serial about a Jewish Iraqi immigrant in 1970’s America trying to make it in Hollywood! It’s been long-awaited, and goodness, what a triumph this is. I love a comic that knows the power of a well-timed title-drop and just revels in it. But I also love comics about art and artistry and the people trying to just make the damn things. And watching Seymour hustle around 70’s Hollywood while trying to balance the domesticity of being the father of a newborn child is a ton of fun. The standout though is Harkham’s spectacular cartooning, wherein his pages can boast at least 21 panels quite frequently just for the fun of it, and it totally fucking works.</p>



<p>There’s two chapters in here that will take your breath away–the first being a color chapter that interrupts the otherwise Black/White comic and is stellar, and then a silent chapter centered around one character that is executed with such confidence that it’s absurd. What use of form, what glorious cartooning power. This book swims in the chaotic turbulence that is 70’s Hollywood and movie-making, the wild party culture, and all the disastrous possibilities that suggests. It’s a riot, and it’s one of the most complete works you can pick up and read this year.</p>



<h3><strong><a href="https://www.olivia-stephens.com/#/darlin/">Darlin’ and her Other Names</a> by Olivia Stephens</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://riteshbabudotcom.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/89ce3-darlin_000_lettered.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You ever read a comic that isn’t done, but immediately know ‘Oh. This is special’? This is that. At about 88 pages, this first installment of the still serializing adult western werewolf period horror drama by Olivia Stephens is a banger. Illustrated in a evocative Black &amp; White palette, the whole thing is such a clear and loud display of aesthetic power. Stephens just lets you be immersed in her world of 1880’s America and it’s one of those comics wherein I was just lost in it. </p>



<p>Once you read enough comics and do so critically, your brain is always ‘on’ and judging and assessing composition, lettering choices, dialogue, all sorts of things. It’s rare that you read just like you did when you were a kid, with your brain just getting lost in things because the work is just that captivating. So when it does happen, I truly am glad and thrilled. It just takes you away. Getting to read with such purity is always a delight, and reading this saga of Marta, the mysterious werewolf on the run/hunt across the west in the shadows? I wanted more.</p>



<p>This is one of those books that you can see why it had to be done indie and serialized by Stephens herself rather than at some publisher. It’s an adult comic that’s a hard-sell for a lot of publishers in the markets. But it’s also one of those books wherein you read it and you know when it’s a 400-500 page tome at the end when it’s all said and done, it’s gonna be something absolutely magical to own. I need more. And I’m so glad we’re getting it. It’s a work of such lovely mood and atmosphere, and it’s one I hope to revisit as the next Part is worked upon.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Miles Davis and The Search For Sound by Dave Chisholm</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7159E4fj3NL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I’ve been a big fan of Chisholm’s music comics. He’s an actual real life musician and music teacher AND he’s a cartoonist who makes comics. That’s the kind of specialization crossover that lets you really harness some magical possibilities. And it shows in his work. There is perhaps no one else working in Western comics right now who has as acute a grasp on how to depict sound in comics. Chisholm’s numerous varied approaches to simulate sound in an artform that has none but signifiers for it, is always thrilling. But it feels like it reaches new heights and refinements here in Miles Davis.</p>



<p>It’s a project that exists due to the Miles Davis estate reading his biopic comic on Charlie Parker from a few years prior (Chasin’ The Bird!), and personally requesting Chisholm’s take on Miles. And while I did have fun with Chisholm’s Enter The Blue which followed his Parker bio, it was no Chasin’ The Bird. Miles Davis and The Search For The Sound feels like Chisholm back at his absolute best, and in fact breaking past it. He pulls on ideas, cues, and strands across his prior musical comics work and pushes them even further here, as the presentations of various instruments’ sounds, the visualizations of their combined melodies, the look of varying rhythms, just so much is put forth with such care. </p>



<p>And that’s on top of the general incredible compositions which radiate with such dynamism and energy that you’re always hooked in. The book is a visual treat and charts Miles’ long career through his pursuit and obsession with capturing a certain sound. And it’s just a grand ol’ time. I would very much like to see actual Black cartoonists and creative teams exploring the story of Miles Davis and other titans of his ilk, and this is decidedly not that. But I am glad this exists, and hope there’s room for even more takes, approaches, and crucially perspectives that explore some of the greatest artists to ever walk the earth.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Night Eaters: Her Little Reapers by Marjorie Liu/Sana Takeda</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YZ2sMGdjL._SL1483_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I respect Sana Takeda and Marjorie Liu for making an entire series of Graphic Novels about the most relatable experience possible:</p>



<p>“What is it like to have a total hardass Asian parent who can do anything and is kinda awesome but also toxic as hell and kills your soul?”</p>



<p>The second part of a trilogy, Night Eaters sees the creative team behind the unbeaten Monstress saga having fun in the OGN format for three years. Centered on the Asian-American family of The Tings, we follow Milly and Billy Ting as they try to make sense of the supernatural madness that wrecks their world, which their parents Ipo and Keon Ting seem to know all about but will say little about. The whole thing feels like what if you had an Asian-American equivalent of Dylan Dog or Martin Mystery, and it’s kind of a delight, with all of the sharp writing you’d expect from Liu and the pure aesthetic power of Takeda.</p>



<p>There’s a scene wherein the two leads are practically begging their mother to just talk to them and shed light on their familial history and background. And the mom just blows cigarette smoke in their faces. It’s a terrible thing to do. It’s callous. But also, she’s the coolest goddamn character in the book. She’s the kind of person who could beat down an army of a 1000 men and not break a sweat, but is just fundamentally incapable of hugging her children or saying ‘I love you’. It’s maddening to have a parent like that, but my god, it makes for great fiction to read!</p>



<p>The book picks up right from the first and leads right into the final one, and boy, I cannot wait for more of this. This is the kind of thing we need more of. Adult Genre OGNs that are serialized and sold as lovely collections with slick covers, from publishers like Abrams Comics. As ever, Liu/Takeda are the absolute forefront of Western comics and are killing it. I am thrilled to see them go at it and do this, and I cannot wait for them to get back and complete the marathon that is Monstress. I remain in awe of what they’ve accomplished together as a creative team. People often fawn over BKV/Fiona Staples or Ed Brubaker/Sean Philips. I feel no passion for either of those teams. This team though? Hell yeah. I will be there, always, no matter what. They are cooking.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>The Naked Tree by Keum Suk Gendry-Kim</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81O8azo4p4L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>An adaptation of the classic Korean Park Wan-Suh novel into comics, this is Keum Suk Gendry-Kim attempting a work of translation of forms. And the end-result is a really evocative work set across the 1950’s during The Korean War. We meet a whole cast of characters who’re struggling and trying to make do as best they can in the harsh times of war, exploitation, and misfortune. It’s a period wherein families are torn apart, people are lost, bombs fall without warning, and everything is uncertain, as the impact hits everyone. From the venomous presence of white American soldiers who take advantage of their power as well as their own currency’s to the demeaning conduct the people under heel have to take up just to survive and let their work thrive, it’s a portrait of growing up in a time and context nobody should ever have to.</p>



<p>Gendry-Kim tweaks the structure of the original novel, opting to start at the end and then move back to the start to explore how things rather than use the source’s linear approach. On top of that, she works in bits of the original real-life context that inspired the book itself into the work, making for a piece that feels like a genuinely novel way to experience the material.</p>



<p>There’s a pain and melancholy in this book that really sticks with me, as people yearn and long for that which they cannot have in the entire book, and it feels so earnest and resonant.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>In Limbo by Deb JJ Lee</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817sucnFM+L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is one of the annual memoir comics, as it feels like every year there’s at least one really solid comics memoir. And it really is a special debut, as Deb JJ Lee plunges the reader into the youth of a Korean-American feeling deeply detached and isolated, and struggling to make sense of their changing life through the High School period, as the specter of College just looms in the distance. It captures that period’s shattering of the self and crisis of identity, the absolute mess of confusion and isolation, from having to reckon with both oneself, one’s parents, and trying to navigate the complex dynamics of school and the tangle of relationships. It’s that first step up to adulthood and all the pitfalls that comes with, and we get to see what that entails for Deb. And it’s…not pretty. Mistakes are made. Regrets amass, and what you have is a rather sincere, honest self-reflection that doesn’t feel constructed to flatter its subject but express a messy truth and journey of trying to make sense of things.</p>



<p>Lee’s distinctive cartooning style and artistic background are really the standouts here, as their carefully textured work that really knows what to focus in on and what to cut for maximum impact lets the whole work sing. The book reads like an exorcism and I mean that in the best way possible. And I cannot wait to see what comes next from Lee after this, because their work and style are really sharp. I’d like to see where it heads next, following this.</p>



<h3><strong><strong><a href="https://magneticpressllc.gumroad.com/l/tkfhz?layout=profile">The Monkey King</a> by Chaiko</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81H08WzQh4L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I’m a big fan of The Monkey King. He’s inspired countless characters and ideas I grew up loving, and his story is one that’s full of so many fun ideas and visuals. So the prospect of Chinese artist Chaiko working on an adaptation of Journey To The West and chronicling The Monkey King’s journey was really exciting to me. Chaiko’s style is clean, sharp, and luxuriates in its tender details. It’s immediately recognizable and distinct, and its cartooning with such expressive sensibilities that it’s a right match. And the book delivers! While the book isn’t a complete adaptation of Journey To The West (despite ‘The Complete Odyssey’ being the subtitle), it covers a hefty chunk and does illustrate a character arc of one of the greatest literary characters we have.</p>



<p>The result is quite simply one of the most beautiful comics you can read this year, and a loving tribute to a cultural icon that feels appropriate. It’s slick action adventure comics that I’m glad to have. I do have a nitpick about the lettering, I wish they’d opted for a different font in this English edition. But that aside, I’m quite pleased with this and rejoice at its existence.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>DOGSRED by Satoru Noda</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/djWPvVD.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I love a good passion project. Satoru Noda, the famous mangaka behind Golden Kamuy, has forever wanted to make a Hockey manga. In fact, he started as a newbie with his first real comic series being an Ice Hockey sports drama titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supinamarada!">Supinamarada!</a> A mouthful, I know. But it got cancelled. And then he’d move onto become A Name with Golden Kamuy and receive much acclaim and success. And after having done so, I dig the fact that his first move was to use his clout to go ‘Actually, I’m uncancelling my cancelled Hockey saga. I’m gonna revamp it, reboot it, and relaunch it fresh all over again. I’m a better, smarter creator now, and I’ll do it right this time. I’ll make a Hockey saga they can’t cancel!’</p>



<p>A comic like Haikyuu that is rooted in that Slam Dunk template never gets to linger the way Slam Dunk did, and it’s very much a feature and flavor of older sports manga, and frankly that’s what DOGSRED feels evocative of. It feels like a sports manga pulled from the past but being published in the now, and not in a bad way. It gives it a different flavor and it aspires to a ‘classical’ sensibility that I’m enjoying right now. Noda’s really building something fun here and taking his sweet time to do it, and I dig that. There truly has not been a great Hockey manga, and I like that Noda’s gone all-in on changing that. He’s terrific, and I love reading his efforts here.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>The Unlikely Story Of Felix and Macabber</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811ict1foUL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is Juni Ba’s SECOND OGN this year, and frankly I do not know how the man does it. I hope he’s getting enough sleep and rest. Someone pleasure ensure he’s taking care. But beyond that, it’s also prolific comics letterer, designer, and critic Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou’s comics writing debut. It’s his first big longform comics work in published form. And to see a collaboration between Hass and Ba like this is a treat.</p>



<p>I wasn’t quite sure what to expect going into this from all the visuals, but I was not expecting a melancholic sports drama about an ex-wrestler and his tragic past and many failings and how that informs and shapes a young lad he meets? It’s unexpected, but quite welcome, I think. I had a ball reading this, and really, it feels like the other half of the same coin with Ba’s other book MOBILIS this year. Both this and Mobilis are about old failures reflecting on their lives and trying to pass on what little they can to younger generations and the future, so that they may fare better and survive.</p>



<p>From quirky experiments with lettering, as visual elements take the place of text in word-balloons to a lettering font style and compositional approach that puts the work squarely in the terrain of the kind of work Marie Enger does, the end result here is a delightful all-ages romp starring a grisly mean old man and an affable young lad.</p>



<h3><strong>Family Style: Memories Of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816hA6kQ+nL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Thien Pham, who most may know as Gene Yang’s collaborator, makes his solo cartoonist debut here. Family Style chronicles his family’s tumultuous journey from Vietnam to America and then the Phams’ life in the States all the way up to the present. It’s a memoir comic structured around food and specific food dishes and tastes, which is not just a superficial framing choice but has deep thematic resonance to the material at hand.</p>



<p>Pham’s work here is so deeply earnest and vulnerable that it’s hard not to be swept away by it. The opening chapters in particular, set on a boat, are filled with such power. Pham knows how to utilize space to have real impact and he has a real grasp of what to show and what not to show, as he puts you in the perilous perspective of a young boy in a storming sea with parents who are terrified, as pirates ransack and destroy what little they have. The choice of cutting to black in this book has more impact than most superhero action you might read this year. The gaps and absences hold power too, and it’s what Pham’s work very much understands, and the overall journey of the book feels like a self-discovery. It feels like a comic that needed to be made for Pham’s sake and to make sense of things for himself, rather than having it all worked out clearly from the start.</p>



<p>Also Gene Yang is an actual character in it, so hell yes.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Girl Juice by Benji Nate</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ZbwpMxv7L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Easily the funniest comic I’ve read all year. Benji Nate is a comedic genius and this book is just killer gag after gag. I’m a huge fan of Gag Comics. They’re criminally underappreciated in all spheres. And Nate really knows how to make a damn good one, as this book is packed to the brim with short 1-pagers, 2-pagers, 3-pagers, 4-pagers, and even longer gag short-stories, all centered around a group of women who room together. There’s Bunny, the central figure, and the epitome of No Thoughts, Head Empty, while the other three characters in the form of Ana, Sadie, and Tallulah try to deal with her shenanigans. It feels like a classical sitcom you’d see on Network TV, only it’s in comics form.</p>



<p>And it’s a blast. You can pace yourself and read how much ever of it you like, and then come back to it later and pick it back right up. It’s a riot. And it’s immensely re-readable in the great way all great gag work or sitcoms are. It’s just a fun time. You can watch foolishness unfold, as insanely stupid hi-jinks ensue and laugh your ass off. This is a joy.</p>

<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e-6KiQP4L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I’m a big fan of Ronald Wimberly. You tell me he’s got a new book out, and I will simply be there. Granted, this is not him drawing it himself, so it’s different. But still, even though it’s merely him writing, it’s still a new Wimberly. And it’s a biopic about Eugene Bullard, one of the world’s first Black combat aviators, who flew for France during World War I. Teaming up with Brahm Level, Wimberly brings us Now Let Me Fly. The work begins with Bullard as an older man working elevators in Madison Avenue, until he finds himself stuck in one with an ad-man in the offices and they get talking and he chronicles his life. The book charts the man from his boyhood in Columbus all the way to his time in England, Scotland, and crucially Paris, where all the action happens.</p>



<p>Level’s art is typical of this mode of biopic comic that you expect, and it doesn’t really have the compositional flair as, say, this year’s other point of comparison Miles Davis. But while it may not be as bold in its formal choices, it is a really well constructed character portrait that’s drawn well and the story being told is as thrilling as any great fictional adventure that could be conjured up–except it’s better because it’s real. This man was a boxer, a musician, a performer, he could kinda do it all. It’s amazing. Bullard’s story and life across continents is a hell of a thing, and you totally understand what drew Wimberly to a project exploring the psyche and life of such a man.</p>



<p>All in all, really solid work I had a good time with.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Ocean by Lucie Bryon</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696707783i/199312607.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Lucie Bryon follows up last year’s tremendous Thieves with another slam dunk here. At around 73 pages, OCEAN is a magnificently cartooned romp about two Time Traveling Agents who are stranded in 2000s France and become owners of a Barbershop (called OCEAN). The agents Toots and Boots are part of an agency that deals with correcting errors in Timelines–think Men In Black but instead of Aliens, they police Time. And now they’re stuck and just have to live out their time as regular people in this small society in France.</p>



<p>And it’s this ridiculously simple, silly premise that Bryon mines totally charming slice of life vignettes and moments out of. The whole thing is a nice, lovely character piece centering on two people who find joy and purpose and meaning in this silly pointless barbershop affair than they did in all their sci-fi lawkeeping business as genre warriors. And the point where it ends feels like it could either be an ending or a launchpad for a whole lot more of OCEAN comics. Either way, whether this was just a standalone bit of fun or a pilot presaging a whole lot more, I’m very down. It’s beautifully drawn and it’s such a breeze to read through. Bryon is one of the very best cartoonists we have at the moment, and I cannot wait to see what more we see from her next.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>The Infinity Particle by Wendy Xu</strong></strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1aX9W4DtlL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Set in the distant far future in an era of Post-Late Stage Capitalism and Post-The Age Of Billionaires, wherein humanity has somehow made it and people live on Mars, The Infinity Particle is a romance. Specifically it’s a romance about a human woman and an Artificial Intelligence, and like all such endeavors in this genre space, it asks pertinent questions about sentience, free will, and possessive, hubris-driven thinking of people.</p>



<p>The way I saw it was almost a sort of reversed look at a conceit like Astro Boy but from a decidedly more shoujo-romance driven angle. I don’t know if this makes sense to non-manga heads, but it does to me. Wendy Xu’s cartooning certainly draws from romance manga aestheticism particularly with the flushed lines and expressions of the leads, and it’s just an engaging character piece wherein two people find each other. Clem and Kye’s connection and relationship as two isolated people trying to find and reach for something, while affected by their own respective traumas, very much works. And as a kid who spent way too many years obsessively reading shoujo manga, let me tell you, this was definitely my jam. Especially given it has all manner of cute little A.I critters, with our female lead Clem even having her own little mascot pet partner SENA.</p>



<p>I always dig seeing what Xu’s come up with, and this one was no different.</p>



<h3>Parasocial by Alex de Campi/Erica Henderson</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LvraGTv+L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Imagine a washed up CW-star and his most obsessive Tumblr stan being stuck together after con-hell.</p>



<p>Sounds awkward and horrifying, yeah? But also kind of funny in that painful ‘oh god’ way, like a trainwreck you can’t look away from.</p>



<p>That’s Parasocial in a nutshell, and it owns. This is the finest outing I’ve read from the De Campi/Henderson team, and it just works because it’s like a perfect gag that never runs longer or shorter than it needs to. It’s just right. Any longer, and it may have worn off, and any shorter and it may have felt a bit unsatisfying. But as it is, it feels pretty appropriate, and is a total riot. I laughed all the way through this book, and it’s a dark comedy that very much works. It’s all the awkwardness, discomfort, and pain of parasocial encounters turned up to 11, with Henderson coloring her own work and doing some really fun stuff with color. And De Campi really just knows how to letter to enhance and sing with Henderson’s pages here. I was flipping through it, planning to read it later on, but I just got caught up in it and binged it in one-go and finished it.</p>



<p>It’s an easy read, a quick read, and it’s gonna make you laugh.</p>



<h3><a href="https://averyhill.gumroad.com/l/dymlh?layout=profile">The Hard Switch</a> by Owen D. Pomery</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81anEx2BRJL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I adore Pomery’s work. His diorama worlds of precision engineering and intricate detail, his tangible designs that feel so worked out they feel like depictions of archaeology than fiction, and his people who live amidst those settings. This is very much set against the backdrop of a humanity running out on its precious resources, as an uncertain future looks ahead, with no one having a clue as to what they’ll do. But amidst that, as Alcanite runs out, there are Extractors, who scavenge for what little remnants they can at the twilight of this age of space-travel.</p>



<p>What follows then is a quest into the unknown, a faint possibility of hope, a potential alternative and pathway to the future, all played against the context of the bottomless exploitative greed of rich billionaires and their militaristic goons, with entire corrupt systems dancing to their beat. It feels quite now, and it’s what I find to be quite quintessentially Pomery. His work feels like what if Gerry Anderson emerged now and instead of making Thunderbirds or Captain Scarlet, he just made slick architectural sci-fi comics instead. It doesn’t feel retro or throwback, the whole thing feels NOW, and there is that Anderson-esque ‘This is a real set somebody designed’ quality to it, which is always a joy.</p>



<p>I do wish Pomery would reconsider the approach on the lettering for this book, as the rigid straight tails with the digital lettering sit strangely on the page. They feel far too ‘pasted on’, rather than ‘integrated’ into the artwork itself. A simpler curved line instead of a traditional tail might frankly work better, I think, to better express the fluidity of conversation and its flows and the general humanity of the people he draws. Pomery’s work is at its best when it balances his pristine dioramas against the fluid people that inhabit it. But even still, despite that nitpick, I had a blast with this. It ends a bit too abruptly than I’d like, but I assume there’s more coming perhaps. We’ll see, I suppose. Either way, though it may not be a complete work in the way that, say, Blood Of The Virgin is, a new Pomery is always worth the time in my book. Good stuff.</p>



<h3>Bea Wolf by Zach Weinersmith and Boulet</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91R7oSwPo3L._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Boulet is an incredible artist. Now pair him together with Zach Weinersmith for a reworking of the epic Beowolf except for young children. And it’s written in a way as to evoke the sensibility of the poem, which results in a strange, silly, and outrageous book. This is less a typical comic and more so a picture book, but the sheer mad energy it runs on, alongside Boulet’s expressive and dynamic artistry make for a special combo that I had a lot of fun with. It’s the kind of book you sit and read with a kid, and it’s a laugh for both you and the child.</p>



<p>Boulet draws the world of Beowolf with the same gleeful absurdity and outrageous quality that covers Lemony Snicket’s work, which is perhaps why it’s appropriate that there’s a Snicket quote on the book recommending it. In any case, if you love sick comics art, this one’s a treat.</p>



<h3>Hungry Ghost by Victoria Ying</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/918ExqCqViL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Content Warning on this one–this is expressly all about eating disorders. So know that going in. If you can deal with that, what you have is a book about a relationship between a Taiwanese-American woman and her mother. The poisonous idea of thinness and ‘watch what you eat’ reprimanding from the mother becomes such a debilitating horror in the life of Val that she develops a really unhealthy eating disorder. And the entire book is how she does her best to hide it and pretends to be ‘normal’ and acts like nothing is wrong, while obsessing over her own body and its inadequacies in a society that constantly drills into your head certain horribly awful and narrow ideas of beauty and health. It’s a charade that can only be maintained for so long, and when a line is crossed and things explode, there’s consequences.</p>



<p>Victoria Ying is very much working through a lot of stuff here and this is personal work that really is affecting by the end.</p>



<h3><a href="https://claystorks.itch.io/the-second-safest-mountain">The Second Safest Mountain</a> by Otava Heikkilä</h3>



<figure><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjEzNzU3Mi8xMjYwMjQzNS5qcGc=/original/2Y7LuV.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A 100-page visual feast, this is a book centered around a group of nuns on a mountain who pray and serve a sacred deity that’s rather akin to a malevolent monster. He is their god and father and lord, and to his whims and pleasure they serve. But they must not descend down into the world below or leave their station. But of course, there are always those who do not listen, and thus unfolds the story of what happens when such doctrine is not obeyed, and what the lives of those beneath are really like.  Otava Heikkilä’s work here is so driven by the power of imagery and is so immensely rereadable that I was really charmed when I burned through it. It’s a cool, short piece of work that I really enjoyed for its aesthetic quality alone.</p>



<h3>Akane Banashi</h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pr6Tz06.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The physical Weekly Shounen Jump magazine has felt really stale in the past few years to me. With the exception of One Piece and the recently concluded Chainsaw Man, it’s kind of been dire. Particularly given I have no positive things to say about the likes of My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen, or Demon Slayer. I have dug bits and pieces of Sakamoto Days (great action artwork), Kaiju #8 (again, artwork is the strongest part), but by and large, it kinda feels lacking. There’s fun gag series in the form of High School Family and Me &amp; Roboco, which can be a laugh. And Blue Box is charming and inoffensive. But there’s no real ‘holy shit’ book there–with one notable exception.</p>



<h2>—</h2>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xE32NwM.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now, these aren’t comics I loved, especially given they’re quite early into their arrivals. But I have loved their artwork, which I think is point blank some of the best being published right now in the direct market. On the left, you have PETROL HEAD, wherein Pye Parr is just cooking up the sickest looking vehicular mayhem every month. On the right, you have SOMNA, where two heavy weights of the Direct Market comics art in the form of Becky Cloonan and Tula Lotay team up to deliver what is one of the most gorgeous pieces of single issue comics you could conjure up.</p>



<h2>Comics I Couldn’t Get To</h2>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6sMKUrs.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Despite my extensive list above, there were comics I just could not get to in 2023, though I really wanted to. They were on my to-do list but I never made it. Always happens every year, there’s just too many cool comics to read. But I still wanted to list the big ones from there here, because I think they are worth doing so, and also because I do really hope to get around to them in 2024. </p>



<h2>The Oddball: <a href="https://uncivilizedbooks.com/the-sickness-01/">The Sickness</a> by Lonnie Nadler/Jenna Cha</h2>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91wddw8I-FL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now, this is a strange one. I like all the creators involved here. But this didn’t click for me. The Sickness is a 13-issue Black &amp; White comic, and a big sprawling horror drama at that, which very much aspires to tap into that Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell FROM HELL sensibility as well as a bit of the Moore/Burrows Providence. It resolutely rejects and has no interest in doing the IP-brain stuff that so much of the Direct Market and mainstream comics is crowded with.</p>



<h2>Comics I’m Looking Forward To In 2024</h2>



<p>Now, having reflected somewhat on 2023’s comics, I’d like to take a look ahead at some stuff I’m excited for in 2024, as we move forward into the year itself. This is not a comprehensive list, but it’s kind of the big hitters that occur to me off the top of my head:</p>



<h3>Lunar New Year Love Story by Gene Yang and Leuyen Pham</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91cGJYyT3WL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>New Gene Yang baby! And it’s with Leuyen Pham to boot! And it’s a love story/romance from a glance! I am down! I am there, day one! Need I say more really?</p>



<h3>Dawnrunner by Ram V/Evan Cagle/Aditya Bidikar/Dave Stewart</h3>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UshrJI2.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It’s a Ram V/Evan Cagle comic featuring mechas and kaijus, with Aditya Bidikar lettering and Dave Stewart on colors. Hell yes I am on-board. After enduring a tsunami of endless white guy western comics about mechas and kaijus, I am ready to see a take on this landscape that has some actual goddamn juice and a capacity to be more than just empty calories I forget about.</p>



<h3>Man’s Best by Pornsak Pichetshote/Jesse Lonergan</h3>



<figure><img src="https://www.boom-studios.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MansBest_001_Cover_A_Main_Promo-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Jesse Lonergan is simply one of the most exciting cartoonists of our times. Pornsak Pichetshote is one of the finest comics writers and editors of our time. Put those two together in a book that reminds you of We3 at first glance (Pichetshote’s Vertigo pedigree as an editor should come to mind), with Jeff Powell joining on to letter and design it like the rest of Pichetshote’s creator-owned work? You bet I’m into it. I’m looking forward to seeing what this entails.</p>



<h3>The Gulf by Adam de Souza</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PZjo8-3UL._SL1500_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I really love De Souza’s cartooning, and his Blind Alley is a favorite. I always get a kick out of seeing his work. And so the fact that he has an OGN out this year means I am thrilled. I’m quite excited to sit down with this book!</p>



<h3>Return To Eden by Paco Roca</h3>



<figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+DJ1-eQ9L._SL1200_.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Paco Roca’s new releases are always an event for me. Every time his work comes out in English, I pay attention and try to pick it up. Whether it’s his period piece drama about Comics freelancers and creator’s rights, or a legal procedural about lost treasures, he’s rarely disappointed me. So the fact that he has a new book out in Return To Eden means I’m a happy camper. I gotta get my hands on this bad boy.</p>
