On March 7, 2003, a struggling company called The SCO Group <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/24747/">filed a lawsuit against IBM</a>, claiming that the
success of Linux was the result of a theft of SCO&#39;s technology.  Two
decades later, it is easy to look back on that incident as a somewhat
humorous side-story in the development of Linux.  At the time, though, it
shook our community to its foundations.  It is hard to overestimate how
much the community we find ourselves in now was shaped by a ridiculous
lawsuit 20 years ago.
</p><p>
SCO <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/25143/">claimed</a> to be the owner of the Unix
operating system which, it said, was the power behind the &#34;global
technology economy&#34;; the company sold a proprietary Unix system that ran on
x86 hardware.  By that point, of course, the heyday of proprietary Unix was
already well in the past, and SCO&#39;s offerings were not doing particularly
well.  The reason for that, SCO reasoned, was the growth of Linux — which
was true to a point, though Windows had been pushing a lot of Unix systems
aside for years.  But Linux, SCO said, couldn&#39;t possibly have reached a
point where it threatened Unix on its own:
</p><blockquote>
	Prior to IBM&#39;s involvement, Linux was the software equivalent of a
	bicycle. UNIX was the software equivalent of a luxury car. To make
	Linux of necessary quality for use by enterprise customers, it must
	be re-designed so that Linux also becomes the software equivalent
	of a luxury car. This re-design is not technologically feasible or
	even possible at the enterprise level without (1) a high degree of
	design coordination, (2) access to expensive and sophisticated
	design and testing equipment; (3) access to UNIX code, methods and
	concepts; (4) UNIX architectural experience; and (5) a very
	significant financial investment.
</blockquote>
<p>
It was the claim of access to Unix code that was the most threatening
allegation for the Linux community.  SCO made it clear that, in its
opinion, Linux was stolen property: &#34;<q>It is not possible for Linux to
rapidly reach UNIX performance standards for complete enterprise
functionality without the misappropriation of UNIX code, methods or
concepts</q>&#34;.  To rectify this &#34;misappropriation&#34;, SCO was asking for a
judgment of at least $1 billion, later increased to $5 billion.
As the suit dragged on, SCO also started suing Linux users as it tried to
collect a tax for use of the system.
</p><h4>Send in the clowns</h4>
<p>
Though this has never been proven, it was widely assumed at the time that
SCO&#39;s real objective was to prod IBM into acquiring the company.  That
would have solved SCO&#39;s ongoing business problems and IBM, for rather less
than the amount demanded in court, could have made an annoying problem go
away and also lay claim to the ownership of Unix — and, thus, Linux.  To
SCO&#39;s management, it may well have seemed like a good idea at the time.
</p><p>
IBM, though, refused to play that game; the company had invested heavily
into Linux in its early days and was uninterested in allowing any sort of
intellectual-property taint to attach to that effort.  So the company,
instead, directed its not inconsiderable legal resources to squashing this
attack.  But notably, so did the development community as a whole, as did
much of the rest of the technology industry.
</p><p>
Over the course of the following years — far too many years — SCO&#39;s case
fell to pieces.  The &#34;misappropriated&#34; technology wasn&#39;t there.  Due to
what must be one of the worst-written contracts in technology-industry
history, it <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/381136/">turned out</a> that SCO didn&#39;t even
own the Unix copyrights it was suing over.  The level of buffoonery was
high from the beginning and got worse; the company lost at every turn and
eventually collapsed into bankruptcy.
</p><p>
At a talk some years ago, your editor got a good laugh by saying that, in
the SCO case, we had the good luck to be sued by idiots.  SCO created a
great deal of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the industry, but a smarter
attack could have been a lot worse.  Even as it was, this was a period when
SCO was making waves by threatening to sue any company using Linux — at a
time when our foothold was rather less well established than it is now.
Microsoft, which had not yet learned to love Linux, funded SCO and loudly
bought licenses from the company.  Magazines like Forbes were <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2003/06/18/cz_dl_0618linux.html?sh=1b9469654dde">warning</a>
the &#34;<q>Linux-loving crunchies in the open-source movement</q>&#34; that they
&#34;<q>should wake up</q>&#34;.  SCO was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/08/05/sco_ready_to_clean_out/">suggesting</a>
a license fee of $1,399 — per-CPU — to run Linux.
</p><p>
All of this was a campaign to create a maximal level of fear around Linux
and, as a result, to put pressure on IBM to settle.  It certainly succeeded
to an extent.  Such an effort, in less incompetent hands, could easily have
damaged Linux badly.  As it went, SCO, despite its best efforts, instead
succeeded in <i>improving</i> the position of Linux — in development,
legal, and economic terms — considerably.
</p><h4>The enduring effects</h4>
<p>
Consider the charge of directly-copied source code — one that SCO CEO Darl
McBride <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030628172006/http://news.com.com/2100-1016-999371.html">loudly
made</a> in May of that year.  At the time, there was not a lot of
oversight applied to code going into the kernel; the project had only just
begun using BitKeeper as its first version-control system, after all, and
the maintainer hierarchy that has served the project so well was in its
infancy.  It seemed almost inevitable that, among the millions of lines of
code poured into the kernel from an unknown number of sources, some would
be found to have been copied from Unix; source for various Unix
distributions was not hard to come by in those days.  Richard Stallman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810103852/http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2914132,00.html">allowed</a>
that: &#34;<q>In a community of over half a million developers, we can hardly
expect that there will never be plagiarism</q>&#34;.  The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/32524/">real question</a> seemed be just how bad the damage
would turn out to be.
</p><p>

The world waited for McBride to actually show all this copied code —
sometimes said to be &#34;millions of lines&#34; — that he had found.  The actual
code <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/45019/">turned out</a> to be a snippet in the ia64
architecture subsystem.  It undoubtedly <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/45801/">shouldn&#39;t
have been there</a>; interestingly, it had already been removed by the time
SCO fingered it.  Beyond that, SCO&#39;s claims touched on code —
read-copy-update and the Berkeley packet filter, for example — that could
not possibly have come from anything it owned.  When SCO was asked to put
up its evidence, all that came out was a bunch of handwaving.
</p><p>
The important part is this, though: SCO&#39;s efforts and those it inspired put
the Linux kernel code under the sort of microscope that few projects ever
see.  There were allegedly billions of dollars at stake, after all.  But
despite that incentive and all of the resources poured into inspecting the
kernel source, nobody ever found all that copied code; it simply did not
exist.  SCO managed to prove the cleanliness of the kernel&#39;s pedigree in a
far more convincing way than anybody else could have.  Nobody now questions
the legitimacy of the kernel&#39;s source code.
</p><p>
Another thing that is no longer questioned is the need for the
free-software community to have lawyers on its side.  It is not enough
to be right; we have to be able to prove that we are right and deter
potential attackers.  The SCO lawsuit brought about a substantial increase
in the legal resources available to the community, both within companies
and in projects and related organizations.  Anybody who hopes to extract
rents from the free-software community now will face a strong, united, and
capable defense.
</p><p>
A related change is the improved procedures that the community has adopted;
just because SCO proved that the kernel&#39;s code was clean doesn&#39;t mean it
will always be.  The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/86436/">adoption</a> of the
developer&#39;s certificate of origin for kernel code is one obvious example;
its purpose was to avoid the next SCO case.  As Linus Torvalds said at the
time: 
</p><blockquote>
	People have been pretty good (understatement of the year) at
	debunking those claims, but the fact is that part of that debunking
	involved searching kernel mailing list archives from 1992 etc. Not
	much fun.
<p>
	For example, in the case of &#34;ctype.h&#34;, what made it so clear that
	it was original work was the horrible bugs it contained originally,
	and since we obviously don&#39;t do bugs any more (right?), we should
	probably plan on having other ways to document the origin of the
	code.
</p><p>
	So, to avoid these kinds of issues ten years from now, I&#39;m
	suggesting that we put in more of a process to explicitly document
	not only where a patch comes from (which we do actually already
	document pretty well in the changelogs), but the path it came
	through.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Many other projects have adopted similar procedures, most of which have the
happy result of documenting the provenance of code without imposing heavy
bureaucracy on the process.  Efforts like <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a> are also partially motivated by the
desire to avoid another SCO.
</p><h4>Long live the long-hair smellies</h4>
<p>
Perhaps the most significant outcome of this whole episode, though, is what
it revealed about our community.  If SCO wanted to scare developers and
users into fleeing Linux, it certainly failed.  While IBM waged a
devastating campaign in the courts, it often seemed like many of the
battles were won in the wider community; it turns out that, when thousands
of developers and users join a fight against a common enemy, they can do
amazing things.
</p><p>
Developers from across the community (occasionally referred to within SCO
as the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/147033/">&#34;long-hair smellies&#34;</a>) put their
time into debunking SCO&#39;s code-ownership claims, to great effect.
Resources like <a href="http://groklaw.net/">Groklaw</a> marshaled
information for the defense and, just as importantly, informed the
community about what was at stake and how the system works.  Encouraged by
this work, users stuck with Linux and refused to pay SCO&#39;s licensing
demands. It was not just IBM&#39;s lawyers and money that won this fight; it
was a widespread community that had built something special and had no
intention of letting a failing company steal it.
</p><p>
Twenty years later, it is fair to say that Linux is doing a little better
than The SCO Group.  Its swaggering leader, who thought to make his fortune
by taxing Linux, <a href="https://unicourt.com/case/pc-bk5-darl-charles-mcbride-1290201">filed
for personal bankruptcy</a> in 2020.  We survived a focused and determined
attack that would have brought an end to many other enterprises, regardless
of the injustice involved.  But the SCO attack should never be forgotten,
because of the ways that it changed our community, but also because,
despite our much stronger position now, it could happen again.  The Linux
community has created a vast amount of wealth, whether measured in code or
in actual money; when that happens, there will always be those who wish to
steal some of that wealth.  Hopefully we will be as lucky when the time
comes to fend off the next one.<br clear="all"/></p>
