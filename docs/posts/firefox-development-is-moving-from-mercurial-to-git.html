This dual SCM requirement places a significant burden on teams which</p><p>are already stretched thin in parts. We have made the decision to move Firefox</p><p>development to Git.</p><p>- We will continue to use Bugzilla, moz-phab, Phabricator, and Lando</p><p>- Although we&#39;ll be hosting the repository on GitHub, our contribution workflow</p><p>  will remain unchanged and we will not be accepting Pull Requests at this time</p><p>- We&#39;re still working through the planning stages, but we&#39;re expecting at least</p><p>  six months before the migration begins</p><p>APPROACH</p><p>In order to deliver gains into the hands of our engineers as early as possible,</p><p>the work will be split into two components: developer-facing first, followed by</p><p>piecemeal migration of backend infrastructure.</p><p>Phase One - Developer Facing</p><p>    We&#39;ll switch the primary repository from Mercurial to Git, at the same time</p><p>    removing support for Mercurial on developers&#39; workstations.  At this point</p><p>    you&#39;ll need to use Git locally, and will continue to use moz-phab to submit</p><p>    patches for review.</p><p>    All changes will land on the Git repository, which will be unidirectionally</p><p>    synchronised into our existing Mercurial infrastructure.</p><p>Phase Two - Infrastructure</p><p>    Respective teams will work on migrating infrastructure that sits atop</p><p>    Mercurial to Git.  This will happen in an incremental manner rather than</p><p>    all at once.</p><p>    By the end of this phase we will have completely removed support of</p><p>    Mercurial from our infrastructure.</p><div>
