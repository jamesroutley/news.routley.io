    <h1>Orion ‚Äì From idea to launch in 45 days</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Last month we released <a href="https://orion.tube" rel="noreferrer">Orion</a>, a small app that turns your iPad into an HDMI monitor. This was certainly a big departure from our usual practice of making camera apps, so I wanted to take a moment to show the &#39;why&#39; ‚Äî¬†and, after that, the &#39;how&#39;: our process of making it from thought to launch.</p><p>This is a dive into the conception, design, and development of Orion, a showcase of the fun one can have while making an app, and a look at the way a simple utility can be infused with funky retro charm.</p><h3 id="the-pitch-and-the-product">The Pitch and the Product</h3><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Apple-TV@1x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Apple-TV@1x.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Apple-TV@1x.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Apple-TV@1x.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Apple-TV@1x.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This summer, Apple announced iPadOS 17 would support UVC, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class" rel="noreferrer">USB Video Class</a> devices (basically:&#34;webcams&#34;). This could be compelling to us, so we researched adding support to <a href="https://halide.cam" rel="noreferrer">Halide</a>. After all, how cool would it be to have Halide&#39;s interface for your digital camera?</p><p>After some quick research, we found it didn&#39;t really work quite like we had hoped. However, our experiments uncovered that those inexpensive USB-C &#34;capture cards&#34; you find on Amazon work like webcams. With one of those, you could plug any HDMI device into your iPad and its output would show up on your screen. It was a &#34;Woah&#34; moment.</p><p>What if we built an app that helped you use your iPad as a monitor?</p><h2 id="evaluating-an-idea">Evaluating An Idea</h2><p>It&#39;s one thing to have an awesome idea, and another to come up with product. We love doing things for the sake of art, but when you run your own business, you have to avoid new and shiny distractions. Otherwise, you&#39;ll end up neglecting the work your customers rely on you for. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-9985.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-9985.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-9985.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-9985.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-9985.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Ben and I pride ourselves on reviewing each other&#39;s weird, left-field ideas whenever they come up ‚Äî making sure we don&#39;t jeopardize our entire business to, say, build an app that launches a game in the dynamic island when you press the action button (it was a promising idea, Ben). So before jumping on a new project, it helps to be skeptical. We asked ourselves a few questions.</p><p><strong>‚ùì How many people want this?</strong> Our gut said, &#34;A lot.&#34; We&#39;ve lost count of the times we wished we had a portable monitor within reach, whether it&#39;s plugging it into our video and still cameras for better monitoring, connecting it to a Mac-Minis we have sitting in a closet, or just hooking up to a Nintendo Switch while traveling.  At the same time, there&#39;s a huge barrier asking someone to spend even $15 on a separate adapter <em>in addition</em> to the cost of our app.</p><p><strong>‚ùì What makes our version special?</strong> We expected a glut of free &#34;iPad monitor&#34; apps in the App Store, like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/06/inevitable-iphone-4-flashlight-apps-flicker-into-view/" rel="noreferrer">Flashlight App gold rush</a> of 2010. What could we bring to the table?</p><p>Design, in and of itself, is a <em>feature</em>. If this was going to be a possible use of the iPad, we might as well make it delightful.</p><p>We also had technical tricks up our sleeve. Our research found that those capture dongles only supported 1080P resolution, and this presented an opportunity. Thanks to our background in image processing, we could build a resolution enhancer that would intelligently upscale to 4K resolution.</p><p><strong>‚ùì Could it make some income to recoup our time?</strong> Assuming there&#39;d be a lot of free utilities to enable this, we felt it was ideal for this app to be &#39;freemium&#39;. We&#39;d make the core experience and most important part ‚Äî using your iPad as a monitor ‚Äî free. Advanced features, like our 4K upscaling, could be a one-time purchase. A big plus here was that we saw it as a fun exercise to build something new, and didn&#39;t have the pressure to turn it into a business. </p><hr/><p><em>üìù <strong>A side note on fun</strong>: we never intended Halide to be a business, either. We just built it out of passion, and had a lot of fun doing it. That ended up becoming a huge success, and a ton of fun to work on. To this day, I think the best products are often built out of passion, not in an effort to chase huge payouts.</em></p><hr/><p>Okay, we had a plan, maybe. On paper, this all sounded like a good plan at that, but one with uncertainty. We know we&#39;re obsessed with details. Unchecked, we could find ourselves spending a year on this, and if it flopped, we&#39;d be kicking ourselves that we hadn&#39;t made that dynamic island action button game instead (it could be a massive multiplayer game, Ben!).</p><p>But we held ourselves to a short schedule, we could risk it. If it made a few bucks, great! If not, we could treat it as the quirky art project it was.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/DATE.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/DATE.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/DATE.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/DATE.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/DATE.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>It was August 4th, just around the corner from New iPhone Season. This is our busiest time of year. That makes it sound kind of casual, but we are talking nights-and-weekends-crazy-busy-busy ‚Äî¬†when new iPhones come out, we don&#39;t get advance hardware or a heads-up on what&#39;s coming. We have to run to the store, buy the phones, and fix what is broken first and then work long nights to support what&#39;s new. </p><p>We had to get Orion out before then. If we didn&#39;t ship Orion in time, we had <em>no choice</em> but to shift focus to Halide and Spectre updates and abandon it. So we set the new iPhone launch as our deadline‚Äî either ship this app in 45 days, or abandon it and move on.</p><p>Buckle up.</p><h2 id="the-design-process">The Design Process </h2><p>While Ben worked on the technical functionality, in parallel, I explored Orion&#39;s potential visual design. I wanted it to be very fun and even a little campy ‚Äî¬†I got a lot of inspiration from in the 80s which had a very futuristic, yet tacky look. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.58.49.png" width="2000" height="1014" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.58.49.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.58.49.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.58.49.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.58.49.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></p></div></div></figure><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.59.05-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1001" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.59.05-1.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.59.05-1.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.59.05-1.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-22.59.05-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>I loved the optimism and almost science-fiction like reverence for technology back then. There was a lot of color and whimsy involved. </p><p>In my first explorations, I just jammed on silly, hypothetical promotional materials for Orion. I pretended flat screen displays didn&#39;t yet exist, and imagined ads like, &#39;finally, a screen you can take anywhere!&#39;, &#39;watch whatever, wherever!&#39;, showing a couple on an abandoned sand bank with their car during a pink sunset.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/poster.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1414" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/poster.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/poster.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/poster.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/poster.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>Noodling around, I was suddenly inspired to make the first screen of the app: A... box?</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Setup---Unboxing.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1547" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Setup---Unboxing.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Setup---Unboxing.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Setup---Unboxing.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/Setup---Unboxing.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I didn&#39;t know what the app would look like, but I wanted it to be a physical experience. Maybe a user could unbox it, as if it really was a TV from the 80s? The most satisfying possible experience unboxing is a tearaway strip; that could translate well to a swipe.</p><p>I threw together some bits and made the box less bare: I labeled the box with an address and electronics certification sticker, using Sony corp&#39;s old Tokyo address, along with a sticker typical of the electronics of the era, listing its voltage and Hz. The dot-matrix type on that sticker is ever so slightly misaligned, as if it wasn&#39;t quite printed perfectly in that semi-analog world. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/tag.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/tag.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/tag.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/tag.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Funny enough, this was the first screen I designed and the last thing we actually built. In the final days, we even managed to get a few more finishing touches into it. More on that later ‚Äî¬†but suffice to say this would become both a figurative and literal shipping label.</p><p>Orion was the kind of project that is pure fun to me, and it gave me an excuse to reach out to people whose work I loved and admired. The first person I reached out to was a longtime friend and collaborator: <a href="http://typehigh.nl" rel="noreferrer">Jelmar Geertsma</a>. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/2023-08-03.jpg" width="1452" height="1936" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/2023-08-03.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/2023-08-03.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/2023-08-03.jpg 1452w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-1669-1.jpg" width="960" height="1440" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-1669-1.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/QuickJPGSm-1669-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div></figure><p>Jelmar is an exceptional designer. He&#39;s a master of type design, for one, but also a spectacular graphic designer. I have worked with many designers in my time, but Jelmar is the kind you only meet once and file mentally in a dramatically lit cerebral hall of fame. Most designers can pull off doing a layout or product page, but type design requires the kind of obsessive nature to keep perfecting a single letter for <em>weeks,</em> if not <em>months</em>. It requires you to have an ever-burning fire and love for the craft inside you that motivates you to do what you do. Jelmar has that fire, and it&#39;s very bright in him indeed.</p><p>I am also lucky to call him one of my best friends, whom I met at art school days about 18 years ago. With our shared appreciation for niche design humor, typeface particularities, beautifully made things and Pulp Fiction, we got along very well in school. It led to many long sessions just designing things for fun and jamming on typefaces along with a few clashes with teachers whom we often out-witted with our computer design chops. </p><p>In August, my grandfather passed away peacefully of old age. I flew to the Netherlands to attend the service, speak at his funeral and grieve with my family. While I was there, I took the opportunity to visit Jelmar for a few days ‚Äî¬†or nights, rather ‚Äî¬†bringing with me some fine American whiskey, a cigar or two, and a lot of ideas.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750015-1.jpg" width="2000" height="3017" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/000009750015-1.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/000009750015-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/000009750015-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750015-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750007-1.jpg" width="2000" height="3017" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/000009750007-1.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/000009750007-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/000009750007-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750007-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750009-1.jpg" width="2000" height="3017" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/000009750009-1.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/000009750009-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/000009750009-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/000009750009-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div></figure><p>For Orion, our brainstorming sessions blended nostalgia and excitement. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1326" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w2400/2023/10/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>This roll of film was expired, but I think it adds to the late night aesthetic. </span></figcaption></figure><p>We both love retro-80s vibes (Jelmar often wears a highly tech-forward Casio watch), and one of our most successful collaborations became my favorite detail and one of our most praised aspects of <a href="http://spectre.cam" rel="noreferrer">Spectre</a> and <a href="http://halide.cam" rel="noreferrer">Halide</a>: our custom typefaces.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-23.12.10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1800" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-23.12.10.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-23.12.10.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-10-at-23.12.10.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/2023-10-10-23.15.13.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="963" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/2023-10-10-23.15.13.jpg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/2023-10-10-23.15.13.jpg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/2023-10-10-23.15.13.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>We&#39;d certainly showcase our love of type in Orion, but that is not where we started.</p><p>My first sketch of the app (post-box design) had me imagining a sort of retro VCR / TV screen aesthetic.

By limiting the app to iPadOS 17, we could take advantage of custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader" rel="noreferrer">shaders</a>, those tiny programs that run on your GPU, responsible for the most complex effects in video games. However, Ben was focused on the app as a whole, so it was risky sending him off on days-long explorations of cool but superfluous effects (or MMORPGs that run in the Dynamic Island). We needed help, and enlisted <a href="http://heestand.xyz" rel="noreferrer">Anton Heestand</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind, it&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month" rel="noreferrer">VERY bad idea</a> to add more developers to a project thinking things will just go faster; more people means more time spent managing everyone&#39;s time. You run the risk of teammates duplicating work, or making changes that interfere with each other. Luckily, Anton&#39;s shader effects didn&#39;t really touch the rest of the app, and he was a delight to work with. The same went for his help on the initial unboxing experience (which we&#39;ll talk about later).</p><p>Based on designs I built in Sketch, Anton built out these cool effects, independent of the rest of our work. Despite his challenging time offset with us ‚Äî¬†Anton is in Japan ‚Äî he pulled in his changes at night, and we provided feedback. This delegation was critical given our short timeline, and a big win.</p><p>While Anton worked on the CRT effects in the interface, Ben built the CRT effect applied to the video. Why two?

We avoid saying Trinitron, since it&#39;s a trademarked name.</p><p>For our authentic CRT effect, each pixel in the shader passes through a &#34;virtual phosphor,&#34; and then gets slightly diffused to simulate halation ‚Äî¬†the process where every phosphor kind of &#39;bleeds&#39; into the adjacent one.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/ryu.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1489" height="862" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/ryu.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/ryu.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2023/10/ryu.jpeg 1489w"/><figcaption><span>Triad vs Slot Mask vs Aperture Grille</span></figcaption></figure><p>These shaders took about four days to build, which included some experiments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_line" rel="noreferrer">scan lines</a>. We even tried drawing the whole image in two alternating phases, like a real TV would. We ultimately stopped at phosphor emulation as we found it hit a sweet spot in recapturing the feel of pixel art as originally shown. Virtual phosphors act as low-pass filter, whereas scan lines just hide pixels.</p><p>So Orion emulates a &#34;perfect&#34; television, one where there are zero gaps between runs of the cathode ray gun. </p><p>Or maybe we&#39;re just telling ourselves this until we decide we like scan lines.</p><h2 id="typography">Typography</h2><p>In the type department, Orion would meet the bar set by our previous apps.

And with that, we were all set for a launch. </p><p>On Wednesday ‚Äî¬†two days after iPadOS 17 came out, and just two days before new iPhone 15s would hit stores and arrive at people&#39;s doorsteps, we sent out notice to press and flipped the switch. </p><figure><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Orion: A display that can go with you anywhere. </p>‚Äî Halide (@halidecamera) <a href="https://twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1704513031701508174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure><p><a href="http://orion.tube" rel="noreferrer">Orion was live.</a></p><p>Much like Halide&#39;s first version, before we launched, barely anyone tried it besides ourselves. You really never know with a project like this if it will be well received or not. We wondered if we struck the right balance between inside joke and functional product. </p><p>And‚Ä¶ people actually got it. Financially, it exceeded our (admittedly very low) expectations, but most importantly, it seems to have put a smile on many people&#39;s faces. </p><p>Money was never and has never been our metric of success. When you get hundreds to thousands of messages from people geeking out on our weird, quirky details, those late nights fretting over little details instantly became even more worth it. </p><p>We&#39;re so glad you love Orion. It really was our pleasure.</p>
