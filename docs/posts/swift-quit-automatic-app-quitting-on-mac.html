    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h4>Why are some apps not quitting?</h4>
                    <p>If you just installed Swift Quit, you may need to log out and log back in. Also remember that Swift Quit must be running in order for auto-quit to work.  If some apps still are not closing please email us at info@swiftquit.com</p>
                    <h4>Can I exclude certain apps from auto quit feature?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, just click the plus button in setting and navigate to your applications folder and select an app that you want to exclude.  It will not quit on the last window close.</p>
                </div><div>
                    <h4>Will this give me Windows-Like functionality?</h4>
                    <p>Swift Quit is designed to close applications when the last window is closed just like Windows, however please contact us at info@swiftquit.com if you notice any applications that are not quitting as expected.</p>
