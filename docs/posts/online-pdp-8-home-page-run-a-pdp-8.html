<p>This site is for people who
wish to learn about the PDP-8 minicomputer and for current PDP-8 users
to get more information on these machines. The PDP-8 was a important early
mini computer
in the history of computing and many are still running today performing
their original function. The PDP-8 was used for industrial control, controlling
experiments, running businesses, word processing, and many other uses.

</p><p>This site is a work in progress so please
to make comments or request what you would like to see.   At
the bottom of most pages is a link to contact me.  I have
been concentrating on the ability to run a PDP8 over the web.  I think
that is working pretty well.  If you haven&#39;t ever run a PDP8 especially
if you haven&#39;t used command line operating systems the online documentation
may not be sufficient to operate it like a pro but I have made it easy to 
play some of the games.

Various bits on this site are from <a href="http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~dwjones/">Douglas
W. Jones FAQ&#39;s</a> The PDP-8 family of minicomputers were built by Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) between 1965 and 1990. It was the follow
on to the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8-models/section-1.html">PDP-5</a> computer with some instruction set changes.
By late 1973, the PDP-8 
family was the best selling computer in the world. The PDP-8 has been described
as the model-T of the computer industry because it was the first computer
to be mass produced at a cost that just about anyone could afford (at least
with company money).
</p><p>The PDP-8 is a 12 bit single accumulator machine which can address
up to 32K 12 bit words.  It has 8 basic <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8/section-3.html">instructions</a>
and the PDP-8/E executes them in 1.2 microsecond for simple instructions
to 4 microsecond for complex memory reference instructions.  This
gives the machine about a .5 MIPS rating.   Although the computer
is very slow and memory limited by today&#39;s standards it was quite capable
in its time.
</p><p>Since the PDP-8 was a more personal machine than the larger more expensive
machines, it was popular for playing with and various games were either
written for it or ported to it from even earlier machines.

game information.</a>
</p><p>People also wrote programs to play sound on the pdp8.  The pdp8 didn&#39;t require a fancy sound card, only an AM radio.
