    <h1>We Fund Public Interest Tech</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The <strong>Prototype Fund</strong> supports ideas in<span> civic tech, data literacy, data security</span> and <span>software infrastructure</span>. We want to provide software developers, hackers, and creatives with the opportunity to code and develop innovative public interest technologies.</p>
<p>The Prototype Fund is the first and only funding program of its sort in Germany. We provide the place and the means necessary to implement innovative software prototypes with a benefit for society: Especially for freelance developers and interdisciplinary teams that have not been considered by government funding instruments before.</p>
<p>The project teams will receive up to â‚¬47,500 over six months from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. With this funding, they can write code and develop a first prototype of your software. In addition, we will connect them with tech and other relevant communities, support them with coaching, and advise them on project implementation and communication.</p>
<p>Only applicants with a residency in Germany are eligible for funding. If you are not a resident in Germany but interested in the funding program nevertheless take a look at our <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/projects/">funded projects</a>, their <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/projects/?filter=code">code base</a>, <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/apply/auswahlkriterien/">funding criteria</a> and the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/apply/faq/">FAQ</a>. If you have any questions or plan to set up a similar funding program feel free to contact <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/about-2/team/">the team</a>. We are happy to help!</p>
<p>The next application phase starts February 1st, 2022.</p>
