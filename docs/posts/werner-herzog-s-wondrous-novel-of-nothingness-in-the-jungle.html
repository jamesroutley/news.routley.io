    <h1>Werner Herzog’s Wondrous Novel of Nothingness in the Jungle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The Japanese lieutenant Hiroo Onoda emerged from hiding, in 1974, after fighting the Second World War for twenty-nine years. He’d been deployed to the Philippine island of Lubang in 1944, when he was twenty-two, and had received secret orders to hold his position even as the Imperial Army withdrew from its airfield there. His commander promised that someone would come back for him eventually. When the war ended, the following summer, Onoda had no way of knowing it, and his jungle vigil continued. He was joined, at first, by three fellow-soldiers who’d got lost in the jungle during the retreat, but then one man wandered off and surrendered, and the other two were killed in skirmishes with local police. Hoping to lure Onoda out, the Japanese dropped leaflets and sent search parties. His brother spoke to him through a loudspeaker; his father left him a haiku. But Onoda had sewn himself so seamlessly into his surroundings that he eluded detection. Trained in military intelligence, he dismissed all outside communication as propaganda. In the U.S., newspapers called him a “straggler” or “holdout,” words that failed to convey the sublime futility of his mission.</p><p>Fortunately, Werner Herzog, an accomplished student of sublime futility, has made Onoda the subject of his wondrous first novel, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-World-Werner-Herzog/dp/0593490266" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-World-Werner-Herzog/dp/0593490266&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-World-Werner-Herzog/dp/0593490266" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Twilight World</a>.” The story in his telling seems not so much fictionalized as lightly mythologized. (Herzog, who has admitted to bending the facts even in his documentaries, notes curtly at the book’s outset, “Most details are factually correct; some are not.”) Herzog’s films, now numbering six dozen, are peopled by the deluded, the obsessed, and the disconcertingly tenacious. His archetypal character might be someone undaunted by nature’s cruelty, who follows his dreams so doggedly that he ends up living a nightmare. It’s easy to see why he was drawn to Onoda’s tale. The two men met, twenty-five years ago, in Tokyo, and spoke intently of the jungle—where Herzog has set some of his most beloved films, including “Fitzcarraldo” and “Aguirre, the Wrath of God”—which he has called “a curse weighing on an entire landscape.” Few writers are better equipped to capture a place so overwhelmingly opaque that it lapses into absurdity, and a life that became an exercise in purposed purposelessness. In Herzog’s hands, Lubang exists outside of time, and Onoda’s war has the eerie gravity of a thought experiment come to life.</p><p>“The Twilight World” has the unenviable task of dramatizing nearly three decades of acute emptiness. Onoda and his companions lived like a millenarian cult, anticipating a salvation that never came—the action was all in the future, and all in their minds. Herzog has written a clipped, economical account that sometimes explodes into lyricism, turning their waiting into a thing of numb, antic beauty. His trick is not to put us in Onoda’s head but to remain so resolutely outside of it that we feel immured in the same wilderness. “A column of millions and millions of ants arrives overnight,” he writes, “and marches through the trees with no beginning or end; the column marches for days and days and then one day is mysteriously and suddenly gone, and that is another year.” Or, more simply: “Birdsong, furious mosquitoes.” In the novel’s brisk hundred and thirty-two pages, there is nothing visceral about Onoda’s suffering, which takes on the quality of sleepwalking. Herzog’s jungle, despite its torrential rains and ceaseless chaos, is an ethereal place, pared back to its hallucinatory core—a different wilds than the one he depicts in “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/the-ecstatic-truth">Rescue Dawn</a>” or “Wings of Hope,” whose heroes don’t blend in as smoothly as Onoda does. Lubang, an island about twice as large as Manhattan, encompasses the whole world, and Onoda becomes “an impalpable dream figure, an elusive and deadly mist, a rumor, a report.”</p><p>Under these circumstances, the discovery of a piece of used chewing gum on a bamboo pole counts as a major plot development. Onoda believes that American G.I.s may have placed it there to taunt him. He considers chewing it himself, to gain insight into the enemy psyche. Later, when he encounters it again, he’s certain that someone has moved it “by a hand’s breadth.” Herzog has always been attuned to the ways in which survivalism functions as a form of existentialism. The brutal irony of “The Twilight World” comes in moments like these, when Onoda succumbs to what a psychologist might call patternicity. He finds meaning everywhere, hearing signals that soon fade into the endless noise. A leaflet proclaiming the end of the war must be a forgery, because it contains minor typos. An errant page from a porno mag, found on the ground, is clearly bait from the enemy. Onoda’s devout belief in his mission becomes a form of schizophrenia, warping everything in its path. Confronted with a newspaper left behind by a search party, he decides that it’s too replete with ads to be real: “They’ve censored the actual news, and replaced it with advertising.”</p><p>“The Twilight World” is a funny novel in the same way that Herzog’s film “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/08/08/loners">Grizzly Man</a>”—about an environmentalist who loved bears, and was eaten by them—is a funny movie. To call it dark, dry, or deadpan is an understatement; it’s more like cosmic farce, or field recordings of the hiccups of fate. The novel’s most humorous events are also its most despairing. When, at last, Onoda left Lubang, in 1974, he was reluctant to abandon the elaborate dream he’d inhabited. He’d stumbled upon a Japanese tourist who’d gone looking for him. As Onoda held him at gunpoint, the tourist swore that the war was over. To prove it, he returned a few weeks later with Onoda’s commanding officer, now an old man, who ordered the soldier to stand down. Onoda still hoped that it wasn’t true, that the Army “had merely wanted to test his dependability.”</p><p>Having missed the detonation of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima">the atom bomb</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1969/07/26/the-moon-hours">moon landing</a>, and the rise of mass consumerism, he returned to Japan a postwar Rip Van Winkle, disdainful of its soulless modernity. The nation afforded him a hero’s welcome, enshrining the “Onoda spirit” as an exemplar of lost Japanese duty and discipline. His homecoming “seemed to stir the deepest and most melancholic feelings,” the <em>Times</em> noted. Though “The Twilight World” is full of melancholy, it politely discards such rhetoric. The word “honor” appears only in dialogue—for Herzog, it belongs between quotation marks. If there’s glory in Onoda’s saga, it derives not from patriotism but from his unswerving ability to ignore his own insignificance. Herzog puts an ultrafine point on it: “Onoda’s war is of no meaning for the cosmos, for history, for the course of the war.”</p><p>Given that Hollywood tends to treat literature as little more than grist for its <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-numbing-rise-of-ip-tv">intellectual-property mill</a>, one might look with reflexive suspicion on filmmakers who write novels. In the past decade, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/david-cronenbergs-dreams-and-nightmares">David Cronenberg</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/quentin-tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> have tried it casually, almost quaintly, like snipers taking up archery in retirement. Herzog seems to have grander ambitions—in an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/werner-herzog-has-never-liked-introspection">interview</a> with <em>The New Yorker</em> in April, he predicted that his writing would outlast his movies—but, to his credit, he approaches the task of novel writing with more caution and, somehow, more abandon. He seems to write with an Onoda-like sense of obligation, and, indeed, he has said that he felt fiction was the only appropriate form for telling Onoda’s story. “The passage of time is one of the reasons why the story became a book and not a film,” he said in the interview. “You take a million steps in the jungle. Lifting the foot out of the mud is already past, and setting it down in front of you is the future. There is no present time.”</p><p>As a series of images, “The Twilight World” is slow and spectral, closer to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/the-metaphysical-world-of-apichatpong-weerasethakuls-movies">Apichatpong Weerasethakul</a>’s “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives” or Terrence Malick’s “The Thin Red Line” than to Herzog’s own movies, which, for all their stateliness, can feel chatty by comparison. Still, his prose, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann, marches to his distinct cadences—anyone who knows his voice will find it in these pages. (Those who don’t should consult the audiobook, which is, blessedly, read by the man himself.) The Herzogian tendency toward high-minded pronouncements, bombastic but endearing, remains very much intact in his fiction. “The monstrous clatter of water enjoins everything to silence, man and nature alike,” he writes. He also reveals a talent for simile, especially in an operatic, slightly hysterical mode. Crickets sound “as though a great locomotive had applied its emergency brakes”; spiders weave their webs “like diabolical harpists plucking irresistible melodies.” Reflecting on Onoda’s tendency to see conspiracy behind every effort to reach him, Herzog writes, “Truth comes with hidden codes, or else the codes are unpredictably enriched with reality, like the veins of ore in rock.”</p><p>Turned on its head, this is an apt description of “The Twilight World”: a true story unpredictably enriched with fiction, it seems to shimmer with layers of meaning. Herzog, who has made a career studying the emptiness of meaning-making, celebrates Onoda’s noble crusade even as he dismisses its abject triviality; it takes a kindred spirit to admire someone who held himself hostage to a lost cause. Fittingly, Herzog devotes almost none of the novel to Onoda’s life after his long war. In his final decades, he moved to Brazil, married, maintained a cattle ranch, and, later, returned to Japan to open a nature school. He died in 2014, at the age of ninety-one. These are biographical afterthoughts for Herzog. The real story is in the jungle, where so much nothing happened that, for Onoda, it became everything. ♦</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
