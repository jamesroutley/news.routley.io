So, when <em>The Settlers II</em> came out in 1996, only MS-DOS and Mac OS enjoyed it. Aside from a release for Nintendo Wii in 2007, it didn’t land on any other platforms.</p><p>So, what about the Amiga? Well, amazing news has just dropped: <em>The Settlers II Gold Edition </em>(the 1997 edition) is coming to the Amiga in October 2025.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The legendary construction strategy classic finally comes to the Amiga!</strong></p><p>In 1993<em>, The Settlers</em> revolutionized gaming on the Amiga and invented a completely new genre: the strategy game. When in 1996 the even more ambitious and still beloved successor <em>The Settlers II</em> appeared, the king of the home computer did not get it. Almost 30 years later, this gaming story is finally corrected!</p><p>With official license from Ubisoft Entertainment is<em> The Settlers II Gold Edition</em> from 18. October 2025 natively available for the Amiga. Not as a fast port, but as a lovingly optimized version that shows what the Amiga really has on it.</p></blockquote><h2>The Settlers II: This is not a port</h2><p>As stated, this isn’t a port, but an optimized version that is designed to run on the Amiga. Published by Look Behind You, <em>The Settlers II Gold Edition</em> is licensed by Ubisoft, which many of us will find absolutely astonishing. However, be aware that it is only intended for AGA or PowerPC Amigas.</p><div><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc2OCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEwMjQgNzY4Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-src="https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10.png 1024w, https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-300x225.png 300w, https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-768x576.png 768w, https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-465x349.png 465w, https://gamingretro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-667x500.png 667w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div><p><em>The Settlers II Gold Edition</em> for Amiga features:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Thousands of lovingly animated subjects</li><li>more than 30 different professional groups, including 6 soldier types</li><li>4 different peoples with different character types: Romans, Asians, Nubians and Vikings</li><li>various landscape elements such as lava, ice areas, marshes, forests and much more, including the cool winter landscape from The Settlers II Mission Disk</li><li>10 Roman campaigns and 9 world campaigns</li><li>130 free bonus cards</li><li>integrated in-game help and optimized playing interface</li><li>4 languages: complete in German and English, in-game also in French and Polish</li></ul></blockquote><p>Minimum system requirements for AGA systems requires more than a basic system, however.</p><blockquote><ul><li>Amiga with AGA chipset</li><li>68040 with 40 MHz</li><li>32 MB Fast RAM</li><li>AmigaOS 3.1</li><li>AHI 4.18</li><li>600 MB free hard disk space</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hi-res graphics are available with this, but you’ll need an accelerator card, or PiStorm.</p><p>If you’re using original hardware, you’ll need to have upgraded the RAM, added a hard disk, and upgraded to AmigaOS 3.1.
