<div id="article-body">
<p>The United States Space Force just offered a rare glimpse of its shadowy X-37B space plane in orbit.</p><p>The photo, released on Thursday (Feb. 20), was taken by a camera onboard the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/25275-x37b-space-plane.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/25275-x37b-space-plane.html">X-37B</a> while the secretive space plane orbited high above the African continent. One of the plane&#39;s solar panels is visible on the left side of the photo, while what appears to be its open payload bay is visible along the top edge.
