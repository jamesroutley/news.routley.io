    <h1>&#34;Your&#34; vs. &#34;My&#34; in user interfaces</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
          



  <div>
    <div>
      
      <p>When referring to the user’s stuff, which is better out of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>“My account” or “Your account”?</li>
<li>“My orders” or “Your orders”?</li>
<li>“My cases” or “Your cases”?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a trick question because often you don’t need any prefix and can just use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account</li>
<li>Orders</li>
<li>Cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is a good example of this in action because it’s obvious that it’s your account and your orders:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/amazon.png" alt="Amazon’s header which does not use ‘your’ or ‘my’ for account and orders"/></figure>
</div>
<p>But what if your product contains things that belong to you and to others – for example, a case working system that contains your cases and everyone else‘s?</p>
<h2>The problem with “my”</h2>
<p>You could use “My cases” in a navigation menu like this:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/nav.png" alt="Navigation menu with options for ‘My cases’ and ‘All cases’"/></figure>
</div>
<p>This seems fine on the face of it.</p>
<p>But screens are not only accessed or referred to through a menu.</p>
<p>For example, you might need to sign post users to their cases in an onboarding flow, email notification or help article.</p>
<p>Saying something like “Go to my cases” is awkward and unnatural – if I told you to go to my cases, you’d think I was telling you to go to my cases, not yours.</p>
<p>Similarly, a support agent might tell you to “Go to your cases” over webchat or a phone call. This is confusing if the UI says “My cases”.</p>
<p>These issues just don’t come up when you use “your” – I’ve used this approach in multiple products over the years, and seen exactly zero issues in user research.</p>
<p>So that’s good.</p>
<h2>“But what if the user is communicating to us using radio buttons, for example?”</h2>
<p>This is easy if we look at an example:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/radios-your.png" alt="Radios where the legend is ‘Do you want to share your profile photo?’ and the options are ‘Yes, share your profile photo’ and ‘No, do not share your profile photo’"/></figure>
</div>
<p>This doesn’t make sense because it sounds like you’re instructing the computer to share their profile, not yours.</p>
<p>But it’s clear if you use “my”:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/radios-my.png" alt="Radios where the legend is ‘Do you want to share your profile photo?’ and the options are ‘Yes, share my profile photo’ and ‘No, do not share my profile photo’"/></figure>
</div>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use “your” when communicating to the user</li>
<li>Use “my” when the user is communicating to us</li>
</ul>
