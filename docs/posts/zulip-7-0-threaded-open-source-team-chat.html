  <p>We’re excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 7.0, containing hundreds
of new features and bug fixes!</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/streams-and-topics.png" alt=""/></span><a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>
is an open-source team chat application designed to help people collaborate to
solve any challenge. With conversations
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">organized by topic</a>, Zulip is
<a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">ideal</a> for both live and asynchronous
communication. Fortune 500 companies, leading open-source projects, and
thousands of other organizations use Zulip every day. Zulip’s 100% open-source
software is available as a <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">managed cloud service</a> or
a <a href="https://zulip.com/self-hosting/">self-hosted solution</a>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/streams-and-topics.png" alt=""/></span></p>
<p>Zulip Server 7.0 is a major release, with over 3800 new commits merged across
the project since the 6.0 release last November. Notable new features include
scheduled messages, unmuting topics in muted streams, many design improvements,
and much more!</p>
<p>A total of 107 people contributed commits to Zulip since the 6.0 release,
bringing the project to over 1200 code contributors. Zulip is remarkable for its
number of major contributors, with <a href="https://zulip.com/team">80 people</a> who’ve
contributed 100+ commits.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who’s
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html">contributed</a>
to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and documentation,
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html#reporting-issues">reporting issues</a>,
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translating/translating.html">translating</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/zulip">supporting us financially</a>, participating in
discussions in the
<a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>, or just
suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving
back to the Zulip community.</p>

<p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server and web application. We’d also like to
share important news and updates for the project as a whole since the 6.0
release last fall:</p>
<h3 id="customer-stories">Customer stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our website now features the story of how the End Point Dev software
consultancy uses Zulip to
<a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/end-point/">manage hundred of projects at once</a>.
End Point uses a variety of chat tools picked by their clients, from Slack and
Teams, to Google Chat and Skype. Having experienced the whole gamut of
options, Zulip is the clear winner for End Point’s internal communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Zulip removes much of the pain that makes people not want to use team chat
apps. We love it.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We also shared the story of how the startup Atolio
<a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/atolio/">built a transparent communication culture</a>
with Zulip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Slack, two thirds of communication is not in public just to avoid noise…
Zulip lets us have conversations in public, not behind closed doors.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have rewritten the page on our website that explains how Zulip’s unique
topic-based threading model
<a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">helps teams communicate more effectively</a>,
incorporating the experiences that so many of our users have generously shared
with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/01/11/year-in-review-2022/">year in review blog post</a>
highlights some stats from 2022, including the most popular emoji on Zulip
Cloud. You can also learn about Zulip’s most underused features (and give them
a try!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p>The Zulip mobile apps for <a href="https://zulip.com/apps/ios">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/apps/android">Android</a> have made
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases">numerous improvements</a> for a
better user experience and a fuller set of Zulip features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Zulip Server 7.0 features, notably
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mute-a-topic">unmuting topics in a muted stream</a>.</li>
<li>More and better options for
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/share-and-upload-files#share-and-upload-files">attaching files and images</a>:
attaching multiple images at once, attaching arbitrary files on iOS (already
supported on Android), and combining text with attachments.</li>
<li><a href="https://zulip.com/help/quote-and-reply">Quote and reply</a>, more results in
search, better troubleshooting for missing
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mobile-notifications">notifications</a>… and lots of
other improvements, including many fixed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all our work on the existing apps, we’ve
<a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/Flutter/near/1492568">started a prototype</a>
of a next-generation Zulip mobile app in <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. We are
<a href="https://zulip.com/jobs#flutter">hiring</a> for that project; if the role sounds
like it would be a good fit, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#readme">Zulip Terminal</a> updates since
the Zulip Server 6.0 release include better topic autocomplete, as well as many
improvement to
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#readme">user documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reviews-and-interviews">Reviews and interviews</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zulip now has
<a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/197945/Zulip/reviews/">over 100 reviews on Capterra</a>!
Our 4.8 star rating beats out reviews for other team chat apps like
<a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/135003/Slack/">Slack</a> and
<a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/168668/Microsoft-Teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>, and has
earned Zulip “Best value” badges for Internal Communications and Collaboration
software.</li>
<li>If you are curious to learn about Zulip’s history, our goals for the product
and how we approach its design, Zulip’s engineering philosophy, and more,
check out this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbj59mVwErg">long-form interview</a> with Tim,
Zulip’s founder and project leader.</li>
<li>Zulip has garnered a number of video reviews in the last few months, with
reviewers describing the product as a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLERougrxKs">privacy friendly open-source alternative</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI6RtnR4AU">asynchronous, open-source chat that’s better than Slack</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The major features and improvements described below are the tip of the iceberg
of all the work that goes into a major Zulip release. We dedicate a lot of
attention to the little things that help make Zulip
<a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/rust/#the-language-team-moves-from-discord-to-zulip-its-better-in-all-the-ways-i-care-about">a joy to use</a>,
such as fine-tuning common interactions, investigating and fixing hundreds of
minor bugs, clarifying the UI and the API, etc. Even if you aren’t looking for
new features, each major Zulip Server release offers a significantly better
overall experience.</p>
<h2 id="redesign">Redesign</h2>
<p>The biggest news for this release is that Zulip is midway through a major visual
redesign. The redesign is intended to give the app a clean, modern look, while
preserving and enhancing Zulip’s highly efficient interaction design. Key
changes in this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New background colors help you focus on the messages you’re reading.</li>
<li>Fully colorized message header bars make it easier to tell which stream you’re
viewing.</li>
<li>Messages with a personal
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/mention-a-user-or-group">mention</a> are highlighted in a
different color than group or wildcard mentions, and your name is bolded to
stand out when you are mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/messages-with-mentions.png"/>
<ul>
<li>The divider lines showing dates have been streamlined, so you can always see
at a glance when all the messages on your screen were sent.</li>
<li>Banners in the compose box have been redesigned with a fresh look, and special
formatting has been added for
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a> noted in
tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/tooltip-and-dates.png"/>
<h2 id="new-and-improved-workflows">New and improved workflows</h2>

<h2 id="new-keyboard-shortcuts">New keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>Zulip is designed to be just as easy to navigate with its ergonomic
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a> as it is with
the mouse.</p>
<ul>
<li>This release adds a new shortcut (<code>z</code>) that lets you zoom to a message in the
context of its conversation. For example, you can use <code>z</code> to jump to the full
context for a search result.</li>
<li>The <code>s</code> shortcut now takes you directly to the conversation the selected
message was sent to. If you are already there, it navigates you to the view
showing the entire stream. This removes the need to remember separate
<code>Shift</code> + <code>s</code> and <code>s</code> shortcuts for these actions.</li>
<li>In addition to the existing <code>+</code> shortcut for reacting to a message with 👍 ,
you can now use <code>=</code> to toggle the first emoji reaction on a message. For
example, <code>=</code> will add your 👋 to the message below.
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/wave-reactions.png"/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The permissions settings for
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-topic">moving messages</a> have
been redesigned for clarity and flexibility. You can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/restrict-moving-messages">configure</a> who can move
messages, and for how long, independently from message editing permissions.
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/moving-messages.png"/></li>
<li>To make it easier to manage users, you can now open a
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-cards">user card</a> by clicking on the user’s name
in the settings and stream subscriber menus.</li>
<li><a href="https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#compliance-export">Compliance exports</a>
now have added flexibility. You can choose between JSON and CSV formats, and
there are new options to filter by message recipient, and to specify whether
attachments should be included in the export.</li>
<li>In addition to configuring who can add subscribers to a stream, you can now
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams#configure-who-can-remove-users">configure permissions</a>
for removing other users as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="better-new-user-experience">Better new-user experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>To better match terminology familiar from other apps, “private messages” have
been renamed to “direct messages” across the Zulip app, including updated
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages#search-by-location">search filters</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://zulip.com/help/">help center</a> now includes documentation for how
to complete many common tasks in the Zulip mobile apps. Many other
instructions have also been updated for clarity and completeness.</li>
<li>To make getting started with Zulip as smooth as possible, we have rewritten
the email that introduces users to
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">streams and topics</a>, and added an
email linking to <a href="https://zulip.com/use-cases/#use-cases">guides</a> for each
type of organization. Also, the contact information provided in emails now
makes clear to users in self-hosted organizations that they’re reaching out to
their Zulip server administrators, and not the Zulip team.
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/05/31/zulip-7-0-released/content/images/2023/05/zulip-guide-email.png"/></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-user-experience-improvements">More user experience improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new privacy option lets you
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/configure-email-visibility">configure</a> who can see the
email address you use to log into Zulip. Your personal configuration overrides
the default set by organization administrators. For example, maintainers of an
open-source project can now easily share their emails with each other, while
keeping the emails of other community members private by default.</li>
<li>To make the experience of catching up on your messages more convenient, the
left sidebar now shows more
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/reading-dms">direct message conversations</a>, and more
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">topics</a> in the selected stream.</li>
<li>To help avoid mistakes, there are now additional confirmation dialogs for
actions deserving caution, including
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-read#mark-all-messages-as-read">marking all messages as read</a>,
removing the last user from a private stream, and disabling all notifications
for direct messages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have added a native webhook integration for
<a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/rundeck">Rundeck</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/github">GitHub integration</a> has been
improved to clearly communicate relevant information across event types, for
example by avoiding repeating the entire pull request description in certain
events.</li>
<li>This release adds support for
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#jwt">JWT authentication</a>,
enabling deep integrations with other applications that need to access the
Zulip API on behalf of users.</li>
<li>Zulip’s SAML integration now supports application-initiated
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#saml-single-logout">SAML Single Logout</a>,
in addition to the existing identity-provider-initiated SAML Single Logout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<ul>
<li>This release adds support for the upcoming
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/releasenotes">Debian 12</a> release.</li>
<li>Zulip
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/postgresql.html#postgresql-database-details">now supports PostgreSQL 15</a>
as the database. This release also removes support for PostgreSQL 11 due to
its <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">approaching end-of-life</a>.</li>
<li>For servers that use the
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upload-backends.html#s3-backend-configuration">S3 file storage</a>
configuration, files are now downloaded to the server, cached, and served to
clients from there, instead of clients fetching them directly from S3
themselves. This increases bandwidth requirements for the Zulip server, but
greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements for Zulip clients by allowing them
to cache the files correctly.</li>
<li>Front-end JavaScript error reporting has been rewritten to use
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/logging.html#sentry-javascript-error-logging">Sentry</a>,
which provides much better support for aggregating and filtering client-side
exceptions than the previous custom system.</li>
<li>Administrators can add
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/deployment.html#deployment-hooks">configurable hooks</a>
which are run when upgrading the Zulip server — for example, sending a Zulip
message describing the newly-deployed commits.</li>
<li>This release upgrades many third-party dependencies, including to
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/">Django 4.2</a> LTS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our community translators have been hard at work keeping up with the product
as it evolves. This release features a total of 27 languages with translations
that cover the majority of non-error strings.</li>
<li>This release fixes several issues involving incorrect internationalization of
dates and times, as well as an issue where some strings in email notifications
were not translated correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview/release-lifecycle.html#compatibility-and-upgrading">highly recommend</a>
upgrading to Zulip Server 7.0 to take advantage of the hundreds of improvements
in this release. If you’re using Zulip Cloud, you already have the new version,
as we constantly upgrade it with improvements as they become ready.</p>
<p>We work hard to ensure that upgrades are smooth; you can upgrade by following
the straightforward
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a>.
The
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#upgrade-notes">upgrade notes section of the changelog</a>
details changes you’ll want to understand before upgrading.</p>
<p>Many installations have already upgraded to release candidates, so we feel very
confident in this release. But if you need help, best-effort support is
available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>. You can
also purchase <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">commercial support</a> from the Zulip core
team.</p>

<p>This release features many improvements in the design of the Zulip web app, and
redesign efforts will continue to be a major priority in the coming months.
Check out
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aredesign">issues tagged with the “redesign” label</a>
to see where we’re headed, and
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/design-discussions.html">join the conversations</a>
in the Zulip development community to offer feedback.</p>
<p>We are also working on features that will make communication even more efficient
with Zulip, including making it possible to
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25673">follow a topic</a> of interest, and
bringing the <a href="https://zulip.com/help/inbox">Inbox view</a> that mobile-app users
are familiar with
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/22189">to the Zulip web app</a>.</p>
<h2 id="release-schedule">Release schedule</h2>
<p>This release is coming out about six months after the Zulip Server 6.0 release
in <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/11/17/zulip-6-0-released/">November 2022</a>, which
we think is a better cadence compared to the eight-month gap between Zulip 5.0
and Zulip 6.0. We are targeting roughly the same six-month interval for the next
major release, which is expected towards the end of the year.</p>

<p>I’d like to take this opportunity to advertise a few opportunities to contribute
