        <p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a> is a purportedly-decentralized social media company that spun out of Twitter, beginning in 2019. It makes sense that people are hunting for new social media platforms right now — Elon Musk&#39;s disastrous takeover of Twitter has demonstrated how fragile relying on private VC-funded companies is for something so critical as communication infrastructure. BlueSky&#39;s answer to this is that they are decentralized — thanks to the <a href="https://atproto.com">AT Protocol</a>, anyone can run a server. Unfortunately, it&#39;s decentralized in name only:</p>

<ul>
<li>The AT Protocol is entirely controlled by Bluesky the company, with no community governance structure or plans for a governance structure. Want to change how it works? Tough luck, buddy.</li>
<li><s>Want to run a server yourself? Well, the server is closed-source, so you&#39;d better enjoy reimplementing it all yourself</s>.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> (Edit: I&#39;m told that this is not true, and that the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto">atproto</a> has the server code. However, it&#39;s unclear to me how much of what&#39;s running on bsky.social is public — the identity parts appear to be, but not the web frontend, that I can find.)</li>
<li>The apps? Also closed source, you don&#39;t have any control over them.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn&#39;t how you build a decentralized ecosystem, it&#39;s how you build a system that you can claim is decentralized while still holding all the power yourself.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more that&#39;s wrong with Bluesky that I&#39;m not going to get into, since I honestly don&#39;t really care. But if you care about not giving more power in your life to a VC-funded company started by a guy who said that &#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772756069773313">Elon is the singular solution I trust</a>&#34; to running Twitter, you probably want to stay away from Bluesky.</p>
