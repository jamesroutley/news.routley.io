    <h1>Giving to Charities</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When I <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Spirited_Away.html">announced my new work as an independent technologist</a>, I also presented <a href="https://veitheller.de/at-large/#rates">my new rates</a>. Most notably, I will be giving 100€ of my 800€ daily rate for open source projects to charities. The obvious questions is which charities I will support using your money, and this blog post is an attempt to answer that question.</p>
<h2 id="give-well">Give Well</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.givewell.org/">Give Well</a> is a nonprofit that helps prospective chariteers<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> choose effective charities. I’ve used it in the past to choose charities, and I found the information helpful; after all, while I want the money that I donate to matter, I’m not an expert on charities. I decided to let them guide my decisions again, and I’ll probably stick with them in the future.</p>
<p>As such, the money that I will be donating in the coming months and years will go to two charities fighting malaria, the <a href="https://www.malariaconsortium.org/">Malaria Consortium</a> and the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a>. These two charities have very different approaches to fighting the disease: while the Malaria Consortium focuses on preventing and treating malaria and other similarly problematic diseases, such as Dengue and Pneumonia, the foundation Against Malaria focuses specifically on distributing insecticidal nets. I believe that those two approaches work very well together, so I’ve decided to support both of them.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>If you know of other charities that you want to share with me, <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/charities@veitheller.de">let me know</a>! Of course you can also write to me if you think that I might be missing something about the charities I am already donating to.</p>
<p>I will update this blog post if and when the set of charities I’m supporting changes.</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> Sometimes, in my constant battle with the English language, I make up words and decide to stick with them.</p>
