    &#34;It&#39;s essentially the Hacker News Hug of Deaf.&#34;

  About three years ago, I set up a tiny <code>netcat</code> loop on
  one of my Debian servers to accept arbitrary connections from the
  Hacker News (HN) community.  The loop ran for 24 hours and did
  exactly three things whenever a client connected:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send a simple <code>ok</code> message to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    Close the connection immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make my terminal beep four times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That&#39;s it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread
  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and
  family.  See
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451">this
  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact
  command I ran on my server:
</p>
<pre><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2&gt;&amp;1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf &#39;\a&#39;; sleep 1; done &amp; done</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code>nc</code> command closes the connection immediately after
  sending the <code>ok</code> message and runs an
  inner <code>for</code> loop in a background shell that
  asynchronously prints the bell character to the terminal four times.
  Meanwhile, the outer <code>while</code> command loops back quickly
  to run a new <code>nc</code> process, thus making this one-liner
  script instantly ready to accept the next incoming connection.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began
  connecting to the demo running on <code>susam.net:8000</code>.
  Anyone on the Internet could use any client of their choice to
  connect.  Here&#39;s how I explained it in the HN thread:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system
    by <em>any</em> means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can
    use <em>whatever client</em> they have to connect to port 8000 of
    my system, e.g., a web browser, <code>nc HOST
    8000</code>, <code>curl HOST:8000</code>, or even, <code>ssh HOST
    -p 8000</code>, <code>irssi -c HOST -p 8000</code>, etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one
  triggering four beeps.  That&#39;s a total of 19044 terminal beeps
  echoing throughout the day!

  Now, 4761 isn&#39;t a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it
  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried
  in a regular HN thread, act on it, and make my terminal beep
  thousands of time.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but
  fun!  Computing isn&#39;t always about solving problems.  Sometimes,
  it&#39;s also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the
  exploration, and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.
  Activities like this keep computing fun for me!

  <strong>Update on 10 Apr 2025:</strong> I posted this article on
  Hacker News on 10 Apr 2025 and received another round of large
  number of connections to my beeper loop.  Here is the data for it:
