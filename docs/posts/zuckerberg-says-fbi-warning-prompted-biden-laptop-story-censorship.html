There is no record on Mr Biden&#39;s schedule that such a meeting ever took place.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Critically, it fed into long-running unproven allegations about corruption on Joe Biden&#39;s part to ensure his son&#39;s business success in Ukraine.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In that context, the New York Post story, based on exclusive data no other news agency had access to, was met with scepticism - and censored by social media outlets. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Zuckerberg told Rogan: &#34;The background here is that the FBI came to us - some folks on our team - and was like &#39;hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election, we have it on notice that basically there&#39;s about to be some kind of dump that&#39;s similar to that&#39;.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said the FBI did not warn Facebook about the Biden story in particular - only that Facebook thought it &#34;fit that pattern&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The article remains controversial. The hard drive at its centre was provided to the Post by Donald Trump&#39;s own lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More than a year after the story appeared, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/">the Washington Post conducted its own analysis</a> and concluded the laptop and some emails were likely to be authentic - but the majority of data could not be verified due to &#34;sloppy handling of the data&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other once-sceptical news organisations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/hunter-biden-tax-bill-investigation.html">such as the New York Times</a> have agreed at least some of the emails are genuine.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Asking Zuckerberg if he regretted suppressing the factual story, the Facebook founder replied: &#34;It sucks... I think in the same way that having to go though a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks... in the end you&#39;re free.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Zuckerberg acknowledged that there remained disagreement about the story, which he said was a &#34;hyper-political issue&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Depending on what side of the political spectrum [you&#39;re on], you either think we didn&#39;t censor it enough or we censored it way too much.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Facebook did not completely ban sharing of the article, but instead limited how much its algorithm automatically shared it to other people for a week, while third-party fact-checkers tried to verify the reporting.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So while people could post the article and discuss it, it was less likely to spread organically to new users.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>By contrast, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54568785">Twitter banned sharing of the article</a> at all. Both social media companies found themselves blasted by US Republicans and Donald Trump supporters, and had to explain their actions before a US Senate hearing in the following days.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Meta, Facebook&#39;s parent company, highlighted that Zuckerberg had addressed the FBI warnings at that 2020 hearing, <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1562967880727048192">saying of the Joe Rogan interview that &#34;none of this is new&#34;</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But in a wide-ranging interview that covered Meta&#39;s virtual reality ambitions and Zuckerberg&#39;s personal life, the creator of Facebook also talked about his dislike for dealing with such thorny issues. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I didn&#39;t get into this to basically judge these things. I got into this to design technology that helps people connect,&#34; he told Rogan.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This whole thing that is arbitrating what is OK and what is not - I obviously have to be involved in that because, at some level, I run the company and I can&#39;t just abdicate that.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;But I also don&#39;t think that as a matter of governance you want all of that decision making vested in one individual.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
