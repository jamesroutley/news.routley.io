    <h1>Ask HN: What to do with a coffee plantation with about 8000 trees?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My dad left me a coffee plantation and I have no experience in this at all, nor did he. It is freshly planted so it won&#39;t reach peak production until around 2026. But I want to learn how I could go about taking care of it and eventually start selling beans. Do you have any resource I can take a look at to learn more about coffee and its production process?</p></div></div>
