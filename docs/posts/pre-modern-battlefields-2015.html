<p><span><br/></span><span><span><b>“Man does not enter battle to fight, but for victory. He does everything that he can to avoid the first and obtain the second” </b></span></span></p>

<p><span><br/></span><span><span><b>O</b></span>f the many books and articles published explaining the tactical mechanics of ancient and medieval warfare, none have influenced my views on the topic more than a short article by <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/people/professors/sabin/index.aspx">Philip Sabin</a> titled “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/300198?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">The Face of Roman Battle</a>.” In this article Sabin attempts to draw an accurate description of the way a Roman legion and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniple_%28military_unit%29">maniples</a> actually worked on the battlefield. He is not the only one to attempt this feat. The clearest description of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_reforms">pre-Marian</a> armies is the account found in t<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0543,001:18:32">he eighteenth book of Polybius’s <i>Histories</i></a>, and historians have been squabbling over just what Polybius’s rather ambiguous report means for the better part of the last two centuries. I believe that Sabin’s is the best of their efforts. What makes his description so convincing is the building blocks he uses to construct it. Sabin starts his reconstruction with a few general insights about the nature of ancient combat, especially the hand-to-hand sort. His most important insight is this: close combat is <i>absolutely terrifying</i>. When you realize just how terrifying it is much of what we find in the ancient and medieval source starts to make a lot more sense.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span><span>Roman heavy infantry engagements possessed several clear characteristics which must be accounted for by any model of the combat mechanics involved. If not decided at the first clash, the contests often dragged on for an hour or more before one side finally broke and fled. The losers could suffer appalling casualties in the battle itself or in the ensuing pursuit, but the victors rarely suffered more than 5 per cent fatalities even in drawn-out engagements. The fighting lines could shift back and forth over hundreds of yards as one side withdrew or was pushed back by its opponents. Finally, the Romans had a practical system for the passage of lines, and preferred to reinforce or replace tired units with fresh ones rather than maximizing the depth of the initial fighting line. </span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>As Sabin read the ancient accounts he realized that parallels for many features of Roman combat could be found in descriptions of early modern Europe’s bayonet charge:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span><span>We know from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century engagements that bayonets caused only a tiny proportion of battle casualties, but bayonet charges do seem to have been decisive in triggering routs. The explanation for this apparent paradox seems to be that cold steel held a unique terror for troops, over and above that caused by the more random and impersonal perils of shot and shell. The morale of opposed infantry formations appears to have been closely interlinked, such that if one side could nerve itself to launch a bayonet charge in the conviction that the enemy would not stand, the enemy did indeed break before contact. Conversely, if mutual deterrence was maintained, then the combat could bog down into a bloody close-range firefight between the opposing lines, often lasting for hours….</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Why was cold steel a “unique terror” for troops in combat? On the face of it a sword does not <i>seem</i> any more frightening than the cannon-ball. Pop culture portrayals of small imperialist forces putting hordes of backward natives to flight with nothing but gun and powder suggest the opposite conclusion. Images of countless thousands led to the slaughter on the banks of the Somme or hills of Verdun only strengthen the impression. But those men who actually withstood both the bullet and the bayonet overwhelmingly preferred to face the former. A similar preference for arrows and cross-bows shot from afar over spear thrusts and sword strokes closer to home pervades the ancient and medieval sources.</span></p>
<p><span><i><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYKjoosrRRI?start=270" width="560"></iframe></i></span></p>
<p><span><br/></span><span>As you can see, most close quarter engagements are decided within seconds. To engage in hand to hand combat is to hang your life on a the balance of a few split second decisions. This is <i>terrifying</i>. It is all the more terrifying if the enemy force is as committed and disciplined as your own.  If you survive the first encounter–that is, if you successfully kill the first man who attempts to kill you–there will be another, and then yet another to fill in his place. How long can you keep making instant life-or-death decisions before you make a mistake? The odds are not in your favor. The physical and mental strain of close quarters combat on those in the front lines is simply more than can be borne for any great stretch of time. </span></p>
<p><span>Sabin explains why this is important: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span><span>What does all this mean for the many cases in Roman infantry battles where neither side broke at the outset, and the combat turned into a prolonged affair? I suggest that close-range sword dueling between steady bodies of infantry must have been a highly unstable state, and one that would require massive injections of physical and psychological energy either to initiate or to sustain for any length of time. It was clearly only the availability of protective armor and shields that made such duels endurable at all, given their apparent intolerability for the unprotected troops of more modern times. I would argue that there must also have been a more physically and psychologically sustainable ‘default state’ within protracted Roman infantry contests, into which the combatants would naturally relapse if the initial advances by either side failed to trigger an early rout.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Sabin does not believe that “pure missile duel” style of battle, decided by one great final charge at its end, accords with the surviving narrative sources:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span> <span>Such a radical image seems to me incompatible with the many references in the literature to true hand-to-hand fighting, and it makes it difficult to explain how one side could ‘push back’ its adversaries during the course of the contest. Hence, unlike in the stalemated firefights of more recent times, I believe that in most Roman battles the lines did sporadically come into contact, as one side or the other surged forward for a brief and localized flurry of hand-to-hand combat. The flurry of combat would end when one side got the worst of the exchange, and its troops would step back to re-impose the ‘safety distance’ while brandishing their weapons to deter immediate enemy pursuit….</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>But if cold steel was so frightening, why would men engage in close quarters combat at all? Again, Sabin explains:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span><span>Why would parts of each line sporadically surge forward into contact? The key individuals would surely be the ‘natural fighters’ and junior leaders, who would encourage a concerted lunge forward to overcome the understandable reluctance among their comrades to be the first to advance into the wall of enemy blades. Roman sub- units such as centuries, maniples, and cohorts offered an ideal basis for such localized charges, whereas tribal warriors would mount less disciplined attacks led by the bolder spirits among them. The many accounts of Roman standard-bearers carrying or flinging their standards towards the enemy to embolden the onslaught of their comrades (as at Pydna and in Caesar’s invasion of Britain) are of obvious relevance in this connection (Plutarch, <i>Aem</i>. 20; Caesar, <i>BG </i>4.25). Across an overall infantry battlefront many hundreds of yards wide, the back and forth movement of individual sub-units or warrior bands just the crucial few yards to engage in or disengage from hand-to-hand combat would not prejudice the maintenance of the overall line. If such flurries of sword fighting were not quickly decisive, then sheer physical and nervous exhaustion, coupled with the killing or wounding of the key junior leaders who were inspiring their men to engage, would lead the two sides to separate back to the default stand-off. The fact that even phalangites could step back facing the enemy (as at Sellasia) indicates that there was usually sufficient ‘give’ within infantry formations to allow front-rankers to shy away from their adversaries without bumping immediately into the man behind. Indeed, when this flexibility was removed and troops became too closely packed together, thereby hindering their ability to use their weapons properly or to step back from clashes which were not going well, they risked exposing themselves to one-sided slaughter. Something like this clearly happened at Cannae, and it could well be that a key reason why flank and rear attacks were so devastating was not just the psychological shock they caused but the fact that they crowded the victims in on one another, removing their ability to re-establish the ‘safety distance’ and so to recover their cohesion and fighting effectiveness. </span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Sabin goes on to describe how this model of legionary activity makes sense of the ambiguous descriptions of Rome’s famous maniple system, and why the maniples would be so effective in this style of combat. I encourage those interested in Roman history to read<a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s598/sh/fcd9fa42-3aca-4dea-a9f9-21ce28103a02/7eeb59e67566c397/res/10f93bfc-2897-4e77-aa11-855dee78a3f1/300198.pdf"> <b>the entire thing</b></a><b>.</b> But I hope readers can see how easily Sabin’s insights transfer to the wars of men who lived far from Rome. Not every army in the pre-modern world had maniples, but many had large infantry contingents intended to destroy their enemies in close quarters. The tempo of their battles would have been decided by fear and terror, as it was with the Romans. Sabin’s model of periodic surges of courage temporarily hurling front lines together should be the default image of every mass infantry battle waged in the pre-modern era. </span></p>

<p><span><b>EDIT (27/10/2015 11:00 AM): </b>A reader has pointed out to me that Philip Sabin has recently published a book that fleshes out this model and uses it to analyze the narrative accounts of famous Roman and Greek battles. I have not read it yet, but it looks interesting: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S84UI7U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00S84UI7U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theschssta-20&amp;linkId=5SHYNGQPTKPNTYGF"><b><i>Lost Battles: Reconstructing the Great Clashes of the Ancient World.</i></b></a></span></p>
