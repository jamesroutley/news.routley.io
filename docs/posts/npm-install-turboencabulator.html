    <h1>npm install turboencabulator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header><p><date>Thursday, January 13th 2022</date></p></header><p>Someone recently shared this story with me about an open-source developer corrupting their popular open-source NPM libraries:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/">bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/</a></li></ul><p>The incident raises questions about the modern web ecosystem &amp; development practices, the economics of open-source maintenance and whether or not you truly &#34;own&#34; the code you store on any of these platforms.</p><p>But writing more in-depth on these topics is a topic best left to more serious blogs.</p><p>After I read about it I wasted a little time looking up random NPM package names to see if they&#39;d been claimed. Sometimes I peruse possibly names for future project. Other times I just look up funny words <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/real-birthday">or ideas</a> to see if they exist.</p><p>That last line of thought made me think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboencabulator">turboencabulators</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;re not familiar, a turboencabulator is probably the longest-running jokes in modern engineering. It&#39;s description, from 1944, is inscrutable, jargon-laden nonsense for an impossible, non-existing machine. In other words: the perfect kind of thing to publish as an NPM package.</p><p>The thought of someone installing a turboencabulator as a dependency made me laugh, and seemed too perfect. I assumed someone out there must&#39;ve had the same idea and done it years ago.</p><p>I looked it up, and much to my astonishment, it was available! I nabbed it quickly:</p><ul><li><strong>NPM</strong>: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/turboencabulator">npmjs.com/package/turboencabulator</a></li><li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/georgemandis/turboencabulator">github.com/georgemandis/turboencabulator</a></li></ul><p>Success!</p><p>Now anyone can add the turboencabulator as a dependency to their project:</p><pre><code># Bash
npm install turboencabulator

# Yarn
yarn add turboencabulator
</code></pre><p><strong>A strange turn:</strong> Within couple days, when all that existed in the project was a README file, I noticed the package had already been downloaded from NPM over 30 times (?!?)</p><p><img src="https://moonbase.georgemandis.com/npm-turboencabulator.jpg" alt="NPM Downloads"/></p><p>What is that all about?</p><p><strong>My theory:</strong> is that someone previously owned this package on NPM and other projects out there must have still had it listed as a dependency. I couldn&#39;t find any precise evidence of this yet, but it makes the most sense to me.</p><p>That&#39;s terrifying for an entirely different set of reasons than what the article I linked to at the beginning raises. I explained NPM package dependencies to someone not precisely in the tech industry the other day and realized just how bananas the whole thing is. I&#39;m honestly astonished it isn&#39;t a bigger mess.</p><p>If the traffic persists for the next couple of weeks I might do more sleuthing and write a followup. It&#39;s only been a couple of days.</p><p>Lastly, as you may have noticed, there <em>is</em> actually code inside the turboencabulator. What does it actually... do?</p><p>It does exactly what it says in the description. I can&#39;t explain it any more clearly than that.</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you <em>are</em> the type to parse through the turboencabulator source and enjoyed deciphering it, you might enjoy contributing to another project of mine: <a href="https://github.com/georgemandis/101-hello-worlds">101 Hello Worlds</a>.</p></section></div>
