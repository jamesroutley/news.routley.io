</p>
<p>I waste too much time scrolling through social media.  It&#39;s bad for my health, so why do I keep doing it?  </p>
<p>Because once in a while, I&#39;ll find a post so good that it teaches me something I never knew before, and all the scrolling feels worth it.
But I&#39;ve stumbled upon an old piece of free and open source tech, relatively unknown today, which is THE solution of solving the problems with modern media without sacrificing accessible, good content: RSS. </p>
<p>Reddit, Facebook, Twitter — platforms built for engagement, not efficiency. Instead of showing you high-quality posts upfront, they pad your feed with memes, spam, and astroturfing. There is only so much &#39;good&#39; content created in a day. By padding your feed with trash, they make the limited amount of good posts &#34;last longer&#34;. 
These sites want you to spend more time scrolling on their website, so they feed you scraps which makes the occasional great post feels like a jackpot.</p>
<p>While some sites offer filtering or sorting options, manually settings these options every time you want to access a subreddit is just not doable.  </p>

</p>
<p>You could, of course, stop consuming content from these websites. However, this would mean potentially missing really good content; content you&#39;d learn from, interesting ideas, and more.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>

</p>

<p>RSS is like your youtube subscription feed in hyperdrive. Subscribe to sites you love and decide what shows up — no exploitative social media algorithm needed. No more ads or algorithms deciding how to keep you doomscrolling. This 1999 tech actually solves a lot of 2025 problems.</p>
<p>You can filter out keywords, set minimum upvotes or like counts, and much more! Modern RSS clients allow you to make filters using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions">Regex</a>, and there are a <em>lot</em> of software and services you can use to tune up your filtering to 11.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Never see noise, and never miss hidden gems again!</p>
<p>But how do you get started with RSS? It&#39;s easier than you think!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup<a href="#setup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I personally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)">self-host</a> an open source RSS reader: <a href="https://tt-rss.org/">Tiny Tiny RSS</a></p>
<p><img src="https://joeyehand.com/assets%5Cimages%5Cblog_posts%5C2025_01_12-rss%5Csupport.png" alt="Image explaining definitions of RSS levels of ease"/> 
</p>

<p>To make it easier, let&#39;s differentiate between three levels of ease when it comes to adding a website to RSS: Easy, medium, and hard.</p>
<h3 id="easy-1-youtube">Easy 1: Youtube<a href="#easy-1-youtube" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Want a youtube channel in your RSS feed? Just copy the channel&#39;s URL and subscribe to it in your reader. Done.</p>
<h3 id="easy-2-ign">Easy 2: IGN<a href="#easy-2-ign" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you like games, you might want to subscribe to <a href="https://ign.com">IGN</a>. There&#39;s no clear RSS button, so the best course of action would be to google &#34;IGN RSS&#34;.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice <a href="https://corp.ign.com/feeds">IGN RSS Feeds</a> page with multiple categorized feeds for you to pick from. If you wanted to subscribe to &#34;Game Articles&#34;, you&#39;d right-click on the game articles link, press &#34;copy link&#34;, go to your RSS reader of choice and subscribe to the link you copied.  </p>
<p>Now all IGN Game Articles will show up in your RSS feed as they are published!</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Some websites don&#39;t have a dedicated RSS button, but still support RSS. You can discover their RSS urls by adding .rss, atom.xml, feed, etc. at the end of the site&#39;s URL, for example <code>https://website.com/atom.xml</code>. Almost all RSS readers support Atom feeds. For more examples, check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/12782um/comment/jee0lpx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this</a> Reddit comment.</p>

<p><img src="https://joeyehand.com/assets%5Cimages%5Cblog_posts%5C2025_01_12-rss%5Cmiddleman.png" alt="Image explaining RSS middlemen"/> 
</p>

<p>Some sites like HackerNews have RSS support. However, this RSS can be extremely limited if you want to filter posts so your feed isn&#39;t spammed by low effort content. Some people are nice enough to set up a &#34;middleman&#34; between your RSS feed and the website, so you can pull the RSS feed through the middleman while doing actions like filtering it.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to subscribe to HackerNews but filter out low upvote count posts, you could subscribe to <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">HNRSS</a> instead of through HN directly. For example, I filter out posts below 150 upvotes by to this url: <code>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=150</code></p>

</p>

<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>When removing the optional search term from a reddit search URL, don&#39;t forget to remove the <code>+</code>
When removing the sort options
If adding more search terms, add a + between them!</p>
</div>
<p>I love managing my homelab. I follow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">/r/homelab</a>. Some posts are really good and teach me a lot.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-filter-out-picture-posts">Step 1: Filter out picture posts.<a href="#step-1-filter-out-picture-posts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Reddit hack: Filter out picture posts by searching for &#39;self:true&#39; in a subreddit. Bonus: You can subscribe to that specific search query as a RSS feed for text posts only.</p>
<p>So instead of subscribing to a subreddit&#39;s RSS directly, you do a search for posts in that subreddit and then subscribe to <em>that</em> RSS feed.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The <code>restrict_sr=on</code> parameter in the URL (probably) means &#34;Restrict_subreddit&#34;. Removing this from the search will yield results from different subreddits than the one you&#39;re searching in. If you think that parameter is redundant, I agree.</p>
</div>
<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of text-only submissions on /r/homelab. Gems are relatively sparce. Lots of low quality content. It&#39;s not the subreddit&#39;s fault; this is standard across Reddit.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-filter-for-quality">Step 2: Filter for quality<a href="#step-2-filter-for-quality" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Seems easy; let&#39;s add a &#39;minimal upvotes&#39; query to the search, right?</p>
<p>Filtering by &#39;Top of ...&#39; always returns 25 items. This means that if you sort by &#39;top of this week&#39;, on average of 25/7=3,57 NEW posts get added to your feed each day! This is a great way to only see the highest scoring posts of each day.</p>
<p>Adding this sort on top of the RSS feed from step 1 results in an URL like this:
<code>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year</code></p>
<div>
<p>Bug</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t care about only seeing text posts, removing <code>self%3Atrue</code> does <strong>NOT</strong> work for RSS feeds, even though it does work for direct searches. Instead, subscribe to the subreddit&#39;s &#34;top&#34; RSS and filter by time. For example: <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top.rss?t=month</code></p>
</div>
<p>For reference, here is how many posts you would get in your RSS feed, depening on your reddit sorting:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeyehand.com/assets%5Cimages%5Cblog_posts%5C2025_01_12-rss%5Cpostsper.png" alt="Image explaining makeup of reddit RSS URL"/> 
</p>

<p>And just like that, we converted a high-noise subreddit to an RSS feed which only gives us the best the subreddit has to offer.</p>
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>If you wanted to subscribe to all new posts in a subreddit, you would subscribe to an url like <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT_NAME/new/.rss?sort=new</code>.

</div>
<h3 id="hard">Hard:<a href="#hard" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some sites might not have support for an RSS feed. Sometimes you can get away with a neat google trick:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeyehand.com/assets%5Cimages%5Cblog_posts%5C2025_01_12-rss%5Cgoogletrick.png" alt="Image explaining makeup of reddit RSS URL"/> 
</p>

<p>Most of the time you&#39;d need something to generate the RSS for you. You could use one of many RSS feed generators available online, or host one yourself. Most of these feed generators have enhanced filtering tools as well.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t had to do this yet, however I&#39;ve heard really good things about the open source <a href="https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge">RSS-Bridge</a></p>
<p>How you&#39;d set up a feed generator depends on the software, so I won&#39;t expand upon that here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Separating yourself from the algorithmic whims of social media platform is easier than ever. With RSS, you can stay informed, save time, and never miss the content that truly matters.</p>
<p>This blog also has an <a href="https://joeyehand.com/feed_rss_created.xml">RSS feed!</a></p>
