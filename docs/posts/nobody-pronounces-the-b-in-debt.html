                              <p>Most of the time if you&#39;re indebted to someone you&#39;re grateful to them for giving you something or making something possible.</p>

<p>That is not how you should feel about those responsible for the spelling of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/debt"><em>debt</em></a>. They have done us no favors.</p>

</div></div>

<p>While it&#39;s usually true that a silent letter in an English word is evidence of some former pronunciation the word had, in some cases it&#39;s not the language&#39;s fault at all, but is actually the fault of lexical meddlers.</p>

<p><em>Debt</em> is derived through the Middle English word <em>dette</em>, from the Old French <em>dette</em> or <em>dete</em>. Note the conspicuous absence of &#34;b.&#34; Some scholars in those dark days we refer to as the Middle Ages sure did. They knew that the word had its origin in the Latin word <em>debitum</em>, and they thought it should pay homage to that wordâ€”and they had the wherewithal to slip a &#34;b&#34; into both the English and French versions of the word. Despite the fact that the &#34;b&#34; had never been pronounced in either language, the spellings became established. </p>

<p>While Modern French spelling reform eliminated the &#34;b&#34; it had been saddled with, English has not managed to shed its own. The language suffers similarly (and for the same reason) with the silent letters in <em>doubt</em>, <em>plumber</em>, <em>subtle</em>, <em>indict</em>, and <em>island</em>.</p>
