<h2 id="years-of-writing">13 years of writing</h2>
<p>We got here via 13 years of writing but that only really counts the number of articles I currently have on my site. I actually started writing sometime in 2009-2010 on one of my tech / video game / gadgets blogs but those are lost to the interwebs (and probably not worth salvaging). And this doesn&#39;t account for the dozens and dozens of journals I&#39;ve had over the years with essays / reflections that will never see the light of day.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, I started writing because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a lot of thoughts in my head</li>
<li>I was bored of school and thought it could ladder up into something fun / useful / make money</li>
<li>I enjoyed the process</li>
<li>I had this thought that it would impact the world in some small way - the same way the blogs I&#39;ve read in my life have impacted me</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I&#39;ve kept writing for similar reasons but several external motivators joined them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps my career w jobs (at least I think it does)</li>
<li><a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-reflection#profit">Makes some money</a> (though not near enough to make a minimum wage)</li>
<li><a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-01_why-i-write">Helps me learn / internalize new things</a></li>
<li>Allows me to share <a href="https://github.com/projects">projects I&#39;ve been building</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-i-keep-writing">How I keep writing</h2>
<p>I often get asked how I write so much - though I think some of that question implies <em>why</em> do I write so much.</p>
<p>The answer is I do it habitually. If there&#39;s a big enough idea I&#39;ve had floating around in my head and I think others might find it useful / interesting then I usually think it&#39;s worth logging it somewhere. If I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll likely just keep thinking about it so might as well get it out of my head and on the internet where people can find it.</p>
<p>My typical buckets are (stolen from Simon Willison):</p>
<ul>
<li>Things I learned</li>
<li>Things I found</li>
<li>Things I built</li>
</ul>
<p>If I did one of those, found it interesting, and think someone else would find it interesting - then it becomes a seed of a post.</p>
<p>My process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log idea</li>
<li>Write quick outline - think atomic essay</li>
<li>Write post</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ul>
<p>Over 13 years and 1k+ posts this process has gotten pretty streamlined and I can usually crank out a post in &lt;1h. Probably not the best post you&#39;ve ever read (based on my low readership numbers) but it gets the idea out there which is the goal.</p>
<p>I also think it&#39;s helped that I&#39;ve kept the bar pretty low - I just want to get a basic idea out there roughly once a week. I schedule my posts weeks in advance so it&#39;s okay if I don&#39;t write anything for weeks on end. This removes a lot of the pressure that might occur to stay on schedule and/or perfect something.</p>
<p>Over the past 5 years, I&#39;ve averaged ~100 posts a year (or ~2 a week). (I&#39;ve recently realized this is equivalent to <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_blogging-a-book-a-year">~1-2 books a year</a>).</p>
<h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t regret writing so much but I do think it comes with its highs and lows.</p>
<p>Highs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can go back and reference thoughts from years (and decades!) ago - which is a cool time-traveling experience</li>
<li>Has led to discussions with many people I never thought I&#39;d get to talk to - like Dan Abramov (creator of React) and Don Syme (creator of F#) to name a few</li>
<li>Has helped make enough money to discount a lot of my project costs</li>
<li>Provides an outlet to think through ideas more thoroughly, discuss them w others, and improve my memory (see: <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2024-01_why-i-write">Why I write online as a Software Engineer</a>)</li>
<li>In some small way it feels like it improves the collective knowledge of humanity - perhaps a bit idealistic but the internet is ab as close to a planetary hivemind as we&#39;ve gotten and AI will likely move us closer</li>
<li>I get way more readership than I thought possible when I started - now averaging ab <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-reflection#share">35k a month across my properties</a> (though this is relatively small and doesn&#39;t monetize well)</li>
<li>I get to tinker with my <a href="https://hamy.xyz/notes/iamhamy-project">personal site</a> regularly which I think is a fun way to contribute to the open (and sometimes weird) web</li>
<li>Provided a platform from which to start <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HAMYLABS">my YouTube channel</a> which really helped me get over some of my stage fright - at least for presenting stuff I&#39;m familiar with</li>
</ul>
<p>Lows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most posts get very little readership</li>
<li>I make way less than minimum wage on these things</li>
<li>Some people on the internet are mean (though most criticism I get is thoughtful and kind)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-id-do-differently">What I&#39;d do differently</h2>
<p>If I started my writing career over today, a few things I&#39;d probably do differently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with an SSR blog</strong> - I like to own my own data and did way too much with Blogger, Wordpress, Medium, React, SvelteKit, various SSG frameworks. Keep it simple and write a simple web backend while owning my own data. AI makes this a lot easier I think.</li>
<li><strong>Write atomic essays from the outset</strong> - I actually had very concise posts the first few years but then got really wordy. I&#39;d honestly like to get back to more concise posts going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Be social media native</strong> - Writing more for the specific socials. If a post is published to the internet and no one&#39;s around to read it, was it published? Socials are the feed of the internet so meet the people where they are.</li>
<li><strong>Start my YouTube early</strong> - This is where a lot of my posts started getting more traction and it personally helped me a lot with my writing and delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Start hosting my media in blob storage early</strong> - I&#39;ve lost a lot of media over the years that was tied up in whatever convoluted image hosting I was using at the time. Now I just put it in blob storage so I always have it accessible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What does the future hold?</h2>
<p>Idk but I&#39;ll probably keep writing. I&#39;m sure my output will fluctuate - some years more and some less - but I think I&#39;ll keep doing at least 1 post a week. My problem is usually too many ideas / thoughts to get on paper not too little.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, I decided to start a <a href="https://hamy.xyz/notes/my-digital-garden">digital garden</a>. If nothing else, I think that will live long-term as some public wiki pages I can share out to people.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure AI will have an impact on my work as well. I&#39;m already using it to help review drafts and research topics. I could see a world where it starts writing outlines / drafts though I do feel too much of that removes the humanity from writing and that&#39;s one of the things I really like about reading people&#39;s blogs.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to monetize the blog further such that I could devote more time / energy to it. But tbh I&#39;d probably keep writing on it even if my revenue and readership dropped to ~zero. It&#39;s kind of a habit at this point and one I tend to enjoy.</p>
