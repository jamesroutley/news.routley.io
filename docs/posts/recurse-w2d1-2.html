<p>These past two days, I&#39;ve been working on what I&#39;ve been calling &#39;building reps&#39; with building games and animation.</p>
<h2 id="w2d1-space-invaders-clone">W2D1 - space invaders clone</h2>
<p>On W2D1, started on a space invaders clone to get a feel for <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/koota">koota</a> as a state management solution for JavaScript based games in general. I started building it out using p5.js as the drawing layer. Based off my lessons on the last animation, I&#39;ve done a much better job distinguishing the simulation state and how that model moves over time, from the &#39;drawing&#39; actions that derive from changes to that state.</p>
<p>Now that it&#39;s W2D2, here&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/space-invaders-p5-koota/commit/f968cc2198eb548095502eb99466d524c1c301ab">a quick snapshot</a> for where I&#39;ve gotten so far. Integrating Koota hasn&#39;t quite worked out yet, but here&#39;s some reflections on at least distinguishing the simulation from the draw:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve encapsulated the state + simulation into a lightweight object for now (perhaps, this should just be pure procedures? Not sure.)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>gameSceneState<span>.</span>sceneId <span>===</span> <span>&#34;CRAWL_INTRO&#34;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    gameSceneState<span>.</span>simulation<span>.</span><span>tick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>drawIntro</span><span>(</span>p<span>,</span> gameSceneState<span>.</span>simulation<span>.</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>gameSceneState<span>.</span>sceneId <span>===</span> <span>&#34;SPACE_INVADERS_GAME&#34;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    gameSceneState<span>.</span>simulation<span>.</span><span>tick</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>drawGame</span><span>(</span>p<span>,</span> gameSceneState<span>.</span>simulation<span>.</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>gameSceneState<span>.</span>sceneId <span>===</span> <span>&#34;END&#34;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    </code></pre>
<p>This allows me to break up the different simulations happening into different &#39;scenes&#39; that run independently of each other.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#39;m controlling the transitions between these scenes in less than optimal ways, by setting up an overly complex machine like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>gameSceneState <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    sceneId<span>:</span> <span>&#34;CRAWL_INTRO&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    simulation<span>:</span> <span>introSimulationFactory</span><span>(</span>
    p<span>,</span>
    <span>queueNextTick</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        gameSceneState <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
            sceneId<span>:</span> <span>&#34;SPACE_INVADERS_GAME&#34;</span><span>,</span>
            simulation<span>:</span> <span>gameSimulationFactory</span><span>(</span>
                p<span>,</span>
                <span>queueNextTick</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                    gameSceneState <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
                        sceneId<span>:</span> <span>&#34;END&#34;</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
                <span>}</span><span>)</span>
            <span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>}</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Definitely some cleanup and re-thinking I can do here; I basically came up with my own version of callback hell with what I have here. Trying to create something lightweight, without having to reach for a more robust solution like <a href="https://xstate.js.org/">xstate</a></p>
<p>I also ended up publishing the <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/p5-vite-typescript-template">P5, TypeScript, Vite template</a>. I used this as the starting point for my space invaders game, so it was good to get that out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="w2d2-pairing-jam">W2D2 - pairing jam</h2>
<p>There was a pairing jam set up today for the entirety of the day. I ended up pairing with <a href="https://github.com/rwhaling">rwhaling</a>. The goal there was 1) learn some React, 2) figure out how to get some kind of shared state between our &#34;React world&#34; and our P5.js world and 3) create some fun math-based animations.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, especially on the #3 front. It was also gratifying to be able to <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/p5-vite-typescript-template">use the template</a> from the day prior to get some fast environment setup.</p>
<p>We ended up with a finish product meeting our goals. It can be played <a href="https://websiteaboutmy.website/p5-react-test/">with here</a></p>
