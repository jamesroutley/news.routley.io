          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
          <p>The X-Wing  concept is based on the initial work of Professor Ian Cheeseman of the University of Southhampton,  England,  and his experiments with what some called a “Flying Stovepipe”.  Dr. Cheesman employed the Coanda principal to  create and then modulate the lift on a cylindrical rotor blade.  The Coanda principle is that if air is blown  tangentially over a surface it will adhere and follow the surface until the  curvature gets too great and it detaches.   Thus it can be used as a virtual flap on an airfoil.  He believed that such a rotor could be  stopped and started in flight if used on a winged vehicle, and employed only  for takeoff and landing.  The rotor would  then be stopped and stowed for cruise efficiency.  </p>
          
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-2.JPG" width="720" height="511" alt="x 1"/></p>
<p>Engineers at  the U.S. Navy’s David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center (DTNSRDC)  extended Professor Cheesman’s idea of lift control on a cylinder using  circulation control by blowing tangential to a rounded trailing edge of a  streamlined shape similar to a conventional airfoil.  This then evolved into the X-Wing concept  where circulation control airfoils could produce lift in either direction and allow  the rotor/wing to maintain lift and control while starting and stopping  rotation.  In 1976 DARPA (the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency) joined the Navy in X-Wing development. </p>
          <p>Quoting the winter  1982 AIAA Student Journal in an article on the X-Wing by Robert M. Williams,  DARPA Program Manager:</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/replace%20pics/X%20Wing%20Wind%20tunnel.jpg" width="540" height="373"/></p>
<p>From the  success of these tests, DARPA and the Navy, with additional support from NASA,  decided to progress to a larger-scale flight test of the X-Wing rotor/wing.  Sikorsky was contracted in 1982 for this development,  with the idea of testing the rotor/wing on the recently delivered NASA/Army/Sikorsky  RSRA (Rotor Systems Research Aircraft).   The S-72 RSRA was a unique aircraft designed solely for testing advanced  helicopter rotors.  It had a variable  incidence wing which could offload or overload the rotor’s lifting  requirements.  It had auxiliary  propulsion and drag brakes to offload or overload the rotor’s horizontal thrust  requirements.  It thus would permit  initial rotor/wing stopping and starting tests to be done in an orderly  build-up fashion, without requiring the rotor to support its full design lift  during initial conversions.  </p>
          <p>The S-72 RSRA  is described in another section of this Sikorsky Product History.  See:</p>
          <p>The X-wing was  perhaps the most technically challenging concept Sikorsky had ever worked  on.  The rotor blades have to carry lift  without the conventional helicopter’s use of centrifugal force for blade  stiffening.  The blades also have to be extremely  stiff since two of them become forward-swept wings in the stopped rotor flight  mode.  The blades have to be  “double-ended” since the blades on the retreating side of the rotor disc must  fly “backwards” in stopped rotor flight.   By using the Coanda effect to control blade lift, the helicopter’s  conventional mechanical swashplate is replaced with a valving system in the  pneumatic lines feeding air to the rotor blades.  The starting and stopping sequence requires  complex high-frequency manipulation of the circulation control valving system  to provide controllable forces and moments during the conversion process.  This requires the latest in the  state-of-the-art in computation capability to control the process. </p>
          <p>Other  technical challenges included the design of large compressor to provide the  circulation control air, and a high energy clutch and a brake to start and stop  the rotor.  Hub moment feedback was required  to control the rotor in conversion.  This  was truly a “high-risk/high-payoff” program.   Both the technical challenges and achievement of the full aircraft  potential were major steps in the state-of-the-art. </p>
          <p>Two design  teams were established at Sikorsky.  The  first concentrated on developing the X-Wing rotor/wing systems as they would be  applied to a demonstrator aircraft.  The  second worked on how to test these systems on the RSRA.  Much detailed work was required on all the disciplines  involved.  A detailed 10 foot diameter wind  tunnel model was developed to optimize the design.  Testing with this model began in December,  1985 at Sikorsky.  In June, 1986 it was  tested in the United Technologies large-scale wind tunnel for forward flight  tests prior to the actual RSRA flight test. </p>

          <p>The entire  X-Wing dynamic system was fabricated and tested on a Propulsion System Test Bed  (PSTB) at Sikorsky’s West Palm Beach Florida test facility.  Initial tests used dummy blades for development  of the pnuemodynamic system from the compressor inlet to the blade root.  Then the blades were installed for a full  system test.      </p>
          
          
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-5.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="390"/></p>
<p>A Vehicle  Management System Laboratory (VMSL) was created to develop the Vehicle  Management System (expanded flight control system) prior to its use on the  aircraft.  The four computers were tied  to a full set of aircraft sensors, hydraulics, electric power and actuation  components, as well as a fixed-base cockpit.   All the aircraft instrumentation was duplicated.  An additional computer facility provided a  simulation of the RSRA/X-Wing vehicle.   Hundreds of operational hours were accumulated on the system prior to  the start of the flight test program.  </p>
          <p>This VMSL became the prototype  for all subsequent Sikorsky flight control system integration laboratories.</p>
          <p>All of this  came together on the RSRA test aircraft.   The roll-out of the RSRA/X-wing occurred on August 19, 1986.</p>

<p>In September  1986 the aircraft was transported, via NASA’s Super Guppy KC-97 cargo aircraft,  to NASA’s Dryden Flight Test Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base in  California. </p>

<p>The flight  test program was envisioned as a gradual buildup of the envelope.  After taxi tests, the aircraft was flown  without the X-Wing blades installed to establish baseline date. </p>
          <p>RSRA was  designed to fly new rotors when they were not producing lift, and to return to  base in an emergency after the rotor blades had been severed from the rotor  head.  Thus it could fly as a fixed wing  airplane without a rotor.  When this test  occurred it was a special event for the Sikorsky team.  Igor Sikorsky spent his early career  producing fixed-wing aircraft, including the large flying boats in the  1930s.  But a new Sikorsky-designed fixed-wing  aircraft had not flown in almost a half of a century</p>
          
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-8.jpg" alt="x 8" width="720" height="472"/></p>
<p>The plan was  to then fly it first with two rotor blades, followed by four blades, with the  rotors stopped.  By mid-1987 the RSRA was  scheduled to fly with the rotor/wing turning at full speed, and by year’s end  the rotor/wing was to be stopped and started in flight.  </p>
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-9.jpg" alt="x09" width="720" height="460"/></p>
<p>But, that was  not to be.  In 1987 the Government had funding  issues and higher priorities, and decided to terminate the contract.  The program was terminated due to this lack of  funding rather than for any technical issues.  </p>

<p>The design and  fabrication of the rotor/wing was the most difficult structural challenge.  The blades could not rely on centrifugal  stiffening like a conventional helicopter since they had to operate when the  rotor was stopped.  In addition, they had  to be unusually stiff since when operating as an “X” wing two of the blades  were swept forward at 45º.   Composites  were used to provide this extreme stiffness at an acceptable weight. </p>

          <p>The blade  manufacturing and tooling challenges were unprecedented in the rotary wing  field and involved development of a unique curing process for the very thick  composite components.  New processes had  to be developed to characterize the material, define the allowable void size  and establish a quality control procedure.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-14.jpg" alt="x 14" width="360" height="88"/></p>
<p>The following  illustration shows the need for both leading and trailing edge blowing.  In rotary wing mode, air is blown out the  trailing edges of the blades.  In the  fixed wing mode, two of the blades are now flying “backwards” with blowing now  required on what was the leading edge.  During  conversion the aerodynamics get much more complicated, with circulation control  blowing required out of both the leading and trailing edges at the same time.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-15.JPG" alt="x 15" width="540" height="399"/></p>
<p>To provide the  air for the circulation control system a two-stage axial compressor was used  driven off the main gearbox. This unique compressor was developed by Pratt  &amp; Whitney in Florida.   It fed  air to a plenum mounted below the rotor concentric with the rotor shaft.  This was a pneumatic swashplate, with the  stationary element collecting air from the compressor, valves to control the  flow, and a rotating element which passed the air out to the blades.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.sikorskyarchives.com/images/images%20X-WING%20322/x-16-17.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="253"/><em></em></p>

<p>Both a high  energy clutch and brake were provided for the rotor starting and stopping operations.  The clutch  was developed by Allison.  The clutch  concept became the basis of the clutch design eventually used to manage the  lift fan on the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35.</p>

<p>A full  authority, quad redundant, digital fly-by-wire vehicle management system was  used to control the blade aerodynamics up to the fourth harmonic with rapid  response characteristics.  This was done  by controlling the pneumatic control valves in the plenum as well as the  mechanical collective pitch change mechanism and the compressor.  During the conversion process it also  controlled the clutch, the brake, and the positioning index system.  </p>
          <p>The  revolutionary flight control computer was developed by The Hamilton Standard  Division of UTC.  At the time it was the  most sophisticated system of its kind other than the space shuttle.</p>

          </em><em>Cross section of convertible engine</em></p>

<p>In a  concurrent effort, NASA and DARPA funded General Electric to develop the GE  CEST TF34 convertible engine.  This was  successfully designed and built and then tested at NASA Lewis from 1984 to  1986.  It was a modified TF-34-400B  engine and produced up to 7950 pounds of thrust with the inlet guide vanes  open, and 4650 shp plus 1650 pounds of thrust with the inlet vanes fully  closed.  This photograph shows the engine  being tested at the NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center.   </p>

          <p><strong>Concluding remarks</strong></p>
          
          <p>Over the five  years of the contract, a tremendous amount of technical work had been  accomplished and many difficult technical challenges had been resolved.  The powered wind tunnel effort, plus compressor/clutch  development, vehicle management system laboratory, system and software validation  activities, composite material development, blade and rotor head fabrication,  and appropriate risk mitigation tests were accomplished in a very few short  years.</p>
          <p>At the time of  termination the X-Wing technology was still in the development stage.  The true potential of the concept was not yet  demonstrated in flight.  Perhaps some day  it will be demonstrated and a mission capable X-Wing will enter service.</p>
          <p>With the  X-Wing program Sikorsky gained much technical experience on bearingless  composite rotors, and fly-by-wire and higher harmonic control systems, which  greatly advanced these technologies for future aircraft.  </p>
