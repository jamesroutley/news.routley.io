So they added future tax hikes that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later.</p><p>The delayed change to Section 174 — from immediate expensing of R&amp;D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods — was that kind of provision. It didn’t start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring.</p><p>The delay wasn’t a technical necessity.

Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits — scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows.</p><p>And so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&amp;D wasn’t a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. </p><p>To understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared.</p><figure id="" data-id="f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82" data-recommend-id="image://f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2667" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82.jpg"/><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82.jpg"/><img alt="Salesforce office buildings in San Francisco." data-chomp-id="f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82" data-format="jpg" data-height="2667" data-alt="Salesforce office buildings in San Francisco." data-anim-src="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82.jpg"/></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Salesforce office buildings in San Francisco.</figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jason Henry/Bloomberg<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82" data-recommend-id="image://f98c03fc6fa7849430a06662e4584a82" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2667" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h343613"><a id=""></a>The layoffs begin</h2><p>It’s no coincidence that Meta announced its “Year of Efficiency” <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/91211773/meta-platforms-2024-layoffs-reality-labs-instagram-whatsapp-year-of-efficiency&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91211773/meta-platforms-2024-layoffs-reality-labs-instagram-whatsapp-year-of-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately after</a></span> the Section 174 change took effect.

Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.cfodive.com/news/meta-microsoft-workday-join-latest-wave-of-tech-layoffs/740171/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.cfodive.com/news/meta-microsoft-workday-join-latest-wave-of-tech-layoffs/740171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whopping 60% jump</a></span> in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies — a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&amp;D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174.</p><h2 id="h343614"><a id=""></a>A crippling change even outside tech</h2><p>Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms — basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads — built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even.</p><p>The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&amp;D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not<em> </em>quite<em> </em>the same thing under what’s known as <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAAP</a></span> accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&amp;D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS.</p><p>But the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains.</p><p>The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight.</p><p>So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector.
