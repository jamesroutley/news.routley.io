    <h1>How to succeed at Meta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><li id="25197583"> <div><ul><li id="25202967"><div> <p><span>Did you even read the post? He changed one line</span></p> <p><span>13m</span> <a>3</a></p></div></li><li id="25203218"><div> <p><span>This guy gets it. I changed a couple lines though :)</span></p> <p><span>Just now</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="25197753"><div> <p><span>What an absolute toxic place to work at. You should stick to Meta and not bring your toxicity elsewhere.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="25201289"><div> <p><span>same here my entire teams codebase in azure runs on integration tests total clown shit. thankfully i just moved out of msft</span></p> </div></li><li id="25202359"><div> <p><span>Where&#39;d y&#39;all move on to? Just curious where to look that might hire cloud infra people (besides the obvious like Google and Amazon)</span></p> <p><span>39m</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="25197558"><div> <p><span>Would you apply this recipe at a startup you founded?</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="25201804"><div> <p><span>Focus on short term impact and small commits yes. The rest would be toxic. Imagine spending all your startup time writing internal only blog posts about how productive you are, with all the time to saved by writing no tests or documentation.</span></p> </div></li><li id="25202822"><div> <p><span>Yes, but that&#39;s good advice for metamates (ðŸ˜…).</span></p> <p><span>20m</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="25197846"><div> <p><span>Mostly good advice except writing tests. You should be doing test first development and 100% test coverage so that you can move fast. Writing tests isn&#39;t really about preventing bugs. It&#39;s about giving you focus so that you can move faster.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="25201000"><div> <p><span>@Uber I meanâ€¦ thereâ€™s lots of tools built into IDEs that will give you test coverage reportsâ€¦</span></p> </div></li><li id="25201685"><div> <p><span>Google you are mostly right if you want to keep the team worth staying at, OP&#39;s attitude has made my team at Meta stuck in a quagmire of broken code written by people who have since moved on.</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li><li id="25199230"><div> <p><span>What a miserable life forced to shout out &#34;look at me I did so well today please praise me&#34;. That looks like the lives of toddlers under constant watch in Chinese kindergardens. Yes that was my life back in China.</span></p> </div> <div><!----> <ul><li id="25200130"><div> <p><span>Fangwen ate his carrots this week. Improved overall school health and set a good example for his peers. He, however, snored during afternoon nap time and negatively impacted quiet time. Below expectations</span></p> </div></li><li id="25202779"><div> <p><span>Children snoring can be a serious problem, and a sign of sleep apnea which needs to be treated asap. Definitely below expectations.</span></p> <p><span>22m</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li></div></div>
