<p>The latest part of an Apple device to demand a repair by its maker appears to be the screens on newer iPads. Reports from repair shops and customers suggest that Apple Pencils no longer work properly on non-genuine Apple screens, as they draw squiggly lines on a diagonal instead of straight.</p>
<p>Ricky Panesar, CEO of UK repair firm iCorrect, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2023/07/27/apple-punishing-ipad-pro-buyers-with-new-pencil-software-lockdown/?sh=71a333304b5f">told Forbes</a> that screens replaced on newer iPad Pros (fifth and sixth-generation 12.9-inch and third and fourth-generation 11-inch models) do not deliver straight lines when an <a href="https://amzn.to/3QhfZdL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Pencil</a> is used to draw at an angle. &#34;They have a memory chip that sits on the screen that&#39;s programmed to only allow the Pencil functionality to work if the screen is connected to the original logic board,&#34; Panesar told Forbes.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/13q5dvo/jittery_diagonal_lines_on_ipad_mini_using_apple/">Reddit post from May 23</a> from a user reporting &#34;jittery&#34; diagonal lines from an Apple <a href="https://amzn.to/3QhfZdL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pencil</a> on a newly replaced iPad mini screen suggests the issue may affect more than just the Pro line of iPads.</p>

<p>Apple continues to suggest, in varying degrees of forcefulness, that it be the only company to repair its customers&#39; devices. At the least, the company seems to believe that only Apple Genuine Replacement Parts should be used by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/apple-gives-third-party-repair-shops-more-access-to-authorized-parts/">licensed technicians</a> or—with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/macbook-self-repair-program-highlights-apples-flawed-repairability-progress/">a suitcase full of tools</a>—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-soon-send-parts-and-tools-to-users-who-want-to-repair-their-phones/">individuals</a>. Every other kind of repair is subject to complications by Apple&#39;s tying of parts to individual devices, known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/france-is-fighting-to-save-your-iphone-from-an-early-death">serialization</a>. Batteries, screens, and Touch ID sensors are all subject to display warnings to users or lose some functionality when transplanted outside of Apple&#39;s repair network.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This stance, and the company&#39;s size and influence, makes Apple a primary target of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/the-same-phone-for-25-years-ifixit-on-right-to-repairs-remaining-obstacles-hope/">right-to-repair campaigns</a>, as well as legislation in the EU seeking to boost their devices&#39; interoperability, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-clock-is-rapidly-ticking-on-apples-lightning-charger/">USB-C mandates</a>.</p>
<p>This latest complaint by the repair community about screen pairing echoes an issue that arose with the then-new iPhone 13 line in 2021. Repair techs found that replacing the screen, even with a genuine Apple screen with the Face ID module laboriously transferred over (but not paired by Apple&#39;s proprietary software), would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-no-longer-break-face-id-on-repaired-iphone-13s/">disable Face ID on the device</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update">later told The Verge</a> that it would &#34;release a software update&#34; to fix the issue without detailing whether it was a bug or an intentional design choice.</p>
<p>Ars contacted Apple for comment and will update this article if we receive a response.</p>
