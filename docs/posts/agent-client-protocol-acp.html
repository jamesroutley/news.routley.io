    <h1>Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-title="Introduction" data-page-href="/overview/introduction"><p><span data-as="p">The Agent Client Protocol standardizes communication between code editors (IDEs, text-editors, etc.) and coding agents (programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code).</span>
<span data-as="p">The protocol is still under development, but it should be complete enough to build interesting user experiences using it.</span></p><h2 id="why-acp%3F"><span>Why ACP?</span></h2>
<p><span data-as="p">AI coding agents and editors are tightly coupled but interoperability isn’t the default. Each editor must build custom integrations for every agent they want to support, and agents must implement editor-specific APIs to reach users.
This creates several problems:</span></p><ul>
<li>Integration overhead: Every new agent-editor combination requires custom work</li>
<li>Limited compatibility: Agents work with only a subset of available editors</li>
<li>Developer lock-in: Choosing an agent often means accepting their available interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-as="p">ACP solves this by providing a standardized protocol for agent-editor communication, similar to how the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Language Server Protocol (LSP)</a> standardized language server integration.</span>
<span data-as="p">Agents that implement ACP work with any compatible editor. Editors that support ACP gain access to the entire ecosystem of ACP-compatible agents.
This decoupling allows both sides to innovate independently while giving developers the freedom to choose the best tools for their workflow.</span></p><h2 id="overview"><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p><span data-as="p">ACP assumes that the user is primarily in their editor, and wants to reach out and use agents to assist them with specific tasks.</span>
<span data-as="p">Agents run as sub-processes of the code editor, and communicate using JSON-RPC over stdio. The protocol re-uses the JSON representations used in MCP where possible, but includes custom types for useful agentic coding UX elements, like displaying diffs.</span>
<span data-as="p">The default format for user-readable text is Markdown, which allows enough flexibility to represent rich formatting without requiring that the code editor is capable of rendering HTML.</span></p><h2 id="supported-editors"><span>Supported Editors</span></h2>
