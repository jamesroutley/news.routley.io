<p>In the open-source world, trust, transparency, and community stewardship form the foundation of public credibility. But a recent case involving the domain name <code>putty.org</code> calls these values into question.</p>
<p>The domain, long associated by users with <strong>PuTTY</strong>, the widely-used open-source SSH and Telnet client, is not controlled by the PuTTY project itself — but by a commercial competitor: <strong>Bitvise</strong>.</p>
<p>Bitvise offers its own SSH client, and while their software is available free of charge, the company now faces criticism for its <strong>appropriation of a domain name that clearly and historically signals the PuTTY project</strong> — a project maintained for over two decades by developer <strong>Simon Tatham</strong>.</p>
<p>A visit to <code>putty.org</code> brings users to a page that references PuTTY, links to the official download site — but also prominently advertises Bitvise&#39;s own SSH client. Critics argue this amounts to misleading branding and exploitation of public trust in open-source software.</p>

<h2>Update: Bitvise escalates with personal attack after publishing private correspondence</h2>
<p>Following publication of this article, Bitvise took the unusual step of <strong>publishing the entire email exchange with the journalist on their public support site</strong>, including the journalist’s <strong>full name without consent</strong> — despite a clear request to anonymize or redact personal information.</p>
<p>When asked to censor the name, a Bitvise representative responded not with a correction, but with verbal abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lol 😂 You fucking idiot.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement — sent via the company’s official support channel — raises serious concerns not only about Bitvise’s domain practices, but also about its <strong>conduct, professionalism, and treatment of individuals engaging in legitimate inquiry</strong>.</p>
<p>The incident reflects a pattern: rather than addressing substantive criticism about its use of the <code>putty.org</code> domain, Bitvise has responded with deflection, hostility, and now a personal attack on a journalist — further distancing itself from the transparency and accountability expected in both commercial and open-source communities.</p>
<p>Requests for formal comment remain open.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>“The PuTTY project never had this domain”</h2>
<p>When approached for comment, <strong>Bitvise’s response sidestepped the ethical questions entirely</strong>, focusing instead on technicalities of ownership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The PuTTY project, or its author, did not originally own this domain. It is misleading to talk about &#39;returning&#39; a domain which the PuTTY project never had,”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked whether Bitvise would consider transferring the domain to PuTTY’s actual maintainer, or whether they believed such use could be ethically problematic, Bider replied dismissively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What you dislike is that the page appears high in search results because it provides a useful service.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He later escalated the tone further, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It speaks to the nature of someone&#39;s mind when the first thought that occurs to them is expropriation and confiscation.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A question of ethics, not legality</h2>
<p>While Bitvise claims no financial gain from the domain, the issue is not about profit, but <strong>intentional association</strong>. The choice to register <code>putty.org</code> — and use it to promote a product — inherently capitalizes on PuTTY’s reputation, regardless of whether revenue is generated directly.</p>
<p>Asked whether such use was ethically justifiable, Bitvise offered instead a philosophical statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The difference is not one of profit, it is one of philosophy. You believe software can be managed by a committee. I believe software requires an owner, otherwise it is dead.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this framing ignores the core issue: controlling a domain name that misleads users into associating Bitvise’s product with the PuTTY project. It’s not about software governance — it’s about <strong>public trust</strong> and <strong>digital responsibility</strong>.</p>
<h2>Exploiting visibility, eroding integrity</h2>
<p>Search engines treat domain names like <code>putty.org</code> as authoritative. A user looking for the PuTTY project might easily assume they are visiting an official or affiliated site. That’s what makes Bitvise’s claim of providing a “service” ring hollow: the service comes wrapped in misleading branding that benefits the company at the expense of clarity.</p>
<p>Digital rights advocates argue that <strong>just because a domain is legally available doesn’t mean it should be claimed</strong>, especially when it mimics a widely known, community-driven project.</p>
<p>As the open-source community continues to grapple with questions of ownership, sustainability, and trust, this case serves as a potent example of how ethical lines can blur in the space between legality and legitimacy.</p>
<p>So far, <strong>Bitvise has shown no sign of releasing the domain</strong> — and no willingness to address the broader ethical dilemma behind their actions. Their responses raise a final question:</p>
