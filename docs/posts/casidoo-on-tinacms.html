				<p>Helllloooo so it’s been a minute! And… for good reason.</p>
<p>I have a workflow that somewhat works well for me in which I write my blog posts in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (with a template that helps me add tags and a description and stuff), and then when I want to post them, I copy and paste the post into the repository here, and then if I have images, I add the images to the repo, and then check all of the paths for it, and then ship it.</p>
<p>It works well, BUT there’s just enough overhead that sometimes I don’t write a post because there’s a few too many steps. I have a few partially-written posts that I haven’t published yet, because I keep thinking about the things getting in my way post-writing. I thought it would be nice to have a web interface for easily publishing blog posts here!</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what CMS I’d use, because so many of them require quite a bit of setup, or they have more of a GUI interface rather than a markdown-oriented one. But, then I saw <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/09/smashing-magazine-tinacms-manage-editorial-workflow/">this blog post about how Smashing Magazine uses TinaCMS</a> and it looked like the perfect solution for me! I love the idea of being able to have everything be Git-based, markdown-based, and very lightweight. I was able to configure <a href="https://tina.io/">Tina</a> pretty quickly (I <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo">streamed</a> it and luckily a core team member was in the chat and able to help me a bit when I was misunderstanding things) and it didn’t mess up my existing codebase in any way!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I spoke at <a href="https://cfe.dev/events/codeword-conf-2023/">CodeWord Conf</a>, and something that Chris Coyier said in his segment stuck with me when he talked about his consistency: the fact that he can just type into a CMS and hit send, with minimal things getting in his way, has kept him more consistent in his writing. I do prefer Markdown and my usual local-first workflow, but the fact that I could spit out a blog quickly without any sort of copying and pasting or editing is something I’m excited to try.</p>
<p>This is the first post I’ve written and published with TinaCMS, and we’ll see how I like it over time!</p>
