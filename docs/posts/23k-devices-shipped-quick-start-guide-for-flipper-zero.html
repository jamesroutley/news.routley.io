            <p>Many backers have already received their Flipper Zeros, and their number is growing by the day. At the time of writing,<strong> 23 thousand devices have already been shipped</strong>! We&#39;re getting a ton of feedback from users and it&#39;s amazing. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/how_to_use_flipper_zero.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/how_to_use_flipper_zero.jpeg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/how_to_use_flipper_zero.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/how_to_use_flipper_zero.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This is a manual for the first launch of Flipper Zero: it explains how to update the firmware, install databases to an SD card, and more. <strong>Please read it carefully before using your Flipper Zero </strong>as it&#39;s a rather advanced piece of hardware, and many things may not be obvious. Read the <a href="https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/first-start">First Start</a> section of the documentation for more details.</p><blockquote>Flipper Zero firmware is under active development and is constantly changing thanks to community input. Therefore, it is important to us that community members understand the device&#39;s internal architecture, how the firmware works, how to debug it and how to collect logs. We&#39;re counting on the community to improve Flipper Zero together with us.</blockquote><h2 id="power-on">Power ON </h2><p>As a safety precaution, Flipper travels in the box in transport mode. In this mode, power is supplied only to the internal clock of the microcontroller. You can read more about the different power modes in the <a href="https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/power">Power</a> section of the documentation.</p><figure><div><video src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/media/2022/02/flipper_power_on.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1920x1080/0a/spacer.png" width="1920" height="1080" loop="" autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="metadata"></video><div><div><p><span>0:00</span></p><p>/<span></span></p></div></div></div></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

Flipper&#39;s battery may be completely discharged, so it won&#39;t turn on right away. Plug the USB cable to charge it and it will turn on automatically.
     </p></div>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="install-an-sd-card">Install an SD card </h2><p>Keys, cards, remotes, and databases are stored on the SD card. It&#39;s also required during firmware updates, so it&#39;s important to <strong>install the SD card BEFORE updating the firmware</strong>. Flipper supports large-capacity SD cards, but we recommend using an SD card no larger than 16GB or 32GB. Since Flipper Zero utilizes very small files rarely exceeding 1MB in size, it makes no sense to use large SD cards. You can read more in the <a href="https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/sd-card">SD card Setup</a> section of the documentation.</p><figure><div><video src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/media/2022/05/Flipper_Sd_Mount3_compressed.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1280x720/0a/spacer.png" width="1280" height="720" loop="" autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="metadata"></video><div><div><p><span>0:00</span></p><p>/<span></span></p></div></div></div><figcaption>SD card installation</figcaption></figure><p>The SD card should snap into place inside the port, in order for this to happen it needs to be pushed a little deeper into the case. You will need to push the card for it to lock inside using your fingernail or something thin. This may not always work with short nails – here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVAd5Ldrqc">video on how to push the SD card into the slot</a> in such cases.</p><p>If the SD card is successfully mounted, you will find a little SD card icon on the top bar: </p><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/sd_card_mounted.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1034" height="660" srcset="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/sd_card_mounted.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/sd_card_mounted.png 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/sd_card_mounted.png 1034w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>SD card mount status</figcaption></figure><p>If your SD card fails to mount, it probably has an incompatible file system.

In order for it to work, the SD card must be formatted to either FAT32 or exFAT.</p><p>We recommend formatting the SD card using Flipper&#39;s built-in format tool. You can do this by navigating to the following menu:  <code>Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Format SD Card</code></p><figure><div><video src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/media/2022/02/Flipper_SdFormat_compressed.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1264x534/0a/spacer.png" width="1264" height="534" loop="" autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="metadata"></video><div><div><p><span>0:00</span></p><p>/<span></span></p></div></div></div><figcaption>How to format SD card on Flipper Zero</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-sd-card-to-get">What SD card to get?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/hqdefault.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="480" height="360"/><figcaption>Not all SD cards are equal</figcaption></figure><p>Not all SD cards are made equal. High-quality branded SD cards have several physical interfaces that can be used for connecting to a device — SDIO and SPI.</p><p>There are many cheap counterfeit and off-brand SD cards on the market, which don&#39;t have all interfaces working stably. In some cases, one SD card works fine over the high-speed SDIO interface but works poorly and is unstable over SPI. Flipper uses SPI, so it&#39;s important to choose a high-quality branded SD card for your Flipper Zero.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
  <div>
    
    <!-- Текст баббла --><p>
All modern smartphones and computers connect to the SD card via the high-speed SDIO interface, but Flipper uses a power-saving and slow SPI interface. This interface is not as popular with cheap counterfeit SD cards and the SPI mode is often poorly implemented. Therefore, it is important to use branded original SD cards.

You can find the average SD card speed on the <a href="https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/sd-card#78-speed-test-results">SD Card speed test</a> documentation page. It&#39;s ok if the values you&#39;re getting are slightly higher or lower. If you&#39;re having problems with an SD card, the best advice we can give is to simply try another one.</p><h2 id="what-is-stored-on-the-sd-card">What is stored on the SD card?</h2><p>The SD card is necessary to unleash the full potential of Flipper Zero. It stores auxiliary files that we call databases. Many Flipper Zero features will not work properly without a relevant database on the SD card. You can find a detailed description of files stored on the SD card here: <a href="https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-sd-card-examples">flipperzero-sd-card-examples</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The databases are copied to the SD card during the last part of the firmware update process. That is why it&#39;s important to perform the update with the SD card already in place. All user keys, signals, cards, and remotes are also stored on the SD card. You can access these files through qFlipper or through the Flipper Mobile Apps.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/3a3dcf9990af34a4b05aa435999500b614f0ac99.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1724" height="1064" srcset="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/3a3dcf9990af34a4b05aa435999500b614f0ac99.png 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/3a3dcf9990af34a4b05aa435999500b614f0ac99.png 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/3a3dcf9990af34a4b05aa435999500b614f0ac99.png 1600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/3a3dcf9990af34a4b05aa435999500b614f0ac99.png 1724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>qFlipper file manager</figcaption></figure><p>You can also access files on an SD card at any time by plugging it into a computer.

All problems related to DFU mode will disappear when we switch to the new self-update method using the SD card. After that Flipper will only be recognized as a COM port device during the update process. This will also allow us to update via Bluetooth using mobile apps.

Here is what we faced and solved since the last post:</p><ul><li>TI CC1101, the chip powering the Sub-Ghz feature, is in extreme shortage. To date, the supplier has shipped just a fraction of our initial order. The same situation is with our LED driver — TI LP5562. To overcome this we have to purchase these components on the spot-buy market at a much, much higher price (3-5x for CC1101 and 20-30x for LP5562)</li><li>Battery supply chain issues. We&#39;ve sourced a new supplier and reworked our supply chain to be more redundant in the battery department</li><li>The last batch of USB cables we received was partially corroded on the metal part. Units packed with such cables had to be reworked and incoming quality control procedures had to be improved</li><li>8k pieces of Top Cover body part had an excess rib in the internal structure that caused a failed assembly. Those parts had to be reworked if possible and replaced completely if not</li></ul><p>Our production team works 24/7 to keep the production running non-stop and overcome these issues as well as many less significant, but still disturbing ones. However, we&#39;ve come a long way already and we are sure that all the orders will be shipped despite all the difficulties and challenges. <strong>We thank you for your patience and continuous support.</strong></p><p>Here is an afterword, unedited text from the co-founder of the project Pavel <a href="https://twitter.com/zhovner">@Zhovner</a>, all punctuation, and spelling are preserved:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/photo_2019-11-19_20-18-14-3.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="846" srcset="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/photo_2019-11-19_20-18-14-3.jpg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/photo_2019-11-19_20-18-14-3.jpg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2022/05/photo_2019-11-19_20-18-14-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><blockquote>Today we can confidently say that we have won. This is a real genuine victory! Every day new problems and issues threatened us with a complete fail. Component crises, supply disruptions, production problems, lockdowns, COVID and wars – all this at any moment could turn us into another scam project from Kickstarter that did not fulfill its obligations. </blockquote>
