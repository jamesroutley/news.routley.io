    <h1>LDAPjs decomissioned by maintainer over hateful email</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This project has been decomissioned. I, James Sumners, took it on when it was
languishing without any maintenance as it filled a need in the ecosystem and
I had built things at a prior organization that depended upon this project.
I spent a lot of time triaging issues and reworking things toward a path
that could be more easily maintained by a community of volunteers. But I have
not had the time to dedicate to this project in quite a while. There are
outstanding issues that would take me at least a week of dedicated development
time to solve, and I cannot afford to take time off of work to do that.
Particularly considering that the aforementioned organization was two
jobs ago, and it is extremely unlikely that I will transition to a role again
that will need this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, why am I just now deciding to decomission this project? Because today,
2024-05-14, I received the following email:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/blob/master/dt.png"><img src="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/raw/master/dt.png" alt="Abusive email"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I will not tolerate abuse, and I especially will not tolerate tacit death
threats, over a hobby. You can thank the author of that email for the
decomissioning on this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">My recommendation to you in regard to LDAP operations: write a gateway in a
language that is more suited to these types of operations. I&#39;d suggest
<a href="https://go.dev" rel="nofollow">Go</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: if I ever do need this project again, I might revive it. But I&#39;d fight
hard for my suggestion above. Also, I will consider turning it over to an
interested party, but I will require at least one recommendation from a
Node.js core contributor that I can vet with the people that I know on that
team.</p>
