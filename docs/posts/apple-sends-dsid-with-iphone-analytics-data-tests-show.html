Apple collects that same ID number along with information for your<!-- --> Apple ID, which means the DSID is<!-- --> directly tied to your full name, phone number, birth date, email address and more, according to Mysk’s tests<!-- -->.<br/></p><p>According to Apple’s analytics policy, “Personal data is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy, or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple.” But Mysk’s tests show that show that the DSID, which is directly tied to your name, is sent to Apple in the same packet as all the other analytics information.<br/></p><p>“Knowing the DSID is like knowing your name. It’s one-to-one to your identity,” said Tommy Mysk, an <!-- -->app developer and security researcher, who ran the test along with his partner Talal Haj Bakry. “All these detailed analytics are going to be linked directly to you. And  that’s a problem, because there’s no way to switch it off.”</p><p>The findings worsen recent discoveries about Apple’s privacy problems and promises<!-- -->.

The company hasn’t said anything publicly about the apparent  contradictions in its privacy promises, or the recent lawsuit.</p><p>Theoretically, Apple might argue that an ID number isn’t personal information. But the GDPR, the mammoth <!-- -->European privacy law which set the standard for data regulation world wide, defines personal data as any information that “directly or indirectly” identifies a person, including ID numbers.<br/></p><p>“I think people should be upset about this,” Mysk said. “This isn’t Google. people opt for iPhone because they think these kinds of things aren’t going to happen. Apple doesn’t have the right to keep an eye on you.” <br/></p><p>Mysk published information about the test in a Twitter thread late <!-- -->Sunday.</p><p>In some cases, this analytics data apparently includes details about your every move. Mysk’s tests show that analytics for the App St<!-- -->ore, for example, includes every  single thing you did in real time, including what you tapped on,  which apps you search  for, what ads you saw, and how long you looked at  a given app and how you found it. You can see the data, which is sent in real time, in a video on the Mysk YouTube channel. <br/></p><p>Over the course of these tests, the researchers checked their work on two  different devices. First, they used a jail<!-- -->broken iPhone running iOS  14.6, which allowed them to decrypt the traffic and examine exactly what  data was being sent. Apple introduced a privacy setting in iOS  14.5 that prevents other companies from harvesting data called App Tracking Transparency<!-- -->, cuing users to decide whether or not to give their data to  individual apps with the prompt “<span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-s-ask-app-not-to-track-prompt-helped-tiktok-1849772915&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-s-ask-app-not-to-track-prompt-helped-tiktok-1849772915">Ask app not to track?</a></span>”<br/></p><p>The  researchers also examined a regular iPhone running iOS 16, the latest  operating system, which bolstered their findings. <!-- -->The researchers couldn’t examine exactly what data was sent because the phone’s encryption remained intact, but the similarities to the tests on the jailbroken phone suggest the patterns they found there<!-- --> may be the <!-- -->standard<!-- --> on the iPhone. <!-- -->There is little reason  to think that the jail<!-- -->broken phone would send different data, they  said, but On iOS 16, they saw the same apps sending similar packets of  data to the same Apple web addresses. The data was transmitted at the  same times under the same circumstances, and turning the available  privacy settings on and off likewise didn’t change anything.</p><p>It’s possible that Apple processes DSID<!-- --> data to shelter personally identifying details when the company receives the information, separating your personal information from other data<!-- -->. But there’s no way to know, because so far Apple seems unwilling to explain its practices. The company<!-- --> may not use the data if you  turn  the related privacy settings  off, despite still receiving it, <!-- -->but that’s not how the company explains what  the  settings do in  its <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/device-analytics/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/device-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a></span>.<br/></p><p>The <!-- -->findings are especially damning given the years Apple spent rebranding itself as a privacy company. Apple’s recent marketing campaigns suggest the company’s privacy practices are supposed to be far better than other tech companies. It emblazoned 40-foot billboards of the iPhone with the simple slogan  “Privacy. That’s iPhone.” and ran the ads across the world for months.<br/></p><p>But Apple is making strides to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://gizmodo.com/apple-app-store-ads-today-tab-homepage-1849694826&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-app-store-ads-today-tab-homepage-1849694826">build an advertising empire</a></span> of its own, built on the personal data of its billions of users.

In the past, “I would always allow the app to share analytics with Apple, because I want to help them,” Mysk said. “But I always assumed the data was going to be sent out in an anonymous way.”</p></div></div>
