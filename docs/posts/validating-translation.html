    <h1>Validating Translation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><time>September 1, 2022</time></p><div>
<p>Given a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#dfn-representation">representation</a> of (meta)data
that <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo">dcterms:conformsTo</a> some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#dfn-data-profile">data
profile</a>, you may wish to translate it to
another data profile.</p>
<p>If a resource is accesible from an HTTP server, then as a client you may <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">negotiate the content
representation</a> in a standard
way. Traditional content negotiation (aka “conneg”) is limited to file formats, aka syntax rather
than semantics, but <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/">content negotiation by profile</a> (aka “connegp”)
can facililate translation.</p>
<p>There may be many ways to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#dfn-functional-specification">functionally
specify</a> data profile
negotiation, i.e. translation. Ultimately, one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#dfn-functional-profile">functional
profile</a> is employed for a given
instance of translation.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that one way to “validate translation” would be to identify the functional profile
employed and trace process outputs for conformance.</p>
<p>I’m really getting into weeds here, aren’t I? My insistence on exploring the cross product of
{identifying,validating,indexing,translating,tracing} \(\times\)
{identifiers,validators,indexers,translators,tracers} to elucidate FAIR-enabling services is a bit
dizzying. I shall cautiously continue.</p>
