			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Minimal Gallery was accidentally brought to life when I started collecting websites as inspiration for client projects, screenshotting and categorizing them for better organization. And never stopped.</p>
			<p>It became one of the leading web design galleries, followed by tens of thousands of designers, developers, agencies, marketing specialists and entrepreneurs all over the world – to this day curated by myself on a daily basis.</p>
			<p><i>If you arrived here through thegallery.io - <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manu</a> was kind enough to gift me his old domain. Big thanks!</i></p>

			<h2>Sponsor</h2>
			<p>This website has been running since almost a decade but has never earned any money whatsoever. I would love to change that.</p>
			<p>A few requirements your product needs to fulfil:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fit the design &amp; tech category</li>
				<li>Meet a high design standard</li>
				<li>Of course not be morally reprehensible</li>
			</ul>

				<li>If it&#39;s a theme, domain or typeface for sale, you will receive a payment link for $25. This keeps this project running, I appreciate the support.</li>
				<li>It might take a few days for me to review your website.</li>
				<li>I can not accept every submission. Don’t be disappointed, try it again with your next project.</li>
