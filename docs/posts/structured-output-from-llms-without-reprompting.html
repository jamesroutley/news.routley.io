<p>Hello! Today is the day!</p>

<p><strong>The Illustrated Guide to Audio Formats</strong> and <strong>The Illustrated Guide to Film Formats</strong> are now available (or can become available) everywhere books are sold!</p>

<p><a href="https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/books/">Buy ‘em now!</a></p>

<p>You can also visit my <a href="https://bookshop.org/contributors/ashley-blewer">Author page on Bookshop.org</a> or my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ashley-Blewer/author/B0B6CW37SQ">Author page on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>These books are arriving <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2022/08/06/the-illustrated-guide-to-video-formats-now-available/">one year after</a> the first of the series, The Illustrated Guide to Video Formats, was published. It’s been a huge amount of work researching formats, selecting and narrowing down to 36 formats, building websites, drafting illustrations, refining details, working with fact-checkers, assembling, proofing, re-proofing, finalizing, re-finalizing, final_final_finalFINALversion-checking, and publishing.</p>

<p>Please consider picking up a copy or sharing widely with your friends. Especially with the recent stratification of social media, it’s harder to get the word out!</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Media Guides have a dedicated website where you can grab or share the illustrations and data anytime: https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/</p>

<p>I want to thank my reviewers: Susie Cummings and Andrew Weaver (Audio), C. Diaz and David Neary (Film).</p>

<p>In other great news, all three books have been <em>translated into Spanish</em>! The translation work is complete (link available <a href="https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/data/">on the Media Guides website</a>), and I’ll be working through updating the page layouts and doing other steps required to publish. The translation was done by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriadavila">Valeria Dávila</a>, and she was absolutely a joy to work with – very thorough and exactly perfect, every time! I am aiming to publish these by November.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2022/05/09/accidentally-making-a-book-video-format-illustrations/">a little bit about this</a>, but as much of my creation process was open source, unless it was not possible (for example, uploading to publishing platforms and digital proof review – its out of my hands at that point). See that linked post for more details.</p>
