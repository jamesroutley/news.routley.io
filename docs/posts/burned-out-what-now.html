      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;ve been feeling off in several ways for a long time now, months if not more, and finally got around to seeing some healthcare professionals. &#34;Showing symptoms of severe occupational burnout&#34; is what I&#39;m being told, and it rings true.<p>I know there are probably plenty of people on HN who have gone through the same. Reflecting back on your experiences, what are the sensible things to do next? Aside from continuing to listen to the aforementioned healthcare professionals, that is.</p><p>Some questions I&#39;m wondering about, specifically:</p><p>- Should I tell my boss and/or team? Should I tell them right away, or wait until I know what other steps I want to take? What should I expect their reactions to be?</p><p>- Should I take time off? How much? Or should I try to work reduced hours? I&#39;m hesitant because I don&#39;t have many hobbies (if any) and in the middle of the pandemic there isn&#39;t much to do anyway. I don&#39;t think running out of things to do would be any better for my health than continuing as-is. I&#39;ve been there before and I don&#39;t handle boredom well.</p><p>- If I continue working, is there something in my working environment I should try to change? Think of senior engineer in a typical DevOps-y SaaS startup.</p><p>- Is there anything specific to working in tech and burning out that I should know about? I feel like this isn&#39;t exactly rare.</p></td></tr>
