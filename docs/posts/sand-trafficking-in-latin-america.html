    <h1>Sand trafficking in Latin America</h1>

		<p>Just 50 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro’s world-famous beaches, one of the city’s most powerful gangsters found a fortune to be made in sand. </p><p>Before he turned himself in to the authorities in December 2023, Luis Antonio da Silva Braga, alias “Zinho,” headed the Bonde do Zinho militia. And beyond its criminal interests in Rio, the group had branched out to the nearby municipality of Seropédica, allegedly working with a Rio de Janeiro state legislator to use floating dredgers, trucks, tractors, backhoes, and silos to illegally scoop up huge amounts of sand.</p><p>Satellite photos show the extent of the extraction between about 2011 and 2017.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-1024x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-300x300.png?crop=1 300w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-150x150.png?crop=1 150w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-768x768.png 768w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-800x800.png?crop=1 800w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-600x600.png?crop=1 600w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-400x400.png?crop=1 400w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-200x200.png?crop=1 200w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-706x706.png 706w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1-100x100.png?crop=1 100w, https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Imagem1.png 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/><figcaption>Source: Luis Fernando Ramadon, with images from Google Earth</figcaption></figure><p>Most illegally mined sand is used in the construction sector for materials like concrete and bricks as well as for foundation bedding. It is cheaper than legally mined sand, and scant oversight by authorities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean has made sand trafficking a relatively profitable and low-risk activity for criminal groups throughout the region. </p><p>But the crime is difficult to police, since differentiating between sand extracted legally and illegally is often impossible. </p><blockquote><p><strong><mark>SEE ALSO: </mark></strong>Q&amp;A: <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/sand-trafficking-brazil-lucrative-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Sand Trafficking in Brazil Became a Highly Lucrative Crime</a></p></blockquote><p>“If you’ve got a truckload of illegal sand, it looks exactly the same as a truck of legally mined sand,” Vince Beiser, author of a history of humans’ use of sand, told InSight Crime.</p><h2 id="h-brazil">Brazil</h2><p>Illegal sand extraction is one of the most profitable illicit industries in Brazil, and in much of the country, illegal sand use outstrips legal sand.</p><p>Powerful militias like Zinho’s steal sand to supply the irregular real estate market, then continue to make money by <a href="https://www.cartacapital.com.br/sociedade/entenda-como-e-a-exploracao-imobiliaria-da-milicia-apontada-como-motivacao-para-o-assassinato-de-marielle/#:~:text=Dados%20da%20prefeitura%20do%20Rio,de%20reais%20para%20os%20criminosos." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monopolizing services for the residents</a> of the illegally constructed buildings.</p><p>The lack of effective regulation has led to some of these apartment buildings <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/militias-become-luxury-real-estate-barons-rio-de-janeiro/">collapsing</a>.

Though they do not operate on the industrial scale seen in Seropédica, they have been accused of recruiting minors and employing people under slave-like conditions.</p><p>“<em>Carroceiros</em> sell sand to building material stores that act outside of the law, which encourages illegal sand extraction,” Ramadon told InSight Crime. </p><h2 id="h-colombia">Colombia</h2><p>In neighboring Colombia, criminal groups – some with ties to political and economic elites – have turned to sand trafficking to diversify their illicit businesses and increase their profits.</p><p>Sand mining gained prominence in Colombia during the 1990s, with the increase in urbanization on the country’s Caribbean coast. As much as half of the sand used in Colombia may be mined illegally, according to some estimates.</p><p>The Caribbean department of Magdalena has been particularly affected. Authorities there responded in May to reports of illegal sand extraction in the rural area of Pivijay and caught people extracting sand in dump trucks without authorization.</p><p>Magdalena’s political elite have previously been tied to the trade. In 2017, the government said illegal sand extraction was taking place on the property of a prominent lawyer who later ran for mayor in the area. </p><p>In the nearby Caribbean department of Córdoba, sand traffickers seem to have been willing to kill for the sake of their business. Colombian journalist Rafael Moreno was murdered in 2016 after he <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/assassination-of-rafael-moreno-revealing-the-millions-embezzled-in-colombia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denounced</a> illegal sand extraction linked to a politically prominent family. </p><h2 id="h-mexico">Mexico</h2><p>In Mexico, illegal sand extraction has also been tied to elite corruption.</p><p>Legally registered companies with permission to mine sand flaunt legal regulations,  and are protected by corrupt local officials, researchers say. Illegal sand extraction often goes unreported due to fears of violent repercussions for whistleblowers.</p><p>Some Mexican sand mafias may export their product to the United States, though the issue has not received as much attention from authorities as the smuggling of drugs and people across the border.</p><p>Beiser said legal sand mining has gotten public pushback due to its effects on water quality, which could be pushing construction companies in the border region to use illegal sand.</p><p>“I would not at all be surprised to learn that illegal sand mining is feeding San Diego’s market now,” Beiser said.</p>	</div></div>
