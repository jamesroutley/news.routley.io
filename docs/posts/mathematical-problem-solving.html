<h2>Organization</h2>



<h2>Course description</h2>

<p>An introduction to mathematical problem solving.
We will learn techniques and tools for solving problems of the kind that appear in mathematical competitions and journals.
These techniques (like induction, the Pigeonhole Principle, modular arithmetic or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) have uses all over mathematics; we will explore these uses through hands-on problem solving.
</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Math 200. <!-- [Min Grade: D]. --> </p>

<h2>Grading and policies</h2>

<div>
<dl>
  <dt>Grading matrix:</dt>
  <dd><ul>
         <li> 100%: homework sets. (Homework set #0 is worth 20 points; homework set #8 is worth 0 points; each remaining homework set is worth 50 points.) </li>
         <!--
         <li> 30%: homework sets (the lowest score will be dropped if all homework sets are submitted). </li>
         -->
      </ul> </dd>
  <dt>Grade scale:</dt>
  <dd>These numbers are <strong>tentative and subject to change</strong>:
      <ul>
         <li> A: (50%, 100%]. </li>
         <li> B: (40%, 50%]. </li>
         <li> C: (20%, 45%]. </li>
         <li> D: [0%, 20%]. </li>
      </ul> </dd>
  <dt>Homework policy:</dt>
  <dd><ul>
         <li> Collaboration and reading is allowed, but you have to write solutions in your own words and <strong>acknowledge all sources that you used</strong>. </li>
         <li> Asking outsiders (anyone apart from Math 235 students and Drexel staff) for help with the problems is <strong>not</strong> allowed. (In particular, you cannot post homework as questions on math.stackexchange before the due date!) </li>
         <li> Late homework will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. <!-- (But keep in mind that the lowest homework score will be dropped.) --> </li>
         <li> Solutions have to be submitted electronically via Gradescope in a format I can read (PDF, TeX or plain text if it works; <strong>no doc/docx!</strong>). If you submit a PDF, make sure that it is readable and does not go over the margins. If there are problems with submission, send your work to me by email for good measure. </li>
      </ul> </dd>
  <dt>Expected outcomes:</dt>
  <dd>Students should have obtained some hands-on experience solving competition-type mathematical problems. They should be aware of standard problem solving techniques in mathematics (such as the pigeonhole and extremal principles) and be familiar with examples of their application. </dd>
