    <p>I&#39;ve been happily using an iPhone 8 for the last 7 years. It has been, and still is, a perfect smartphone. I&#39;ve never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I&#39;ve never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.</p>
<p>About a year ago the battery wasn&#39;t making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.</p>
<p>But then this year,  <em>it started happening</em>. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device&#39;s release date. So I&#39;m stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.</p>
<p>And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly functional iPhone that is becoming obsolete, not through any fault of its own or depreciation of the hardware, but due to dwindling support. And the worst part is, I get it! Very few people keep a phone for 7 years. Apple seems to be the best at supporting older devices, and yet I don&#39;t actually expect them to support hardware for longer than that.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&#39;m being punished for taking good care of my stuff.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the iPhone 16 in the hopes that it&#39;ll last the longest (6 years of software updates starting this year, let&#39;s go!). And on setting it up I realise that it does exactly the same stuff that my iPhone 8 does. But the number is doubled from 8 to 16...so why doesn&#39;t it feel like it&#39;s twice as good?</p>
<p>Now it doesn&#39;t fit in my hand properly, all new iPhones are veritable tablets. I also miss TouchID. The new camera is fine.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going nowhere with this post. I&#39;m trying to voice my frustration with something that is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that I&#39;ve been forced to upgrade to something worse.</p>
