<p>I grew up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolt_Cola">Jolt Cola</a>. After the original Jolt left Sweden in 2009, my friend group tried dozens of colas to replace it. Other greats like Premier Extreme Cola also eventually disappeared. In 2013, <a href="https://www.voltcola.com/">Volt Cola</a> came to save the day, and I was back on the juice.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-for-some-health-concerns">If not for some health concerns.</h2>

<p>All that sugar. Dad always reminds me: <em>You&#39;ll get diabetes. Have a coffee.</em> But I never liked it. Bitter and sour at the same time. On top of that, it&#39;s served scalding hot.</p>

<p>Even so, for health, I find myself yet again giving it a go.</p>

<p>Youtube coffee legend James Hoffmann introduced me to the concept of lightly roasted coffee. Here in Sweden, it is customary to roast and brew coffee the same color as your soul: dark and ragged. The idea that coffee can have any taste other burnt rubber was interesting.</p>

<p>I acquired a cheap grinder and a <a href="https://cleverbrewing.coffee/">Clever Dripper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-beans">The beans</h2>

<p>Then I tried a lot of coffees. These are the few beans that I think taste good (on most days). My preference is light and juicy coffee.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kichawir</li>
<li>Hunkute</li>
</ul>

<p>I will add to this list as I find new coffees.
If you have bean recommendations, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@xinux:matrix.znurre.com">hit me up on Matrix</a>.
Google is your friend for finding roasters.</p>
