    <h1>Svelte is surprisingly easy to learn</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><div id="post-content-wrapper">
<p>What if I told you, You don&#39;t need to learn svelte! Not because svelte is bad, or not worth learning. It&#39;s quite the opposite. You don&#39;t need to learn it because you already know it! <em>Dan Dan Daaaannn...</em></p>
<p>You&#39;ve been working with JavaScript, crafting web marvels and wrangling code like a seasoned pro. You&#39;ve tamed the wild async functions, navigated the treacherous waters of callbacks, and even had a dance-off with the quirky <code>this</code> keyword. So, <strong>why on Earth would you need to learn something new</strong>?</p>
<h3 id="heading-what-is-this">What is this?</h3>
<p>In this journey <strong>we uncover a superpower, hidden deep inside you</strong>, buried under mounds of react wrappers and redux sagas. Today, you&#39;ll come to realize that Svelte is not some arcane magic potion you need to memorize incantations or syntax for. <strong>It&#39;s JavaScript, with a sleek makeover and a secret identity.</strong></p>
<p>By the end of this article, <strong>you&#39;ll find that you don&#39;t need to</strong> learn <strong>Svelteâ€”it&#39;s practically dÃ©jÃ  vu with a futuristic twist!</strong></p>
<p>Svelte is suprisingly easy to learn, and it&#39;s still pretty awesome! So, Let&#39;s get to it!</p>

<p>Svelte is a UI framework (we don&#39;t shy away from that word here, unlike some other &#34;libraries&#34;, ahem ahem...), that&#39;s compiled, compact and complete!</p>
<p>It&#39;s extremely fast, easy to use and also <a target="_blank" href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies">the most admired JS Web framework according to Stack Overflow Survey</a>.</p>

<h2 id="heading-compiled">Compiled</h2>
<p>With Svelte, there&#39;s no runtime needed. No need to send a few kilobytes of &#34;SvelteJS&#34; runtime on every website you ever built/will build. It&#39;s just a compiler with targets to &#34;document.getElementById&#34; instead of machine code.</p>
<h2 id="heading-concise">Concise</h2>
<p>Svelte lets you write beautiful syntax, you know it already! It&#39;s HTML CSS and JS (it&#39;s like the Avengers of web languages, teaming up to form something magnificent). Svelte compiles it down to extremely fast and optimized JS.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like having your cake and eating it too, except it&#39;s code, and you&#39;re making it run faster than a caffeine-infused squirrel.</p>
<h2 id="heading-complete">Complete</h2>
<p>Svelte comes with a state management solution (one of the best I&#39;ve seen till now), and component-scoped styling (no styled components needed). It even has motion primitives for those jazzy animations that make users go &#34;oooh&#34; and &#34;ah.&#34;</p>
<p>So, while you were busy <code>npm install</code>ing the bare essentials for your projects, Svelte was chilling in the corner, whispering, &#34;I&#39;ve got this, fam.&#34;</p>

<p>Love it or hate it, Javascript is a very useful technology, and all the libraries, frameworks, and &#34;meta&#34; frameworks, are nothing but abstractions over JS (mostly leaky ones).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693294080856/65301be7-5198-4b58-bf0b-a64e85edf472.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>That&#39;s where Svelte shines, even though it&#39;s another &#34;web framework&#34;, It doesn&#39;t throw a bunch of alien syntax at you, expecting you to decipher it like an ancient scroll. No, Svelte takes the familiar, battle-tested primitives, syntax, and concepts of JavaScript and weaves them into its fabric.</p>
<p>So, while other frameworks might introduce themselves with an air of mystique, Svelte strides in with a friendly nod, saying, &#34;Hey, it&#39;s all JavaScript here. Let&#39;s create something amazing together.&#34;</p>

<p>Okay, Okay, I see you react lovers (I&#39;m one too!), you might not be convinced yet. Here are a few examples to tip you to the right side...</p>
<h2 id="heading-effectsreactivity">Effects/Reactivity</h2>
<p>With react, here&#39;s what&#39;s needed to make something run every time a dependency changes</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Component</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    useEffect(<span>() =&gt;</span> {
        <span>console</span>.log(<span>&#34;Count Changed!&#34;</span>, count)
    }, [count])

    <span>return</span> 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not so bad, is it? Now see what it translates to in svelte</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
    <span>$</span>: {
        <span>console</span>.log(<span>&#34;Count Changed!&#34;</span>, count)
    }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>


</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it! Svelte automatically tracks dependencies, and you only need to label a code block as reactive (<code>$:</code>). It&#39;ll run the code any time those dependencies change.</p>
<h2 id="heading-storesstate-management">Stores/State Management</h2>
<p>While in react, you might go with complex setups like zustand, react-query or redux. Svelte gives you an in-built solution. A fascinating, cutting-edge idea called &#34;pub-sub&#34;. Yupp, it&#39;s that dumb.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> counts = writable({
    <span>a</span>: <span>0</span>,
    <span>b</span>: <span>0</span>,
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
    <span>import</span> counts <span>from</span> <span>&#39;./store.ts&#39;</span>;
    <span>import</span> {onMount} <span>from</span> <span>&#39;svelte&#39;</span>;
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>on:click</span>=<span>{()</span> =&gt;</span> $counts.a += 1}&gt;
    Increment A ({$counts.a})
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the component only &#34;subscribes&#34; to <code>count.a</code>, unline what react context allows you to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>$</code> just before the variable name makes the component handle subscribing and unsubscribing to the store for you!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heading-simple-lifecycle">Simple Lifecycle</h2>
<p>While React uses some implicit behaviors of <code>useEffect</code> to do component lifecycles, Svelte is extremely explicit and simple</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
    
    onMount(<span>() =&gt;</span> {
        
        <span>return</span> <span>() =&gt;</span> { 
    })
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>button</span>&gt;</span>click me!<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanna do something only once, just write it in the script tag! Unlike React Components, the bodies of the script tag of a Svelte Component are only executed when it&#39;s created.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-if-i-want-redux-actions">What if I want Redux actions?</h2>
<p>To restrict changes to the store, all you need to do is this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> _counts = writeable({
    <span>a</span>: <span>0</span>,
    <span>b</span>: <span>0</span>,
});

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> counts = {
    <span>subscribe</span>: _counts.subscribe,
    <span>incrementA</span>: <span>() =&gt;</span> _counts.update(<span>(<span>counts</span>) =&gt;</span> {...counts, <span>a</span>: counts.a + <span>1</span>}),
    ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>A store is an object with a <code>subscribe</code> method. You&#39;re free to mold it as you please!</p>
<h2 id="heading-scoped-styles">Scoped Styles</h2>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>&#34;container&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>&#34;card&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>Name<span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>Description<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;</span><span>
    <span>.container</span> {
        
    }
    <span>.card</span> {
        
    }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>All of these classes are scoped to the component by default, &#34;container&#34; means nothing outside of this component.</p>
<p>You get all this, with 0 dependency and no runtime cost.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the best part, the svelte ecosystem is bigger than React! because it&#39;s all of the JS ecosystem.</p>
<p>You see, in the realm of Svelte, there&#39;s no need for those wrappers that you might have wrestled with in the past. Say goodbye to deciphering cryptic syntax or quirky APIs just to connect a wrapper to the actual library you want to use. Nope, with Svelte, it&#39;s as straightforward as it gets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like a direct line to JavaScript paradise â€“ no middlemen required! ðŸš€</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heading-lets-look-at-an-example">Let&#39;s Look at an example</h2>
<p>Imagine you&#39;re a developer aiming to add some stunning charts to your web app using the renowned &#34;Chart.js&#34; library.</p>
<h3 id="heading-react-a-web-of-wrappers">React: A Web of Wrappers</h3>
<h4 id="heading-step-1-install-the-wrapper">Step 1: Install the Wrapper</h4>
<p>First, you&#39;d need to find a React wrapper for Chart.js, install it, and cross your fingers that it behaves as expected. Also remember to use the <code>2</code> version.</p>
<pre><code>
npm install react-chartjs<span>-2</span> chart.js
</code></pre>
<h4 id="heading-step-2-import-the-wrapper">Step 2: Import the Wrapper</h4>
<p>Next, you import the wrapper, wrap your component around it, and pray there are no compatibility issues.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>&#39;react&#39;</span>;
<span>import</span> { Bar } <span>from</span> <span>&#39;react-chartjs-2&#39;</span>;

<span>const</span> ChartComponent = <span>() =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> data = {};

  <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>Bar</span> <span>data</span>=<span>{data}</span> /&gt;</span></span>;
};

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> ChartComponent;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="heading-step-3-deal-with-wrapper-limitations">Step 3: Deal with Wrapper Limitations</h4>
<p>You realize that the wrapper doesn&#39;t quite support the latest Chart.js features, so you resort to direct manipulation to achieve your goals.</p>

<h3 id="heading-svelte-the-direct-approach">Svelte: The Direct Approach</h3>
<h4 id="heading-step-1-add-the-library">Step 1: Add the Library</h4>
<p>In the world of Svelte, you don&#39;t need a special wrapper. You just add the Chart.js library directly.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>import</span> { onMount } <span>from</span> <span>&#39;svelte&#39;</span>;
  <span>import</span> Chart <span>from</span> <span>&#39;chart.js&#39;</span>;

  <span>let</span> chartInstance;
  <span>let</span> canvas
  <span>$</span>: {
    <span>const</span> ctx = canvas.getContext(<span>&#39;2d&#39;</span>);
    chartInstance = <span>new</span> Chart(ctx, {});
  }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>canvas</span> <span>bind:this</span>=<span>{canvas}</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>canvas</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="heading-and-done">And... Done!</h3>
<p>No wrappers, no compatibility struggles â€“ just plain JavaScript, building upon what you already know. Svelte&#39;s direct approach feels like a breath of fresh air, reminding us that sometimes, less is truly more.</p>

<p>Ah, the enthusiasm! You&#39;re ready to jump into the Svelte universe and flex those JavaScript muscles. Here we go!</p>
<h2 id="heading-step-1-embrace-the-basics">Step 1: Embrace The Basics</h2>
<p>Good Documentation is a godsend in software, and <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte">Svelte&#39;s Intro Tutorial</a> is especially good. It&#39;s like the &#34;Welcome to Svelte&#34; mat laid out for you.</p>
<p>This is where Svelte gives you the first taste of its most-priced quality, its simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="heading-step-2-craft-a-mini-masterpiece">Step 2: Craft a Mini-Masterpiece</h2>
<p>Once you&#39;ve completed the tutorial and seen how seamlessly Svelte meshes with your JavaScript prowess, it&#39;s playtime. Go make a project you&#39;ve been thinking of building. Don&#39;t have one? Here are a few cool ones you can start with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Virtual Recipe Box -</strong> So you never lose your favourite recipes</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Snippets Manager</strong> - So you don&#39;t ever loose that bash command you keep safely in your bash history (I know you do...)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Project Idea Repository</strong> - So you don&#39;t need this list again!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s your playground, play around, and you&#39;ll realize, how beautiful it is to just use JS and the web platform.</p>

<p>Svelte is like a breath of fresh air among the syntax-heavy, complexity-mongering tools that exist in the JS ecosystem. You don&#39;t need to learn svelte, because it has a learning curve so small, that you won&#39;t even realize it when you learn it.</p>
<p>You of course won&#39;t become an expert in a day, but Svelte enables you to focus on building stuff rather than learning weird quirks of the framework.</p>
<p>So, whether you&#39;re a battle-hardened developer or a curious newcomer, consider giving Svelte a spin. It might just inspire you to view web development through a cybernetically enhanced lens.</p>
