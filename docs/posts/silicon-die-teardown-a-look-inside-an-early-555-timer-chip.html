<p>If you&#39;ve played around with electronic circuits, you probably know
the 555 timer integrated circuit,<span id="fnref:POPULAR"><a href="#fn:POPULAR">1</a></span>
said to be the world&#39;s best-selling integrated circuit
with billions sold.
Designed by analog IC wizard Hans Camenzind<span id="fnref:CAMENZIND"><a href="#fn:CAMENZIND">2</a></span>, the 555 has been called one of the
<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/25-microchips-that-shook-the-world">greatest chips of all time</a>.</p>

<p>Eric Schlaepfer (<a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/1481120280105811970">@TubeTimeUS</a>) recently came across the chip above, with a mysterious part number.
He tediously sanded through the epoxy package to reveal the die (below) and determined that the chip is a 555 timer.
Signetics released the 555 timer in mid-1972 <span id="fnref:1972"><a href="#fn:1972">4</a></span> and the chip below has a January 1973 date code (7304), so it must be one of the first 555 timers.
Curiously, it is not labeled 555, so perhaps it is a prototype or internal version.<span id="fnref:revisions"><a href="#fn:revisions">3</a></span>
I took detailed die photos, which I discuss in this blog post.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/package.jpg"><img alt="The 555 timer with the package sanded down to expose the silicon die, the tiny square in the middle." height="270" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/package-w500.jpg" title="The 555 timer with the package sanded down to expose the silicon die, the tiny square in the middle." width="500"/></a></p><p>The 555 timer with the package sanded down to expose the silicon die, the tiny square in the middle.</p>
<h2>A brief explanation of the 555 timer</h2>
<p>The 555 timer has hundreds of applications, operating as anything from a timer or latch to a voltage-controlled oscillator or modulator.
The diagram below illustrates how the 555 timer operates as a simple oscillator.
Inside the 555 chip, three resistors form a divider generating references voltages of 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply voltage.
The external capacitor will charge and discharge between these limits, producing an oscillation.
In more detail, the capacitor will slowly charge (A) through the external resistors until its voltage hits the 2/3 reference.
At that point (B), the upper (threshold) comparator switches the flip flop off and the output off. This turns on the discharge transistor, slowly discharging the capacitor (C). When the voltage on the capacitor hits the 1/3 reference (D), the lower (trigger) comparator turns on, setting the flip flop and the output, and the cycle repeats. The values of the resistors and capacitor control the timing, from microseconds to hours.<span id="fnref:BRILLIANT"><a href="#fn:BRILLIANT">5</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/555-operation.png"><img alt="Diagram showing how the 555 timer can operate as an oscillator.

The external capacitor charges and discharges through the external resistors, under the control of the 555 timer.</p>
<p>To summarize, the key components of the 555 timer are the comparators to detect the upper and lower voltage limits, the three-resistor divider to set these limits, and the flip flop to keep track of whether the circuit is charging or discharging.
The 555 timer has two other pins (reset and control voltage) that I haven&#39;t covered above; they can be used for more complex circuits.</p>
<h2>The structure of the integrated circuit</h2>
<p>I created the photo below from a composite of microscope images.
On top of the silicon, a thin layer of metal connects different parts of the chip. This metal is clearly visible in the photo as light-colored traces. Under the metal, a thin, glassy silicon dioxide layer provides insulation between the metal and the silicon, except where contact holes in the silicon dioxide allow the metal to connect to the silicon. At the edge of the chip, thin wires connect the metal pads to the chip&#39;s external pins.</p>

<p>The different types of silicon on the chip are harder to see.
Regions of the chip are treated (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)">doped</a>) with impurities to change the electrical properties of the silicon. N-type silicon has an excess of electrons (negative), while P-type silicon lacks electrons (positive).
In the photo, these regions show up as a slightly different color surrounded by a thin black border.
These regions are the building blocks of the chip, forming transistors and resistors.</p>
<h3>NPN transistors inside the IC</h3>
<p>Transistors are the key components in a chip. The 555 timer uses NPN and PNP bipolar transistors.
If you&#39;ve studied electronics, you&#39;ve probably seen a diagram of an NPN transistor like the one below, showing the collector (C), base (B), and emitter (E) of the transistor, The transistor is illustrated as a sandwich of P silicon in between two symmetric layers of N silicon; the N-P-N layers make an NPN transistor.
It turns out that transistors on a chip look nothing like this, and the base often isn&#39;t even in the middle!</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/npn-transistor.png"><img alt="Schematic symbol for an NPN transistor, along with an oversimplified diagram of its internal structure." height="167" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/npn-transistor-w250.png" title="Schematic symbol for an NPN transistor, along with an oversimplified diagram of its internal structure." width="250"/></a></p><p>Schematic symbol for an NPN transistor, along with an oversimplified diagram of its internal structure.</p>
<p>The photo below shows a closeup of one of the transistors in the 555 as it appears on the chip.
The slightly different tints in the silicon indicate regions that have been doped to form N and P regions.
The whitish areas are the metal layer of the chip on top of the silicon - these form the wires connecting to the collector, emitter, and base.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/transistor-structure-npn.jpg"><img alt="Structure of an NPN transistor on the die." height="300" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/transistor-structure-npn-w350.jpg" title="Structure of an NPN transistor on the die." width="350"/></a></p><p>Structure of an NPN transistor on the die.</p>
<p>Underneath the photo is a cross-section drawing illustrating how the transistor is constructed. There&#39;s a lot more than just the N-P-N sandwich you see in books, but if you look carefully at the vertical cross-section below the &#39;E&#39;, you can find the N-P-N that forms the transistor. The emitter (E) wire is connected to N+ silicon. Below that is a P layer connected to the base contact (B). And below that is an N+ layer connected (indirectly) to the collector (C).<span id="fnref:EMITTER"><a href="#fn:EMITTER">6</a></span>
The transistor is surrounded by a P+ ring that isolates it from neighboring components.</p>
<h3>PNP transistors inside the IC</h3>
<p>You might expect PNP transistors to be similar to NPN transistors, just swapping the roles of N and P silicon. But for a variety of reasons, PNP transistors have an entirely different construction.
They consist of a small circular emitter (P), surrounded by a ring-shaped base (N), which is surrounded by the collector (P). This forms a P-N-P sandwich horizontally (laterally), unlike the vertical structure of the NPN transistors.
</p><p>
The diagram below shows one of the PNP transistors in the 555, along with a cross-section showing the silicon structure.
Note that although the metal contact for the base is on the edge of the transistor, it is electrically connected through the N and N+ regions to its active ring in between the collector and emitter.</p>

<p>The output transistors in the 555 are much larger than the other transistors and have a different structure in order to produce the high-current output. The photo below shows one of the output transistors. Note the multiple interlocking &#34;fingers&#34; of the emitter and base, surrounded by the large collector.</p>

<h3>How resistors are implemented in silicon</h3>
<p>Resistors are a key component of analog chips. Unfortunately, resistors in ICs are large and inaccurate; the resistances can vary by 50% from chip to chip. Thus, analog ICs are designed so only the ratio of resistors matters, not the absolute values, since the ratios remain nearly constant.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/resistor.jpg"><img alt="A resistor inside the 555 timer. The resistor is a strip of P silicon between two metal contacts." height="130" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/resistor-w500.jpg" title="A resistor inside the 555 timer. The resistor is a strip of P silicon between two metal contacts." width="500"/></a></p><p>A resistor inside the 555 timer. The resistor is a strip of P silicon between two metal contacts.</p>
<p>The photo above shows a 10KΩ resistor in the 555, formed from a strip of P silicon (pinkish gray), contacting metal wiring at either end. Other metal wires cross
the resistor. The resistor has a spiral shape to fit its length in the available space.
The resistor below is a 100KΩ <i>pinch resistor</i>.
A layer of N silicon on top of the pinch resistor makes the conductive region much thinner (i.e. pinches it), forming a much higher but less accurate resistance.</p>

<h3>IC component: The current mirror</h3>
<p>There are some subcircuits that are very common in analog ICs, but may seem mysterious at first. The current mirror is one of these.
If you&#39;ve looked at analog IC block diagrams, you may have seen the symbols below, indicating a current source, and wondered what a current source is and why you&#39;d use one. The idea is you start with one known current and then you can &#34;clone&#34; multiple copies of the current with a simple transistor circuit, the current mirror.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/current-source.png"><img alt="Schematic symbols for a current source." height="131" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/current-source-w200.png" title="Schematic symbols for a current source." width="200"/></a></p><p>Schematic symbols for a current source.</p>
<p>The following circuit shows how a current mirror is implemented with two identical transistors.<span id="fnref:CURRENTMIRROR"><a href="#fn:CURRENTMIRROR">7</a></span> A reference current passes through the transistor on the right. (In this case, the current is set by the resistor.) Since both transistors have the same emitter voltage and base voltage, they source the same current, so the current on the right matches the reference current on the left.<span id="fnref:q19"><a href="#fn:q19">8</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/current-mirror.png"><img alt="Current mirror circuit. The current on the right copies the current on the left." height="262" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/current-mirror-w250.png" title="Current mirror circuit. The current on the right copies the current on the left." width="250"/></a></p><p>Current mirror circuit. The current on the right copies the current on the left.</p>
<p>A common use of a current mirror is to replace resistors. As explained earlier, resistors inside ICs are both inconveniently large and inaccurate. It saves space to use a current mirror instead of a resistor whenever possible. 
Also, the currents produced by a current mirror are nearly identical, unlike the currents produced by two resistors.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/trans-mirror-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Three transistors form a current mirror in the 555 timer chip. They all share the same base and two transistors share emitters." height="231" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/trans-mirror-labeled-w500.jpg" title="Three transistors form a current mirror in the 555 timer chip. They all share the same base and two transistors share emitters." width="500"/></a></p><p>Three transistors form a current mirror in the 555 timer chip. They all share the same base and two transistors share emitters.</p>
<p>The three transistors above form a current mirror with two outputs. Note the three transistors share the base connection, tied to the collector on the right, and the emitters on the right are tied together.
On the schematic, the two transistors on the right are drawn as a single two-collector transistor, Q19.</p>
<h3>IC component: The differential pair</h3>
<p>The second important circuit to understand is the differential pair, the most common two-transistor subcircuit used in analog ICs.  <span id="fnref:DIFFERENTIALPAIR"><a href="#fn:DIFFERENTIALPAIR">9</a></span>
You may have wondered how a comparator compares two voltages, or an op amp subtracts two voltages. This is the job of the differential pair.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/differential-pair.png"><img alt="Schematic of a simple differential pair circuit. The current source sends a fixed current I through the differential pair. If the two inputs are equal, the current is split equally." height="299" src="https://static.righto.com/images/555a/differential-pair-w250.png" title="Schematic of a simple differential pair circuit. The current source sends a fixed current I through the differential pair. If the two inputs are equal, the current is split equally." width="250"/></a></p><p>Schematic of a simple differential pair circuit. The current source sends a fixed current I through the differential pair. If the two inputs are equal, the current is split equally.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows a simple differential pair. The current source at the bottom provides a fixed current I, which is split between the two input transistors. If the input voltages are equal, the current will be split equally into the two branches (I1 and I2). If one of the input voltages is a bit higher than the other, the corresponding transistor will conduct exponentially more current, so one branch gets more current and the other branch gets less.
A small input difference is enough to direct most of the current into the &#34;winning&#34; branch, flipping the comparator on or off.
The 555 chip uses one differential pair for the threshold comparator and another for the trigger comparator.<span id="fnref:comparators"><a href="#fn:comparators">10</a></span></p>
<h2>The 555 schematic interactive explorer</h2>
<p>The 555 die photo and schematic<span id="fnref:schematic"><a href="#fn:schematic">11</a></span>
below are interactive. Click on a component in the die or schematic, and a brief explanation of the component will be displayed.
(For a thorough discussion of how the 555 timer works, see
<a href="http://shop.emscdn.com/KitInstrux/555/555_principles_revB3.pdf">555 Principles of Operation</a>.)</p>
<p>For a quick overview, 
the large output transistors and discharge transistor are the most obvious features on the die. 
The threshold comparator consists of Q1 through Q8. The trigger comparator consists of Q10 through Q13, along with current mirror Q9.
Q16 and Q17 form the flip flop. The three 5KΩ resistors forming the voltage divider are in the middle of the chip.<span id="fnref:parallel"><a href="#fn:parallel">12</a></span>
Urban legend says that the 555 is named after these three 5K resistors, but
<a href="http://www.semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/LectureHall/Camenzind/Camenzind_Page2.htm">according to its designer</a>
555 is just an arbitrary number in the 500 chip series.</p>
