</div><p>An international team of engineers and materials scientists has developed a lithium-sulfur battery capable of retaining 80% of its charge capacity after 25,000 cycles. Their paper is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08298-9" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Nature</i>.</p>

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                    <p>To make batteries smaller and lighter, engineers continually look for new materials. Such efforts tend to focus on the electrodes where lithium is held by other materials. Finding a better material to hold the lithium could result in an overall lighter and more compact battery.</p>
<p>One of the more promising materials is sulfur, due to its quality, abundance and low cost. Unfortunately, some of sulfur&#39;s reactions with lithium lead to ion loss, and worse, it tends to expand, leading to degradation and a short battery life.</p>
<p>In this new study, the research team working in China found a way around such problems and built a battery that can hold up longer than other batteries over thousands of recharge cycles.</p>
<p>The approach uses sulfur to create a solid electrode—its porous atomic structure allows for ion diffusion without movement of intermediaries. To create the electrode, the team created a glass-like mixture made from <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/sulfur/" rel="tag">sulfur</a>, boron, lithium, phosphorus and iodine. The latter proved to be the key; it helped speed the movement of electrons through the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/redox+reactions/" rel="tag">redox reactions</a>, which led to faster reaction speeds.</p>

<p>The result was a battery that could be charged quickly, even when exposed to <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/high+temperatures/" rel="tag">high temperatures</a>. But more importantly, the battery was capable of retaining an 80% charge capacity after undergoing 25,000 charge/recharge cycles—a noticeable improvement over typical lithium-ion batteries, which tend to degrade after just 1,000 cycles.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest more work is required to improve the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/energy+density/" rel="tag">energy density</a> and perhaps to find other materials to use for the mix to ensure a low-weight battery.</p>
