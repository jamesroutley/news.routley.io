    <h1>Arch Linux bugtracker migration to Gitlab completed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/hyperkitty/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/WYXDTJ3TR2DWRQCDZK44BQDH67IDVGTS/">migration of the bugtracker to GitLab</a> is done! ðŸ¥³ </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!</p>
<p>This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.</p>
<p>The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/56716">Task #56716</a>) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.</p>
<p>Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the &#34;Add a new Bug&#34; button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/archlinux/teams/bug-wranglers/-/group_members">Bug Wranglers</a> will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/teams/package-maintainer-team">Package Maintainers</a> to fix. A list of all issues can be found <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/archlinux/packaging/-/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our <a href="https://accounts.archlinux.org/">SSO service</a>), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.</p></div></div>
