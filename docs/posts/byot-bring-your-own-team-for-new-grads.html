We lived in NH, where my parents operated a Chinese take-out.</span></p><p id="text28"><span>Of course, I&#39;m pretty sure it was illegal to be homeless in our situation. After all, I don&#39;t think living in a restaurant is generally legally acceptable. Further, every school year we had to sign legal forms, and I remember making up places we lived at every year. Yes, we were not homeless. Yes, this is the home we rented. Hi, YMCA staff, good afternoon! It was a facade that nobody knew.</span></p><p id="text29"><span>I never really stole stuff or did that type stuff, so now it was mostly me nonchalantly moving through life. Eventually, I got my first laptop. I can&#39;t remember what model it was, but it was the jankiest of things. One of my friends introduced me to video games, so my parents finally bought me it to play Left for Dead 2. Except... I couldn&#39;t run it! So, with a laptop and nothing to do, I stumbled, somehow, into the world of programming. I noticed a lot of places in my area didn&#39;t have great websites. One of these was the Keene Cinema. I ended up creating a nice front-end (for the time) and started selling tickets online, buying movie tickets in-person, and selling them at our restaurant! Somehow, the Cinema never said a thing, but I eventually moved on to copying other things.</span></p><p id="text30">I eventually built a website for own restaurant too! At this stage, our restaurant was ever so close to profitability. Keene State College was one of the markets that we hadn&#39;t penetrated very well, partly because we did no advertising. I set up social media accounts. I created a student discount program. I put up flyers that we were the only restaurant with student discounts (patently false). I had a unique referral program where I asked students to send their friends a picture of their food and a discount code. I set up a table on the Keene State campus and I sold our food. I got kicked out like 6 times, but they never banned me, so I kept at it! We won over the college market eventually. The lesson here is to try and tackle problems both head-on and through creative measures. And that college students are very easy to please.</p><p id="text32"><span>Remember when I couldn&#39;t boot Left for Dead 2? My second laptop easily could. I got into gaming. Really <strong><em>dove</em></strong> deep into that. TF2, CS:GO, and Dota 2 were the only actual hobbies I had for most of high school.</span></p><p id="text33"><span>I came to learn of crypto relatively early on. After all, users would trade their virtual hats in games like TF2 for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. At that point, I still gave all my money to my parents and I didn&#39;t have much in money. I followed crypto, but didn&#39;t have money to &#34;invest.&#34; I found an up and coming currency called Raiblocks. I asked my parents to temporarily use $1,000, which was a lot for us. I invested in Raiblocks in this small exchange. I created a series of promotional youtube videos, I articulately spammed in subreddits, did whatever cryptobros did. I turned $1k into $20k. Then, the small obscure italian exchange rugpulled their users. I decided my first dip into the crypto would also be my last for a while.</span></p><p id="text34"><span>Back to degeneracy, the Dota 2 esports gambling scene was picking up, so I tried it out. One of my attributes is to be extremely paranoid about money. After all, after making money on crypto, I chose to stop instead of chasing those multiples. Of course, extreme frugality isn&#39;t always optimal, but my circumstances and parents had basically instilled it into me.</span></p><p id="text35"><span>Before the application proces, believe it or not, I knew how to program pretty well at this point, but I still didn&#39;t know computer science was a major. Growing up in NH with no CS curriculum in school meant most kids didn&#39;t do CS. That being said, the wealth disparity in our small high school meant the academically best students were children of doctors or lawyers in town and similarly went into those professions.</span></p><div id="list10"><ul><li><p>Paying for College w/ Piracy</p></li></ul></div><p id="text36"><span>As the only Asian in my grade, I didn&#39;t really fit in culturally. After all, I couldn&#39;t join any clubs, didn&#39;t have time to hang out with friends, and no one else was into computers. One summer, we visited NYC in order to recruit a Chinese cook for our restaurant. One of those days, I was hanging out at my mom&#39;s friend&#39;s house with her sons. They were watching anime and playing Yu-gi-oh. Steam users always had anime profiles, so I was familiar with anime, but I never wanted to dive in, but short story short, I was addicted immediately. Something other asians did? I was hooked to anime and manga.</span></p><p id="text37"><span>At this point, I just started junior year. I got really into botting (and scraping). I created a network of accounts and was successfully able to upvote posts on Reddit without detection. I started selling upvoting services to allow users to get their posts to the front page of a subreddit. Eventually, even comment capabilities were added. This whole process was really interesting because I could generate so much traffic from such a low-cost.</span></p><p id="text38"><span>Now, this is later on in junior year.</span></p><p id="text39"><span>For a general reflection, there are lots of regrets and pain points. There are a lot of projects I&#39;ve worked on that didn&#39;t pan out. Here are some more lessons to help summarize my experiences.</span></p><ul id="buttons11"><li><a href="#home"><svg><use xlink:href="#icon-902"></use></svg><span>BYOT</span></a></li></ul></section><section id="byot-section"><p id="text40"><span>BYOT</span></p><p id="text41"><span>Ask any college student what the best thing about college is. You&#39;ll get told that it&#39;s the people. The brightest, smartest, most passionate people. The people and friends you&#39;ve studied with, stayed up all night with, lamented with, and celebrated with. In your four years, you&#39;ve accumulated relationships that will last you a lifetime—except they probably won&#39;t. The unfortunate reality is that you&#39;ll lose contact with your friends over time. And that&#39;s fine too. As you graduate, you&#39;ll likely reset your relationships and friendships as you try to fit into a new culture, a new city, a new life.</span></p><ul id="links01"><li><a href="#campus">Available Campuses</a></li></ul><p id="text43"><span>For companies that want cohesive teams and employee happiness, we offer self-selected groups of passionate new-grads at the best universities.
