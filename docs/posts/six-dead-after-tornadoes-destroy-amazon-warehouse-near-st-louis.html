Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fifty-people-likely-killed-tornadoes-kentucky-governor-2021-12-11" target="_blank">Tornadoes</a> ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses  stretching more than 200 miles.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said.
