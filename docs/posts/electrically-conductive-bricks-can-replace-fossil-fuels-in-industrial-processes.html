Thermal batteries powered by renewable energy could reduce roughly half of those emissions according to <a href="https://www.brattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Thermal-Batteries-Opportunities-to-Accelerate-Decarbonization-of-Industrial-Heat.pdf">a 2023 report</a> by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit, and its affiliated Renewable Thermal Collaborative.</span></p><p><span>The problem, Stack said, is that there aren’t a lot of good options available to produce high-temperature heat from electricity. Electric heaters, like the wires that turn red hot in a toaster, work well at low temperatures but quickly burn out at higher temperatures. Other less common materials like molybdenum and silicon carbide can withstand higher temperatures but are prohibitively expensive.</span></p><p><span>As a graduate student at MIT, Stack wondered if firebricks, the bricks commonly used in residential fireplaces and industrial kilns, could be a less expensive, more durable solution. Bricks do not typically conduct electricity, but by slightly altering the recipe of the metal oxides used to make them, he and Electrified Thermal Solutions cofounder Joey Kabel were able to create bricks that could essentially take the place of wires to conduct electricity and generate heat.</span></p><p><span>“There’s no exotic metals in here; there’s nothing that’ll burn out,” Stack said, standing next to shelves lined with small samples that he and his team have tested to find bricks with the best heating properties.</span></p><div id=""><figure id="img-WVNWZG6ISVUZ3SYT3XXEKHWUDA"><img id="img-WVNWZG6ISVUZ3SYT3XXEKHWUDA-image" alt="Detail of a cut section from an electrically conductive brick.

The same bricks that convert electricity to super-hot temperatures can also retain that heat for days inside the company’s insulated Hive.</span></p><p><span>Recent government funding, including a $5 million grant from the US Department of Energy in January, and another DOE grant for up to $35 million, announced in March, have given the company a significant boost.</span></p><p><span>The latter grant would help fund the replacement of boilers powered by natural gas at a chemical plant in Calvert City, Ky. The bricks would reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with steam generation at the plant by nearly 70 percent,<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-chemicals-and-refining#chemical"> according to the DOE</a>.</span></p><p><span>As Stack and his colleagues prepare to deploy their first commercial-scale Hives, they are continuing to ramp up their capabilities. After several years placing orders for small test batches from an existing brick manufacturer, ETS recently received its first multi-ton order.</span></p><p><span>“Now, if you want two tons, [or, if] you want 2,000 tons, the manufacturer is ready to do that for us,” Stack said. “We’re off to the races.”</span></p><p><span><i>This story is published in partnership with</i><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/"><i> Inside Climate News</i></a><i>, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment.</i></span></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>
