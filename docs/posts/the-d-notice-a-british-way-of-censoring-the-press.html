Become a <a href="https://thedissenter.org/#/portal/signup">monthly subscriber</a> to help us continue our independent journalism.</em></em></em></em></strong></p><p>Rights groups and concerned citizens the world over have <a href="https://leftfootforward.org/2022/04/freeassange-calls-grow-for-patel-to-refuse-extradition-of-julian-assange/">urged</a> Patel to halt the extradition, on the grounds that Washington’s case against Assange amounts to the criminalization of entirely legitimate journalistic activities, and puts global press freedom at risk.</p><p>Such entreaties are likely to fall on deaf ears. A striking feature of both the January 2021 ruling on Assange’s extradition, as well as the judgement on Washington’s appeal, was that considerations of press freedom did not factor into the court’s considerations at all. </p><p>District Judge Vanessa Baraitser accepted the evidence underlying each US charge at face value, while the High Court of Justice dismissed any suggestion that Assange&#39;s extradition would be &#34;unjust.&#34; </p><p>This troubling oversight may be symptomatic of Britain’s culture of state secrecy, arguably the most intensive and draconian in the Western world—and why it must be presumed Patel will rubber stamp Assange&#39;s extradition come May.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="introducing-the-dsma">Introducing the DSMA</h2><p>Little known and rarely discussed by the media establishment, Britain has for decades maintained the highly secretive <a href="https://www.dsma.uk/the-committee/">Defense and Security Media Advisory (DSMA) Committee</a>, which imposes a very British form of censorship on the press. It decides which subjects and events can be reported on, and how, in a chivalrous yet fundamentally dishonest manner.</p><p>The DSMA Committee is a Defense Ministry-run body composed of representatives of the security services, military veterans, high ranking government officials, press association chiefs, senior editors, and journalists, which meets every six months.</p><p>Often the Committee issues D-notices as an official request to journalists not to publish or broadcast particular information on subjects related to national security, or ask for the removal of certain details from reporting on supposedly sensitive topics.</p><p>As of 2017, there are <a href="https://www.dsma.uk/standing-notices/">five standing notices</a>, concerning: military operations, plans and capabilities; nuclear and non-nuclear weapon systems and equipment; military counter-terrorist forces, special forces and intelligence agency operations, activities and communication methods and techniques; physical property and assets; personnel and their families who work in sensitive positions. </p><p>If the secretary of the Committee believes a story will soon be published, or has been published, which falls under one or more of those five areas, emails are dispatched to the editors of all mainstream publications, typically marked “private and confidential: not for publication, broadcast or use on social media.” </p><p>Minutes of the most recent DSMA Committee <a href="https://www.dsma.uk/dsma-committee-meeting-2-nov-21/">meeting</a>, in November 2021 indicated from May to November, its secretariat received 78 inquiries and requests for advice, a 44 percent increase over the previous period. The total was &#34;only slightly below the 10-year historical average” of 88. </p><p>The minutes also noted that media representatives on the Committee “highlighted the importance of journalists and editors asking searching questions themselves about the implications of what is published.&#34;</p><p>Presumably, the mainstream press reached out for advice on these subjects en masse, and they were left alone after showing compliance.</p><h2 id="seek-the-dsmas-advice%E2%80%94or-else">Seek The DSMA&#39;s Advice—Or Else</h2><p>Letters from the DSMA Committee typically conclude with polite questions such as, “May I ask you to seek my advice before doing so?” This civility belies a sinister paradox at the system’s core.</p><p>There are very few examples of a D-notice ever being broken, and letters are rarely sent. Between 1997 and 2008, the Committee <a href="http://www.defenceviewpoints.co.uk/articles-and-analysis/d-notices-uk-s-defence-self-censorship-system">wrote</a> to news outlets on only 30 occasions. </p><p>A palpable example of the system’s effectiveness came in November 2010, when a D-notice was <a href="https://order-order.com/2010/11/26/that-wikileaks-d-notice/">issued</a> following WikiLeaks’ initial releases of US State Department cables. </p><p>It warned publicizing the files “might trigger violent local reactions” against British citizens “working or living in volatile regions.” </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="consulting-the-dsma-every-working-day">Consulting the DSMA &#39;Every Working Day&#39;</h2><p>The body’s operation has a chilling effect on British journalists. </p><p>The DSMA Committee vice chair has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/02/d-notice-national-security-blackout">boasted</a>, “On average a journalist consults the secretariat every working day.” </p><p>Still, there are rare examples of journalists and editors not coordinating with the Committee in advance of publishing stories.</p><p>The most significant example involved The Guardian’s 2013 series of articles based on sensitive documents shared by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, which exposed the excesses of the secret &#34;Five Eyes&#34; <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/517537-gchq-nsa-anniversary-spying-britain-usa/">global spying network</a> led by Washington and London.</p><p>On June 7, 2013, the day after The Guardian’s first reports, the Committee sent a D-notice to newspaper editors, stating that while its guidelines hadn’t been breached, intelligence services were “concerned that further developments of this same theme” could compromise national security. So it was that the Snowden revelations were <a href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-spying-revelations-were-in-breach-of-da-notice-guidance/">largely ignored</a> by Britain’s media, with most outlets not mentioning the seismic disclosures at all.</p><p>The Committee also undertook <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-09-11-how-the-uk-security-services-neutralised-the-countrys-leading-liberal-newspaper/">considerable efforts</a> to cultivate and neutralize The Guardian. In July that year, at the precise moment GCHQ technicians watched as laptops containing the Snowden files were ritualistically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq">destroyed</a>, the outlet solicited Committee advice on the documents and subsequently declined to publish certain information contained therein. </p><p>Such engagement steadily increased over the year, culminating in Guardian deputy editor Paul Johnson, who led the symbolic laptop destruction, being appointed to the DSMA Committee. </p><p>Three years later, the outlet’s investigative team was <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-set-to-break-up-six-strong-team-of-investigative-reporters-as-journalists-told-to-find-other-roles/">dissolved</a>, and Guardian coverage of military, security and intelligence issues declined precipitously. In fact, presently, many key national security correspondents at the Guardian have little background in the field. </p><p>Mark Curtis, editor for Declassified UK, said the outlet refused to remove Purser&#39;s name. </p><p>In 2020, a member of the Defense Ministry&#39;s press office <a href="https://declassifieduk.org/uk-defence-ministrys-communications-director-said-his-department-shouldnt-waste-any-time-on-investigative-media-organisation-declassified/">proposed</a> that Declassified UK be &#34;put on a list of organizations the department would not engage with.&#34;  (Eventually, the Defense Ministry issued an apology.) </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="an-urgent-warning-to-editors">An &#39;Urgent&#39; Warning To Editors</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.assassinationspodcast.com/podcasts/2021/12/27/interview-kit-klarenberg">apparent nerve agent poisoning</a> of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4, 2018, provides another example of the Committee&#39;s function.</p><p>Miller deleted that incriminating profile, but on March 7, The Daily Telegraph <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/07/poisoned-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-close-consultant-linked/">revealed</a> he was now working for Orbis Intelligence, the notorious private security firm led by former MI6 spy Christopher Steele, who authored the widely discredited Trump-Russia dossier. </p><p>Despite the publication voluntarily declining to name Miller, <a href="https://powerbase.info/index.php/DSMA_notice_7_March_2018">within hours</a> the DSMA Secretary issued yet another “urgent” missive warning editors against revealing identities of British security and intelligence personnel. It urged media to consult the Committee if they were “currently considering publication of such material.” </p><p>The following day, BBC News’ Gordon Corera and the Guardian’s Luke Harding, known national security stenographers, <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/04/where-they-tell-you-not-to-look/">took to Twitter</a> and issued firm denials that Miller ever worked for Orbis. They also alleged - based on anonymous sources—that there was no link whatsoever between Skripal and Steele. (Harding <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot-461-1024x940.png">wildly claimed</a> Google results attesting to such a connection were the product of nefarious search engine manipulation.)</p><p>The Daily Telegraph eventually published an article disavowing their previous report as the product of a “black ops attempt” by Russian intelligence to cast doubt on the Steele dossier, quoting “well-placed sources,” who “suspected” the LinkedIn profile to which it had originally referred—“if it ever properly existed at all”—was created by Russian military intelligence. </p><h2 id="a-system-for-suppressing-journalism">A System For Suppressing Journalism</h2><p>The rise of the internet has posed significant problems for the DSMA system. After all, it is incredibly difficult if not impossible for London to prevent publications and journalists outside the country from releasing information the British government does not want in the public domain. </p><p>This may at least partially account for why British authorities are planning to greatly expand their ability to jail whistleblowers, leakers, and journalists.</p><p>As covered by <a href="https://thedissenter.org/uk-official-secrets-act-proposals-press-freedom/">The Dissenter</a> on February 9, British officials are working to expand the Official Secrets Acts to mirror the Orwellian nature of the US Espionage Act.</p><p>The legislation presently means any “crown servant” (government, employee, or contractor) who releases classified information to anyone else—or newspapers or journalists who publish secrets leaked to them by such individuals—may be jailed for up to two years. </p><p>Neither leakers nor publishers are afforded any &#34;public interest&#34; defense, and sentences may subsequently be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56451521">increased</a> if a judge finds initial penalties were insufficiently severe.</p><p>The law is a key reason why leaks from British security or intelligence agencies, or even government departments, are rare. In fact, when leaks occur, they typically come from agencies which want the information to be public for some political or deceitful reason.</p><p>This mephitic push is all the more ominous given how the DSMA Committee and its D-notice system already serve as a devastatingly successful mechanism for suppressing journalism. </p><p>The minutes from November 2021 showed that operations of the Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism directorate would soon be covered by the system. This means local journalists, often first on the scene at terrorist incidents and “less likely to be familiar with the standing notices,” will be targets of “outreach.&#34;</p><p>“Media side members might be able to contribute here,” the minutes noted, indicating journalists and editors are to be called upon to actively assist the Committee in stemming the flow of inconvenient truths and damaging facts across the media. </p><p>In June 2021, Stundin, an Icelandic biweekly newspaper, <a href="https://stundin.is/grein/13627/key-witness-in-assange-case-admits-to-lies-in-indictment/">revealed</a> that a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wikileaks-founder-charged-superseding-indictment">superseding indictment</a> against the WikiLeaks chief was based largely on the false testimony of a fraudster, diagnosed sociopath and convicted pedophile, who the FBI recruited to undermine the organization from within. Details came from an interview with the informant himself, but <a href="https://www.medialens.org/2021/a-remarkable-silence-media-blackout-after-key-witness-against-assange-admits-lying/">not a single</a> British journalist covered it.</p><p>Three months later, Yahoo! News <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html">exposed</a> the CIA&#39;s &#34;secret war plans&#34; to kidnap or even murder Assange in the event he escaped the Ecuadorian embassy in London. BBC News mentioned the bombshell exposé just one time — in its <a href="https://twitter.com/medialens/status/1443626585916121089">Somali-language section</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/sep/27/senior-cia-officials-trump-discussed-assassinating-julian-assange">The Guardian</a><strong> </strong>and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/julian-assange-cia-kidnap-plot-yahoo-news-b1930759.html">Independent</a> mentioned the story once, while all other British media <a href="https://fair.org/home/deathly-silence-journalists-who-mocked-assange-have-nothing-to-say-about-cia-plans-to-kill-him/">ignored</a> the reporting.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->
