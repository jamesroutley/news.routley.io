deepfake, but a recording the attacker made when using the same attack
against the previous person.  See the comments.

I think someone just tried to phish my Facebook account, including a
fake video of a FB friend.  Here&#39;s the conversation:



</p>
<dl>

<dt>Them, via FB Messenger, 9:32am:
</dt>
<dd>Please ,I was trying to login in my instagram page on Facebook my
new phone and they ask me to find someone to help me receive a code,
Facebook gave me two friends suggestions and you one of them, the
other person isn&#39;t online. will you Help me receive the code please?

</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having trouble logging in! Just so I can
make sure your account hasn&#39;t been hacked, how did we meet?

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>[Calls me over FB Messenger, audio isn&#39;t working but it does look
like them.  I&#39;m completely convinced at this point.] 

</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>Audio wasn&#39;t working, but I did recognize you</dd>
<dt>32665, over SMS:
</dt>
<dd>NNNNNNNN is your Facebook password reset code [this number has
previously sent me FB resets]

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>Send me the code sent to you minute ago

</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>Hmm, those look like the code to reset the password to my
account?</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>[I try to call them back, doesn&#39;t go through]

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>Nahh it&#39;s for my instagram

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>Having bad connections here

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>Send me the code ?

</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>sorry, I&#39;m still worried your account has been hacked -- can we do
another call? 

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>[Calls me over FB Messenger, audio is still not working, and the
video feels slightly off.  Ends quickly on their end. Possibly it&#39;s
even the same video from last time?]

</dd>
<dt>Me:
</dt>
<dd>We&#39;re you able to hear me?

</dd>
<dt>Them:
</dt>
<dd>My connections
</dd>
</dl>

<p>

I&#39;ve reported their account as hacked.

</p>
<p>

Things that made me suspicious:

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don&#39;t think FB has any sort of account recovery that looks
like this
</p></li>
<li><p>This is exactly what an attempt to hack my FB account would
look like
</p></li>
<li><p>9:30am, even though that makes it 6:30 where they live
</p></li>
<li><p>Video call didn&#39;t have any audio
</p></li>
<li><p>They couldn&#39;t receive incoming video calls
</p></li>
<li><p>Text did&#39;t feel like them, though I don&#39;t know them that
well. 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>

Here&#39;s a screenshot I took during the second video call:

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

Even with all those things, the video call would normally have been
very convincing, and it did briefly convince me.  I could easily see
it fooling someone who didn&#39;t know about deepfake video.
