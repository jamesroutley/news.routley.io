  <p>just like how infinitesimals are useful because they&#39;re indiscernible from 0, but have the advantage of being able to be divided by.</p>
<p>the other important number besides 0 is 1. gpt even suggested it as i was typing it.</p>
<p>the monad of 1 is numbers of the form (1 + ε) where ε is an infinitesimal. multiplying by them should be almost as good as multiplying by 1, aka a freebie.</p>
<p>this is just the lie algebra, and is why elements of it are always invertible. by using the infinitesimal version of a clifford algebra on the tangent space, we can use its rotor represention to see how the exponential map gives lie&#39;s third theorem.</p>
