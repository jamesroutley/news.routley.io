          I’m working through
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj">Hammertime</a>, a 30-day program of instrumental rationality exercises. Hammertime
          introduced me to a technique called Focusing via a LessWrong post
          called
          <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics">“Focusing, for skeptics”</a>. The post’s version of Focusing involves:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Thinking about a problem in your life</li>
          <li>
            Paying attention to how your body feels when you’re thinking about
            the problem. Focusing calls this a <em>felt sense</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Coming up with a <em>handle</em> for that felt sense: a word, image,
            or concept that points to it
          </li>
          <li>
            Comparing the handle to the felt sense, paying attention to whether
            the handle feels right. If so, go back to step 3, narrowing down the
            handle, adding more description and nuance. If not, try step 3 with
            a new handle. Repeat!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It struck me that this is how I debug a computer program. First, I
          gather all the information I can about the bug. What part of the code
          is it in? When the bug happens, what state is the program in? Gaining
          knowledge about a bug is like paying attention to a felt sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I lean on my intuition to surface hypotheses—in essence, short
          sentences that point to the bug’s root cause. This is similar to
          coming up with a handle for a felt sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I compare each hypothesis against the data. I might fill in
          blanks in a hypothesis, tweak it to fit the data better, or throw it
          out entirely. This is like comparing a handle to a felt sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m good at debugging but not at Focusing. This makes sense, even
          though they’re similar skills. I have years of experience ingesting
          information about computer programs. I haven’t spent nearly as much
          time paying attention to how my body feels. (I haven’t meditated
          seriously for a couple of years, so I’m at least out of practice.)
          Plus, my accumulated coding knowledge fuels my bug intuition. It takes
          longer to come up with good handles for felt senses because I have
          less data on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One takeaway for me: when Focusing, I should leave behind any
          preconceived notions of how I feel about a problem. Just like how,
          when debugging, it’s easy to stay attached to an existing hypothesis,
          even when the data are against it.
