    <h1>Ask HN: Tools or frameworks to build music theory games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>My music theory teacher has built from scratch, without much coding knowledge, an Electron app with games. Example of games are: guess the 2-3 notes randomly played by the piano, find the intervals etc. Those are multiple choice games mostly.</p><p>He is now on a journey to build games that interact with notes on scores, like colorize all the Cs, click on the notes that are wrong vs what you hear etc.</p><p>He is building everything from scratch, with the scores, the notes, and I&#39;m wondering if there are some tools or libraries out there that provide much flexibility to build stuff for music theory.</p></div></div></div>
