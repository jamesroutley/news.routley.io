    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2662273418" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-tribute" data-authors="Charles J. Murray" data-headline="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough" data-page-title="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough - IEEE Spectrum"><div><p>Nobel Laureate <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John B. Goodenough</a>, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery, died on 25 June at age 100.</p><p>Goodenough, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>, authored more than 800 technical papers during his career. He and his colleagues were recently granted a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20220115739" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a>, shortly before his 100th birthday.</p><p>A mathematician and physicist by education, Goodenough had a 70-year career in physics and chemistry. He probably is best known for developing the lithium cobalt oxide cathode in 1980—which became the foundation for <a href="https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902083334341504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sony’s first</a> commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991.</p><p>For that, he won a 2019 <a href="https://region8today.ieeer8.org/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2019-is-awarded-for-the-development-of-the-lithium-ion-battery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>, sharing the award with <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M. Stanley Whittingham</a>, who created the lithium-ion concept, and <a href="https://www.asahi-kasei.com/asahikasei-brands/interview/yoshino/profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akira Yoshino</a>, who developed the anode chemistry that was used in Sony’s first lithium-ion battery.</p><p>Goodenough was awarded the <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/2012-ieee-honors-medal-for-environmental-and-safety-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2012 IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies</a> for discoveries that “paved the way for development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology.”</p><p>Starting in the 1990s, his lithium cobalt oxide cathode was used in many electronic products including camcorders, laptop computers, and mobile phones. It later became the chemistry of choice for early electric cars including the <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/tesla/roadster/2008/review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2008 Tesla Roadster</a>.</p><p>Within the battery community, Goodenough is known for more than just lithium cobalt oxide, though. He helped develop three of the five most commonly used types of lithium-ion chemistries. His first was lithium cobalt oxide. His second, lithium manganese oxide, is used in power tools, medical devices, and some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-vehicles">electric vehicles</a>. His third, lithium iron phosphate, is now one of the most popular battery chemistries in the automotive industry.</p><h2>Overcoming struggles with dyslexia</h2><p>Born in Jena, Germany, Goodenough grew up in Woodbridge, Conn., about 13 kilometers from <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yale</a>, where his father was a religion professor.</p><p>Goodenough was dyslexic and struggled to read—which almost caused him to be held back in the sixth grade.</p><p>“I was so frustrated that I couldn’t read,” he wrote in his memoir, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Witness_to_Grace/K5T8oAEACAAJ?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Witness to Grace</em></a>. “And, of course, my [older] brother read really well, and my father was a professor with a lot of books to read. It was terrible.”</p><p>Goodenough taught himself to read and became a high-achieving student in high school. But even after gaining acceptance to Yale, he said, he steered clear of all courses with long reading lists, fearing that he wouldn’t be able to keep up. </p><p>After graduating in 1943 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, Goodenough joined the U.S. Army. He worked as a meteorologist and was tasked with predicting the weather for the Allies’ D-Day invasion.</p><p>Following World War II, he pursued a doctorate in physics at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. He studied under <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6781744" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a>, the physicist who created the world’s first nuclear chain reaction, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4640583" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Teller</a>, the so-called “father of the hydrogen bomb.” His doctoral supervisor was <a href="https://history.aip.org/phn/11806003.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarence Zener</a>, whose diode famously allowed current to flow in reverse.</p><p>After Goodenough earned a Ph.D. in 1952 in solid-state physics, he joined MIT’s <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lincoln Laboratory</a>, in Lexington, Mass., as a researcher. He was part of a team there that developed the world’s first random-access magnetic memory. His ability to cross disciplines started at MIT.</p><p>“At Lincoln Lab, in order to solve problems, we had to bring physics and chemistry together with engineering,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ylhy-utbXY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said during an interview</a> in 2016.</p><p><img alt="Photo of an olderman in a tie in front of a flowered tree.

It was there that Goodenough made his mark while working on a rechargeable lithium battery with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Mizushima_(scientist)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Koichi Mizushima</a>, a postdoctoral researcher. </p><p><a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exxon</a> researcher <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whittingham</a> had developed a lithium titanium disulfide battery in the 1970s; Goodenough decided to replace the titanium disulfide with lithium cobalt oxide. It gave the battery a significant voltage boost: from 2.4 to 4 volts. The higher voltage made his new battery chemistry almost impossible to ignore.</p><p>Goodenough patented his battery in 1980, signing away his financial claim to it in order to fund the patent.</p><p>Sony produced its first commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991 using Goodenough’s and Mizushima’s cobalt oxide cathode. The company originally employed the battery in its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Handycam</a>, and the lithium-ion technology soon made its way into billions of mobile phones and laptop computers.</p><p>While still at Oxford in 1981, Goodenough worked with <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/michael-m-thackeray" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael M. Thackeray</a> on a lithium manganese oxide battery. The LMO battery was less expensive and safer to use than lithium cobalt oxide, and it became a mainstay in tools and medical devices. In 2010 Nissan used it in its <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2010-nissan-leaf-first-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leaf</a> electric car.</p><p>Goodenough moved back to the United States in 1986 and joined the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of mechanical engineering. He worked on another lithium-ion chemistry there in 1995: lithium iron phosphate. </p><p>At first, he had little confidence in the chemistry, thinking it was too low in energy. But French battery scientist <a href="https://cicenergigune.com/en/michel-armand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michel Armand</a> called Goodenough and offered to collaborate on it. The duo created a lithium-ion battery with lower voltage but also lower cost and greater safety.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, the battery is gaining momentum in the auto industry as a means of reducing the cost of electric cars. Today it is being employed by Chinese EV manufacturers including <a href="https://www.byd.com/us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BYD</a>, as well as by <a href="https://www.ford.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.gm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Motors</a>, and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tesla</a>.</p><p><img alt="A group photo of three men.
