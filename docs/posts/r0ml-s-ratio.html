    <h1>R0ML&#39;s Ratio</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>My <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2011/06/blog-post.html">father</a>, also known as
“<a href="https://r0ml.medium.com">R0ML</a>” once described a methodology for evaluating
volume purchases that I think needs to be more popular.</p>
<p>If you are a hardcore fan, you might know that he <em>has</em> already described this
concept publicly in a talk at OSCON in 2005, among other places, but it has
never found its way to the public Internet, so I’m giving it a home here, and
in the process, appropriating some of his words.<sup id="fnref:1:r0mls-ratio-2025-8"><a href="#fn:1:r0mls-ratio-2025-8" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup></p>
<hr/>
<p>Let’s say you’re running a circus.  The circus has many clowns.  Ten thousand
clowns, to be precise.  They require bright red clown noses.  Therefore, you
must acquire a significant volume of clown noses.  An enterprise licensing
agreement for clown noses, if you will.</p>
<p>If the nose
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_Thirteen#:~:text=Have%20you%20guys%20been%20talking%20to%20my%20dad?">plays</a>,
it can really make the act.  In order to make sure you’re getting quality
noses, you go with a quality vendor.  You select a vendor who can supply noses
for $100 each, at retail.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy retail?  Ten thousand clowns, ten thousand noses, one
hundred dollars: that’s a million bucks worth of noses, so it’s worth your
while to get a good deal.</p>
<p>As a conscientious executive, you go to the golf course with your favorite
clown accessories vendor and negotiate yourself a 50% discount, with a
commitment to buy all ten thousand noses.</p>
<p>Is this a <em>good</em> deal?  Should you take it?</p>
<p>To determine this, we will use an analytical tool called <em>R0ML’s Ratio</em> (RR).</p>
<p>The ratio has 2 terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Full Undiscounted Retail List Price of Units Used (FURLPoUU), which can
   of course be computed by the individual retail list price of a single unit
   (in our case, $100) multiplied by the <strong>number of units used</strong></li>
<li>the Total Price of the Entire Enterprise Volume Licensing Agreement
   (TPotEEVLA), which in our case is $500,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is expressed as:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><code><span>RR</span> <span>=</span> <span>TPotEEVLA</span> <span>/</span> <span>FURLPoUU</span>
</code></pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

<p>Crucially, you must be able to compute the <strong>number of units used</strong> in order to
complete this ratio.  If, as expected, every single clown wears their nose at
least once during the period of the license agreement, then our Units Used is
10,000, our FURLPoUU is $1,000,000 and our TPotEEVLA is $500,000, which makes
our RR 0.5.</p>
<p>Congratulations.  If R0ML’s Ratio is less than 1, it’s a good deal.  Proceed.</p>
<p>But… maybe the nose <em>doesn’t</em> play.  Not every clown’s costume is an exact
clone of the traditional, stereotypical image of a clown.  Many are
avant-garde.  Perhaps this plentiful proboscis pledge was premature.  Here, I
must quote the originator of this theoretical framework directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if the wheeze doesn’t please?</p>
<p><em>What if the schnozz gives some pause?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: what if some clowns don’t wear their noses?</p>
<p>If we were to do this deal, and then ask around <em>afterwards</em> to find out that
only <em>200</em> of our 10,000 clowns were to use their noses, then FURLPoUU comes
out to 200 * $100, for a total of $20,000.  In that scenario, RR is <strong>25</strong>,
which you may observe is <em>substantially greater</em> than 1.</p>
<p>If you do a deal where R0ML’s ratio is greater than 1, then <em>you</em> are the bozo.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I apologize if I have belabored this point.  As R0ML expressed in the email we
exchanged about this many years ago,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not mind if you blog about it — and I don&#39;t mind getting the credit —
although one would think it would be obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yeah, one <em>would</em> think this would be obvious?  But I have belabored it
because many discounted enterprise volume purchasing agreements still fail the
R0ML’s Ratio Bozo Test.<sup id="fnref:2:r0mls-ratio-2025-8"><a href="#fn:2:r0mls-ratio-2025-8" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In the case of clown noses, if you pay the discounted price, at least you get
to keep the nose; maybe lightly-used clown noses have some resale value.  But
in software licensing or SaaS deals, once you’ve purchased the “discounted”
software or service, once you have provisioned the “seats”, the money is gone,
and if your employees don’t use it, then no value for your organization will
ever result.</p>
<p>Measuring <strong>number of units used</strong> is <strong><em>very</em></strong> important.  Without this
number, you have no idea if you are a bozo or not.</p>
<p>It is <em>often</em> better to give your individual employees a corporate card and
allow them to make arbitrary individual purchases of software licenses and SaaS
tools, with minimal expense-reporting overhead; this will always keep R0ML’s
Ratio at 1.0, and thus, you will never be a bozo.</p>
<p>It is <em>always</em> better to do that the <em>first</em> time you are purchasing a <em>new</em>
software tool, because the first time making such a purchase you (almost by
definition) have no information about “units used” yet.  You have no idea — you
<em>cannot</em> have any idea — if you are a bozo or not.</p>
<p>If you don’t know who the bozo is, it’s probably you.</p>
