          <p>A question that comes up quite a bit in the Self Hosted communities is &#34;What Self Hosted applications do you use most?&#34; This question alone has been the reason I discover so many new applications I never knew I needed. Perhaps I can do the same for you by sharing my most used self hosted applications.</p><h3 id="nginx-proxy-manager">Nginx Proxy Manager</h3><p>Nginx Proxy Manager is the backbone of my self hosted network.
