    <h1>Signal K – open-source universal marine data exchange format</h1>

    <h2>What is Signal K?</h2>
    <h3>A Free and Open Source universal marine data exchange format</h3>
    <p>
      Signal K is a modern and open data format for marine use. Built on standard web technologies including JSON,
      WebSockets and HTTP, Signal K provides a method for sharing information in a way that is friendly to WiFi,
      cellphones, tablets and the Internet. A format available to everyone, where anyone can contribute, Signal K is
      the first truly open data format for the marine industry and is set to revolutionize how we consume and interact
      with data on boats.
    </p>
    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>
      All Signal K source code is published under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache License, Version 2.0</a> and everything else, like protocols and interface descriptions,
      under the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY-SA</a>
      license.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means that it is open source, but friendly to companies that want to use it in closed source applications or
      hardware. Of course source code contributions are always welcome and encouraged.

    <h2>Who is Signal K for?</h2>
    <p>
      Signal K was developed by boaters for boaters, with the intention of using the latest mobile and web technologies
      to give you access to the same experiences on your boat as you have on land. Many of the developments happening
      in home automation and the “Internet of Things”, can be marinised for use on pleasure boats, bringing new
      functionality and solutions, that will enrich your boating activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signal K is more than just a data standard, it is also the mobile apps, server software, web apps and compatible
      hardware that generates and handles this new open data format. On this website, we have information and links
      that will help boaters learn more about the features and benefits of Signal K and how to setup their own Signal K
      system. In addition we have information and links that will help developers and marine electronics manufacturers
      quickly understand the Signal K technology and how they can support it in their products.
