    <h1>Who is the author “JC Shakespeare”?</h1>

<p>Knowledge graphs are tricky beasts to create. Trying to extract semantic metadata from documents is a gargantuan task. Mix them together and you have a recipe for disaster.</p><p>While yak-shaving for my MSc, I found an interesting looking research paper authored by one JC Shakespeare.</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-01-at-14-55-19-JC-Shakespeare-Google-Scholar.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Scholar result for &#34;Tech Media Corruption in the Age of Information by JC Shakespeare&#34;." width="1224" height="233"/></p><p>As you can probably tell from that snippet, there is something a bit hinkey going on here.  Here&#39;s the page that Google Scholar has scraped:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tech-media.png" alt="Screenshot showing a quote which ends with &#34;Shakespeare comma Julius Caesar&#34;." width="688" height="583"/></p><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to see what has happened here. The algorithm (whether via simple AI or complex regular expression) &#34;knows&#34; that a typical surname followed by a comma followed by a typical given name is almost certainly a reference.</p><p>And so &#34;JC Shakespeare&#34; becomes the author of a delightfully diverse set of papers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-01-at-11-57-13-JC-Shakespeare-Google-Scholar.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Scholar results. Shakespeare has, apparently, written about law, technology, wine, and an article in German." width="1674" height="1288"/></p><p>Of course, Julius Caesar isn&#39;t the only play which gets picked up in this way:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-01-at-15-10-16-RII-Shakespeare-richard-Google-Scholar.png" alt="Narrative integrity Autobiographical identity by RIl Shakespeare." width="1142" height="230"/></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-01-at-15-10-24-Narrative-and-Identity.png" alt="Narrative integrity Autobiographical identity and the meaning of the &#34;good life&#34; Mark Freeman and Jens Brockmeier How sour sweet music is When time is broke, and no proportion kept!

It can be remarkably quick at drawing <em>nearly</em> correct conclusions from a diverse data set. When talking about AI, we usually discuss false positives and false negatives. But we also need to ask &#34;is this the sort of mistake a human would make?&#34;</p><p>As it happens, Google has been making this class of mistakes for a few years:</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Scholar has parsed this cafeteria lunch menu as an author list, and it&#39;s delightful <a href="https://t.co/jobE6Z7bpI">pic.twitter.com/jobE6Z7bpI</a></p><p>— Alex Klotz (@AlexanderRKlotz) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderRKlotz/status/1252389218514427909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></p></blockquote></div></div>
