<b>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE REAL WORLD BY ONE WHO GLIMPSED IT AND FLED</b>
</center>
<p>
I have a recurring dream about Kenyon. In it, I&#39;m walking to the post
office on the way to my first class at the start of the school year.
Suddenly it occurs to me that I don&#39;t have my schedule memorized, and
I&#39;m not sure which classes I&#39;m taking, or where exactly I&#39;m supposed to
be going.
</p><p>
Experience is food for the brain. And four years at Kenyon is a rich
meal. I suppose it should be no surprise that your brains will probably
burp up Kenyon for a long time. And I think the reason I keep having the
dream is because its central image is a metaphor for a good part of
life: that is, not knowing where you&#39;re going or what you&#39;re doing.
</p><p>
In the middle of my sophomore year at Kenyon, I decided to paint a copy
of Michelangelo&#39;s &#34;Creation of Adam&#34; from the Sistine Chapel
on the ceiling of my dorm room. By standing on a chair, I could reach
the ceiling, and I taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy
the picture from my art history book.
</p><p>
The picture took me months to do, and in fact, I didn&#39;t finish the work
until very near the end of the school year. I wasn&#39;t much of a painter
then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it
gained in the incongruity of having a High Renaissance masterpiece in a
college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older
laundry.</p><p>
Despite the futility of the whole episode, my fondest memories of
college are times like these, where things were done out of some
inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was
demanded. Clearly, I never spent as much time or work on any authorized
art project, or any poli sci paper, as I spent on this one act of
vandalism.
</p><p>
It&#39;s surprising how hard we&#39;ll work when the work is done just for
ourselves. And with all due respect to John Stuart Mill, maybe
utilitarianism is overrated. If I&#39;ve learned one thing from being a
cartoonist, it&#39;s how important playing is to creativity and happiness.
My job is essentially to come up with 365 ideas a year.</p><p>
We&#39;re not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do
more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our
idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the
television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting
off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car
battery-it recharges by running.</p><p>
At school, new ideas are thrust at you every day. Out in the world,
you&#39;ll have to find the inner motivation to search for new ideas on your
own. With any luck at all, you&#39;ll never need to take an idea and squeeze
a punchline out of it, but as bright, creative people, you&#39;ll be called
upon to generate ideas and solutions all your lives. Letting your mind
play is the best way to solve problems.</p><p>
I don&#39;t look back on my first few years out of school with much
affection, and if I could have talked to you six months ago, I&#39;d have
encouraged you all to flunk some classes and postpone this moment as
long as possible. But now it&#39;s too late.</p><p>
Boy, was I smug.
</p><p>
As it turned out, my editor instantly regretted his decision to hire me.
By the end of the summer, I&#39;d been given notice; by the beginning of
winter, I was in an unemployment line; and by the end of my first year
away from Kenyon, I was broke and living with my parents again. You can
imagine how upset my dad was when he learned that Kenyon doesn&#39;t give
refunds.</p><p>
A REAL job is a job you hate. I designed car ads and grocery ads in the
windowless basement of a convenience store, and I hated every single
minute of the 4-1/2 million minutes I worked there. My fellow prisoners
at work were basically concerned about how to punch the time clock at
the perfect second where they would earn another 20 cents without doing
any work for it.</p><p>
It&#39;s funny how at Kenyon, you take for granted that the people around
you think about more than the last episode of Dynasty. I guess that&#39;s
what it means to be in an ivory tower.
</p><p>
Anyway, after a few months at this job, I was starved for some life of
the mind that, during my lunch break, I used to read those poli sci
books that I&#39;d somehow never quite finished when I was here. Some of
those books were actually kind of interesting. It was a rude shock to
see just how empty and robotic life can be when you don&#39;t care about
what you&#39;re doing, and the only reason you&#39;re there is to pay the
bills.</p><blockquote>&#34;the mass of men lead lives of
