    <h1>Zink brings conformant OpenGL on Imagination GPUs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imagination Technologies</a> announced some very exciting news: they are now <a href="https://blog.imaginationtech.com/imagination-gpus-now-support-opengl-4.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using Zink for full OpenGL 4.6 support</a>! Collabora had the pleasure of working together with engineers from Imagination to make this a reality, and it&#39;s very rewarding to now be able show the results to the world!</p>
<p>This is the first time we&#39;ve seen a hardware vendor trust the OpenGL-on-Vulkan Mesa driver enough to completely <em>side-step</em> a native OpenGL driver and use it in a <em>shipping product</em>. It&#39;s wonderful to see that Zink can realistically be used as a work-horse, <strong>especially</strong> in a high-performance graphics setting.</p>
<p>Zink <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/news-and-blog/blog/2018/10/31/introducing-zink-opengl-implementation-vulkan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started out</a> as a small R&amp;D project at Collabora, but has since grown to be a full-on community project. None of this would have been possible without the awesome work done by <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mike</a> and the other Zink contributors!</p>
<h3>Conformance</h3>
<p>One small detail from Imagination&#39;s post that I think is important to highlight is that the solution is <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengl#submission_332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">officially conformant</a>. This is the first product to be officially conformant using Zink, but it&#39;s not going to be the last! In fact, we only need one more conformant implementation before Zink itself is conformant as a generic layered implementation, according to the Khronos <a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/conformance_procedures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Conformant Product Criteria</a>.</p>
<h3>An Open Source graphics future</h3>
<p>In the not too distant future, we should be able to combine Zink with the in-progress <a href="https://developer.imaginationtech.com/open-source-gpu-driver/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">open source driver</a> from Imagination, and that&#39;s when things will <em>really</em> start to shine for the open source graphics stack on Imagination hardware. So there&#39;s plenty more to look forward to here!</p>
