    <h1>Mastodon&#39;s federation model encourages specific instances with peculiar rules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>what makes a <strong>social network</strong> interesting is the <strong>contributions</strong> that the users decide to make available to the world. I am of the opinion that, to give the users the most <strong>freedom</strong> to let their <strong>personality</strong> shine, the social network itslef should be as <strong>boring</strong> and <strong>generic</strong> as possible.</p>
<p>social networks can of course choose to <strong>differenciate</strong> themselves by some sort of <strong>gimmick:</strong> LinkedIn is <em>business-oriented</em>, Instagram is <em>photo-oriented</em>, Tumblr is <em>post-oriented</em> and Twitter is <em>short-form-oriented</em>; but I believe they shouldn&#39;t go <strong>beyond</strong> that.</p>
<p>so why isn&#39;t <strong>Mastododon</strong> a good <strong>social network</strong>?</p>
<p>imagine if the <strong>only</strong> online profile where you could <strong>express</strong> yourself was through your old <strong>&#34;Ancient Greek Literature Forum&#34;</strong> account. that would be quite <strong>limiting</strong>, wouldn&#39;t it? you&#39;d have to follow the forum <strong>rules</strong>, which are quite <strong>strict</strong> and perfectly adequate to regulate discourse about ancient literature, yet completely <strong>limiting</strong> when wanting to discuss about <strong>general topics</strong>. you created that account because you wanted to take part on those <strong>specific conversations</strong>, not because you wanted it to represent your <strong>whole</strong> online persona.</p>
<p>I feel this is what Mastodon <strong>encourages</strong> with its <strong>federation model.</strong> <strong>admins</strong> create these highly <strong>specific</strong> instances with <strong>peculiar</strong> rules, and people who want to create a profile <strong>there</strong> have to <strong>submit</strong> themselves to a highly <strong>limited</strong> set of conversations and content they can <strong>publish</strong>. what if I feel <strong>strongly</strong> about some geopolitical topic yet those kind of conversations are <strong>banned</strong> on my <strong>&#34;LEGOholics&#34;</strong> instance? where will I <strong>voice</strong> my opinion? on <strong>another</strong> server? with <strong>another</strong> account? what&#39;s the <strong>point</strong> then?</p>
<p>some could say: just create your account on a more <strong>generalist</strong> instance! that&#39;s <strong>true</strong>, but most people <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want to host generic instances. they go through the <strong>hassle</strong> of setting up their own if it allows them to create some nice little place <strong>entirely</strong> dedicated to their <strong>passions</strong>. generalist intances are <strong>few</strong> and far apart and they, rightfully, attract the <strong>most</strong> users. but this creates <strong>enormous</strong> conglomerates which hold too much <strong>power</strong> and <strong>influence</strong> on the fediverse and risk creating great <strong>damage</strong> with every action they take, such as <strong>blacklisting</strong> some specific instance or <strong>defederating</strong> alltogether.</p>
<p>the <strong>ideal</strong> solution would be to <strong>distribute</strong> all these users between many <strong>small</strong> and <strong>generic</strong> instances with no <strong>silly domain names</strong> or <strong>draconic rule sets</strong> and have some way to create <strong>&#34;forum-like&#34;</strong> instances where <strong>no</strong> accounts can be created but where <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>highly moderated</strong> discussions can take place.</p>
<p>I personally <strong>don&#39;t</strong> think this will ever be <strong>possible</strong>, it can only serve as some nice little <strong>fantasy</strong> to keep me <strong>dreaming</strong> for better online spaces.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;just run your own instance&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like Mastodon to be the best federated social network possible, which is why I want to suggest a better way of federating. Telling people to make their own server is a valid suggestion, but its natural conclusion is a peer 2 peer architecture instead of a federated one. If you want a p2p social network, cool, but that&#39;s not what Mastodon was optimized to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;actually having very specialized communities is good&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mastodon is a social network, not a multi-forum platform. My proposal for a hybrid system is, I think, the best way to get the best out of both worlds: the freedom and individuality of your own personal social media account and the incredible depth of personalized communities akin to the forum era. Unfortunately this means that Mastodon would have to take some advice both from the Reddit and Facebook models, instead of being a copy of Twitter.</p>
