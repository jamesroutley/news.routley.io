<p>The saga continued today… on twitch.tv/msrobot0.  I attempted to web3 ify <a href="https://ex-worlding.herokuapp.com/">ex-worlding</a>.  By web3ify I mean that you don’t log in – you connect your wallet to the site (its safe). And if you create a world, this is the user associated with the world. Otherwise worlds are anonymous. </p>



<p>Also by web3ify I mean we don’t use databases. We just use ipfs – which is a database – and probably less secure – but its web3. </p>



<p>I have made a bunch of sites before that connect to a wallet but this is my first time creating a site that connects to ipfs. And it is a pain. I am writing this in python. I had an old version of the<a href="https://ipfs.io/"> ipfs daimon</a> installed. A lot of sites said to upgrade this – so I did. Thanks homebrew – I am on a mac. Then I was using a client library ipfshttpclient. I apparently was using an old version so I force installed version 7. Pip used to handle package dependencies I think but maybe I am deluded. Anyway it clashed with some other library. I uninstalled that library and then did a clean install of the new ipfshttclient and everything seemed ok. </p>



<p>Until I got an error that my ipfs daemon version (11 – the latest) was not supported yet. </p>



<p>I just threw in the towel. I fired up my trusty <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/">request for humans</a> library. I mean this is why we cant have nice things and I still use vi. Things seemed to g a little better – I got a 400 error – which is still an error but I think I was getting a  503 error before (a gateway error – which is worse -imho). At least here I am connecting with the ipfs gateway – I think. </p>



<p>Anyway- it still did not work because it needs a keyword file. I tried a few things that did not work  – and this error is logged on the internets – from October 21. I do feel like have made progress. I wrote this blog post while finishing my twich live stream. And now I am going to close it out with a yoga kriya. </p>



<p>Happy Full Moon in Leo Folks – be bold and use conditioner even if you are bald. </p>
