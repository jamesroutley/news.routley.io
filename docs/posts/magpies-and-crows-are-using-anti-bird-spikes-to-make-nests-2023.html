          <section property="schema:text"> <p>Humans have made the world less hospitable for birds in many ways. One obvious and intentional example of this can be found in towns and cities worldwide: anti-bird spikes. The pointy wires you might see attached to roofs, ledges, and light poles are meant to deter urban species like pigeons from landing, pooping, and even nesting where people don’t want them to. But in an avian act of poetic justice, a handful of European birds have struck back.</p>

<p>Apparently Carrion Crows and Eurasian Magpies are stealing and repurposing the spikes as a nest-building material. Nests featuring the deterrent were documented in <a href="https://www.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/documents-nmr/Publicaties/Deinsea/Deinsea_21/Deinsea_21_17_25_2023_Hiemstra_et_al.pdf">a study</a> published Tuesday in the Dutch journal <em>Deinsea</em>, an online periodical from the Natural History Museum Rotterdam. </p>

<p>When Cornelis Moeliker, director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam and one of the study authors, saw the nests, he was “totally baffled,” he says. “I’ve been watching wildlife, and especially urban nature, for about half a century, and I’ve never seen something like this. It’s almost unbelievable that it actually happens–I mean, the sheer irony of it.”</p>

<p>One of the recently discovered magpie nests now lives at the Leiden museum and includes about 1,500 visible metal spikes. “It’s quite solid,” Hiemstra says, though still light enough to easily pick up. He describes the nest as “magnificent and weird looking, but also so well-built and creative.” The nest was first noticed by a patient looking out of his Antwerp hospital window in 2021. Soon after, Hiemstra received an email from the man imploring him to come see it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Rotterdam, maintenance workers had found an odd, unfinished crow’s nest in a tree and contacted the local natural history museum. From there, the researchers teamed up and tracked down other similar nest observations by scouring the scientific literature, local news reports, and even social media posts.</p>

<p>It also appears that the birds specifically sought out the spikes. Two of the newly documented nests, collected by the researchers and brought back to the museum for preservation and display, still had sticky adhesive lingering on the hardware, implying that the animals tore the spikes off of buildings. Although magpies and crows haven’t been documented doing this, other birds have. In 2019, a video of a Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo pulling a spiky strip from the ledge of a building in Australia was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/chick-flick-cockatoo-gives-anti-nesting-spikes-the-bird-in-viral-video" target="_blank">widely shared</a> online. For the magpies and crows, the spikes are apparently valuable, Hiemstra notes. They must be “worth putting in the extra effort.”</p>
