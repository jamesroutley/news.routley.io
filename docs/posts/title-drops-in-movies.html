		<img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/leonardo_pointing.jpg"/></p> <p>The overall meta-ness of this is - of course - nothing new. And filmmakers and scriptwriters
		have been doing it since the dawn of the medium itself<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lmooii">*</span>. It&#39;s known in film speak as a <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-u51ftf">title drop</strong>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yuztv1">Consequently, there&#39;s tons of examples throughout movie history that range from the iconic (see
		Back to the Future&#39;s above)</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/drops/eternal_sunshine_drop.jpg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-3rfu4h">the very much self-aware</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/drops/hot_tub_drop.jpg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1c1pags">to the downright cringe.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/drops/suicide_squad_drop.jpg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1b81rdb">But how common are these title drops really? Has this phenomenon gained momentum over time with
		our postmodern culture becoming ever more meta? Can we predict anything about the quality of a
		film based on how many times its title is mentioned? And what does a movie title mean, anyway?</p> <p>There have been <a href="https://datanaut.blog/posts/title-drops-in-movies/" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-6w8ywg">analyses</a>
		and
		<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jeremyhayes1/movie-title-in-the-movie-moments" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-a9m0z6">oh</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/the-thirty-greatest-titular-lines-in-movie-history" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-10ewxdq">so</a> <a href="https://www.watchmojo.com/articles/top-10-movie-title-name-drops#:~:text=%231%3A%20%E2%80%9CBack%20to%20the%20Future%E2%80%9D%20(1985)&amp;text=It%20would%20top%20this%20podium,%2Ddrops%20go%2C%20it&#39;s%20exemplary!" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-125zz3k">so</a> <a href="https://screenrant.com/worst-title-drops-movies-reddit/" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-143sq03">many</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/50-greatest-movie-title-drops/" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-1ozhrnj">listicles</a>
		of the title drop phenomenon before, but they are small and anecdotal. Here&#39;s the first extensive
		analysis of title drops for a dataset of <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-1b0xmtx">73,921 movies</strong> that amount to
		<strong data-svelte-h="svelte-1r2vhv">roughly 61% of movies on IMDb</strong> with at least 100 user votes<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lmooii">*</span>. I&#39;m looking at <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-1dmwuha">movies released between 1940 and 2023</strong>.
		<img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/movie_histogram.svg"/> Special thanks go to my friends at
		<a href="https://opensubtitles.com" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-6ld4nw">OpenSubtitles.com</a> for providing this data!</p> <h3>Let&#39;s talk data</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1b16of4">I started out with two datasets: 89,242 (English) movie subtitles from <a href="https://opensubtitles.com" target="_blank">OpenSubtitles.com</a>
		and metadata for 121,797 movies from
		<a href="https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/" target="_blank">IMDb</a>. After
		joining them and filtering them for broken subtitle files I was left with a total of 73,921
		subtitled movies. With that out of the way, I realized that the tougher task was still ahead of
		me: answering the question what even <em>was</em> a title drop?</p> <p>The na√Øve approach is - of course - to simply look for the movie&#39;s name anywhere in the
		subtitles. Which is a fantastic approach for movies like <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0088763" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>Back to the Future</a> with a nice unique title:</p>  <p>But this quickly breaks down if we look at movies like <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0910869" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>E</a> or <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt2302966" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>I</a> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lmooii">*</span>, which lead to way too many matches.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1cgcrje">We also run into problems with every movie that is a sequel (Rocky III, Hot Tub Time Machine 2)
		since none of the characters will add the sequel number to character names/oversized bathing
		equipment. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/2016-movie-titles-colon-record-captain-america-rogue-one/" target="_blank">rise of the colon</a>
		in movie titles would make for some very awkward dialogue (LUKE: &#34;Gosh Mr. Kenobi, it&#39;s almost like
		we&#39;re in the middle of some <i>Star Wars Episode Four: A New Hope</i>!&#34;).
		<img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/dead_poets_fake.jpeg"/>
		(See also the
		<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/he-didnt-say-that-movie-titles-in-movie-lines" target="_blank">He Didn&#39;t Say That</a>
		meme.)</p> <p>So I applied a few rules to my title matching in the dialogue. Leading &#39;The&#39;, &#39;An&#39; and &#39;A&#39;s and
		special characters like dashes are ignored, sequel numbers both Arabic and Roman are dropped
		(along with &#39;Episode...&#39;, &#39;Part...&#39; etc.) and titles containing a colon are split and either
		side counts as a title drop. So for <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0120737" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a>
		either &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; or &#34;Fellowship of the Ring&#34; would count as title drops (feel free to hover
		over the visualizations to explore the matches)!</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1byeszk">With the data cleaning out of the way, let&#39;s get down to business!</p> <h3>Stats</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-jpwz7q">Alright, so here&#39;s the number you&#39;ve all been waiting for (drumroll):
		</p> <p>So who are the most excessive offenders in mentioning their titles over the course of the film?
		The overall star when it comes to fiction only came out last year: it&#39;s <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt1517268" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>Barbie</a> by Greta Gerwig with an impressive
		<strong data-svelte-h="svelte-14d7fe0">267 title drops within its 1 hour and 54 minutes runtime</strong>, clocking in at a
		whopping <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-dufrow">2.34 BPM (Barbies Per Minute)</strong>.</p> <p>On the non-fiction side of documentaries the winner is <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt11178402" target="_blank"><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/film-strip-fill.svg"/>Mickey: The Story of a Mouse</a>
		with <strong data-svelte-h="svelte-1rvxecz">309 title drops in only 90 minutes</strong>, so
		<strong data-svelte-h="svelte-covmcq">3.43 Mickeys Per Minute</strong>!</p> <div><h4>Top ten number of title drops in one movie</h4> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-wavy.svg"/> </p></div> <div><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1b6n1rq">Fiction only</p>   <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1teau28">Fiction + Documentaries</p></div>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-t9zag4">What&#39;s interesting about the (Fiction) list here is that it&#39;s pretty international: only two of
		the top ten movies come from Hollywood, 6 are from India, one from Indonesia and one from
		Turkey. So it&#39;s definitely an international phenomenon.</p> <h3>Names in titles</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p>Looking at the top ten list you might have noticed this little icon <img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/person-circle-outline-svgrepo-com.svg"/>
		signifying a movie where the data says it&#39;s named after one of its characters<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lmooii">*</span>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1sdzjv0">Unsurprisingly, movies named after one of their characters have <strong>an average of 24.7 title drops</strong>, more than twice as much as the usual 10.3. Protagonists have a tendency to pop up repeatedly
		in a film, so their names usually do the same.
		</p> <details><summary data-svelte-h="svelte-qu4307">A note on the data here</summary> <hr/>
			This is the more experimental part of the analysis. To figure out if a movie was named after its
			protagonist I&#39;ve used
			<a href="https://datasets.imdbws.com/" target="_blank" data-svelte-h="svelte-xvznn2">IMDb&#39;s Principals Dataset</a>
			that lists character names for the first couple of actors and compared that to the movie&#39;s title.</details> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yzg0zi">An interesting category are movies named after a character that only have a single title drop -
		making it all the more meaningful?</p> <div><h4>Movies named after a character with single title drops</h4> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-wavy.svg"/> </p></div>  <h3>&#34;Real&#34; title drops</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1h25k9n">Title-drop connoisseurs might sneer at this point and well-actually us that a &#34;real&#34; title drop
		should only happen once in a film. That there&#39;s this one memorable (or cringe-y) scene where the
		protagonist looks directly at the camera and declares the title of the film with as much pathos
		as they can muster. Or as a nice send-off in the last spoken line.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/little_women_moe_side_by_side.jpg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uojp5d">Such single drops happen surprisingly often:</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/count_percentage.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-hkq436">In the single drop case it is more likely that the filmmakers were adding a title drop very
		consciously.</p> <div><h4>Highest rated single drop movies</h4> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-wavy.svg"/> </p></div> <div><p data-svelte-h="svelte-1b6n1rq">Fiction only</p>   <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1teau28">Fiction + Documentaries</p></div>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1t9sgt8">Single drops often happen in a key scene and explain the movie&#39;s title: what mysterious
		fellowship the first Lord of the Rings is named after. Or that the audience waiting for some
		dark knight to show up must simply accept that it&#39;s been the Batman all along.</p> <h3>Title drops over the years</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-uw6c0s">One suspicion I had was that the very meta act of having a character speak the name of the movie
		they&#39;re in would be something gaining more and more traction over the last two or three decades.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5yxcef">And indeed, if we look at the average number of movies with title drops over the decades we can
		see that there&#39;s a certain upwards trend. The 1960s and 1970s seemed to be most averse to
		mentioning their title in the film, while it&#39;s become more common-place over the last years.

		<img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/deviation_by_decade.svg"/></p> <div><h4>Highest title drops by decade</h4> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-wavy.svg"/> </p></div>  <div><p data-svelte-h="svelte-zrarij">Most drops</p>   <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lsvmm9">Best rated (at least 1 drop)</p></div>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1o5djl7">If we dig deeper, this growth over the decades comes with a clearer explanation: splitting up
		movies by single- and multi-title drops shows that while the tendency of movies to drop their
		title exactly once keeps more or less steady, the number of multi-drop films is on the rise.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/decs_single_vs_multi.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-xxse9f">Your explanation for this (More movies are being named after their protagonists? Movies are more
		productified so brand recognition becomes an important concern?) is probably as good as mine ü§∑</p> <h3>A sign of quality?</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-zyvhke">Another question I wanted to answer was if a high number of title drops was a sign of a bad
		movie. Think of all the trashy slasher and horror movies about Meth Marmots and Killer
		Ballerinas - wouldn&#39;t their characters in the sparse dialogues constantly mention the title for
		brand recognition and all that?</p> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/rating_vs_drops.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-btkys1">Interestingly though, there&#39;s no strong connection between film quality (expressed as IMDb
		rating (YMMV)) and the probability of title-dropping.</p> <h3>Genres and title drops</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-5mtp2k">An aspect that certainly <em>does</em> have an impact on the probability of a title drop though is
		the genre of a film.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12p4e2m">If you think back to the discussion about names in titles from earlier, genres like Biography
		and other non-fiction genres like Sport and History - almost by definition - mention their
		subject in both the title and throughout the film.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z5f9mt">Accordingly, the probability of a title drop varies wildly by genre. Non-fiction films have a
		strong tendency towards title-dropping, while more fiction-oriented genres like Crime, Romance
		and War don&#39;t.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-89tmax"><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/deviation_by_genre_styled_anno.svg"/></p> <h3>What does a movie title mean?</h3> <p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble-scratchy.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-xmexhq">Finally, we can ask the question: what even <em>is</em> a movie title?
		</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xsiy58">I couldn&#39;t find a complete classification in the scientific literature (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02666286.2015.1053037" target="_blank">&#34;What&#39;s in a name? The art of movie titling&#34;</a>
		by Ingrid Haidegger comes the closest). Movie titles are an interesting case, since they have to
		work as a description of a product, a marketing instrument, but also as the title of a piece of art.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-qw1d0v">The most extensive classification of media titles in general I could find is
		<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleTropes" target="_blank">TVTropes&#39; Title Tropes list</a>
		which lists over 180 (!) different types of tropes alone. Some of those tropes are:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dt3wh9">While naming a movie is a very creative task and pretty successfully defies classification, we
		can still look at the overall shape of movie titles and see if that has any impact on the number
		of title drops.</p> <p>One such simple aspect is the length of the title itself. As you would expect there&#39;s a negative
		correlation (if only a slight one<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lmooii">*</span>)
		between the length of a title and the number of title drops it does.
		<img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/charts/title_length.svg"/></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10d3gzs">Still, there are some fun examples for <em>reaaaaally</em>
		long movie titles that nevertheless do at least one title drop:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1l1h6zn">And while these previous examples only drops parts from before or after the colon, this next
		specimen actually does an impressive full title drop:</p>  <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/img/deco/scribble1.svg"/></p><p data-svelte-h="svelte-vvmi2w">And with that, we&#39;re done with the overarching analysis!
