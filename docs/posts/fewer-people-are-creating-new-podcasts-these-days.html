    <h1>Fewer people are creating new podcasts these days</h1>

Yet, those numbers fare poorly compared to 2020 and 2021 figures (30,130,431 and 29,513,070 respectively).</p></li></ul><p>Are podcast creators giving up? The above figures certainly suggest many have. The time and effort it takes to maintain a podcast property is non-negligible and it’s probably harder to start from one scratch these days than let’s say five years ago due to the existing competition.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
