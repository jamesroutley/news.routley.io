<p>The what and the why in a single image:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/bollard.jpg" alt="bollard"/></p>

<p>A bollard is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>any sort of physical barricade strong enough, shaped in such a way, that if a vehicle tries to overlap with the bollard in location, intentional or not, the vehicle cannot cross. Sometimes they‚Äôre built into the physical environment, sometimes not. They can be movable or not. Large and intrusive, or not.</p>

<p>In the words of a local city engineer‚Äô<sup id="fnref:will-not-be-named" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:will-not-be-named" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, <em>as he was explaining why a bollard placed near where pedestrians congregate to cross a large roadway would be innapropriate</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barriers (bollards, guardrail, etc.) are considered for installation if the result of a vehicle striking the barrier will be less severe than hitting the unshielded object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a placement like this makes intuitive sense:</p>

<p>You‚Äôll never unsee this:</p>

<p>https://www.urbanismspeakeasy.com/p/take-another-look-at-where-they-put</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But public works and transportation departments routinely install guardrails <em>on the outside of a sidewalk</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, please stop evaluating local transportation administrations as competent. I‚Äôve hung out with these people, gone on walks with them, driven around with them, listened to them get excited about a new pedestrian affordence they‚Äôve installed, and the lack of awareness and closemindedness (which is obviously necessary to sustain a shitty system creaking into it‚Äôs 100th year of existance) is stunning.</p>

<p>To interact with local transportation administrations <em>requires</em> that you 1) self-abandon, and 2) maintain performative allegience to a pseudo-scientific view of the world.</p>

<p><em>It‚Äôs tricky to hit the right emotional tone of why bollards matter. Sometimes it seems academic and dry, sometimes its very visceral and raw.</em></p>

<p>Where there are not bollards, there are careening, speeding vehicles, and often enough death and destruction.</p>

<p>To park a vehicle, one needs to press the correct pedel. When people are driving unfamilar vehicles, or rushed, or whatever, sometimes the wrong peddle gets pushed. Would you suggest that this small error should result in death of people and the elimination of businesses and buildings?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1cfs0np/why_cars_should_be_restricted"><img src="https://josh.works/images/car_in_store.png" alt="car_in_store"/></a></p>

<p>When there are not bollards, in areas where people are promised safety, even if everyone behaves correctly, there are still failures. For example‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Once, a widely respected member of a local software development community and their partner (also a widely respected member of the same community) were walking on a sidewalk in California one night a few years ago. Far from them, a speeding car struck another car of course careened through the sidewalk. Both friends were hit by the car. She was killed instantly, he was knocked unconcious, woke up days later to find out the news. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/29-year-old-woman-identified-as-victim-in-S-F-16189585.php">The lanugage in the article is full of ‚Äòthis was an unavoidable tragedy‚Äô</a>, though i think it‚Äôs obvious a local city engineer ought to be held criminally liable for their neglect.</p>

<p>Because not only was it entirely preventable, it was also statistically inevitable. Not putting bollards where they need to be is like not only <em>not wearing a seatbelt</em> when driving, but arguing that <em>seatbelts should not be available in cars because usually they‚Äôre not needed</em>.</p>

<p>A bollard is just a seatbelt for someone outside of the vehicle.</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ this is the sort of devestation done to a community that everyone would obviously want to prevent. And this exact pattern plays out many times a day.</p>

<p>So, when there‚Äôs <em>not</em> bollards, often enough, there are cars.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs another example - even souless corporate entities understand bollards and appreciate that they have a duty of responsibility to people who are using their spaces:</p>

<p><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/2/8/23591381/7-eleven-storefront-crash-settles-lawsuit-bensenville">7-Eleven to pay $91 million to suburban man who lost both legs because they didn‚Äôt install bollards at <em>that</em> location.</a></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a normal occurrance. Notice down below how often this kind of thing happens. I hope there‚Äôs bollards at every 7/11 now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 57-year-old suburban man who became a double amputee after a car pinned his legs against the front of a Bensenville 7-Eleven will receive a $91 million payout from the convenience store chain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a moment, you‚Äôll see the kinds of vehicle-strikes-building results this refers to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The case was the first in which attorneys had access to some 15 years of reports from 7- Eleven, which identified some 6,253 storefront crashes at 7-Eleven stores across the country, Power said. Data from a previous lawsuit against the company identified another 1,525 crashes between 1991 and 1996.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who in the story do you think uttered the following?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note that this unfortunate accident was caused by a reckless driver who pled guilty, and this store followed all local building codes and ordinances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the legal representation of 7/11, but you can also hear the local city manager or city engineer saying ‚Äòit was not my fault either!‚Äô. (‚Äúfollowed all local buildiong codes and ordinances‚Äù)</p>

<p>Maybe it would feel poetic if he was also a car-user, having his life destroyed by a car, but he didn‚Äôt even have a car.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carl was a frequent customer of the Bensenville store, and most days would walk a few blocks from an apartment he shared with his three sons to buy his morning coffee‚Ä¶</p>

  <p>[the morning of this tragic-yet-statistically-inevitable systemic failure] Carl‚Äôs ride was running late, and a man pulling into a parking space in front of the store stepped on his car‚Äôs accelerator instead of the brake. The car lurched over the curb, across a sidewalk and pinned Carl against the storefront, causing injuries that would require the amputation of both his legs above the knees. Another driver had crashed into the front of the same store 16 months earlier, Power said.</p>

<p>In the context of ‚Äòbollards as protecting store-fronts from cars‚Äô, sort of akin to a physical insurance policy, here‚Äôs what moving vehicles, through stores, can look like.</p>

<p>I wonder what losses the involved parties were able to recoup. Presumably insurance would make partial financial repairs, but it would all be at great opportunity cost, hassle, sadness, anger.</p>

<p>Even a <em>rock</em>, obtained functionally for free, could have fully prevented this. Again, no one‚Äôs fault, but it hurts to see damage accrue.</p>

<p>üëâ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1cfs0np/why_cars_should_be_restricted/">driver presses wrong peddle when parking outside store</a></p>

<p>I dislike the caption. It says ‚Äúwoman forgets‚Ä¶‚Äù which feels like it‚Äôs possibly playing into the mysogentistic sentiment that some people are, for reasons of fundamental inferiority, unable to develop a certain skill.</p>

<p>It should say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This sort of incident would be perfectly prevented by bollards like this:</p>

<p>I live in the Cheesman park area in Denver, there‚Äôs already plenty of bollards and bollard-passing objects (trees, light poles, boulders) and I‚Äôd love for there to be many more, following similar-enough patterns of what is already placed, with some reasonable, obvious iteration.</p>

<p>Bollards are like iceburgs. Some bollards are not placed deep into the ground or very strong, and might deform under a vehicle impact. Some bollards are quite firmly placed.</p>
