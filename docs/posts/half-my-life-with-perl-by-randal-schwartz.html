<p>Randal Schwartz - 2024-12-19</p>

<div><p>I had never met Randal Schwartz before, but when I reached out to him about contributing to year 25 of the Perl Advent Calendar, he immediately agreed. This year I wanted to try some new things and Randal suggested giving a Perl-specific talk which he had given once before, but which was lacking in recording quality. This gave Randal a chance to re-record his talk and it gave the Perl communities a chance to watch in real time. We&#39;ve never before had a video recording as a Perl Advent article, but I believe quite strongly that this is in the spirit of the Advent Calendar project, which is about giving something back. Also, when I mentioned it to Mark Fowler back in October, he didn&#39;t object, so I&#39;ll take that as a seal of approval.</p>

<p>-- Olaf Alders</p>

<p>Randal&#39;s advance summary of this talk:</p>

<pre><code>    Having been there, at the beginning with Perl, I will recount the early
    days through the modern era (or as much as I can cover in the time
    provided). I’ll deliver first-hand experience of the creation of the Camel
    Book, the Llama book, and the way I invaded comp.unix.questions with Perl 2
    answers so often that people would post “no Perl please”. Oh, and my
    version of the story of the Schwartzian Transform.</code></pre>

<p>If you enjoyed the video below, you may also enjoy the next in the series, which will be presented by Dave Cross: <a href="https://lu.ma/3b8ekn8y">Still Munging Data with Perl</a>. If you are at all interested, please register now, even if you cannot attend, as that will allow us to share the recording URL with you after the fact.</p>

<p>Now, please enjoy Randal Schwartz&#39;s &#34;Half My Life with Perl&#34;:</p>
