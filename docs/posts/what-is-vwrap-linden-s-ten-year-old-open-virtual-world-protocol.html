    <h1>What is VWRAP? (Linden&#39;s ten year old open Virtual World protocol)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="00_Intro">
      
      <p>
        In 2009 and 2010 I was involved in defining and
        implementing the Virtual Worlds Region Agent
        Protocol. I built a number of Node.JS services
        at Linden Lab, helped manage an IETF Working
        Group tasked with shepherding the protocol
        through the standardization process and even
        wrote a bunch of the specs myself. Virtual and
        Augmented reality has boarded the hype-train
        again so I figured it might be interesting to
        re-publish links to the old specs and blog posts
        that have since disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP was the name of the protocol and the IETF
        Working Group and was focused on supporting
        open, inter-operable, standards-based &#34;Second
        Life-Like&#34; virtual worlds. We weren&#39;t trying to
        create a protocol that was &#34;all things to all
        people&#34; and consequently lost a number of good
        potential contributors from Project Wonderland,
        There.Com and elsewhere. (Specifically, Second
        Life uses a model where the &#34;ground truth&#34; is
        owned by the server instead of the truth model
        being distributed among a number of peers.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In an effort to try to explain what VWRAP was
        all about, I penned a number of blog
        posts. Let&#39;s start with this one: it&#39;s an
        overview of what VWRAP is and how it&#39;s intended
        to be used: <a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/v2/technical/vwrap/what_is_the_virtual_worlds_region_agent_protocol.html">What
        Is the Virtual Worlds Region Agent Protocol</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you&#39;re familiar with VWRAP&#39;s context, you
        may want to read a few of the specifications. At
        the very least, you should read the
        &#34;Introduction and Goals&#34; Internet Draft written
        my David Levine and myself. The &#34;Abstract Type
        System&#34; Internet Draft introduced the
        description of a hypothetical type system our
        protocol would depend on. It&#39;s not horribly
        complicated: integers, booleans, arrays and that
        kind of thing. It might be interesting as a
        model for specifying protocol type behaviour
        without depending on a particular language or
        processor architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you&#39;ve read and digested the Abstract Type
        System documentation, the &#34;Trust Model and User
        Authentication&#34; text can serve as an example of
        how to construct &#34;VWRAP-Like Services&#34; (as well
        as describing the trust model we expected second
        life-like worlds to use.) If the Abstract Type
        System documentation seems too dry, try reading
        the article &#34;<a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/v2/technical/vwrap/an_abstract_type_system.html">Abstract
        Type System? Hunh?</a>&#34; first. It&#39;s short and it
        might help you figure out what&#39;s going on with
        that specification.

      <p>
        This is a fair amount of technical documentation
        to consume; and it&#39;s all relatively foreign to
        the experience of most web developers. John
        Hurliman and I wrote an internet draft that
        describes how VWRAP / Second Life-Like services
        can be launched via downloading a specially
        formatted message with a particular MIME
        Type. The idea here is that end users&#39; systems
        would be configured to launch a Second Life
        viewer upon receipt of this type of MIME
        message. This would act as a sort of
        authentication bridge between the web world and
        the Second Life virtual world.

        Speaking of VWRAP Internet Drafts, you may want
        to review the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/vwrap/about/">VWRAP
        Working Group Charter</a> and this blog post on
        &#34;<a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/v2/technical/vwrap/notes_on_the_history_of_the_vwrap_working_group.html">Notes
        on the History of the VWRAP Working Group</a>.&#34;
        The history is a little convoluted, having gone
        through the names OGP and MMOX before settling
        on VWRAP.

        The blog post <a href="https://meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/v2/technical/vwrap/what_does_it_mean_for_a_virtual_world_to_be_second_life_like.html">What
        Does It Mean for a Virtual World to be
        &#34;Second-Life-Like&#34;</a> describes briefly the
        three features of SL like worlds: the virtual
        world is persistent, things in the virtual world
        are persistent and there&#39;s only one of you. A
        more detailed list of things that make a world
        &#34;Second Life-Like&#34; is provided in
