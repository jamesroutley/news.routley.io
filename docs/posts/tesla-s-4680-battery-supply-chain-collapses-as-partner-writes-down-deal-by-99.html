<p>A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped. South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F Co. announced today that the value of its massive supply deal with Tesla has been slashed by over 99%, signaling a catastrophic drop in demand for the automaker’s in-house battery cells.</p>



<p>This is arguably the strongest evidence yet that Tesla’s 4680 program, and the vehicle that relies on it, the Cybertruck, is in serious trouble.</p>



<p>In early 2023, L&amp;F <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-lf-says-value-battery-material-supply-deal-with-tesla-cut-7386-2025-12-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a $2.9 billion contract</a> to supply high-nickel cathode materials directly to Tesla.</p>



<p>At the time, the industry saw this as a major move by Tesla to secure materials for its ramp-up of the 4680 battery cell, which Elon Musk had touted as the key to halving battery costs and enabling cheaper electric vehicles, a plan he later scrapped.</p>	
	



<p>Right now, Tesla’s Cybertruck is the only vehicle using the automaker’s own 4680 cells.</p>



<p>In a regulatory filing today, L&amp;F revealed that the contract’s value has been written down to just $7,386.</p>



<p>No, that is not a typo. $2.9 billion to roughly $7,400.</p>



<p>L&amp;F did not explicitly state the reason for the cut, citing only a “change in supply quantity,” but the dots are easy to connect. The high-nickel cathode was destined for Tesla’s 4680 cells, and the primary consumer of those cells is the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>We have been reporting on the Cybertruck’s demand issues for the better part of this year. In March, we noted that the truck was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/06/tesla-now-offers-discounted-financing-on-cybertruck-as-the-truck-turns-out-to-be-a-flop/">turning out to be a flop</a> as Tesla began offering discounted financing to move inventory. By June, Tesla <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/05/tesla-goes-full-desperate-cybertruck-with-biggest-discount-yet/">became desperate</a>, launching 0% APR incentives as inventory piled up in lots across the US.</p>



<p>Despite a production capacity of 250,000 units per year at Giga Texas, the Cybertruck is currently selling at a run rate of roughly 20,000 to 25,000 units annually. We even saw Tesla <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/">discontinue the cheapest Cybertruck</a> in September because, frankly, no one wanted a gutted version of a truck that was already struggling to find buyers.</p>



<p>If Tesla isn’t building Cybertrucks, it doesn’t need 4680 cells. And if it doesn’t need 4680 cells, L&amp;F has no one to sell its cathode material to.</p>



<h3 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h3>



<p>This is not a good look Tesla’s 4680 program.</p>



<p>For years, we’ve been told that the 4680 cell was the “holy grail” that would allow Tesla to produce a $25,000 electric car. But five years after Battery Day, the cells are still reportedly difficult to manufacture at scale due to the dry electrode process, and their only application is a low-volume pickup truck that has become a commercial failure.</p>



<p>The math here is brutal. A 99% reduction in a supply contract basically means the contract was cancelled. It means Tesla is not ramping 4680 production; if anything, they might be winding it down.</p>




	<p>The ‘Cybercab’ is also supposed to be using the 4680 cells, but we will have to wait and see how that goes.</p>



<p>It’s also a vehicle program that could go the way of the Cybertruck. CEO Elon Musk is insisting that it will launch in early 2026 without a steering wheel, but Tesla has yet to solve level 4 autonomous driving.</p>



<p>If it does launch without a steering wheel, it will be a program even more limited in volume than the Cybertruck.</p>
