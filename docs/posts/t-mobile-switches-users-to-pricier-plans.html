<p>T-Mobile is moving people to newer, more expensive plans starting with the November bill cycle unless customers call the company to opt out, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The forced migration <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174s0rx/forced_plan_migrations_coming_soon/">surfaced on Reddit</a> two days ago and was <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">confirmed by The Mobile Report</a>, which published portions of leaked documents indicating how the plan changes will be implemented. T-Mobile also confirmed the change to CNET, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-is-forcibly-moving-those-on-older-plans-to-some-of-its-newer-ones-in-november/">telling the news site</a> that &#34;there will be an increase of approximately $10 per line with the migration.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re always looking for ways to give our customers more from our services so we&#39;re moving a small number who were on older rate plans to newer plans that will deliver them enhanced features,&#34; T-Mobile told CNET.</p>
<p>The Mobile Report article said that users &#34;can contact support upon notification of the pending changes and, after listening to a pitch on why they should migrate anyway, be allowed to opt out of the migration.&#34; Consumers will be moved to plans such as Go5G or Essentials, depending on what they have now.</p>
<p>Users who want to keep their current plan should call T-Mobile after receiving the notification that will be sent starting on Tuesday next week.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile: It’s not a price hike, just “a different cost”</h2>
<p>The leaked documents show what customer service reps are being trained to tell users. Instead of saying the price is going up, reps will say, &#34;We are not raising the price of any of our plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost.&#34; That&#39;s the talking point customer service reps are supposed to use if a customer mentions that they saw commercials &#34;about how T-Mobile won&#39;t raise the price of my plan.&#34;</p>
<p>Customers will be switched to a newer plan if they&#39;re on any of the following packages offered in previous years: Simple Choice/Select Choice, Magenta, Magenta 55, ONE Plan, and Simple Choice Business.</p>
<p>Something a bit strange is going on with the Magenta plan. A T-Mobile document shown in The Mobile Report&#39;s article says that Magenta customers will be migrated to Go5G. But it also says that some Simple Choice and Select Choice customers will be migrated to Magenta. T-Mobile&#39;s list of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> includes Magenta, so it isn&#39;t clear why anyone with that plan would be automatically migrated.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, then-CEO John Legere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8249169/t-mobile-uncontract-announced">unveiled the &#34;Un-Contract&#34;</a> in which Simple Choice customers could keep their plans at the same price &#34;for as long as you&#39;re a customer.&#34; T-Mobile currently has a &#34;<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/price-lock">price lock</a>&#34; but only for customers on certain plans who activated their accounts after April 28, 2022.</p>
<p>Customers who activated accounts before April 28, 2022, had the Un-Contract guarantee, which no longer guarantees that rates won&#39;t be raised. T-Mobile&#39;s price lock page says, &#34;we have committed to pay your final month&#39;s recurring service charge if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days.&#34;</p>
<p>T-Mobile&#39;s <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> range from $60 to $100 a month for a single line or $5 more if you don&#39;t enroll in the AutoPay discount. T-Mobile recently started <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/autopay">requiring</a> a debit card or linked bank account to get the AutoPay discount, which may be concerning to users because of the company&#39;s history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/t-mobile-screwup-caused-customers-to-see-other-users-billing-information/">data breaches and leaks</a>.</p>
<h2>$5 or $10 per-line increases</h2>
<p>One of the leaked documents says that customers will see $5 or $10 per-line monthly increases depending on which plan they have now. The document says the increase can be offset with the $5 AutoPay discount, but that discount has been available for years.</p>
<p>Customers whose plans are set to change should receive notifications via email and SMS starting October 17, though a document said that &#34;timing will vary depending on the customer&#39;s bill cycle.&#34; The notifications will &#34;include a link to a landing page with plan details and an option to call Care to opt out of this plan migration,&#34; the document said.</p>
<p>It will be possible to move back to an old plan for at least a little while, even if customers don&#39;t opt out in time. A document that describes a few customer service scenarios tells reps how to respond if a user says, &#34;I just got my new bill, and you changed my plan without telling me.&#34;</p>
<p>Reps are supposed to tell customers, &#34;We recently notified you of a change to your plan,&#34; and that if the plan &#34;doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I can help you with the opt out request to keep your current plan.&#34;</p>
<p>We contacted T-Mobile today and will update this article if we get more details.</p>
<p>T-Mobile was once a smaller wireless company fighting behemoths AT&amp;T and Verizon but is now one of three major national carriers after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/">acquiring Sprint</a> in 2020. Critics of the merger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/t-mobilesprint-merger-will-bring-higher-prices-small-carriers-tell-fcc/">predicted</a> it would result in higher prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">On Reddit</a>, T-Mobile users called the change a &#34;shady&#34; and &#34;money-grubbing&#34; move. &#34;We are slowly turning into the Canada wireless industry with high prices everywhere,&#34; one person wrote. Another wrote, &#34;How long until they just force you off without a choice? 1 year? 2? Pulling a VZW/ATT seems inevitable at this point.&#34;</p>
