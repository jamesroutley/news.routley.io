<p>After 15 happy years on WordPress.com, I’ve moved to Substack at <a href="https://neuroai.science">neuroai.science</a>. I’ve already published more than a dozen long-form articles on neuroscience and AI over there in newsletter format. You can subscribe or read the archives completely free. </p>



<p>Substack makes it easy to create sticky experiences for audiences and reach them where they are–in their email. This is all the more important as traditional social media channels have de-emphasized link sharing, making it harder to maintain an audience. The archives of xcorr.net will remain here. Thank you for supporting the blog over its long run!</p>
