    <h1>Using Goatse to Stop App Theft</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I recently built a browser-based word game with my friends called Sqword (sqword.com). I&#39;m proud to say that we&#39;ve been able to maintain a steady group of daily active users over the past 6 months or so despite not doing any real advertising.</p>
<p>Vultures will even pick at modest success stories.</p>
<p>Yesterday one of my collaborators googled &#34;sqword&#34; and to his surprise, there were tons of first-page results that weren&#39;t the sqword.com domain. These sites are &#34;game aggregator&#34; sites that host your app inside of an iFrame so that they can steal ad revenue from your product.</p>
<p>This made me angrier than it should have - not because Sqword is a cash cow - we don&#39;t run ads on the site and don&#39;t make money from it, it&#39;s just for fun - but because it was a passion project with friends, something pure and intentionally free to play WITHOUT ads. It&#39;s against my ethos as a developer, there are banners and popups everywhere. If I build an app, I believe it should either be free or it should be up-front about what the subscription or purchase price is (and then not upsell you).</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t abide seeing my code monetized in this way.</p>
<p>The mature and responsible thing to do would have been to add a content security policy to the page. I am not mature so instead what I decided to do was render the early 2000s internet shock image Goatse with a nice message superimposed over it in place of the app if Sqword detects that it is in an iFrame.</p>
<p>It has been one of my greatest achievements as a dev: to live-deploy a massive goatse image to at least 8 domains that aren&#39;t mine.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to you - if you are using an iFrame to display a site that isn&#39;t yours, even for legitimate purposes, you have no control over that content - it can change at any time. One day instead of looking into an iFrame, you might be looking at an entirely different kind of portal.</p>
