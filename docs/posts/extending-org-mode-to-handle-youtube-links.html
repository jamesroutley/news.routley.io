    <h1>Extending org-mode to handle YouTube links</h1>

Recently I&#39;ve been building a tool (<a href="https://github.com/bitspook/cl-ownpress">cl-ownpress</a>) which will make blogging a
zero-effort activity for me. First step in this is to publish a subset of my
notes. I have already built a habit of judiciously taking notes. Simply
publishing a subset of my notes will enable maintaining an active blog without
doing any &#34;work&#34;.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve also been making thickly-accented-awkardly-narrated youtube videos. These
are almost always <i>tldr;</i> videos for my blog posts. So they get embedded in my
blog posts.
</p>

<p>
&#39;Blog with notes + embed youtube videos&#39; become easier to do with this little
tinkering. Since <a href="https://github.com/bitspook/cl-ownpress">cl-ownpress</a> uses my running Emacs to publish my posts, I don&#39;t
need to make any change in my blogging setup. I can embed my <i>tldr;</i> videos in
my blog posts by just prefixing youtube links with <code>yt://</code> instead of
<code>https://</code>.
</p>

<p>
I am pretty happy that I got zero work blogging-setup, and zero work
extending-the-blogging-setup as well.
