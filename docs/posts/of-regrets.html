    <p>Here is a copy of the MIT license. One of the well-known open source licenses. It is, effectively, the only license that I’ve used for software I wrote or contributed in the last 10 years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Copyright <year> <copyright holder=""></copyright></year></p>

  <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I strongly regret it. It is a fool’s game in retrospect. The no-warranty clause apparently doesn’t hold up in court (at least in the UK). So, you’re, effectively, giving away an unlimited license to use your software for anyone to do with what they want, and they get to sue you for millions when it doesn’t work out.</p>

<p>All for trying to do a good thing.</p>
