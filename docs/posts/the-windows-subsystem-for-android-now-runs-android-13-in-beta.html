<p dir="auto">The only reason why Google Play Games exists is because Google is unwilling to partner with MS to include Google Play on WSA. Otherwise what&#39;s the point of the Google Play Games program?</p>
<p dir="auto">Google historically has never supported MS in any of their initiatives. This is the same company that tried to destroy Windows Phone by repeatedly killing the YouTube app that MS made and never developed any apps for the platform. They have zero presence on the Microsoft Store, even Apple has their apps on the MS Store. I heard of them doing shady things with the Edge browser as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would love to be proven wrong and maybe one day Google Play may be integrated into WSA. But chances of this are very low. Developers who develop for WSA are making the apps with Amazon Appstore in mind and changing this suddenly would be a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Totally agree, so considering that, Microsoft should at the very least make it much easier for end-users to root the WSA, preferably with 1 -click, and easily install Gapps or MicroG etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Microsoft doesn&#39;t need to officially provide the binaries, just make the WSA compatible by default to use Gapps or similar things.</p>
<p dir="auto">currently, we need to download WSA msix, then use Linux subsystem to modify it, root it etc. and then install Gapps, Microsoft can automate those extra steps for us.</p>
<p dir="auto">what do you think?</p>
