					</p>
					<p>Welcome to the party! Today you will participate in an <mark>interactive
							experiment</mark> about the birthday paradox. We will use you, the reader, as part of our data, to help
						explain what it is, why it is cool, and how it works.</p>
					
				</div>
				<p>Hello! <mark>I’m Russell</mark>. On what day of the year were you born? <span>Please tell me
							your real birthday, this is for science 🔬not evil 💀, I promise.</span></p>
				<p>Cool, thanks! My birthday is <mark>November 15th</mark>. <span>We don’t share the same
							birthday 😢</span><span>We share the same birthday! Scorpio fam 🦂</span>.<span></span><span>But how many people do you think we need in a room to have a 50%
							chance that two people have the same birthday?</span><span>But let’s pretend I was lying,
							and I’m really born on, say... August 15th. How many people do you think we need in a room to have a 50%
							chance that two people have the same birthday?</span></p>
				<p>This seems like a good guess and sounds intuitive💡because there are 365.2422 days<sup>+<span>We
								stay in sync with the seasons by adding a leap year every four years since it is close enough to
								¼.</span></sup> in the year, which is a lot. <span></span>But <mark><span></span> people</mark> would really give us a <mark><span></span></mark>
						chance of a shared birthday. I would take that bet! 💸</p>
				<p>Hold your horses 🐴! You know there are 365.2422 days<sup>+<span>We stay in sync with the
								seasons by adding a leap year every four years since it is close enough to ¼.</span></sup> in a year,
						right? <span></span>The chances of a shared birthday with just <mark><span></span>
							people</mark> is actually about <mark><span></span></mark>. I wouldn’t take that bet! 💸</p>
				<p>Oh so close 🥈! <span></span>But <mark><span></span> people</mark> would really
						give us a <mark><span></span></mark> chance of a shared birthday. Tough to say if I would take
						that bet... 💸</p>
				<p>Holy 💩you nailed it! Or maybe you’ve heard about this, huh? Or you are just a big Michael Jordan 🏀 fan
						like myself… <span></span>Anyways, it can still be hard to believe it actually happens, right?
					</p>
				<p>The chance that two people in the same room have the same birthday — that is the <mark>Birthday
							Paradox</mark> 🎉. And according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Calculating_the_probability" target_blank="">fancy
							math</a>, there is a <mark>50.7%</mark> chance when there are just <mark>23 people</mark><sup>+<span>This is in a hypothetical world. In reality, people aren’t born evenly throughout the year,
								and leap years are excluded. However, the numbers should still be pretty close. More on this in the
								appendix.</span></sup> in a room. <span></span>It may seem surprising, but the logic is
						much more simple than it appears. But first, let me convince you it happens.</p>
				<p>Of course I can make you believe it. But we won’t look at formulas 🤓 or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7l9ef7/i_simulated_and_animated_500_instances_of_the/" target="_blank">simulations</a> 🤖, let’s invite the last <mark>21 real people</mark> like you who just
						visited this site to our party. <span>🎈= shared birthday</span></p>
				<p><span>💥 Boom! I told you it could happen.</span><span>🥚Aww we laid a
							goose egg.</span> But that is just one instance, and it would be wrong of me to stop there.<span> <span></span>Because each time we get 23 people together, it’s basically a coin flip that we get
							a shared birthday. The more we repeat this, the more balanced our results will be. That is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" target="_blank">Law of Large Numbers</a> in
							action.</span></p>
				<p>Okay, let’s bring in <mark>19 more</mark> groups of 23 people and see what happens. I have a feeling we
						will witness the magic of the paradox a few times 🤞. <span><span>Hmm let’s speed
								this up.</span> <span>A little more...</span> <span>A lot
								more...</span></span></p>
				<p>As you can see, we are converging towards the <mark>50.7% success rate</mark><sup>+<span>Since
								this is a live experiment, the actual success rate may vary from this hypothetical value. However, the
								numbers should still be pretty close. More on this in the appendix.</span></sup>. But wait, there’s
						more! Let’s boost this sample size to <span>include everyone who has ever visited this
							site.</span> <span>We will put it on hyperspeed ⚡️so we aren’t here all day.</span></p>
				<p>The odds can seem surprising because as self-involved humans 😍, we usually frame the situation by
						comparing just ourselves to 365 possible days. <span>Our brains are more inclined to think
							about things linearly, but as we add more people to a room, the number of comparisons actually goes up
							quadratically 📈.</span></p>
