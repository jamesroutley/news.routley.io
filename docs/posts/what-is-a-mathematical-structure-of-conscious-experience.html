      <span>Abstract:</span>  In consciousness science, several promising approaches have been developed
for how to represent conscious experience in terms of mathematical spaces and
structures. What is missing, however, is an explicit definition of what a
&#39;mathematical structure of conscious experience&#39; is. Here, we propose such a
definition. This definition provides a link between the abstract formal
entities of mathematics and the concreta of conscious experience; it
complements recent approaches that study quality spaces, qualia spaces or
phenomenal spaces; it provides a general method to identify and investigate
structures of conscious experience; and it may serve as a framework to unify
the various approaches from different fields. We hope that ultimately this work
provides a basis for developing a common formal language to study
consciousness.
