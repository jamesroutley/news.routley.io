        GPT4All Chat is a locally-running AI chat application powered by the GPT4All-J Apache 2 Licensed chatbot. The model runs on your computers CPU, works without an internet connection and sends no chat data to external servers (unless you opt-in to have your chat data be used to improve future GPT4All models). It allows you to communicate with a large language model (LLM) to get helpful answers, insights, and suggestions. GPT4All Chat is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Windows and Linux require at least an AVX2 chipset. Both intel and arm macOS machines should work. A future update should allow non-AVX2 chipsets for older machines. Check back frequently and will announce here when it
        is ready.

    <h2>Download the Installer</h2>


<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>
    After downloading the installer for your platform, run the installer and pay close attention to the installation location, as you will need to navigate to that folder after the installation is complete. Once the installation is finished, locate the &#39;bin&#39; subdirectory within the installation folder. To launch the GPT4All Chat application, execute the &#39;chat&#39; file in the &#39;bin&#39; folder. The file will be named &#39;chat&#39; on Linux, &#39;chat.exe&#39; on Windows, and &#39;chat.app&#39; on macOS.

</h2><h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>
    The GPT4All Chat installer needs to decompress a 3GB LLM model during the installation process. This might take a significant amount of time, depending on your system. Please be patient and do not worry if it seems like the installer is stuck. It is working in the background, and the installation will be completed successfully. You are downloading a 3 GB file that has baked into it all human-historical knowledge placed onto the internet. We appreciate your patience and understanding - maybe take some time during the download to appreciate the gravity of how far we as humans have come and pat yourself on the back.
