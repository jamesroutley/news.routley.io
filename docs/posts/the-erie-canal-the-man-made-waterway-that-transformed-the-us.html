Paul Comstock, a Geneva, New York‒born septuagenarian, told me about the inspiration for his 21-day trip across the canal in 2013. Comstock&#39;s maternal grandfather, who died before he was born, worked on the waterway. &#34;I thought, &#39;What an opportunity to do a multi-day paddle, and get to know this guy who was not really well-thought-of in the family,&#39;&#34; Comstock said. He was so taken with the experience, especially the diversity of people he met along the way, that he has returned each summer to lead paddling tours.<!-- --></p><p>The sense of connecting and sharing experiences along the canal isn&#39;t surprising, Utter said. &#34;There were big ideas happening here: suffrage, abolition, temperance, utopian religious communities, the anti-Mason movement. A lot of these took hold along the canal corridor, where they were able to travel quickly,&#34; he said.<!-- --></p><p>Beth Walker and Sara Catalano (no relation to the author), a mother-daughter paddling team behind the Instagram account <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/two_gals_on_the_canal/">Two Gals on the Canal<!-- --></a>, developed new relationships as they kayaked the entire 363-mile length of the Erie, in segments, over a two-year period. In particular, Catalano told me, &#34;The generational history and the amount of pride the lock operators have in their work, and their ability to share stories with us and give recommendations, has been really lovely. They are so invested in the upkeep of the canal and its history.&#34;<!-- --></p><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="plotting-your-paddle"><b id="plotting-your-paddle">Plotting your paddle<!-- --></b></span></h2></p><p>Thanks to its calm waters and straightforward route, the Erie Canal is suitable for paddlers of all levels. &#34;Most of the canal is fairly predictable,&#34; Catalano said. &#34;It&#39;s hard to get lost. There are portions that can be a little rougher, such as around the Mohawk or Niagara rivers, but if you check the weather and wind in advance, it&#39;s quite safe.&#34; Comstock agrees, and recommends using Google Maps to plot distances and, by zooming in, to pinpoint public boat launches and pull-outs.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0jblpmz.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The Erie&#39;s most iconic lock, the Flight of Five, is located in Lockport, New York (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The Erie&#39;s most iconic lock, the Flight of Five, is located in Lockport, New York (Credit: Getty Images)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>For Walker, planning is part of the fun.
