<p>Muse is a workspace built for the <a href="https://museapp.com/how/workflows">messy middle</a> of your creative process: deep thinking, synthesizing, and sense-making.</p>

<p>Version 2.0 includes everything from its predecessor: an open canvas of <a href="https://museapp.com/how/nestedboards">nested boards</a>, cards and ink for visual and spatial thinking, and content snippets like PDFs, videos, and tweets. And here’s what’s new…</p>

<h2>Muse for Mac = focused productivity</h2>

<p>The vision for Muse 2 is to bring your boards to every computing device you use for work. Each device cues a unique mood and way of working. iPad, for example, is relaxed and informal; and it’s fun to work directly with your hands. New for 2.0 is Muse for Mac.</p>

<p>Mac is where creative work gets done. It’s the best platform ever created for creative and productive tasks, encapsulating 30+ years of thinking. Muse for Mac is designed from the same principles as Muse for iPad, while taking advantage of more screen real estate, the keyboard, files, and overlapping windows.</p>

<h2>Text blocks = write spatially</h2>

<p>Muse 2.0 introduces text blocks, a way to write spatially. This brings a new dimension to writing and note taking, alongside your handwritten scribbles and rich media.</p>

</figure>

<p>Text blocks are now the default way to write in Muse, from a single line to email drafts to the first draft of your next long essay. Double-tap anywhere on a board to start writing with text blocks.</p>

<p>By combining the joy of visual thinking with the efficiency of linear text editing, Muse lets you express the full richness of your ideas to create unexpected connections and creative leaps.</p>

<h2>Local-first sync = fast and offline-capable</h2>

<p>Your Muse workspace is shared across Mac and Muse for iPad using a technology called local-first sync.</p>

<p>Muse keeps all the data locally and any edits happen completely on the device. That means you never need to experience any delay or stutter when moving a card, drawing or highlighting, or typing some text.</p>

</figure>

<p>Often the places best suited for contemplation are the least well-connected, like a long flight or train ride. Local-first means if you’re offline, everything will continue to work as normal. Once you reconnect, all your edits will be uploaded at blazing-fast speed.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Muse for iPad = relaxed thinking</h2>

<p>Muse for iPad is still the best place for reading, annotating, and open-ended brainstorming. It offers a human and creative working style by embracing what makes iPad special: the intimacy of the touchscreen, the immediacy of the high-performance display, and the fun of working with your hands.</p>

</figure>

<p>Muse 2.0 for iPad uses text blocks and the sync capability described above. Otherwise you’ll find all the same great features you know from Muse 1: fluid gestures, nested boards, rich media cards, excerpts, iPadOS multi-window and drag-and-drop support, and so on.</p>

<h2>If you’re coming from Muse 1.9…</h2>

<p>If you’re a user or customer of Muse 1 for iPad, you should already be updated to 2.0. You’ll probably notice the refreshed interface styling right away:</p>

</figure>

<p>The first time you run Muse after upgrading, you’ll see a brief housekeeping screen as your data is migrated to the new format. After that, a notification at the top allows you to opt in to sync:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://media.museapp.com/website/memo-2022-05-dive-into-big-ideas/launch-opt-in.webp"/>
</figure>

<p>Feel free to dismiss this and continue to use Muse normally. You can opt in any time from the Settings panel. Read more in the <a href="https://museapp.com/migrations/sync">sync opt-in FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>You can now use text blocks by double-tapping on empty board space. Any text imported into Muse (for example, by copy-pasting or from the browser extension) will now arrive as text blocks.</p>

<p>Notes (previously “text cards”) are more compact and can now be used with either text or ink. They are great for short annotations and fixed-size sticky notes. All your existing text cards are converted to notes and can be used in largely the same way.</p>

<h2>Try it today</h2>



<p>This is a huge update to Muse, and inevitably there will be bugs, glitches, and performance problems. Write us via in-app feedback or hello@museapp.com with any reports. In the meantime, <strong>thank you so much for your support</strong> during the beta and the launch. We hope this is the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for deep work tools.</p>
