  <!--This is where the body starts. -->
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="body" --><p>Well it&#39;s been a long time in coming however I&#39;ve finally ported a great design for spudguns.org that I&#39;ve had sitting on the back burner for a number of years. Took a bit of doing to code the design by hand in Notepad with all the nested tables originally, however with Dreamweaver it&#39;s only taken a few hours, not weeks. My goal on this site is to be a on stop shop to reference existing designs, math, ideas, everything related to potato guns. </p>
<p>In the meantime while I&#39;m working on content for the menus on the left feel free to check out these:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spudguns.org/spudlinks.html">SpudGun Index</a> - a manual index that I created myself over the span of about a month. Manually spidering 1000&#39;s of cross-linked websites to put them all in one location. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.spudguns.org/calculators.html">Calculators</a> - This is probably the most helpful to those of you trying to figure out how much bang will you get for the given size of a gun. Lets you calculate the total usable volume of a nested (piston style) cannon, as well as the average muzzle pressure and a handful of other goodies. I coded this one personally myself from my HS Physics teachers College Physics books :D</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spudguns.org/fisx.html">Physics</a> - These relatively simply equations will help you again figure out where your shots are going. This stuff is plug and play. You put in the numbers and it&#39;ll give you the approximate results. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.spudguns.org/traj.html">Trajectory</a> - Both calculators and a reference for the math that&#39;s behind projectile motion. Use this to help figure out where your shots are going. Originally copied from the Physics &amp; Astronomy portion of the Georgia State University.</p>
<p>Lastly here my take on making my own Supah Valve, similar to valves sold elsewhere for more than $100.00 USD plus shipping.</p>
