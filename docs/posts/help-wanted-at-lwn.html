LWN.net is looking to hire a full-time writer/editor to help us keep the
news flowing and to expand our content in areas of interest to our readers.
We are certain that the person we need is out there somewhere, and are
counting on help from LWN readers to find them.  Read on for details on who
we are looking for and how we see them fitting in here.
</p><p>
LWN has always set an ambitious goal for itself: making what is happening
in the Linux and free-software-development communities clear and
understandable to those who are a part of it in any way â€” or who would like
to be.  It is a far bigger job than even a larger LWN could do, but we do
the best that we can.  To do better, we need more people with the energy
and desire to pick up part of the load.  Fortunately, we are in a position
where we can bring in such a person full time.
</p><p>
The ideal LWN writer is immersed in the free-software world and has a wide
view of what is happening within it.  They want to be learning constantly
and are interested in going out into the development community.  We are
looking for somebody who is enthusiastic about communicating what they
learn to a wide audience, part of which knows more about the material at
hand regardless of the specific subject matter.  Preferably, they would
like to broaden our coverage in an adjacent area: Rust, Android,
toolchains, distributions, security, or any of a number of other
possibilities.  Ideally, they would want to go beyond just writing and take
an active role in directing LWN&#39;s future.
</p><p>
The full job description appears below.
</p><blockquote>
<h4>LWN writer/editor</h4>
<p>
LWN.net is seeking a full-time technical journalist to provide high-quality
coverage of the Linux and free-software communities for our readers.  This
is an opportunity to be a part of a community that has changed the world
and is far from finished.  LWN has been covering this community from within
since 1998.
</p><p>
Responsibilities will include finding and researching topics, writing
articles on a regular schedule, reviewing articles written by others,
interacting with readers, and traveling to and reporting from community
events.  Additionally, we all take part in the tasks of running the
business and making important decisions about where we are trying to go.
</p><p>
Requirements include:
</p><ul>
<li> A university degree in technical writing, engineering, or the sciences,
   or equivalent experience.

</li><li> Excellent English writing and editing skills.

</li><li> The willingness and ability to work remotely full-time.

</li><li> An understanding of free software and the communities that create it.

</li><li> A willingness to take on a wide range of challenges in a small-company
   environment.
</li></ul>
<p>
We would also like to see:
</p><ul>
<li> A demonstrated history of writing for a highly technical audience.

</li><li> Software development experience, especially in the form of contribution
   to one or more free-software projects.

</li><li> Experience with web technologies and web-site design.

</li><li> Python development experience.

</li><li> An interest in traveling to attend conferences and other community
     events. 
</li></ul>
<p>
LWN is located in Colorado, in the US.  For candidates within the US, we
are offering a salary range of $70,000 to $140,000 per year, health
insurance, and a 5% 401(k) match.  We are happy to consider applications
from outside of the US as well; in such a case, salary and benefits will be
dependent on what we are able to arrange in the specific location.
</p><p>
To apply for this position, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editorjob@lwn.net"><tt>editorjob@lwn.net</tt></a> and tell us
about the topic areas you would be most interested in covering.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Finding this person is crucial to the long-term future of LWN; we have been
understaffed for some time, and that is making itself felt.  So we are
asking all LWN readers to think about whose words they would like to read
on these pages.  If you know somebody who might make a good candidate,
please direct their attention this way and encourage them to apply.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
