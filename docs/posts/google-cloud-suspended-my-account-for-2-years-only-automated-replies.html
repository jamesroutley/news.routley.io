    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>My Google account has been suspended from GCP since March 2024.</p><p>I have submitted multiple appeals through ts-consult@google.com over 2 years. Every time I get the same automated template asking me to explain, I reply with details, then nothing. No human ever responds.</p><p>Case: #1-8622000037271</p><p>Timeline:
  - March 2024: Suspended, appeal submitted
  - April 2024: Automated requests for info, I replied
  - Nov 2024: More automated emails, I replied again
  - Dec 2024 - now: Complete silence</p><p>I am a CS researcher at UC Berkeley. This has seriously impacted my work.</p><p>Has anyone successfully gotten Google to review a GCP suspension appeal? How do you reach a human?</p></div></div></div>
