    <h1>The best and worst of 1994 and predictions for &#39;95</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<i>by Eric Berlin</i><hr/>

Here are the views of Internet World&#39;s regular contributors on the year&#39;s best and worst trends, events, 

resources, and sites, plus prognostications.<p>

<b>Best in Net Entertainment:</b></p><ul>

<i></i><li><i>Nethack.</i> A dungeon-exploration game to which even non-Dungeons and Dragons fanatics 

can become addicted. Every adventure game has monsters and magic items, but Nethack has so many monsters, magic items, puzzling situations, and amazing secrets that you&#39;ll completely forget about the 

ASCII graphics. It&#39;s the most complex and thought-intensive adventure you&#39;ll experience on the Net (to 

access Nethack, FTP to <a href="ftp://linc.cis.upenn.edu">linc.cis.upenn.edu</a> 

/pub/NH3.1/binaries; also read rec.games.roguelike.nethack).

<i></i></li><li><i>Diplomacy.</i> Avalon Hill&#39;s board game Diplomacy is a classic that fits the Internet like a 

hand in a glove, and that&#39;s why there are zillions of e-mail games going on as we speak; not to mention 

discussion groups, Gopher sites, Web pages, and quite a few utilities. Modern-day Machiavellis will find 

their electronic home right here (in rec.games.diplomacy).

<i></i></li><li><i>The Internet Chess Server.</i> Always near to bursting with activity, you&#39;re guaranteed to find 

a chess mate of your skill level. Brush the cobwebs off your game or challenge a grandmaster. I 

personally keep a physical chess board handy so I can better visualize the game (to access, telnet to 

ics.onenet.net 5000).

<i></i></li><li><i>This Just In.</i> Every week, Randy Cassingham rounds up the strangest news events he can 

find; from bumbled bank robberies around the world to humorously bad decisions on the part of the 

world&#39;s leaders, politicians, and CEOs. He then throws in a line or two of hysterically funny, ironic 

commentary and mails the whole thing to thousands of his closest friends around the world. The arrival of 

This Just In in my mailbox always brightens my day. To subscribe, send a message to <a href="mailto:listserv@netcom.com">listserv@netcom.com</a> with &#34;subscribe this-just-in&#34; in the message 

body.

<i></i></li><li><i>alt.fan.cecil-adams.</i> Cecil Adams is an acerbic and funny know-it-all, and author of The 

Straight Dope, a syndicated column in which he spreads his wisdom, answering amazingly varied 

questions from readers. The alt.fan.cecil-adams group is where Cecil (through his assistant Ed Zotti) posts 

his weekly column, and where would-be Cecils ponder the mysteries of the universe. Less chaotic than 

alt.folklore.urban, and just as entertaining. 

<i></i></li><li><i>LambdaMOO.</i> You&#39;re probably sick of hearing how great LambdaMOO is, particularly if 

you haven&#39;t been able to log on because of overcrowding. Sorry. Fact is, there&#39;s so much going on here, 

and Lambda is so darned addictive, how could I leave it off a &#34;best of&#34; list? If you can squeeze through 

the door, check it out by telnetting to lambda.parc.xerox.com 8888.

</li></ul>

<b>Worst in Net Entertainment: </b><ul>

<i></i><li><i>alt.flame and alt.bitterness.</i> I know I&#39;m only asking for trouble here. But the entertainment 

value of these groups eludes me, and the die-hard seriousness with which the regulars go at each other 

really gives me the creeps. I&#39;ve learned to stay away. 

<i></i></li><li><i>Jeopardy.</i> I&#39;m glad the IRC gaming channels are popular, but the #jeopardy channel is 

usually so crowded the game becomes a typing race rather than a trivia game. Maybe the newer game 

channels (#outburst and #boggle) will alleviate some of the crowding.

<i></i></li><li><i>The TSR/Diku flap.</i> TSR wants to protect its popular Dungeons and Dragons trademarks.  

Fair enough. The gamers want to be left alone to play on the DikuMUDs. Also fair enough. The problem 

is, the DikuMUDs may violate some of TSR&#39;s trademarks, and the result is the collision of two immovable 

objects. I personally can&#39;t wait for this legal snake pit to get itself resolved. Find out about DikuMUDs in 

rec.games.diku. 

<i></i></li><li><i>E-wrestling.</i> The game for people who find tic-tac-toe too thought-intensive. You control a 

wrestler, and you e-mail your move (&#34;Head lock&#34;) to the adjudicator. So does your opponent. The judge 

decides what happens, writes up a report, and mails it to everyone involved. There&#39;s no strategy, not too 

many rules, and it makes as much sense as &#34;real&#34; professional wrestling. 

<i></i></li><li><i>The organization of the World-Wide Web.</i> I love the Web, but finding something specific on 

it is a nightmare. And because the Web is growing by leaps and bounds, I just don&#39;t see things getting 

easier anytime soon.
