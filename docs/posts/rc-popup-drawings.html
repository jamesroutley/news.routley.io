    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’ve been procrastinating. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a fairly productive couple of days: I solved all of <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> thus far, either in <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html">Carp</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto">zepto</a>; I contributed a few things to Carp; I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/reptile">snake clone in it</a>; I produced an unusually torrentous amount of <a href="https://veitheller.de/art">art</a>; and I’ve been more active on this blog than I have been for a long time.</p>
<p>But I haven’t made any progress on what I’ve set out to do: make a ring. I want to explore why that is in this blog post, for I think it’s a fairly common phenomenon in the projects I’m working on, and it’s entirely unhealthy, both for me and for the projects themselves.</p>
<h2 id="the-fear-is-real">The fear is real</h2>
<p>I’m an angsty person. Regular readers of my blog will know, I’ve always been upfront with it. I’m lucky enough to have a readership that either enjoys reading those posts or doesn’t care and just waits it out until I write about Lisp and C and weird hacks again. I’m also lucky enough to not having to monetize this blog, and so I can just write what I want, and if people enjoy it, that’s great, and if not, no hard feelings.</p>
<p>This is not true for a lot of other projects I’m working on: people depend on them, or they pay me to work on them, or, most recently, it is a token that our primitive cultures require for a bond. I’ve been assured that it’s not a problem if I don’t get this ring done, but my conscience cannot be fooled by even the most masterful sleight of hand.</p>
<p><img src="https://veitheller.de/static/square.png"/></p>
<p>I regularly abandon projects; they pile up behind me, not unlike lost lovers or estranged friends. My code is very close to me, it feels closer than some of my human relationships: when I leave it behind, it’s always a goodbye.</p>
<p>That’s utterly unprofessional, and yet I cannot help it but think of the things I have begun and not finished, like I think of people I know from high school, asking myself what they’re up to now. The only difference is, for the code I know the answer; it’s still in the dark, damp cell I left it in, slowly bitrotting.</p>
<p>I really wish this was more of a hyperbole. I really wish that I didn’t feel this way in my dark moments, because I not only feel like a failure, I feel disgustingly treacherous, a tech-savvy snakeoil salesman.</p>
<p><img src="https://veitheller.de/static/letter_to_mother.png"/></p>
<p>And so I present these little visual distractions instead, in an effort to make this seem like I’m being productive. This is what I do: if there is a project I really have to finish, chances are that I won’t finish it properly. I’m too afraid of not getting it done, and I’m appalled by the manual work, the trial and error required to <em>really</em> get it to work.</p>
<p>Right now I should be trying to get the 3D printer to work, to print some sketches, and then generate a good 3D model that my fiancée and I can wear to see if what I did was a colossal failure. Instead I’m telling you about my angst, making you complicit in this game of procrastination. How does that make you feel?</p>
<p><img src="https://veitheller.de/static/ferris.png"/></p>
<p>I’m annoyed at how manual 3D printing seems, how much of it is just wait and see and recalibrate. I could rant about that, but that’s really not what it’s about: it’s about my inability to do anything that isn’t fun. That’s not healthy, and it is only getting worse. As my career progresses, and I’m slowly getting a reputation, and I’m building projects, I more and more get to pick and choose and I lose my ability to bear anything.</p>
<p>(If a recruiter happens to read this: this is what you’re trying to sell your clients. Better stay back.)</p>
<p>My parents didn’t spoil me, and I didn’t have a lot of money until I started working in tech. Now that I do, I can feel it corrupting me. But this is a story for another day.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.veitheller.de/assets/parallel.png"/></p>
<p>There is so much here that I could talk about more, and I want to talk about none of it.</p>
<p>So now for the happy ending: I’m still fairly happy with my output, and I’m learning to live with my conscience. But this is what I think in my darkest hours, and in a spectacular case of bad judgement I decided to make it public. You’ve probably read my stuff, you know how I am. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.</p>
