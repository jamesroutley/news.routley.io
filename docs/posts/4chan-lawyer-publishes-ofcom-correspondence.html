    <h1>4Chan Lawyer publishes Ofcom correspondence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Ofcom — driven by the letter of British law that they are bound to follow, but <em>still</em> Ofcom — are quietly making Britain look (a) very silly and (b) as if we haven’t yet shucked-off the American Revolution, let alone colonialism.</p>



<h3>What’s Happened Now?</h3>



<p>Preston Byrne, <a href="https://x.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1978968228530397573">lawyer for 4Chan</a>, has <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2025/10/16/the-ofcom-files/">published the (apparently full) correspondence between himself and Ofcom</a> from the past few months, the smoking gun of which is the <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4chan-Confirmation-Decision-1-1.pdf">Ofcom Confirmation Decision</a>, where Ofcom notes: (to summarise)</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Act explicitly grants Ofcom the legal authority to regulate online safety for individuals in the United Kingdom, and this expressly includes conducting investigations into, and imposing penalties for, non-compliance by providers of online services with their duties under the Act. […] The Act expressly anticipates that it will have extra-territorial effect, stating at section 204(1) of the Act […] This does not mean that the Act extends to all use of in-scope services globally. […] “<em>The duties extend only to the design, operation and use of the service </em><strong><em>in the UK </em></strong><em>and, for duties expressed to apply in relation to ‘users’</em><strong><em>, as it affects the UK users of the service</em></strong>”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My lived experience of Ofcom people makes me believe that this is a reflection of what they actually think they can and should be doing — I would love to be generous and suggest that this boilerplate reflects them politely throwing parliament under a bus for passing <a href="https://www.cyberleagle.com/2025/05/knives-out-for-knives.html">such a prima-facie dreadfully drafted and over-reaching law as the Online Safety Act</a>… but I’m not convinced that Ofcom don’t actually believe some form of “<em>we can do this! we are the little regulator who can bring law to the internet!</em>” — hoping that smooth patter and soft power will provide them with outsize leverage.</p>



<p>Oh, and… having declared British jurisdictional powers to enforce against an American company in America thereby flouting American law, they then demand that American law protects them from counter-lawsuits, not to mention <em>also claiming that 4Chan does not have jurisdiction over Ofcom</em>:</p>

<h3>What happens next?</h3>



<p>Alas, global politics are a very big pond, and Ofcom (and Britain in general) is a much smaller fish than it likes to imagine.</p>



<p>As I have <a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/117326">written previously, this will not end well</a>: I cannot imagine the US judiciary nor administration supporting so flagrant a flouting of US sovereignty, although Britain will be spinning hard to minimise the noise in the media. </p>



<p>However: when eventually / having been proven <em>not</em> to be able to enforce against 4Chan and the Global Internet, the minds behind the Online Safety Act will start to press for a Great Firewall of Britain to protect our children from these profane and insufficiently regulated websites — which is curious if you think about it for a moment.</p>



<p>It’s not as if 4Chan is stealing across our borders in the dead of night to infect delicate British childrens’ minds with shitposting, porn and badly-drawn cartoons of frogs. From my perspective more damage has been wrought to British culture by the Disneyification of Winnie-the-Pooh (big fan of EH Shephard here) than by 4Chan.</p>



<p>And of course once/if the Great British Firewall (“White Cliffs of Cyber?”) is built, then we’ll be rediscovering that:</p>



<ul>
<li>The kids already know how to use VPNs to circumvent firewalls</li>



<li>The Streisand Effect dictates that more kids will have gone to look at 4Chan because the Government is trying to stop them</li>



<li>The impotent child-protection (and national security) interests will be demanding even more loudly that digital identity be required to even <em>look</em> at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/">the pot of filth that is the internet</a></li>



<li>Investing in regulation rather than education will have made everything much, much <strong>worse</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The way we protect British kids from the Internet is to <a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/116699">make better and more capable Britons, rather than to try and kidproof the entire internet.</a></p>



<p>The least bad thing that Ofcom and the Government could do is to quietly let the matter drop whilst focusing on education.</p>
