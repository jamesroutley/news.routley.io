to have spent time on the project.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not often that we as clock repairers get the opportunity to work on something that is old, but also something that is of great historical importance,&#34; he said.</p><p>The clock used to be set using a sundial on the outside of the tower. Now a modern digital clock secured to the wall, next to the Tudor era mechanism is used.</p><p>&#34;When this thing was made 500 years ago, we didn&#39;t have the accuracy that we have today,&#34; said Mr Gilchrist. </p><p>Parts of the mechanism like the pendulum expand in the summers heat and contract in the cold of winter, all affecting timekeeping.</p><p>This was a device built for a time when peoples&#39; days began at dawn and ended shortly after the sun went down.</p><p>Given that, he added: &#34;In terms if accuracy, it&#39;s pretty accurate.&#34;</p></div></article></div>
