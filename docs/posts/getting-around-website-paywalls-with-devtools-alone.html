    <h1>Getting around website paywalls with devtools alone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So I knew how to get around paywalls, or how to remove them with my frontend developer experience. But I didn&#39;t know how to scroll down on the page until today.</p><p>I was just clicking around and found that if you right click on a div and click &#34;scroll into view&#34; it will scroll down to that div.</p><p>So the first step is to delete the paywall div, then the second step is to find the divs with the text your interested in.
