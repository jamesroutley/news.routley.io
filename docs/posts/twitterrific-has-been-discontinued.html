<p>Twitterrific has been discontinued.</p>



<p>A sentence that none of us wanted to write, but have long felt would need to be written someday. We didn’t expect to be writing it so soon, though, and certainly not without having had time to notify you that it was coming. We are sorry to say that the app’s sudden and undignified demise is due to an <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2023/01/state-of-the-twitterverse/">unannounced</a> and undocumented policy change by an increasingly capricious Twitter – a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy nor want to work with any longer.</p>



<p>Since 2007, <a href="https://twitterrific.com">Twitterrific</a> helped define the shape of the Twitter experience. It was the <a href="https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">first</a> desktop client, the first mobile client, one of the very first apps in the App Store, an Apple Design <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2008/06/iconfactory-honored-with-apple-design-award/">award winner</a>, and it even helped redefine the word “<a href="https://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/">tweet</a>” in the dictionary. Ollie, Twitterrific’s bluebird mascot, was <a href="http://gedblog.com/2007/05/11/twitter-identity-transference-syndrome-twits/">so popular</a> it even prompted Twitter themselves to later adopt a bluebird logo of their very own. Our little app made a big dent on the world!</p>



<p>None of those amazing achievements would have been possible without the generous and loyal support of you, our wonderful customers and fans. Your financial support may have paid the bills, but your spiritual support enriched our souls and for that we can never thank you enough. You changed our lives forever.</p>



<p>But, as much as it pains us to say it, Twitterrific for iOS and macOS have now been removed from both App Stores. If you had a subscription on iOS, it will be automatically cancelled by the App Store.</p>



<p>Finally, if you were subscriber to Twitterrific for iOS, we would ask you to <strong>please consider not requesting a refund from Apple</strong>. The loss of ongoing, recurring revenue from Twitterrific is already going to hurt our business significantly, and any refunds will come directly out of our pockets – not Twitter’s and not Apple’s. To put it simply, thousands of refunds would be <strong>devastating</strong> to a small company like ours.</p>



<p>While this chapter may have ended, our story is not over. As long as we’re able, we’ll continue improving <a href="https://apps.iconfactory.com">our other apps</a>, creating new apps, doing <a href="https://design.iconfactory.com">amazing design work</a> for our clients, and posting awesome wallpapers to <a href="https://wallaroo.app">Wallaroo</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/iconfactory">Patreon</a>. Stick around!</p>
