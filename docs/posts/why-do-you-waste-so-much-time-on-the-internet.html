    <h1>Why do you waste so much time on the internet?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>sometimes i wonder why do i waste so much of time on internet, not even doing productive work. Just refreshing yt feed and sometimes opening instagram. Its not like I enjoy them 10/10. So why do I do this? I even made a stratergy to stop this, but no matter what I do, it just...doesn&#39;t work. I will follow that thing for 2-3 days then back to that unproductive and mindless pithole. I haven&#39;t achieved anything in life, but i want to, i want to own things...i want to have friends...i want to have fun....but this....something is just holding me. I could simply just say i&#39;m lazy, but is that a good reason..why would i even  need a reason.</p>
<p>I would like to think its not laziness, but then what even is it? And again i will search on the internet about this, find some videos that talk about this, then some people in the comments will say the &#34;i suffer from the same things&#34;,,,and then? then i will feel better that there are people that are similar to me....and? guess what? back to the same routine. I am sick of this...its like i know i will not have these comfortable days, these days where i just sit down and scroll will end. But what will be at the other side of it? A person who i would envy and want to be like or someone who no one cares about and is pathetic</p>
