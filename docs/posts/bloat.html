<p>There are many rants on the internet about code bloat. They often focus
on waste. I think this misses the mark.</p>

<p>The problem with code bloat is that it slows down development in the long
run. Every line of code you ship is a line of code you need to consider when
debugging a problem. Every interaction between modules is an opportunity for
a second order effect.</p>

<p>When your program doesn&#39;t work, where will you look? How many cases do
you need to consider? What tracing will you need, and how many systems does
that trace interact with?</p>
