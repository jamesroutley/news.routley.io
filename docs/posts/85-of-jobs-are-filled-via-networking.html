<p><b><a href="https://www.zippia.com/answers/how-do-i-improve-my-network/">How do I improve my network?</a></b></p>
<p><b>The best way to improve your network is to reach out and get involved with your community.</b> This includes going to social events, complimenting people, asking questions, finding common interests, using social media, taking a mental note of who you meet, following up after meetings, and making yourself a resource for other people.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your network, you’re not alone. Only 48% of professionals say they keep in touch with their network, and 38% say it’s hard to do so. However, you can make networking easy by reading this <a ltype="auto" href="https://www.zippia.com/guide-jobs/jobs/">guide</a> on <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-to-network-in-9-easy-steps/">how to network</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><a href="https://www.zippia.com/answers/should-i-network-online-or-in-person/">Should I network online or in-person?</a></b></p>
<p><b>You should network in-person when possible, but online networking is also effective.</b> There are benefits to both networking online and in person. Of course, statistics show that businesses are 24% more likely to gain new customers through in-person networking. However, this should not discourage you from online networking.</p>
<p>Post pandemic, more Americans are <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/new-remote-job/">working remotely</a> than ever before, and trends show that younger generations prefer online networking. When in doubt, consider what you need to network for. What kind of demographics do you need to attract? That will determine whether or not you need more of an online or in-person focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How effective is networking?</b></p>
<p><b>Networking is extremely effective for finding job opportunities, developing your knowledge and skill set, and staying up-to-date on news in your industry.</b> Up to 85% of jobs are filled through networking rather than traditional online job boards, meaning that a strong network is your best chance of having a full slate of career options available to you.</p>
<p>To ensure that networking <i>is</i> effective, make sure that you’re intentional and deliberate about the relationships you build, especially as you’re just getting started. Always consider how <i>you</i> can be valuable to other people, rather than thinking of networking as a one-way street of people doing you favors.</p></li>
<li>
<p><b>Why is networking so hard?</b></p>
<p><b>Networking is so hard because the attitude that most people have toward networking is one of fear or even disgust.</b> It’s easy to think of networking as the type of thing reserved for old businessmen in Las Vegas convention centers, but the truth is that professional networking isn’t all that different from personal relationship-building.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption behind this attitude is that networking is a way of getting an unfair advantage by “knowing the right people,” which flies in the face of Americans’ love and belief in meritocracy. </p>
<p>However, all industries from the dawn of civilization have relied on personal relationships to succeed, so, whether you like it or not, knowing people <i>is</i> part of building a career.</p>
<p>Finally, networking is so hard because it often requires talking to new people, putting your ideas out there, and engaging with other people’s ideas in a respectful and thoughtful way — all things that require varying degrees of energy depending on your personality type.</p>
<p>To make networking less hard, don’t put so much pressure on the relationships you’re trying to build. It may take some practice, but try to shift your attitude away from networking as an unpleasant necessity and towards active excitement about getting to know more people who share your passions and aspirations.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="fancy" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While networking isn’t always easy, as shown by 38% of people outright saying it’s hard, it’s nevertheless important. 70% of people got their current job through networking, and a massive 80% of jobs available aren’t even listed on job sites. Additionally, in-person and online networking accounts for 16-40% of all customers gained.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a new job or new customers, networking plays a vital role in your success. So, knowing that, it’s important to maintain your network. Use social media apps like LinkedIn or Facebook to get started.</p>
