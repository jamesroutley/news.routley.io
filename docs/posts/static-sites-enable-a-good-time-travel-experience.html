  Varun wrote about
  <a href="https://varunbarad.com/blog/blogging-achievements">gamifying blogging and personal website maintenance</a>
  which reminded me of the time when
  <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/posts/i-gamified-my-own-blog/">I awarded myself some badges for blogging</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I mentioned this to Varun who asked if I had any screenshots of what it looked
  like on my website. My initial answer was “no”, then I looked at Wayback
  Machine but there were not pictures of the badges.
</p>

<p>
  Then, a bit later it hit me. I don’t need any archived screenshots: my website
  is built with Eleventy and it&#39;s static so I can check out a git commit from
  the time I had those badges up, fire up Eleventy and see the website — as it
  was in the spring of 2021.
</p>

  That’s a beauty of a static site generator combined with my workflow of
  fetching posts from CMS before build time so each commit contains a full
  snapshot of the website.
</p>

<p>
  Comparing this to a website that uses a database for posts (like WordPress) or
  a flow where posts from CMS are not stored in version control but rather
  fetched at build time only, my solution makes time travel to (almost) any
  given moment in time a two-command operation (<code>git checkout</code>
  with the right commit hash and
  <code>@11ty/eleventy serve</code> to serve a dev
  server). I say almost because back in the day I wasn’t quite as diligent in
  commiting every change as I was deploying manually and not through version
  control automation.

  A year ago, inspired by Alex Chan’s blog post
  <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2024/scheduled-screenshots/">Taking regular screenshots of my website</a>
  I set up a GitHub Action that takes a snapshot of my front page once a month
  to keep a record. At the time, I felt bit sad that I hadn’t started it before.
  However, now that I realised how easy it is for me to go back in time thanks
  to Eleventy and git, I’m not so worried anymore. Maybe I should do a collage
  of changes on my design one day by going through my project history.
</p>

<p>One more major point for static site generators!</p>
