    <h1>AI is an impediment to learning web development</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body=""> <p>Some thoughts on AI and LLMs, based on being Head of Engineering for <a href="https://ben.page/jumbocode">JumboCode</a>, a club of 180 students at Tufts University that builds software for non-profits.</p>
<p>For context, almost all of our developers are learning web development (TypeScript, React, etc) from scratch, and have little prior experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-in-jumbocode-is-ubiquitous">Use of LLMs in JumboCode is ubiquitous</h2>
<p>LLMs excel at writing code for web development — you can describe a frontend component that you want and get a decent React component back.</p>
<p>I didn’t spend the year hawk-eyeing the teams’ repositories, but when I did poke my head in, I found substantial portions that <em>looked</em> LLM-written — that is to say, overly-commented, dissonant, and, at times, horrifying.</p>
<h3 id="horrifying"><em>“horrifying?”</em></h3>
<p>The starkest example I came across was a Next.js project that had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page written in HTML and vanilla JavaScript, loaded from the <code>public/</code> directory, completely outside of the Next.js + React system.</li>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript loaded in via filesystem APIs and executed via <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>.</li>
<li>API calls from one server-side API endpoint to another public API endpoint on <code>localhost:3000</code> (instead of just importing a function and calling it directly).</li>
</ul>
<p>These don’t seem to me like classic beginner mistakes — these are <em>fundamental misunderstandings</em> of the tools and the web platform.</p>
<p>LLMs will obediently provide the solutions you ask for. If you’re missing fundamental understanding, you won’t be able to spot when your questions have gone off the rails.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-hinders-learning-of-web-development">Use of LLMs hinders learning of web development.</h2>
<p>LLMs are a shortcut to get assignments done. In the process, however, you learn close to nothing.</p>
<p>It’s cliche, but struggling <em>is</em> learning. The way you learn is that you try different paths, piece bits of information together, and eventually create a mental model.</p>
<p>LLMs don’t require you to form a mental model and allow you to skip to the end result, but in turn you won’t <em>have</em> a mental model when you actually need one (for example, when you need to verify that your LLM has architected the code in a reasonable way).</p>
<p>LLMs are useful if you already have a good mental model and understanding of a subject. However, I believe that they are destructive when learning something from 0 to 1.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-probably-just-ask-a-person">You should probably just ask a person.</h2>
<p>You’ll learn a lot more by asking a real human, like your tech lead or a member of JumboCode’s board.</p>
<p>They can explain something in the exact context that you need it. And, in my experience at least, humans are still better than LLMs at providing concise, proper-level explanations.</p>
<h2 id="youll-probably-still-use-llms-instead-of-asking-a-person">You’ll probably still use LLMs instead of asking a person.</h2>
<p>Asking people is hard work and requires asking questions (scary). Many folks will still ask LLMs to write large swaths of code.</p>
<p>This is likely worse for your learning, but I can’t stop you (and I might be wrong).</p>
<p>But in my opinion, if you don’t have the time to do JumboCode without deferring whole tasks to LLMs, you’re probably better off not doing JumboCode. (And no hard feelings! I just don’t think that going through the motions via LLM-generated deliverables is worth the time.)</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="appendix-ben-do-you-use-llms">Appendix: Ben, do <em>you</em> use LLMs?</h2>
<p>Yes, I do! For example, I write code in <a href="https://cursor.so">Cursor</a>, the self-proclaimed “AI Code Editor.”</p>
<p>But I’m honestly glad that I learned the fundamentals of web development before LLMs became ubiquitous. I don’t know if I would have had the will and motivation to properly learn the foundations otherwise — but doing so has paid off immensely for me.</p>
<p>If I had used LLMs to produce work when I was first learning web development, I would not have learned web development.</p> </div></div>
