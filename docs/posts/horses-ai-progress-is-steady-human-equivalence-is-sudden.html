    <h1>Horses: AI progress is steady. Human equivalence is sudden</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        
<p>So after all these hours talking about AI, in these last five minutes I am going to talk about: horses.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/horse_efficiency.png" alt="Engine efficiency over time, showing steady improvement"/></p>
<p>Engines, steam engines, were invented in 1700.</p>
<p>And what followed was 200 years of steady improvement, with engines getting 20% better a decade.</p>
<p>For the first 120 years of that steady improvement, horses didn&#39;t notice at all.</p>
<p>Then, between 1930 and 1950, 90% of the horses in the US disappeared.</p>
<p>Progress in engines was steady. Equivalence to horses was sudden.</p>
<hr/>

<p>But enough about horses. Let&#39;s talk about chess!</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/chess.png" alt="Computer chess Elo over time, showing steady 50 point per year improvement"/></p>
<p>Folks started tracking computer chess in 1985.</p>
<p>And for the next 40 years, computer chess would improve by 50 Elo per year.</p>
<p>That meant in 2000, a human grandmaster could expect to win 90% of their games against a computer.</p>
<p>But ten years later, the same human grandmaster would lose 90% of their games against a computer.</p>
<p>Progress in chess was steady. Equivalence to humans was sudden.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Enough about chess! Let&#39;s talk about AI.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/project_cost.png" alt="AI datacenter capital expenditure over time"/></p>
<p>Capital expenditure on AI has been pretty steady.</p>
<p>Right now we&#39;re - globally - spending the equivalent of 2% of US GDP on AI datacenters each year.</p>
<p>That number seems to have steadily been doubling over the past few years.</p>
<p>And it seems - according to the deals signed - likely to carry on doubling for the next few years.</p>
<hr/>

<p>But from my perspective, from equivalence to me, it hasn&#39;t been steady at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/ask_claude.png" alt="Questions answered by humans vs Claude over time"/></p>
<p>I was one of the first researchers hired at Anthropic.</p>
<p>This pink line, back in 2024, was a large part of my job. Answer technical questions for new hires.</p>
<p>Back then, me and other old-timers were answering about 4,000 new-hire questions a month.</p>
<p>Then in December, Claude finally got good enough to answer some of those questions for us.</p>
<p>In December, it was some of those questions. Six months later, 80% of the questions I&#39;d been being asked had disappeared.</p>
<p>Claude, meanwhile, was now answering 30,000 questions a month; eight times as many questions as me &amp; mine ever did.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Now. Answering those questions was only part of my job.</p>
<p>But while it took horses decades to be overcome, and chess masters years, it took me all of six months to be surpassed.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/per_token_cost.png" alt="Cost per million words: AI researcher vs subsistence farmer vs Sonnet"/></p>
<p>Surpassed by a system that costs one thousand times less than I do.</p>
<p>A system that costs less, per word thought or written, than it&#39;d cost to hire the cheapest human labor on the face of the planet.</p>
<hr/>

<p>And so I find myself thinking a lot about horses, nowadays.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/horse_car.png" alt="Horses vs cars in the United States, with &#39;me&#39; marked at 1920"/></p>
<p>In 1920, there were 25 million horses in the United States, 25 million horses totally ambivalent to two hundred years of progress in mechanical engines.</p>
<p>And not very long after, 93 per cent of those horses had disappeared.</p>
<p>I very much hope we&#39;ll get the two decades that horses did.</p>
<p>But looking at how fast Claude is automating my job, I think we&#39;re getting a lot less.</p>
