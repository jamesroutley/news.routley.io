<p>Welcome to the Permacomputing wiki!</p>

<p><img src="https://permacomputing.net/pmclogo-neau.png" alt="permaflower"/></p>

<p>Permacomputing is both a concept and a community of practice
oriented around issues of resilience and regenerativity in computer and
network technology inspired by permaculture. ପໄଓ☾☼✫ -☆:*´</p>

<p>There are huge environmental and societal issues in today&#39;s computing,
and permacomputing specifically wants to challenge them in the same way as
permaculture has challenged industrial agriculture. With that said, permacomputing is
an anti-capitalist political project. It is driven by several strands of anarchism,
decoloniality, intersectional feminism, post-marxism, degrowth, ecologism.</p>

<p>Permacomputing is also a utopian ideal that needs a lot of rethinking,
rebuilding and technical design work to put in practice. This is why a lot
of material on this wiki is highly technical.</p>

<p>Most importantly, there is no permacomputing kit to buy. See permacomputing as
invitation to collectively and radically rethink computational culture. It is not a
tech solution searching for a problem. You are free to start your own
initiative and use the term permacomputing, however please make sure you
understand the purpose and ethos of this project :)</p>
