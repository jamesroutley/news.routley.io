    <h1>Bought an Ampere Altra System</h1>

		<p>In the hunt for a development machine, I got to the next phase. I did some
shopping, and there it is: my own Ampere Altra-based system.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>As you may have read in <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2025/06/20/the-hunt-for-a-development-machine/">my previous post</a>,
I used several AArch64 systems for local development. And the latest one, an
Apple MacBook Pro, is nice and fast but has some limits — does not support 64k
page size. Which I need for my work.</p>
<h3>Let’s go cheap</h3>
<p>So I have decided to buy myself an Ampere Altra system. As cheap as possible.</p>
<h3>AArch64 server parts</h3>
<p>The only part I needed to buy brand new was a motherboard. And the only
“affordable” one was <a href="https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.pl.asp?Model=ALTRAD8UD-1L2T">AsrockRack <span>ALTRA8BUD</span>-<span>1L2T</span></a>,
which was a product for data centres (so I was told).</p>
<p>Next, a used processor. At first, the idea was to buy a Q64-22 (64 cores,
2.2 GHz clock), but when the seller on eBay was not responding, one of my friends
decided to upgrade his Altra systems and offered me a Q80-30 (80 cores, 3.0 GHz clock).</p>
<p>The <span>CPU</span> requires cooling. There are not many options for the <span>LGA</span> 4926 socket. I
found an Arctic Freezer 4U-M in one of the online stores here in Poland and
bought the only one they had.</p>
<p>Each computer needs memory, right? So I went with used ones again, as there is a
huge market for used server parts. 
I bought eight sticks of <span>16GB</span> each; the model is <span>SK</span>-Hynix <span>HMA82GR7CJR8N</span>-<span>XN</span>. 
It is not present on <a href="https://connect-admin.amperecomputing.com/api/secure-file-download/download-regular/?file=Altra_Family_AVL_March_20_2024_877fb4f48c.pdf&amp;type=technical-document&amp;doc_id=854">the official Ampere
Altra memory Approved Vendor List</a>.</p>
<p>Working fine (after re-seating three sticks):</p>

</code></pre>
<h3>Ordinary parts</h3>
<p>The rest of the parts are ordinary ones available in any random store.</p>
<h4>Computer case</h4>
<p>The case was a challenge. The <span>ALTRAD8UD</span>-<span>1L2T</span> is a “deep MicroATX” case which
means I needed a case that can take an <span>EATX</span> motherboard (they are a bit deeper
than <span>ATX</span>).</p>
<p>I looked through pictures in online stores and selected about 10 candidates. Then
I started watching reviews and crossed several of them out. Usually because the
holes for handling cables were too close to the edge of a board.</p>
<p>Finally, bought an Endorfy 700 Air case. It came with five 120mm fans (3 at the
front, one at the rear, and one on the top). There was a lot of space behind
the motherboard’s plate for cabling, and a fan splitter so I could connect all
five case fans as one to the motherboard.</p>
<p>And the <span>PSU</span> compartment has an extra hole for PCIe power cables!</p>
<h4>Power supply</h4>
<p>The <span>ALTRAD8UD</span>-<span>1L2T</span> motherboard is expected to be powered by a 12V <span>PSU</span> only.
There is no connection port for the <span>ATX</span> 24-pin plug. Instead, there is an
adapter that takes only power-on and power-good signals from it and connects to
the small 4-pin port on the motherboard.</p>
<p>There are three <span>EPS12V</span> connectors available. I used two of them. The <span>MSI</span> <span>MPG</span>
<span>A850G</span> power supply I bought comes with two such cables and has an option for
connecting the third one.</p>
<h4>The rest</h4>
<p>What else is needed? Some <span>NVME</span> for storage (Lexar <span>LM790</span> <span>2TB</span>) and a random
graphics card (Radeon Pro <span>WX2100</span>, remembering the old times).</p>
<p>And I was ready to build the system.</p>
<h3>How does it look?</h3>
<p>The motherboard feels small once the <span>CPU</span> cooler is mounted. And a low-profile
graphics card is almost invisible:</p>

<p>The back side of the case shows where I hid the <span>ATX</span> 24-pin adapter and most of
the cables.</p>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Of course, if I went cheap, then how cheap did it end up being?</p>

</table>
<p>In total: 7 732 <span>PLN</span> (around 1 800 <span>EUR</span>). About 500 <span>EUR</span> more than I anticipated at first.</p>
<p>The <span>CPU</span> upgrade to 80 cores was extra 100 <span>EUR</span>. Memory came from another seller,
as the first one ended their sale before I was ready to buy, resulting in an
extra 40 <span>EUR</span> to the cost.</p>
<p>At first, I wanted to have <span>2GB</span> per core, but with the <span>CPU</span> upgrade, I would have
needed to go to 256 <span>GB</span>, and that would have been another 250-300 <span>EUR</span> extra.</p>
<p>The case had a 30% discount due to a promotion, and the <span>NVME</span> came with 7% cashback.</p>
<h3>Plans</h3>
<p>My current plans for this system are:</p>
<ul>
<li>install Fedora 42</li>
<li>create some <span>VM</span> instances:<ul>
<li><span>RHEL</span> 9/10</li>
<li>CentOS Stream 9/10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>put a Radeon <span>RX</span> <span>6700XT</span> inside and check whether it would work</li>
<li>try to use it as a desktop</li>
<li>do some crazy experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>All Linux systems will have both 4k and 64k page size kernels.</p>
