    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="View from the new office’s window" src="https://www.ansto.gov.au/images/2023-02-01-recently-view-from-the-new-offices-window.jpeg"/></p><p>This was a big month of change for me – I announced that <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/01/27/valtown.html">I was joining Val.town</a> and wrote <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html">a big update about Placemark</a>. Plenty more to write, but at least here I’ll take a little breather and just do the usual: what’s new!</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><p>I only finished one book this month - <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/01/31/meet-us-by-the-roaring-sea.html">Meet Us By The Roaring Sea</a>, which was part of my book club. It was great, and gets me off on a good footing for reading a lot more fiction in 2023.</p><p>I really liked Brian Potter’s <a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/weekend-roundup-icon-diamond-age">weekend roundup</a>, which covers a lot of funky building technology – wooden potash storage, robotically-assembled buildings, 3D printed houses.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about the <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/">layoffs explainer from prof Pfeffer</a> that has made the rounds a few times. It seems right in a broad sense, but too simple: framing layoffs as pure contagion helps explain and color the senselessness of them, but doesn’t really help construct a why-and-now-now-what sort of thought.</p><p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-end-of-writing-ia-on-ai">iA’s writing about GPT</a> is grumpy but I love them for it, and also for <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> which is up there with <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> as the slickest software of all time.</p><h3 id="watching">Watching</h3><p>I watched a few of the movies this month that everyone watched and felt approximately the same as they did about it. I also watched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/solaris-2002/">Solaris (the new one)</a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/gone-girl/">Gone Girl</a>, which were both <em>fantastic</em>.</p><p>Like, ahem, people of a certain mind-type, what I watch to tune out has often been of people assembling, disassembling, or making things. I’ve collected a good range of those and here they are: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVqhLG8wo5k">Baumgartner Restoration</a> for art restoration, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOw9WqMOHjA">Clickspring</a> where a friendly Australian man makes tools from scratch to make a clock from scratch modeled after an ancient greek analog computer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt8XOQ3Rlzc">Donut Media</a> where fun kids disassemble and reassemble cars, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuqlZna6Tg">James Hoffmann</a> for coffee brewing in total depth.</p><h3 id="listening">Listening</h3><p>The only music I added to my collection this month was FKA twigs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_(album)">Magdalene</a>, which is spectacular. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84">Cellophane</a> in particular - her albums really do things with production and song structure that you don’t hear elsewhere. That song sits next to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vx6J_pLCA">Dawn Chorus</a> from Anima in my head.</p><p>In podcast news, Odd Lots keeps coming out with great episodes. I liked this one about egg prices, and has lots of egg puns.</p></div></div>
