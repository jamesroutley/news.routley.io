    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a non-recently post ready to write, any day now…</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p>This was a strong month for reading: I finished <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/08/the-hidden-wealth-of-nations">The Hidden Wealth of Nations</a>, <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/15/useful-not-true">Useful Not True</a>, and <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/23/cyberlibertarianism">Cyberlibertarianism</a>.</p><p>I had a book club that read Cyberlibertarianism so we discussed it last week. I have a lot of qualms with the book, and gave it two stars for that reason. But I will admit that it’s taking up space in my mind.</p><p>The ‘cyberlibertarian’ ideology was familiar to me before reading it. The book’s critique of it didn’t shift my thinking that much.</p><p>But I have been thinking a lot about what it argued <em>for</em>, which is a world in which the government has very extensive powers – to limit what is said online, to regulate which companies can even create forums or social media platforms. He also believed that a government should be able to decrypt and read conversations between private citizens. It’s a very different idea of government power than what I’m used to, and well outside my comfort zone.</p><p>I think it’s interesting to consider these things: the government probably <em>should</em> have some control of some kinds of speech, and in some cases it’s useful to have the FBI tapping the phones of drug smugglers or terrorists. How do we really define what’s acceptable and what isn’t? I don’t know, I want to do more thinking about the uncomfortable things that nevertheless may be necessary for functioning of society.</p><hr/><p>Besides that, there is so much to read. This month I added a lot of news subscriptions to my pile, which I think is now Hell Gate, Wired, NYTimes, Bloomberg, 404 Media, The Verge, and a bunch of newsletters.</p><ul><li>This interview with <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/stephanie-kelton-on-the-disastrous">Stephanie Kelton</a>, who is at the forefront of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory">Modern Monetary Theory</a> movement in America, and wrote the very good book <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/12/05/the-deficit-myth">The Deficit Myth</a>.</li><li>This <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-true-crime-documentary-series-has-millions-of-views-the-murders-are-all-ai-generated/">404 Media story on an AI-generated ‘true crime’ YouTube channel</a> is great because the team at 404 Media does both deep research <em>and</em> they interrogate their sources.</li><li>Nathan Tankus has always been good but in this era he’s essential reading. His <a href="https://www.crisesnotes.com/a-scam-built-atop-an-accounting-gimmick-wrapped-in-bullshit-why-visiting-fort-knox-is-not-about-selling-gold-but-is-about-buying-bitcoin/">piece on Fort Knox</a> is quick and snappy. His others are more involved but always worth reading.</li></ul><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p>We’ve been rewatching <em>The Bear</em> and admiring the <a href="https://uproxx.com/indie/the-bear-soundtrack-showrunners-interview/">dad-rock soundtrack</a>.</p><p>This Nine Inch Nails track shows up at the end of a season:</p><lite-youtube videoid="BLj7S1QShdk"></lite-youtube><p>And this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Eno</a> track:</p><lite-youtube videoid="e5msmGpmiU0"></lite-youtube><p>Besides that, this track from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smino">Smino</a> played at a local cocktail bar. The bars at 0:45 sound like they’re tumbling downhill in a delightful way.</p><lite-youtube videoid="UegKO-O4jgc"></lite-youtube><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><p>So I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macwright.com/post/3licrv7zjrs2l">bought a sewing machine</a> in February, a beautiful old Kenmore 158-series, produced in the 1970s in Japan. It’s awesome. How sewing machines work is amazing, as this video lays out. There’s so much coordinated motion happening for every stitch, and the machines are so well-designed that they last for decades easily.</p><lite-youtube videoid="RQYuyHNLPTQ"></lite-youtube><p>Besides that, I just watched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-apprentice-2024/">The Apprentice</a>, which I really did not like.</p><h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/placemark/">I was on a podcast with Jeremy Jung, taking about Placemark!</a></li><li>My post in the /micro/ section, <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/13/all-hat-no-cowboy">All Hat No Cowboy</a>, probably could have or should have been a blog post, but I was feeling skittish about being too anti-AI on the main.</li></ul></div></div>
