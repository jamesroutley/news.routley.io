    <h1>Recently</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy 2023! I wrote my “2022 in review” in my paper journal and will write about some retrospectives on how the business and such have gone, but for now, let’s keep this traditional, a good old-fashioned Recently.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p>This month’s theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/12/04/bad-sex.html">Bad Sex</a>, which was on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted my appetite for the books that it referenced. The <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/12/14/the-right-to-sex.html">Right to Sex</a> on the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual power.</p><p>I’ve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup - <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> for RSS and <a href="https://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> for read-it-later, in favor of <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, which does both, and more. Readwise feels flashy and has an expansive feature set that’s executed surprisingly well. It has more of a “startupy” feel relative to my old tools, but interestingly <a href="https://blog.readwise.io/the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-beta/#bootstrappedbusinessmodel">Readwise is bootstrapped</a> too. I suspect I’ll stick with it - the only pain point so far is that I heavily used Instapaper’s “send to Kindle” feature, and Reader lacks that.</p><p>Which brings me to things I read online. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story-FTX-collapse-matt-levine/">How Not to Play The Game</a> by Matt Levine - a follow-up to his big <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/">Crypto Story</a> - is just as spectacular. I enjoyed this paragraph a lot:</p><blockquote><p>The regular financial system is built up from things in the real world, things that have some practical value and produce some reliable cash flows. A synthetic collateralized debt obligation of mortgage-backed securities is a very abstract bit of financial engineering, but it is the output of a complicated machine, and the inputs to the machine are people who live in houses sending monthly checks to pay for those houses. There’s a lot of math and judgment involved in structuring and pricing the thing, but there is also a house. The value of a synthetic CDO tranche can go to zero, but the value of all the stuff that goes into the machine can’t go to zero as long as people need houses.</p></blockquote><p>This sort of connects to a recent story about how <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/twitter-s-skipped-lease-payments-hit-bonds-tied-to-headquarters">Twitter’s rent shenanigans are causing bonds against the building to fluctuate</a>. It turns out that financial products often have some tether to reality.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><p><img alt="Bullet Train screengrab" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-01-03-recently-bullet-train-screengrab.jpeg"/></p><p>My favorite movie this month was, far and away, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/bullet-train/">Bullet Train</a>. It’s not <em>good</em>, really, it’s fine, but it’s a particular kind of movie that’s just really easy to enjoy: a romp. It’s like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent/">The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</a>, it’s just a fun film to watch.</p><p>In shorter-form video, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyya23MPoAI">video about free soloing a rock wall with Alex Honnold</a> managed to be scarier than <em>Free Solo.</em> And this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAHfX4s6EYw">YouTube channel about retro computers</a> is deeply satisfying.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="320" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z5NoQg8LdDk" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.polyphia.com/">Polyphia</a> still, and their honestly ludicrous new album. It’s all so over-the-top and virtuosic but fun.</p><h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2><p>I announced a bunch of <a href="https://www.placemark.io/post/changelog-december-15">open source tools and drawing improvements in Placemark</a>, then <a href="https://www.placemark.io/post/folders">folder organization for maps</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1606387135300268032">circles</a>. My <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/12/09/activitypub.html">article about ActivityPub</a> went around and I had a fun time talking to my friend Ben Klemens for an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/mastodon-highlights-pros-and-cons-of-moving-beyond-big-tech-gatekeepers/">article about the technology in Ars Technica</a>.</p><p>I’ve just started working on a <a href="https://github.com/placemark/figma-plugin">Figma plugin under the Placemark name</a> that makes a certain kind of map possible within Figma for (I think) the first time - a purely vector-based, fully open source and open data plugin. You could say it’s 1% of <a href="https://www.avenza.com/mapublisher/">MAPublisher</a>, for 0% of the price. I’m not sure where that experiment will go, but I’ll have a use for it in my own projects and it’s nicely scoped so that it can just be open source &amp; server-free for the time being.</p></div></div>
