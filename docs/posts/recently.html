    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="View of the woods" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-01-recently-view-of-the-woods.jpeg"/></p><p>This was another exciting, busy, and challenging month. <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a> clocked in another month of pretty good organic growth, and I spent a week at <a href="https://www.gradientretreat.com/">Gradient Retreat</a>, which was everything I hoped it would be - relaxing, intellectually invigorating, a place where I got to know a bunch of people working on interesting things, and a real opportunity to focus.</p><p>At Placemark, I released <a href="https://www.placemark.io/post/changelog-august-16">a changelog</a> and <a href="https://www.placemark.io/post/betterknown-a-new-wkt-ewkt-parser">a new parser</a>, plus did a lot of important but quiet changes, like upgrading <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz</a> to 2.0 and implementing both map sharing and SAML support using <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a>. I guess that part of it was a loop that connected - I built a lot of Placemark’s components using <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/">Radix</a>, a project whose team now works at WorkOS.</p><p><img alt="Vancouver" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-01-recently-vancouver.jpeg"/></p><p>Vancouver was a fascinating place to visit - aesthetically so different than New York or San Francisco. A dense but unaffordable city. Some beautiful walkability at the same time as car dominated streets.</p><p>I gave a talk in New York at <a href="https://browsertech.nyc/">browsertech nyc</a>, which went okay but made me realize that I really have to get back into that groove if I want to be good at it. The last few years I’ve really felt skills and interests shifting around: after all, it’s been a global disruption worse than anything I’ve lived through. It’s sort of natural to forget to make watercolor drawings in this environment. But I’ve got to get back on it.</p><p>I’ve still been writing a lot about the experience of starting and running an indie startup, but haven’t really published any of it. It’s all stashed away in <a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a> right now, waiting to be edited and redacted or expanded. The way that I’ve run Placemark is in the middle, not a fully transparent open indie startup, but not a VC-backed startup either. This stance of keeping options open can be a comfort, but it might also mean foreclosing both the cozy honesty of being small and the success potential of going big.</p><p>I’ll start publishing some of those notes soon, and more importantly, commit to a path.</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><p>It was a pretty good month for reading books! I didn’t like <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/08/01/against-creativity.html">Against Creativity</a>, but <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/08/19/what-i-talk-about.html">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a> was lovely and so was <a href="https://macwright.com/2022/08/21/the-psychology-of-money.html">The Psychology of Money</a>. I’m stuck in the middle of a few tomes, like <a href="http://worldcat.org/search?q=bn:0143116800">Lords of Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/30/535799735/corporate-bungling-and-political-scandal-abound-in-jesse-eisinger-s-new-book">The Chickenshit Club</a>. Just not sure if I really need that much detail in every book.</p><h3 id="listening">Listening</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wAhJWomphfM" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>I’ve loved Jacob’s music since <a href="https://foozle.bandcamp.com/album/everythings-casual">Foozle</a>. Sitcom is his new project, which has all the songwriting brilliance of the older stuff but has gotten weirder, much weirder, in a good way.</p><h3 id="watching">Watching</h3><p>There are <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/atlanta-season-three-flaws.html">mixed reactions to it</a> but I am really enjoying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(season_3)">Season 3 of Atlanta</a>.</p><p>Pretty big month for movies - Licorice Pizza (fun, okay), Morbius (just as bad as you think it will be), The Gray Man (almost perfect in its meaninglessness), The Thing (deserves to be a classic, not just a punchline).</p></div></div>
