    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I watched a large part of <a href="https://archive.org/details/BBC.All.Watched.Over.by.Machines.of.Loving.Grace.3of3.Monkey.in.the.Machine.PDTV/BBC.All.Watched.Over.by.Machines.of.Loving.Grace.1of3.Love.and.Power.PDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org.mp4">All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace</a> this month. This also counts as a “listening” item, because the theme song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJTCQJa8NBs">“Baby Love Child” by Pizzicato Five</a>, is also spectacular.</p><lite-youtube videoid="yDvl4fZGk40"></lite-youtube><p><em>Guitar Moves</em> is a good series of interviews by Matt Sweeney, who I mostly know via his involvement in <a href="https://bonnieprincebilly.bandcamp.com/track/london-may">Bonnie Prince Billy</a>. It’s a really cool format. I like how he interviews guitarists with recognizable sounds, and you get to see how little they need to play to sound just like themselves.</p><lite-youtube videoid="IrMgXPLwc9o"></lite-youtube><p>The episode with St. Vincent is excellent too: she’s one of my guitar heroes: check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEDRFOFs9rg">guitar solo in Just The Same But Brand New</a>, or her version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lan-UQfN0zs">Dig a Pony</a>.</p><p>I also watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Other_Land">No Other Land</a>. Everyone should watch No Other Land.</p><h3 id="ai-thoughts-roundup">AI thoughts roundup</h3><blockquote><p>I don’t have a conclusion. Really, that’s my current state: ambivalence. I acknowledge that these tools are incredibly powerful, I’ve even started incorporating them into my work in certain limited ways (low-stakes code like POCs and unit tests seem like an ideal use case), but I absolutely hate them. I hate the way they’ve taken over the software industry, I hate how they make me feel while I’m using them, and I hate the human-intelligence-insulting postulation that a glorified Excel spreadsheet can do what I can but better.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/04/02/ai-ambivalence/?ck_subscriber_id=1881659020">Nolan Lawson: AI ambivalence</a></li></ul><hr/><p>As I always say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">the purpose of the system is what it does</a>. Or, in this case, <em>how I think about AI stuff is mostly affected by how people use AI stuff</em>, and how people use AI stuff is a real mixed bag. There’s the tidal wave of spam, the <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/">aesthetic of fascism</a>, the low-effort marketing materials with nonsense images, the non-consensual AI porn. I see all of the bad stuff every day both online and in the odd subway ad. The <em>good stuff</em> seems pretty theoretical, though: the press releases about AI-driven medical advances never seem to break into the real world. The stories about engineers 10x’ing their ability seem pretty mixed: we’re already at the hangover-and-regret phase with programmers bemoaning how they’ve generated so much slop and lost so much knowledge.</p><p>Anyway, I’m mildly optimistic about the potential! But it’s a lot like crypto in that you could theoretically use the technology for something good but most people loudly used it for bad stuff, and people including me judged it based on what it did. AI has to start doing some good stuff soon. Potential isn’t enough.</p><hr/><blockquote><p>I think one thing chatGPT’s invention has revealed is how many people - including some very important people in society - find just basic reading and writing to be laborious and cumbersome to perform, and how oddly closely that type of strained literacy correlates with having other shitty opinions.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mtsw.bsky.social/post/3lmsfjzyiok25">mtsw</a> on Bluesky, about this story about <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/democratic-rivals-cuomo-chatgpt-housing/">Andrew Cuomo using ChatGPT to half-assedly write a policy platform</a>.</p><p>Right off the bat I should say that judging people for their level of literacy <em>reeks of classism</em> and so on. My own ability to read &amp; write has a lot to do with my place in society: I went to good schools, had a stable home life, and smart parents.</p><p>However, “the way that society was set up” kind of evened this out. Extremely social people with cultural capital and chiseled jawlines and biceps would get their rewards, and people like… myself, we would get rewarded for literacy and critical thinking. When one group needed the other, it was usually some kind of payment or partnership: Cuomo pays his scriptwriter, the TV show creator pays the actors. And some people can do both sides of the equation.</p><p>But LLMs definitely indicate that people <em>do not like this deal</em>. Whew, they don’t like writing, but they also don’t like paying the writers or reading what they write. Maybe they could rejigger the system so that they could do it all. They have ideas for music and art but no interest in learning about music, practicing instruments, going to art school, or concentrating on a task for a long time, so <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/13/all-hat-no-cowboy">why not generate it all?</a></p><p>Why not, well - there are reasons, those reasons being that the generated output usually passes <em>their own</em> vibe check but once someone who looks closely at things or reads <em>all</em> the words encounters it, everyone points at the slop and it’s embarrassing. (Cuomo will never be embarrassed) Plus, you’re always going to get average results by asking a device that is incapable of creativity or thought. Also, you’ll miss out on the human experience of creating. And you’ll be indirectly feeding output data into training data for future LLMs, consequentially making their output worse. (Cuomo does not care about consequences)</p><h2 id="colophon-update">Colophon update</h2><p>I’ve moved the images for this website to <a href="https://bunny.net?ref=q3nw9g5hnz">Bunny</a> (that’s an affiliate link, here’s a <a href="https://bunny.net/">non-affiliate link if that’s what you prefer</a>).</p><p>When I initially <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/02/28/photos">moved my photos to this website</a>, I set them up with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for storage and CloudFront to serve them with a CDN. Using AWS is painful for me, so I moved them to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/developer-platform/products/r2/">Cloudflare R2</a>, which is Cloudflare’s equivalent to S3, and Cloudflare as a CDN.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/02/06/how-to-blog#own-your-domain-and-use-simple-technology">owning my own domains</a>, swapping out image hosts is pretty quick: switching to Bunny took all of five minutes.</p><p>So what’s the deal with Bunny?</p><p>Partly I’ve become a little more negative on Cloudflare and R2: I think Cloudflare’s technology is neat, but R2 has iffy reliability and Cloudflare has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies">iffy politics</a>.</p><p>I’m also intrigued by diversifying my dependencies geographically. Bunny is a Slovenian company, and my email is from <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">an Australian company</a>. This probably won’t have any practical effect, but it feels kind of good for obvious reasons to even minutely hedge my bets here.</p><p>So far Bunny has been great. They don’t support the S3 protocol but they do support SFTP, which works just as well for my purposes and works great with the beautiful <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> app. Before, with R2, I was using the significantly less beautiful <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a> application because Cloudflare R2 doesn’t support all of the S3 protocol. It seems to be just as fast as Cloudflare was, too.</p><p>And I’m somewhat reassured by the prospect of paying Bunny. I don’t like the feeling of getting “free” services like I can from Cloudflare. I want that customer relationship.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><blockquote><p>Then again, pop culture is powerful, and even the dumbest marketing both affects and reflects it. Busch Light’s can holder shaped like a cup that holds beer is dumb, which is fine, because most beer promos are. But the fact that the brand frames it as a functional, masculine alternative to Stanley’s H2.0 Flowstate affirms a similarly retrograde outlook on gender roles to the one that young American men are seeking out on the political right.</p></blockquote><p>From my friend Dave’s <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-c-u-p-runneth-over-infante">article about Busch Light’s weird attempt to riff on the Stanley Tumbler trend</a>.</p><p>I was once a loyal listener of the Chapo Trap House podcast, but fell off of it in 2020 when their support of Bernie Sanders led them to be jerks about <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>. But reading <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/chapo-trap-house-democrats-joe-rogan">this Vanity Fair article about the cohosts of the podcast</a> endeared them to me a bit.</p><blockquote><p>“Like to thank” is linguistic phlegm. “I’d like to thank the Academy.” They’d “like to thank” me. Well I’d like to be 6’3” and drive a G Wagon, thanks. I’d like you to accept my novella. I’d like to quit paying three dollars to Submittable every time I want to send a story out. The world is full of actions I would like to do. The most direct way to say thank you is just to say it: “thank you, name, for doing X.” “I’d like to thank” is a performative thanks, a thanks with a smirk and a blink, eyeing for extra credit. Just because people say it in their award show acceptance speeches doesn’t mean you should say it, too. In fact, that’s the reason you shouldn’t say it.</p></blockquote><p>Loved this article <a href="https://barretthathcock.com/2025/03/16/close-reading-my-rejections/">“Close reading my rejections”</a> from friend of the blog Barrett Hathcock.</p></div></div>
