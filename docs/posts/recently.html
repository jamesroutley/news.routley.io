I’ll be pretty busy this weekend too, so I’ll publish this now: a solid double-length post to make up for it.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p>It’s been a really good time for music: both discovering new albums by bands I’ve followed, and finding new stuff out of the blue. I get the question occasionally of “how do I find music”, and the answer is:</p><ul><li>When you buy an album off of <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, by default you get notifications when new albums are released.</li><li>I’m an extremely active listener and will eagerly pursue songs that I hear every day: the Shazam app is always at hand, and I’ll pick up music from the background of TV shows or movies. Three of the albums I picked up this month were by this method: <em>Goat</em>’s album was playing at an excellent vegetarian restaurant called <a href="https://www.handlebarchicago.com/">Handlebar</a> in Chicago, and the Ezra Collective &amp; Baby Rose songs were played on the speakers in the hotel in Berlin.</li><li>I look up bands and the people in them. The Duffy x Uhlmann album came up when I looked up the members of SML, whose <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/02/04/recently">album I mentioned in February</a>: Gregory Uhlmann is the guitarist in both bands. Wikipedia, personal websites, and sometimes reviews are useful in this kind of browsing.</li><li><a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/">Hearing Things</a> is still a great source. For me, their recommendations line up maybe 10% of the time, and that’s <em>good</em>: it gives me exposure to genres that I don’t listen to and I’ll probably warm to eventually.</li></ul><p>As I’ve <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/01/27/my-music-library">mentioned before</a>, having a definable, finite music catalog changes how I feel about and perceive music. Songs can be waypoints, place markers if you let them be. You can recognize the first few notes and remember who you were when you first heard that tune. It’s a wonderful feeling, a sense of digital <em>home</em> in a way that no streaming service can replicate.</p><p>So: to the songs</p><p>Duffy x Uhlmann sometimes reminds me of <em>The Books</em>. It’s a pairing of guitar &amp; bass that I don’t see that often in avant-jazz-experimental music.</p><p><em>The rhythm on this track</em>. Ezra Collective is danceable futuristic jazz.</p><p>I think I’ve listened this song out. It’s one of those songs that I listened to multiple times in a row after I bought the album because I just wanted to hear that hook.</p><p>I realized that there are more Do Make Say Think albums than I thought! This one’s great.</p><p>It’s a Swedish ‘world music’ band called Goat that came out with an album “World Music (2024)” that has three goat-themed songs on it: Goatman, Goatlord, and Goathead. Nevertheless, this is a jam.</p><p>Cassandra Jenkins, who I first found via <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2121063/cassandra-jenkins-an-overview-on-phenomenal-nature/interviews/under-the-influence/">David Berman’s Purple Mountains</a>, records consistently very comfortable-sounding deep music.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><lite-youtube videoid="_v3KiaAjpY8"></lite-youtube><p>Elephant Graveyard is a YouTube channel that critiques the right-wing ‘comedy’ scene. It’s a really well-produced, well-written, funny takedown, and the conclusion that Joe Rogan and right-wing tech oligarchs are creating an alternate reality has a lot in common with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation">Adam Curtis’s documentaries</a>. It’s a pretty useful lens through which to view the disaster.</p><lite-youtube videoid="86nhP8tvbLY"></lite-youtube><p>In response to this video, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250822-youtube-is-using-ai-to-edit-videos-without-permission">YouTube/Alphabet/Google responded</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We’re running an experiment on select YouTube Shorts that uses traditional machine learning technology to unblur, denoise and improve clarity in videos during processing (similar to what a modern smartphone does when you record a video)</p></blockquote><p>This is the first time I’ve heard <em>traditional machine learning technology</em> used as a term. Sigh.</p><p>Honestly, I am not really a connoisseur of video content: any smart thing I can say about films or TV shows is just extrapolating from what I know about photography and retouching, which is something that I have a lot of experience with. But from that perspective, it’s notable how platforms and ‘creators’ have conflicting incentives: a company like YouTube benefits from all of its content looking kind of homogenous in the same way as Amazon benefits from minimizing some forms of brand awareness. And AI is a superweapon of homogenisation, both intentional and incidental.</p><p>I still use YouTube but I want to stop, in part because of this nonsense. It’s sad that a decentralized or even non-Google YouTube alternative is so hard to stand up because of the cost of video streaming. The people running YouTube channels are doing good work that I enjoy, but it’s a sad form of platform lock-in that everyone’s experiencing.</p><p>As a first step, I’m going to tinker with avoiding the YouTube website experience: thankfully there are a lot of ways to do that, like <a href="https://invidious.io/">Invidious</a>.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2025-08-29-recently-brandenburg.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Brandenburg" height="848" src="https://www.theguardian.com/images/2025-08-29-recently-brandenburg.jpg" width="1280"/></picture></p><blockquote><p>Because the oral world finds it difficult to define and discuss why abstract analytical categories like “moral behavior” or “hard work” are good in their own right, moral instruction has to take the form of children’s stories, where good behavior leads to better personal outcomes.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-20/ai-orality-and-the-golden-age-of-grift">Joe Weisenthal on AI, Orality, and the Golden Age of Grift</a> is really worth reading. It’s behind a Bloomberg paywall, though: is it weird that Bloomberg is one of my primary news sources? I feel it all in my bones: how the ideas of things being <em>moral</em> and <em>worthwhile</em> are being eroded by the same forces. The whole thing becomes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest">Keynesian beauty contest</a> of trying to crowd into the same popular things because they’re popular. Like Joe, I find it all incredibly tiring and dispiriting, in part because like a true millennial and like a true former Catholic, I actually do think that morality exists and is really important.</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the focus of e-mobility is on increasing comfort, decreasing exertion, and selling utopias — all of which undermine the rewards of cost-effectiveness, sustainability, physicality, interaction with the world, autonomy, community, and fun that cycling offers.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://theradavist.com/eurobike-2025-part-two">The Radavist’s coverage of Eurobike</a>, by <a href="https://cyclespeak.com/2024/05/20/petor-georgallou-bespoked/">Petor Georgallou</a> has hints of Gonzo journalism in its account of sweating through and generally not enjoying a big bicycle industry event. I have complicated feelings about e-bikes and e-mobility, not distinct enough from the feelings of better writers so they aren’t really worth writing longform but: it’s good that e-bikes encourage people to bike when they would have driven, it’s cool that <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/20/why-electric-bikes-give-more-exercise/">some people get more exercise on e-bikes</a> because they’re easier to ride for more purposes, and it’s bad that <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/10/now-do-cars-adams-and-council-push-for-e-bike-speed-limits-ignores-the-biggest-danger">cities crack down on e-bikes instead of cars</a>. But on the other side, e-bikes make their riders less connected to reality, to other people, and to their bodies than regular bikes do, and they have proprietary, electronic, disposable parts - eliminating one of the things that I love most about bicycles, their extremely long lifespans. I have to say that the average e-bike user I see is <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2025/08/19/opinion-too-fast-riders-could-be-the-downfall-of-e-bike-culture">less cautious, less engaged, and less happy</a> than the average bicyclist. <em>Being connected to base reality</em> is one of my highest priorities right now and bicycles do it, and e-bikes don’t.</p><p>Speaking of which: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB6hBLmBhPA">Berm Peak’s new video</a> about ebikes covers a lot of the same notes. The quote about kids learning how to ride ebikes before they learn to ride a non-electric bike is just so sad.</p><blockquote><p>The relentless pull of productivity—that supposed virtue in our society—casts nearly any downtime as wasteful. This harsh judgment taints everything from immersive video games to quieter, seemingly innocuous tasks like tweaking the appearance of a personal website. I never worried about these things when I was younger, because time was an endless commodity; though I often felt limited in the particulars of a moment, I also knew boundlessness in possibility.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://netigen.com/forty-four">Reading through the archives of netigen</a>, finding more gems like this.</p><blockquote><p>windsurf wasn’t a company. it was an accidentally subsidized training program that discovered the most valuable output wasn’t code — it was coders who knew how to build coding models.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/windsurf-gets-margin-called">This analysis of windsurf</a> is extremely lucid and harsh. I don’t like the writing style at all but it tells the truth.</p><blockquote><p>Another friend commiserated the difficulty of trying to help an engineer contribute at work. “I review the code, ask for changes, and then they immediately hit me with another round of AI slop.”</p></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://catskull.net/what-the-hell-is-going-on-right-now.html">catskull’s blog</a>. <a href="https://catskull.net/resigning.html">Congrats on leaving the industry!</a> Thankfully at <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a> the AI usage is mature and moderate, but everything I hear from the rest of the industry sounds dire.</p><blockquote><p>One begins to suspect that a great many students wanted this all along: to make it through college unaltered, unscathed. To be precisely the same person at graduation, and after, as they were on the first day they arrived on campus. As if the whole experience had never really happened at all.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/i-used-to-teach-students-now-i-catch-chatgpt-cheats">From ‘I Used to Teach Students. Now I Catch ChatGPT Cheats’</a>. More AI doom?</p><blockquote><p>“It is without a doubt the most illegal search I’ve ever seen in my life,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said from the bench. “I’m absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened. A high school student would know this was an illegal search.”</p><p>“Lawlessness cannot come from the government,” Judge Faruqui added. “The eyes of the world are on this city right now.”</p></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/g-s1-85119/crime-washington-dc-judges-arrests">this NPR article</a> on the extraordinarily bad cases being brought against people in Washington, DC right now. This era has a constant theme of raw power outweighting intelligence or morality, which makes intelligent or principled people like this judge extremely frustrated.</p></div></div>
