I think it took over a month to get through it - kept losing momentum by taking a few days off from reading during a trip. It was good - of course it was good, it won a Pulitzer. I enjoyed it, but I wish I enjoyed reading it more, and I’m not sure why.</p><p>There have been hundreds of articles written about Twitter and FTX this month. I read a lot of both, and none of the FTX articles particularly stuck out, but <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz’s</a> writing has been a fun way to follow along with some of the Mastodon/Twitter hype. That’s jwz of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge</a>.</p><p>Nick Maggiulli’s <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/how-much-growth-can-you-expect/">How Much Growth Can You Expect?</a> was an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his <a href="https://github.com/nmaggiulli/of-dollars-and-data/blob/master/analysis/0323_global_port_dca.R">analysis is open source on GitHub</a> and serves as a neat example learning a bit of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2022-12-01-recently-nyc-marathon.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="NYC Marathon" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-12-01-recently-nyc-marathon.jpg"/></picture></p><p>Not a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Pavane_pour_une_infante_d%C3%A9funte_(Ravel,_Maurice)"><em>Pavane pour une infante défunte</em> by Maurice Ravel</a>. I’m trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there’s <a href="https://www.classtab.org/ravel_op19_pavane_pour_une_unfante_defunte.txt">a great tab</a> on <a href="https://www.classtab.org/">classtab</a>), but the original version on piano is so lovely.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2022-12-01-recently-serial-mom.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Serial mom" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-12-01-recently-serial-mom.jpg"/></picture></p><p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/serial-mom/">Serial Mom</a> was, I think, the first John Waters film I’ve watched. Made me want to watch more from the back catalog.</p><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2022-12-01-recently-matchstick-men.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Matchstick Men" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-12-01-recently-matchstick-men.jpg"/></picture></p><p>I’m continuing the mission of watching all the Nic Cage films - at 18% so far - with <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/matchstick-men/">Matchstick Men</a>. It’s one of the good ones.</p><p>Finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building">Only Murders in The Building</a>, which has a sort of extreme mass-appeal quality that’s become more boring than appealing lately.</p></div></div>
