    <h1>Recently</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What to say about this month - well, I’m a few days late to the <em>Recently</em>, because I’ve been pretty busy! Things are good. Building products is fun but also a lot of work. Pretty excited about what I’m working on. Ready for winter to end.</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><p>I enjoyed reading Ross Barkan’s <a href="https://rossbarkan.substack.com/p/what-to-do-about-the-police">What to Do About Police</a>, though it’s bound to generate some controversy. Barkan is, I think, a geniunely ‘center’ or balanced commentator, if you consider the political spectrum of major American cities as the guide. He also has a sense for reading polls and knowing people enough to identify surprising but true disconnects between what we <em>think</em> people believe and what they do.</p><blockquote><p>There’s a strangely libertarian tinge to the leftist arguments around defunding and abolishing the police. The NYPD budget is described as “bloated” in the same way a Manhattan Institute scholar might refer to the Department of Education. To pay for non-violent responders, mental health clinics, and other community-based organizations that could reduce the need for violent police interactions, the department itself must be slashed so the money can be made available.</p></blockquote><p>And I agree with a lot of his critiques of the left, despite being in it - especially identifying the libertarian underpinnings of leftist thought.</p><hr/><blockquote><p>A legal AI that’s wrong 10% of the time would be, in prac­tice, no better than one that’s wrong 90% of the time, because either way it can’t be trusted.</p></blockquote><p>Matthew Butterick is <a href="https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/">suing GitHub over Copilot, their AI-powered code completion</a>, and a <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/">Renaissance man</a> and wrote about <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/camera-obscura-the-case-against-ai-in-classrooms.html">AI in classrooms</a>, which eloquently argues against AI in that context and others.</p><h3 id="watching">Watching</h3><p>I’m <em>very</em> late to this one, but I’ve been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Party_(TV_series)">Search Party</a>, which is a real grab-bag of styles and genres. It’s good, but maybe not exceptional. I think a lot of the TV produced now is so heavily invested in aesthetics and soundtracks and, generally “vibes” and Search Party is a show that’s interesting just because of the plot. It looks fine, but not exceptional. It’s not cool, and the lighting looks like mainstream TV. But it’s occasionally really clever.</p><p>Also, in between watching and listening, revisiting this Do Make Say Think song &amp; performance. It’s so great:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EYRwE9HPgpM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="320" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><h3 id="listening">Listening</h3><p>Following the thread of crazy guitar music past Polyphia and Hella, I inevitably ended up at Chon. Another great band, especially in the way they balance the heavy and acoustic elements.</p><h3 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h3><p><img alt="" src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/images/2023-03-03-recently-cb3638d0ed35d7036f79feada1e4301f.png"/></p><p>Elsewhere, I’ve been building and building with <a href="https://val.town">Val.town</a>, most recently <a href="https://www.val.town/tmcw.nearestOpenStation">a val that finds the nearest Citibike parking dock</a> with open spots, so I can use it from Apple Shortcuts. It’s been fun! I’ve been working on a tricky project to move Val.town’s internals to <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a> and adding better isolation between execution and the host environment. Luckily, it feels like we’re in the right place at the right time - there are a lot of new <a href="https://dev.to/tomlienard/v8-isolates-are-taking-over-the-world-3h4m">V8 Isolate</a>-based JavaScript runtimes coming to the surface, standards emerging for them like <a href="https://wintercg.org/">WinterCG</a>, and frameworks built for them like <a href="https://hono.dev/">Hono</a> and <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>. The last mile - isolation, code bundling, and communication - is still the wild west, and that’s what I’ve been building.</p><p><img alt="Columbus Ohio" src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/images/2023-03-03-recently-columbus-ohio.jpeg"/></p><p>I did a tiny bit of traveling this month. Besides that, I’ve been busy! So much to do.</p></div></div>
