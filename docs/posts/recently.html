It’s hard to overstate how bad things are for America right now. We’re just doing the thing: we’ve elected fascists and they’re <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/03/immigration-spending-increases-trump-big-beautiful-bill">funding an unaccountable military</a> that will do their bidding. They’re doing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump">worst possible economic policy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/new-york-mayoral-candidate-brad-lander-interview">attacking elected officials</a>. The New York Times is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mtsw.bsky.social/post/3lt3tbzmopc2w">actively fighting against New York’s Democratic candidate for mayor</a> by publishing weak hit pieces day after day, and doing their <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/06/26/zohran">weak-ass quasi-endorsement of Cuomo</a> even after they publicly stated they wouldn’t endorse in local campaigns. Shame on them. As mtsw says, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mtsw.bsky.social/post/3lt3npqi3d22w">they like Trump and want him to rule like a king</a>. You probably know all this, and every day you’re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250331225614/https://www.tumblr.com/nitewrighter/779101283437150208/me-i-dont-get-it-i-thought-i-was-doing-a-lot">feeling the fascism</a>. If you aren’t, how? Or, alternatively, what’s wrong with you?</p><p><em>Now on to the entertaining content (staring into the void, copy &amp; pasting links from my Instapaper ‘Liked’ stories)</em></p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p>The big new listen this month was S. G. Goodman, who I learned from <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/what-the-helly/">Hearing Things</a>:</p><p>In very broad strokes she’s next to <a href="https://www.waxahatchee.com/">Waxahatchee</a> in my MP3 library in <a href="https://swinsian.com/">Swinsian</a>: country-inflected folk rock. It’s a solid album with some hits. And I usually don’t notice this, but she has <a href="https://stores.portmerch.com/sggoodman/">really really nailed her visual style and merch</a>. A+.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><p>I’ve been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderbot_(TV_series)">Murderbot</a>, which is very watchable, and extremely brief: each episode is about 17 minutes of actual video. So far I’m happy that <em>things happen</em> in it, but it isn’t very funny or meaningful. Watching it is kind of like nicotine gum, a way to take a small dose of television and wean yourself off of it.</p><lite-youtube videoid="t86ZjhGxwAY"></lite-youtube><p>I’m a sucker for ‘how it works’ videos and this one is an all-timer. It’s at the perfect level of detail and fascinating end-to-end. I just love these physical effects, the creativity involved in the shots, the commitment to the craft by actors, designers, even a guy making remote-controlled robots. Watch it.</p><p>Other than that, I watched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/walk-hard-the-dewey-cox-story/">Walk Hard</a> this month and it was so incredibly dumb and I loved every moment.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p>Finally got some momentum with books! <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/06/21/glass-century">Glass Century</a> and <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/06/29/things-become-other-things">Things Become Other Things</a> are both hard to describe but great in their own ways. And similar also in that their authors have been on my radar for a long time: I regularly read Ross Barkan’s blog for its local political coverage, and admire Craig Mod’s photos and online writing.</p><p><em>Chill out for a moment listening to the cool guy play the nice piano before I rant about the cops</em></p><lite-youtube videoid="wT5z_6Kr-u0"></lite-youtube><blockquote><p>But if history is any indication, any attempts to limit or even question the infinite expansion of the NYPD’s size, budget, power, and impunity will turn police against a candidate.</p></blockquote><p>Matthew Guariglia’s <a href="https://www.forever-wars.com/zohran-mamdani-better-get-ready-to-fight-the-nypd/">Zohran Mamdani Better Get Ready To Fight The NYPD</a> was a riveting read. The more I know about the NYPD and its history, the more I am convinced that it is a government all to itself, unaccountable and malevolent. I recommend reading about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrolmen%27s_Benevolent_Association_Riot">Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association Riot</a> as a starting point. Then read <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/category/nypd/">The City’s coverage of the NYPD</a>. Every new piece of information paints a worse picture.</p><blockquote><p>Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses?</p></blockquote><p>Frankly Ed Zitron’s writing can be too much for me, but <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/make-fun-of-them/">Make Fun of Them</a> has a great central dynamic: that major tech companies are simultaneously posing as champions of the next generation of ‘AI’ technology while failing to maintain the basic software that is their main actual product.</p><blockquote><p>And so it was that a lifetime of doing, gradually, then suddenly gave way to a remainder of lacking—lacking the tools that had enabled her longer decades of productivity than most. My grandmother was a testament to the term “workhorse.” I often joke that they simply don’t make people like they used to.</p></blockquote><p>I really like reading <a href="https://netigen.com/when-the-doing-stops">netigen</a>, a semi-anonymous blog.</p><blockquote><p>There are seconds here and there when I feel a deep gratitude about getting older. They’re really random; I’ve sometimes held dishes while cleaning them, thinking “I might hate doing this right now, but I’ll miss it once I’m no longer on this earth. I’ll miss everything, no matter how mundane.”.</p></blockquote><p>And also <a href="https://blog.avas.space/getting-older/">ava’s blog</a>. There are more like this that I read - blogs that are nostalgic, personal, affecting. I can’t write like that, because this blog has my real all over it, and from day one I’ve drawn some boundaries around what I write about: no personal stories, no real-life drama, no “journaling” on this website. I keep a <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/01/02/paper-notes">paper journal</a> for that stuff. But I appreciate people who are able to write honestly about life, death, family, love, and all of it.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not lost on me that filling time with an endless card game is a way to escape the cold clutch of grief. There are no counters, no tricky cards you can pull out of your hand. When that bastard attacks, it sails right through all defenses.</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, from <a href="https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-07-03-mtg-grief/">Dan Sinker</a>, who I admire, and whose writing I admire.</p><h2 id="new-york">New York</h2><p>Knowing New York will take a lifetime, but I’m trying.</p><p>I went to <a href="https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/walter-de-maria-the-new-york-earth-room-new-york-united-states">The New York Earth Room</a>, which is a second-floor apartment filled with dirt. You can’t walk on the dirt. There’s someone who works there, nodding at the visitors, probably answering questions about the dirt. The same gallery network, Dia, houses <a href="https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/walter-de-maria-the-broken-kilometer-new-york-united-states/">The Broken Kilometer</a>, a kilometer of brass rods arranged on the floor of another space. Dia is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_Art_Foundation">its own story</a>, starting with an oil fortune and carrying on to the present day leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fariha_al_Jerrahi">converting to Sufism</a> and founding a <a href="https://nurashkijerrahi.org/">Sufi lodge</a> downtown. I haven’t been to the lodge yet. The <a href="https://www.melafoundation.org/about.htm">MELA foundation</a> is the obvious next place to go.</p></div></div>
