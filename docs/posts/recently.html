Interfaces that have different behaviors should look different, and familiar styles are so valuable.</p><p>I <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/24/on-web-components">wrote about Web Components</a> and <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/the-web-component-success-story/">Jake Lazaroff wrote in response: “The Web Component Success Story”</a>. I agree with his response 100%: it’d be lovely if we didn’t have to cart in a big framework just to create a tooltip, and it’d be great if maintainers didn’t need to write a version of a library for 5 different front-end frameworks. Maybe that’s where Web Components will fit in.</p><p>This post about <a href="https://moderncss.dev/12-modern-css-one-line-upgrades/">modern CSS upgrades</a> is a nice hit of optimism. My only addition is <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/12/19/has">:has</a>: the has selector has totally changed the things that are possible with CSS. I’m using the heck out of it.</p><p>Plus:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ferd.ca/counting-forest-fires.html">Counting forest fires</a>, an article about keeping servers online and fixing “incidents” in tech companies.</li><li><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-great-silent-majority-of-american">Garbage Day on the Stanley Cup</a> thing. These cultural moments are a good time to inspect the bubble we live in. Outside of my bubble <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/the-list-of-the-top-tv-broadcasts-in-2023-looks-familiar-nfl-nfl/">93% of the most-watched TV is football</a>. I like it in my bubble.</li><li>I’m <em>not</em> <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/04/15/ai">a big AI critic</a>, but I don’t like AI art very much and nobody has written about it better than <a href="https://ia.net/topics/ai-art-is-the-new-stock-image">iA’s AI art is the new stock image</a>.</li></ul><p>In books:</p><p><a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/22/swing-time">Swing Time</a> was so good. I’m reading <a href="https://islandpress.org/books/affordable-city">The Affordable City</a> right now and it’s pretty good too, in, of course, a totally different way.</p><h3 id="watching">Watching</h3><p>I watched 8 movies in January, somehow, but the only one that stuck with me was <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/poor-things-2023/">Poor Things</a>. It’s fantastic. Delivers on every level. A romp.</p><p>I have, by the way, been making videos about Placemark and stuff. Here’s one, in a handy embed:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LGq1mI3U6CI?si=P_JmwBlahh6O1Qim" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>Making video content <em>takes so long</em>, and I’m afraid at every turn that it’s cringe. But it also seems like a good format for talking about visual things like Placemark and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDz53MzwbkQ">the Figma plugins</a> I’ve been maintaining.</p><p>Video software is not great: <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a> crashes, <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a> crashes, Cleanshot is too minimal, Detail’s performance is pretty bad, OBS works but the interface looks open source. I’m using Descript right now, but planning on using OBS and/or DaVinci Resolve for the next video that I make.</p><h3 id="listening">Listening</h3><p>The new album by <em>The Smile</em> (40% of Radiohead plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Skinner_(drummer)">Tom Skinner</a>) is awesome. I’ve been listening to this song all the time.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WyXFfKYbtQU?si=pxiHsfqAaPWGUYAk&amp;start=865" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>This song “Without” by Sampha is also spectacular, and the version in this Tiny Desk performance looks fun.</p><h3 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h3><p>I wrote about <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/28/work-hard-and-take-everything-seriously">working hard</a> and people seemed to like it!</p><p>Also, if you missed the post before - <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/19/placemark-oss">Placemark, the map editing tool that I wrote, is now open source</a>. It has over 900 stars on GitHub! And some contributions already - <a href="https://github.com/placemark/placemark/pull/16">including a Docker configuration!</a> I really hope that it goes someplace. I’m tempted to throw a little time into it, to help with <a href="https://github.com/placemark/placemark/issues/14">moving it to Maplibre</a>. I don’t know if I’ll get the time to do a lot of development on it, but I’ll say that I’m absolutely going to spend the time to review and merge PRs promptly!</p></div></article></div></div>
