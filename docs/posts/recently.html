    <h1>Recently</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I became a year older last week. I’ll be traveling on April 1st, so in lieu of a usual 1st-of-the-month <em>Recently</em>, here are some thoughts, on a different day. In honor of growing older, this is sort of a super-cut of a bunch of different drafts that I previously judged to be too odd or personal.</p><h3 id="constants">Constants</h3><p>The idea has been rephrased a million times in different medias, but I like DFW’s framing of <a href="https://gist.github.com/tmcw/45db547cb246d4fdb9adafe24a84b8c0">“whatever you worship will eat you alive”</a>. A decade ago, I honestly believed I’d learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days. I was – and am – avoiding flashy purchases or other obvious signs that I’m hopping on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a>. But it didn’t work. The treadmill isn’t necessarily about money or fame. It can be anything.</p><p>I thought that <a href="https://macwright.com/2021/06/30/teach-you-to-be-rich.html">the book</a> was just fine, but <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/podcast/">Ramit Sethi’s podcast</a> is really good. Sure, it’s pop-psychology, but it drives home a big, important point: circumstances don’t really change attitudes. If you’re afraid of failure, you’ll still fear it after being successful. And alternately, if you have a healthy relationship with something, then you’ll have a much easier time when that thing changes.</p><p>It’s not all bad. I used to fear that drive and natural curiosity was an expendable resource. For me, that wasn’t the case.</p><h3 id="diversify-your-joy">Diversify your joy</h3><p>Here’s something I think I did okay. Lots of hobbies, lots of different contexts that I enjoyed in different ways. Though I share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HipHopImages/comments/2h2y9c/everything_in_the_world_is_exactly_the_same/">Kanye’s views on art</a>, in practice there are different feelings for playing guitar or writing or drawing. One of the ways I battle burnout is being aware of when I’m losing interest or phoning it in and being ready to switch tasks at that moment.</p><p>It’s really helpful to have a backup, and a backup for a backup. Even if you have a few things in your life that you love doing, eventually you’ll wake up and none of them will give you any joy. Having a fourth or fifth option won’t always work either, but a lot of times it will.</p><h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3><p>I’m not. I don’t have consistency. I worked some long days in March, making enormous progress on Placemark. I worked some short days, barely getting anything done.</p><p>I used to watch Casey Neistat videos on YouTube. He has one called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZexvTZ1sV8U">fat and lazy</a> about his personal schedule, which was grueling. He had a “work harder” lamp. And a “work harder” tattoo. And at the time, he was sleeping 4 hours a night, working or working out the rest of the day. He burned out a few years later and moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>Now, I don’t feel bad about consistency anymore. I felt more bad about it when I worked in schedule-driven jobs. We’d try to estimate how many hours a feature would take and divide them and plan for the future. An hour is not an hour, though.</p><p>Without the 9-5 norm, I bet some people would still work on a tight schedule. But a lot of us would just get things done when it felt right - when that hour of work was actually going to be the hour in which we made progress.</p><p>The same goes for a lot of things, I guess. I average out to around the same number of books a year, but a good amount of the time I’m not reading. I’ve been <a href="https://macwright.com/photos/">posting photos</a> recently because a few rolls of film got developed, but that waxes and wanes, too.</p><p>The thing is, when I’m inspired and motivated on <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a> – which is thankfully often – there’s no effort in sitting down and working. That kind of work isn’t so different from play, or study. It doesn’t burn me out.</p><hr/><p><em>Looking at this draft</em>: is this anything? I guess now that I’m older than probably an alarming percentage of the people working at Google I should be doling out unsolicited life lessons, even if the substance is just reiterating that <em>you too, are not immune to the hedonic treadmill</em>. Oh, and there’s a new <a href="https://aldousharding.bandcamp.com/album/warm-chris">Aldous Harding</a> album out, weirder than ever, give it a listen.</p></div></div>
