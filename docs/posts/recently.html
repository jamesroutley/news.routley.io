    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><img alt="Monarch caterpillar" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-10-01-recently-monarch-caterpillar.jpeg"/></p><p>We saw this Monarch butterfly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly">caterpillar</a> at the pretty unusual <a href="https://www.brooklyngreenway.org/naval-cemetery-landscape/">Naval Cemetery Landscape</a>. The landscape is just native pollinators and native plants growing wild, with a wood platform above the field so you can walk around and see the bugs and plants. It’s also built on a cemetery that was moved to another site, but they <a href="https://www.brooklyngreenway.org/naval-cemetery-landscape/history-and-design/">didn’t move all the bodies</a>, so there are still some unaccounted for in the park.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><p>I know that every generation looks at the younger generation and fears that their cultural memory is getting shorter, but isn’t it? Adam Neely, who I’ve mentioned before when he <a href="https://macwright.com/2021/03/03/recently">talked about the ‘Sea Shanty’</a> trend on TikTok, came out with this great breakdown of Laufey, jazz, and the dangers of rewriting history.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/68zOvCLwcL8?si=WNNBW-wXxUnCOv8P" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>Speaking of jazz, found <a href="https://gogopenguin.co.uk/">GoGo Penguin</a>, which is not quite jazz - if something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal_Hands">Mammal Hands</a> are halfway between jazz and electronica, GoGo Penguin is 75% of the way to electronica. But I love it anyway:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DolDqHG6FSI?si=DYSvdVVVenzd3Inn" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>Like everyone, I’ve been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)">The Bear</a>, and I’ve cried during about 40% of the Season 2 episodes. I appreciate the show even more because I have absolutely no interest in running a restaurant or watching people cook or eat – I actually have what is probably a common aversion to the TV trope of people constantly talking while eating. The Bear basically dodges all of that and tells a great story. The soundtrack is great, too.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p>Adrian Holovaty, who you might remember as the co-creator of the Django web framework, or founder of EveryBlock, or founder of <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/">Soundslice</a>, released his first proper album.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Oyz4Aodr8T4?si=1QBNBKth_ji37pvR" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" title="YouTube video player" width="100%"></iframe><p>Early this month my friends and I saw <a href="https://claud.online/">Claud</a> at Bowery Ballroom and all agreed that they were on the cusp of playing stadium shows. See them in the local cheap venue while you can.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p>My experience with companies in the last few years has made me a believer in the power of <em>vibes</em>, which is why I like <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/fail/">this article about rephrasing failure</a>. I know that words don’t have magic power, and that trying to use language to change reality doesn’t work directly. But building stuff is such a struggle filled with setbacks that the people who survived have a naturally persistent mentality, or they put a lot of time into managing their positivity and attitude.</p><p>This <a href="https://axiomvaluation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023.09.16b.-Building-Wealth.pdf">contrarian take about real estate</a> is a good counter-point to the common assumptions about home-ownership. A good snippet:</p><blockquote><p>However, despite the positive performance of both wealth components, the lowest income class lost out on a relative basis because it was over invested in real estate. Building wealth through purchasing a consumer durable like a home is not equivalent to making an investment that produces a stream of sustainable income. Although owner-occupied home values have increased over time, to access the wealth potentially created, one needs to sell the home and of course find another place to live.</p></blockquote><p>Reading this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/10/magazine/roz-chast-interview.html">interview with Roz Chast</a> made me feel like I was listening to myself in 33 years.</p><p><img alt="School" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-10-01-recently-school.jpeg"/></p><h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2><p>I’ve been making some more progress on side-projects - I <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/09/17/bikeshare-1">wrote about the bikeshare project</a> and made time to <a href="https://macwright.com/drawings/">illustrate that and another post this month</a>.</p><p>I’ve been working on my custom Tidbyt display as well. I think for both this and the bikeshare project, I’m going in with the attitude that they don’t make much sense. Neither is going to be a big open source project or the seed idea for a startup. They’re both great on-ramps to learning new skills: my understanding of Rust, Parquet, and DuckDB is getting gradually better.</p><p><img alt="Tidbyt render" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-10-01-recently-tidbyt-render.png"/></p><p>I even used the Tidbyt project as an angle to start learning <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> again, and this time I’m gotten a lot more momentum. I’ve been keeping notes on the <a href="https://www.are.na/tom-macwright/blender-resources-vc4d6w9agae">resources I use as I go</a> - which seem to include a lot of YouTube videos written by teenagers who are talking about Blender as an alternative to Roblox. My renders look bad so far – I don’t know anything about lighting or the rendering pipelines. Someday I want to learn how to make those <a href="https://stamen.com/shadows-on-maps-are-getting-a-lot-more-exciting-and-heres-why/">amazing shadowy maps</a> and also how to use <a href="https://twitter.com/OskSta">flat renderers to make beautiful watercolor-esque games</a>.</p></div><p><postamble datetime="2023-10-01">October 1, 2023</postamble>  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=tmcw&amp;user_id=1458271" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Follow me on Twitter">@tmcw</a></p></article></div></div>
