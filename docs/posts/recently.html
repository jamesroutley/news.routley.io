    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><img alt="A vandalized iPhone sign in Brooklyn" src="https://macwright.com/images/2025-04-07-recently-a-vandalized-iphone-sign-in-brooklyn.jpeg"/></p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><blockquote><p>Whether it’s cryptocurrency scammers mining with FOSS compute resources or Google engineers too lazy to design their software properly or Silicon Valley ripping off all the data they can get their hands on at everyone else’s expense… I am sick and tired of having all of these costs externalized directly into my fucking face.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">Drew DeVault</a> on the annoyance and cost of AI scrapers. I share some of that pain: <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a> is routinely hammered by some AI company’s poorly-coded scraping bot. I think it’s like this for everyone, and it’s hard to tell if AI companies even care that <em>everyone hates them</em>.</p><blockquote><p>And perhaps most recently, when a person who publishes their work under a free license discovers that work has been used by tech mega-giants to train extractive, exploitative large language models? Wait, no, not like that.</p></blockquote><p>Molly White wrote a <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/free-and-open-access-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">more positive article about the LLM scraping problem</a>, but I have my doubts about its positivity. For example, she suggests that Wikimedia’s approach with “Wikimedia Enterprise” gives LLM companies a way to scrape the site without creating too much cost. But <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/">that doesn’t seem like it’s working</a>. The problem is that these companies really truly do not care.</p><blockquote><p>Harberger taxes represent an elegant theoretical solution that fails in practice for immobile property. Just as mobile home residents face exploitation through sudden ground rent increases, property owners under a Harberger system would face similar hold-up problems. This creates an impossible dilemma: pay increasingly burdensome taxes or surrender investments at below-market values.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://progressandpoverty.substack.com/p/mobile-home-parks-harberger-auctions">Progress and Poverty</a>, a blog about <a href="https://macwright.com/2025/03/22/land-is-a-big-deal">Georgism</a>, has this post about Herberger taxes, which are a super neat idea. The gist is that you would be in charge of saying how much your house is worth, but the added wrinkle is that by saying a price you are bound to be open to selling your house at that price. So if you go too low, someone will buy it, or too high, and you’re paying too much in taxes.</p><p>It’s clever but doesn’t work, and the analysis points to the vital difference between housing and other goods: that buying, selling, and moving between houses is anything but simple.</p><blockquote><p>I’ve always been a little skeptical of the line that the AI crowd feels contempt for artists, or that such a sense is particularly widespread—because certainly they all do not!—but it’s hard to take away any other impression from a trend so widely cheered in its halls as AI Ghiblification.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/openais-studio-ghibli-meme-factory">Brian Merchant</a> on the OpenAI Studio Ghibli ‘trend’ is a good read. I can’t stop thinking that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macwright.com/post/3lhqw4io5nc2h">AI is in danger of being right-wing coded</a>, the examples of this, like the horrifying White House tweet mentioned in that article, are multiplying.</p><p>I feel bad when I recoil to innocent usage of the tool by good people who just want something cute. It <em>is</em> kind of fine, on the micro level. But with context, it’s so bad in so many ways. Already the joy and attachment I’ve felt to the graphic style is fading as more shitty Studio Ghibli knockoffs have been created in the last month than in all of the studio’s work.</p><blockquote><p>Two days later, at a state dinner in the White House, Mark gets another chance to speak with Xi. In Mandarin, he asks Xi if he’ll do him the honor of naming his unborn child. Xi refuses.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://macwright.com/2025/04/06/careless-people">Careless People</a> was a good read. It’s devastating for Zuckerberg, Joel Kaplan, and Sheryl Sandberg, as well as a bunch of global leaders who are eager to provide tax loopholes for Facebook. Perhaps the only person who ends the book as a hero is President Obama, who sees through it all.</p><blockquote><p>In a March 26 Slack message, Lavingia also suggested that the agency should do away with paper forms entirely, aiming for “full digitization.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“There are over 400 vet-facing forms that the VA supports, and only about 10 percent of those are digitized,” says a VA worker, noting that digitizing forms “can take years because of the sensitivity of the data” they contain. Additionally, many veterans are elderly and prefer using paper forms because they lack the technical skills to navigate digital platforms.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Many vets don’t have computers or can’t see at all,” they say. “My skin is crawling thinking about the nonchalantness of this guy.”</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps because of proximity, the story that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-department-of-veterans-affairs-ai/">Sahil Lavingia has been working for DOGE</a> seems important. It was a relief when a few other people noticed it and started retelling the story to the tech sphere, like <a href="https://danb.me/blog/gumroad-is-not-open-source/">Dan Brown’s “Gumroad is not open source”</a> and <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/04/06/gumroad-open-source-doge-drama/">Ernie Smith’s “Gunkroad”</a>, but I have to nitpick on the structure here: <em>using a non-compliant open source</em> license is not the headline, <em>collaborating with fascists and carelessly endangering disabled veterans</em> is.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p>I saw John Carroll Kirby play at Public Records and have been listening to them constantly ever since. The music is such a paradox: the components sound like elevator music or incredibly cheesy jazz if you listen to a few seconds, but if you keep listening it’s a unique, deep sound.</p><p>More new jazz! Mammoth Hands and Portico Quartet overlap with Vega Trails, which is a beautiful minimalist band.</p><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><lite-youtube videoid="MwGWoqyQqTE"></lite-youtube><p>This short video with John Wilson was great. He says a bit about having a real physical video camera, not just a phone, which reminded me of an old post of mine, <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/11/03/carrying-a-camera">Carrying a Camera</a>.</p></div></article></div></div>
