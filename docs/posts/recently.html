    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I am not going to repeat the news. But man, things are really, really bad and getting worse in America. It’s all so unendingly stupid and evil. The tech industry is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/a16z-hires-acquitted-former-marine-daniel-penny-as-an-investor/">being horrible</a>, too. Wishing strength to the people who are much more exposed to the chaos than I am.</em></p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><p><a href="https://macwright.com/2025/01/25/a-confederacy-of-dunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> was such a perfect novel. It was pure escapism, over-the-top comedy, and such an unusual artifact, that was sadly only appreciated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kennedy_Toole">posthumously</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Very earnestly I believe that despite greater access to power and resources, the box labeled “socially acceptable ways to be a man” is much smaller than the box labeled “socially acceptable ways to be a woman.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://celestemdavis.substack.com/p/hard-to-be-a-man">This article on the distinction between patriarchy and men</a> was an interesting read. With the whole… politics out there, it’s easy to go off the rails with any discussion about men and women and whether either have it easy or hard. The same author wrote this good article <a href="https://celestemdavis.substack.com/p/why-boys-dont-go-to-college">about declining male enrollment in college</a>. I think both are worth a read.</p><p>Whenever I read this kind of article, I’m reminded of how limited and mostly fortunate my own experience is. There’s a big difference, I think, in how vigorously you have to perform your gender in some red state where everyone owns a pickup truck, versus a major city where the roles are a little more fluid. Plus, I’ve been extremely fortunate to have a lot of friends and genuine open conversations about feelings with other men. I wish that was the norm!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/on-having-a-maximum-wealth">On Having a Maximum Wealth</a> was right up my alley. I’m reading another one of the new-French-economist books right now, and am still fascinated by the prospect of wealth taxes.</li><li>My friend David has started a <a href="https://www.chlookout.com/p/the-controversial-high-tech-recording-devices">local newsletter for Richmond, Virginia</a>, and written a good piece about public surveillance.</li><li>Construction Physics is consistently great, and their <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes">investigation of why skyscrapers are all glass boxes</a> is no exception.</li></ul><h2 id="watching">Watching</h2><lite-youtube videoid="EPTQVXwCkbw"></lite-youtube><p>David Lynch was so great. We watched his film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_(film)">Lost Highway</a> a few days after he passed, and it was even better than I had remembered it.</p><lite-youtube videoid="vATVsdYLRT0"></lite-youtube><p>Norm Macdonald’s extremely long jokes on late-night talk shows have been getting me through the days.</p><h2 id="listening">Listening</h2><p><a href="https://thehardquartet.bandcamp.com/track/six-deaf-rats">This song by the The Hard Quartet</a> – a supergroup of Emmett Kelly, Stephen Malkmus (Pavement), Matt Sweeney and Jim White. It’s such a loving, tender bit of nonsense, very golden-age Pavement. They also have this nice chill song:</p><lite-youtube videoid="V0paI3MwISI"></lite-youtube><p>I came across this SML album via <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/">Hearing Things</a>, which has been highlighting a lot of good music.</p><p>It’s a pretty good time for these independent high-quality art websites. <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/">Colossal</a> has done the same for the art world and highlights good new art: I really want to make it out to see the <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/01/nick-cave-amalgams-graphts/">Nick Cave</a> (not the musician) art show while it’s in New York.</p></div></div>
