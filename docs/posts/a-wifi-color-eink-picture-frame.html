A while ago, our little one was born. As unfortunately her (great-)grandparents are located 
somewhat spread out over the globe, real-life visits can&#39;t happen too often. Obviously,
video calling is a thing nowadays, so we keep in contact. Still, I wanted everyone to
also be able to see her when we weren&#39;t online together. So I thought: why not make 
a picture frame around a color display and a WiFi chip? Especially with the little 
one growing so fast, it would be nice to send a new photo every day and have it always 
show a new and up-to-date picture.</p>

<p>You probably have seen E-ink displays by now: if not in an Ebook-reader, then surely
in some local supermarket or other shop where they replaced the old paper price tags. 
They&#39;re great for displaying static images as they retain their most recent image
without any power draw. Most of these screens are black-and-white, with sometimes red 
or yellow thrown in as an extra colour for good measure. These are nice, but
a black-and-white picture doesn&#39;t do justice to the vibrant colors of a happy baby
derping around with her colorful toys.</p>

<p>At the point of writing (early 2023), some E-book-readers with color screens are finally
starting to appear. The quality of them seems good, with colors approaching those of
a newspaper. Unfortunately, they are expensive, and the screens themselves don&#39;t seem
to be available as spare parts yet, so there&#39;s no chance of easy re-use in a DIY project.</p>

<p><a href="https://spritesmods.com/wifipicframe/waveshare.jpg"><img src="https://spritesmods.com/wifipicframe/waveshare.jpg" width="400"/></a></p><p>However, there has been one type of color E-ink display that has been available for use in DIY 
projects. It seems mostly sold by Waveshare, a Chinese company catering to the maker 
market, and the most common one is a 5.65 inch 7 color 640x448 unit. With only 7 colors and a refresh
time of about a minute, it seems intended to be the &#39;big brother&#39; to those price
tags: displaying static information with the colors used to e.g. have some flat background
colors. They&#39;re certainly not intended to reproduce photorealistic images.
</p>

<p>That is a bit unfortunate: an Eink display makes for a great &#39;printed photo&#39; simulacrum as it doesn&#39;t
require any backlight and is entirely static. I&#39;m not the only one who thinks so, and

of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YawP9RjPcJA">people</a> already had an attempt at using dithering to make this screen
into something that can display pictures with some fidelity. This is my attempt at doing so.
