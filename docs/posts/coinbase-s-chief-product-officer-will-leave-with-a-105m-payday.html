    <h1>Coinbase’s chief product officer will leave with a $105M payday</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Surojit Chatterjee logs out on his final day as chief product officer at Coinbase on February 3, he will have made a whopping $105 million from stock sales.</p><p>According to<!-- --> <!-- --><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978822000134/coin-20221028.htm">disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, the former chief product officer will also retain a further 249,315 shares of COIN stock, worth another $7.6 million.

The price of Bitcoin hit $69,000. Coinbase&#39;s revenues are heavily linked to crypto transaction volume, and COIN stock rocketed to a high of more than $342 per share during that year. Chatterjee&#39;s options were priced at just at $18.71 — making him fabulously wealthy.<!-- --></p><p>That wealth wasn&#39;t just on paper. The company required its executives to trade their stock according to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which generated frequent automatic sales of their options on a schedule they did not control. As the months went by, Chatterjee was granted options and then sold them in 65 separate transactions, mostly in 2021, according to his SEC disclosures. The plan paid off handsomely: He took $102.5 million in cash gains in 2021 alone.</p><p>He wasn&#39;t even the richest beneficiary of the plan. According to the SEC, chief operating officer Emilie Choi booked $106 million in stock sales that same year. CEO Brian Armstrong booked none — zero — that year, but he did gain $57 million from options sales the year before. He continues to hold a controlling stake in the company.</p><p>Chatterjee had a five-year agreement with Coinbase but is leaving after three. With COIN stock at $49 per share, his compensation package is now magnitudes less valuable than it was in 2021. But the cash may not have been the driving factor behind his departure — Chatterjee has said he is grappling with family issues.</p><p>“As our product leaders have taken on more responsibility, I&#39;ve been able to consider taking a much-needed personal break to spend more time with my family. It has been a tough year for me personally — my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and my mother passed away unexpectedly. If I&#39;m honest with myself, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve allowed myself time to grieve either yet,” he wrote<!-- --> <!-- --><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-my-crypto-web3-journey-time-little-break-chatterjee/?published=t">in a recent LinkedIn post</a>.<!-- --></p><p>Chatterjee and Coinbase both declined to comment to <!-- --><i>DL News</i>.<!-- --></p></div></div>
