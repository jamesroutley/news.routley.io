                        As the bombs and missiles rain down on Ukraine cities and towns, we must bypass Putin’s 
                        lies and deliver the truth to Russians. They are a people who have been lied to for decades 
                        and are being lied to about what is happening in Ukraine now. 
                        It is our responsibility and our duty to talk to them.

                                    World’s opinion doesn’t matter to Putin. World leaders can’t change his plans. 
                                    Sanctions can’t. He is not afraid of them. There’s only thing he is afraid of – Russian people on streets protesting. 
                                    And forty million calls can help this happen.

                                    Russian propaganda machine is working perfectly. It’s zombifying effect is terrifying. 
                                    Independent media closed, journalists – silenced. So, there’s none to tell the truth, to show photos of 
                                    destroyed hospitals, killed children, bombarded houses.

                                    Putin speaks the language of guns and violence. He lies and fakes reality. 
                                    Russians are victims of Putin and his regime. We know that Russian parents are not being told where their sons are 
                                    and what they are doing. Russians does not deserve hate – they need our encouragement, our support and belief.

                                    because the first day they will stand against the Putin, will be the last day of the war.
