<p>Ross Ulbricht is condemned to die in prison for creating an anonymous e-commerce website called Silk Road. An entrepreneur passionate about free markets and privacy, he was 26 when he made the site. He was never prosecuted for causing harm or bodily injury and no victim was named at trial.</p>
<p>Users of Silk Road chose to exchange a variety of goods, both legal and illegal, including drugs (most commonly small amounts of cannabis). <a href="https://freeross.org/what-was-silk-road/">Prohibited</a> was anything involuntary that could harm a third party.</p>
<p>Ross was <a href="https://freeross.org/the-charges/">not convicted</a> of selling drugs or illegal items himself, but was held responsible for what others sold on the site.</p>

				<div><p>Ross was smeared with false, unprosecuted allegations of planning murder-for-hire that much of the media amplified through inaccurate and sensationalized reporting. The allegations were never charged at trial, never proven, never submitted to, or ruled on by, a jury, and eventually <b>dismissed with prejudice</b>.</p>
<p>Ross consistently denied the allegations (which relied on anonymous online chats never proven to have been authored by him) and those who know him never believed them. Even the only alleged victim ever identified, Curtis Green, is a fervent supporter of Ross’s clemency.</p>

				<div><p>None of the other defendants related to the case received sentences above ten years, including those behind Silk Road 2.0, a larger replica. Nearly all of them are free today.</p>
<p>Ross’s judge used uncharged allegations that Ross was never found guilty of to justify her sentence, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. She also violated the First Amendment by sentencing Ross, in part, on what she believed was his political philosophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“…such a sentence should, at the very least, be reserved for the worst crimes committed by repeat offenders…Ross’s crime is nowhere near that category and his sentence was grossly excessive.”</em></p>

				<div><p>October 1, 2022 marked the beginning of Ross’s <b>10th</b> year in prison.</p>
<p>Throughout this ordeal, and at times in a dangerous environment, Ross has been a model prisoner and a good influence on those around him. He has never received a disciplinary sanction. He has taught science and math classes, and tutored fellow prisoners. He has led yoga and meditation classes to help prisoners better cope with anxiety. Ross currently leads support groups and serves as a mediator within his unit.</p>
<p>130 fellow prisoners signed a letter asking the President to grant him clemency.</p>
<p>Ross has dedicated part of the sale of his art to supporting prisoners and their families through a charitable fund called <a href="https://freeross.org/art4giving/">Art4Giving</a>.</p>

				<div><p>Ross was an idealistic entrepreneur who never intended harm. He has taken responsibility for his mistake and deeply regrets it. He has learned his lesson the hard way. If released tomorrow, he would never break the law again.</p>
<p>Ross clings to the hope of a second chance and dreams of a future where he can start a family and make positive contributions to society.</p>
<p>This has been a long, hard road but we remain hopeful and optimistic. We are not a wealthy family though and we <b>cannot do this alone</b>. We are just regular people working every day to get Ross some relief.</p>
<p>Please join us!</p>
