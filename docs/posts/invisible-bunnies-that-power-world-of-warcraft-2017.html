    <h1>Invisible Bunnies That Power World of Warcraft (2017)</h1>

Turns out, game development is full of stories like that. <em>World of Warcraft</em>, for instance, is overrun with ghost bunnies.<br/></p><div><div><div><div data-playlist="196163,196143,196131" data-current="196163"><div><div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

Other things that creatures are good at doing would be hard to implement any other way, so we use an invisible creature instead.”</p><p>He offered the example of the laser turret in this raid:</p><p><em><small>Video courtesy of </small></em><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPdH3tv8zuGDBBKCEwruGQ&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPdH3tv8zuGDBBKCEwruGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><small>FatbossTV</small></em></a></span><em><small>.</small></em></p><p><small><em>“</em>T</small>he ‘point’ of this laser turret is actually an invisible creature that is following a player with [a] laser visual and beam attached,” Chapman said. “It’s periodically casting fire zone spells.”</p><p>Different games use different invisible creatures. For <em>WoW</em>, it’s mostly bunnies. Chapman pointed me to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;http://www.wowhead.com/search?q=bunny#npcs:0-2+1&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="http://www.wowhead.com/search?q=bunny#npcs:0-2+1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a list of bunnies in the game</a></span>, noting that every bunny on the list that’s not categorized as a “critter” is an invisible bunny oompa-loompaing around in the background of <em>WoW</em>’s endless chocolate factory. The list, I should add, is <em>1,000 damn entries long</em>. These bunnies have some incredible names, too. For instance, there’s the Projections And Plans Kill Credit Bunny. I’m also partial to Pony Gun Bunny. </p><p>Why is <em>WoW </em>a front for a morally questionable bunny labor operation? The short version is, programmers’ time is limited, and NPCs’ time is not. “Programmer time is extremely valuable, and most of the ‘stuff’ that can be done in a game can be done by NPCs,” said Chapman. “NPCs already have to support things like pathing, casting spells, using weapons, doing various actions to other NPCs, etc. So, while you could in theory have a programmer separately implement every ‘effect’ you wanted in the game with some minor benefit, if you already have a class of thing in a game that can solve your problem, it’s a better use of time to use the existing system.”</p><p>“NPCs check off every box in the ‘what I want’ column, except ‘not visible to the player,’” he said. “So you make an invisible creature.”</p><p>He noted, however, that this is all case-by-case, and some individual effects and functions are better left to programmers. Principal server software engineer Kurtis McCathern<strong> </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/823702883392569344&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/823702883392569344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a></span> that there aren’t as many invisible bunnies in <em>WoW </em>as there used to be. The <em>WoW </em>team’s tools have become more refined over time, so they don’t have to duct-tape rabbits to lasers as much anymore. “Sometimes,” McCathern<strong> </strong>said, “you don’t know designers need a kitchen until they’ve made ramen in a flower vase with an iron.”</p><p>Other designers pointed out that games they’ve worked on or played were also built on the haunted remains of pet cemeteries:</p><p>So there you go. If you think you’re alone in your favorite game—quietly taking in the view, breathing the gentle spring air, and shouting your secrets as loudly as you can—you’re probably not. Beware the bunnies, for they see all.</p></div></div></div>
