Last week, Debian announced that in September 2006
they accidentally broke the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator
while trying to silence a Valgrind warning.
One effect this had is that the <code>ssh-keygen</code> program
installed on recent Debian systems (and Debian-derived systems like Ubuntu)
could only generate 32,767 different possible SSH keys of a given type and size,
so there are a lot of people walking around with <a href="http://github.com/blog/63-ssh-keys-generated-on-debian-ubuntu-compromised">the same keys</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many people have had fingers pointed at them, but
it is not really interesting who made the mistake: everyone
makes mistakes.  What&#39;s interesting is the situation that
encouraged making the mistake and that made it possible
not to notice it for almost two years.
</p>

<p>
To do that, you have to understand the code involved and the
details of the bug; those require understanding a little bit
about entropy and random number generators.
