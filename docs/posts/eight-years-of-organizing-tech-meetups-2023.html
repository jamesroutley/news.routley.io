    <h1>Eight years of organizing tech meetups (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>This is a collection of random personal experiences. So if you don&#39;t
want to read everything, feel free to skip to the end for takeaways.</p>
<p>I write because I&#39;d like to see more high-quality meetups. And maybe
my little bit of experience will help someone out.</p>
<h3 id="2015:-philadelphia">2015: Philadelphia</h3><p>I first tried to organize a meetup in Philly in 2015. I was
contracting at the time and I figured a meetup might be a good way to
source contracts or just meet interesting people. I created the
&#34;Philadelphia Software in Business&#34; (or some other similarly vaguely
named) group on Meetup.com.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have any network; the first companies I worked for were not
in Philly. But Meetup.com got me a few tens of people joining the
group.</p>
<p>My first challenge was finding a place to meet. I didn&#39;t know what I
was doing so I looked at restaurants, bars, and cafes for dedicated
event space. Needless to say, renting space was expensive on its
own. And there was always an additional required minimum dollar spent
per attendee.</p>
<p>I ultimately found a place near the Schuylkill River. Maybe it was a
community event space. Maybe I paid for it. I can&#39;t remember.</p>
<p>The first and only time I hosted an event for the group, I got a
surprising number of people for such a vague topic. There were maybe 6
of us. I was the youngest by far (I was 20), they were middle
age. Excel users and one visionary type.</p>
<p>There was no real point to the meetup and I didn&#39;t continue doing
it.</p>
<h3 id="2016---2017:-linode">2016 - 2017: Linode</h3><p>While I was at Linode, I organized &#34;hack nights&#34;. I didn&#39;t ask for
anyone&#39;s approval before starting it. I just said I&#39;d be ordering
pizza for anyone interested in staying after work to hack on
Linode-related projects. I was willing to pay for the pizza, in part
because I didn&#39;t want to risk being shut down by asking. But caker
paid for it each time.</p>
<p>I was nervous because people would show up and ask for pizza and not
want to hack. It was company-provided under the aspiration of doing
Linode-related work. Maybe I mentioned this or not. I can&#39;t
remember. I&#39;m pretty sure they got their pizza.</p>
<p>Aside from myself, developers at Linode didn&#39;t really attend. The
folks who attended were support staff or folks from the technical
writing team who wanted more experience coding.</p>
<p>I ran this for maybe 3 to 5 Wednesdays before not continuing. It was
pretty fun! But staying after work for a few hours each Wednesday lost
its charm.</p>
<h4 id="book-club">Book Club</h4><p>Another time at Linode I started a book club. I was very torn about
attempting to make the book club open to anyone in the area or just to
Linode employees.</p>
<p>I knew I&#39;d probably get more people to attend if I made it public. But
I wasn&#39;t sure if Linode would be cool with having external folks in
the office. Before they moved to the Old City office, visitors weren&#39;t
really a thing.</p>
<p>So I made it private to Linode. And I started with the most obvious
book for your average developer: Practical Common Lisp.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I learned one big trick by this time though. When I
announced I&#39;d be starting the book club I said something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey folks! I&#39;m thinking of starting a book club. A book I have in
mind to start with is Practical Common Lisp. If I get at least one
other person to join in then I&#39;ll move forward!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up getting two folks: one developer and one support staff
member. We held the book club for 30 minutes once a week, covering one
chapter each week. I was the only one who read anything I think, but
the other two guys faithfully showed up for discussion.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t ask for permission to do this either. And this time we met
during company time. I think it was 2-2:30PM.</p>
<p>It was fun. We finished the book. But Practical Common Lisp probably
wasn&#39;t a good choice. And I don&#39;t think I started a second book.</p>
<h3 id="2017---2020:-false-starts">2017 - 2020: False starts</h3><p>I moved to NYC and joined a small startup (~20 employees). Linode was
100+ employees.</p>
<p>We were in a WeWork so I considered starting a book club that was
public to the WeWork. I had learned by then the law of numbers: I
probably wouldn&#39;t get anyone from my company to join.</p>
<p>I considered putting up posters around the WeWork to advertise. But in
the end, I didn&#39;t end up going through with anything.</p>
<p>I did present at a few meetups in NYC during this time. But I didn&#39;t
organize anything.</p>
<p>And then the pandemic hit and everything disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="2021---2022:-virtual">2021 - 2022: Virtual</h3><p>In 2021 I started contracting again, thinking about starting a
company. I wanted a community to be at the center.</p>
<p>So I started a <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord focused on software
internals</a>.</p>
<p>I had a bit more of a network at this point so I posted about the
Discord on Twitter and got 100 likes or something and slowly started
gaining folks in the Discord.</p>
<p>I knew it was going to do better if I was pretty active in it so I
made sure to post interesting blog posts at some regular
interval. About compilers or databases or something.</p>
<p>The Discord didn&#39;t turn out to help me out much in the
starting-a-company front. Or I didn&#39;t use it effectively for that.</p>
<p>I wanted more of an independent Discord of cool people who like to
learn about systems internals. And that&#39;s what I got.</p>
<p>This turned out to be ok though because I stopped working on that
company and the Discord is still around and I still get to hang out
with cool people.</p>
<p>This Discord is still around and hit 1,700 members recently. Among
other things, it has developers from many different database companies
in it these days. They hang out and help out the noobs like me learn
about database internals.</p>
<p>I culled inactive members recently, so today the total is around
1,100.</p>
<h4 id="hacker-nights">Hacker Nights</h4><p>During the pandemic I became frustrated that all the good meetups
disappeared so I decided to start an online one that would be somewhat
tied to the Discord and be about software internals.</p>
<p>I would find 2 or 3 people to present for 10-20 minutes each on
anything to do with software internals. We&#39;d meet once a month at 8PM
NY time I think.</p>
<p>To get speakers I&#39;d mostly DM people who I saw do interesting things
on Twitter or Hacker News. I was lucky to have <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/">Philip
O&#39;Toole</a> (author of rqlite), <a href="https://sirupsen.com/">Simon
Eskildsen</a> (author of the Napkin Math blog),
<a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a>, and many other excellent folks
speak.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2t91m2Rvccpg2q2o_8lfuTYUhoP3AMwq">videos of these talks on
YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The events were organized on Meetup.com. The group grew quickly
and I&#39;d have about 100 people RSVP to each event. 10-20 normally
showed up.</p>
<p>I&#39;d post a Zoom link on Meetup.com. Sometimes Meetup.com crashed right
as the meetup started, so no one could get a link. That was fun.</p>
<p>On two different nights I had Zoom bombers show up and play crazy
music or impersonate other members of the call and act weirdly (Zoom
lets you change your name after you&#39;ve joined the call).</p>
<p>I learned a little bit about how to administrate a Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>I ran Hacker Nights for 5 months. It was tiring to
find speakers, tiring to deal with Zoom bombers. It was thankless and
I wasn&#39;t really enjoying it.</p>
<p>I was proud though that I was offering a channel for developers to
learn about software internals of compilers, databases, etc. And it
was great to meet many interesting speakers and attendees.</p>
<h3 id="2023:-designing-data-intensive-applications">2023: Designing Data Intensive Applications</h3><p>A month ago I put out a call on Twitter for folks in NYC interested in
reading through the book Designing Data Intensive Applications.</p>
<p>I&#39;d read the book before and while it was challenging, I knew it was
immensely useful to any developer who works with data or an API.</p>
<p>By this time I&#39;d learned my second trick: not asking for public
responses.</p>
<p>I said something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey folks! I&#39;m thinking of starting a book club meeting in Midtown
NYC reading through Designing Data Intensive Applications. DM me if
you&#39;d be interested! If I get 2 other interested folks this will be on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got maybe 40 DMs and 20 of them were based in NYC. Attendence thus
would have been higher if I made the book club virtual. But virtual
events take about as much effort as in-person events and somehow feel
less rewarding. So I went through with the NYC group.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I could have gotten some company to provide us space, but
this would just mean more negotation for me and tedium for everyone
involved (bring your ID to be checked in, make sure you&#39;re registered,
etc.).</p>
<p>The group would meet every 2 weeks and cover 2 chapters at a
time. We&#39;d meet for 30 minutes. To avoid needing to find a place to
meet, we&#39;d meet in public at Bryant Park. (There turns out to be
plenty of available seating on Fridays at 9AM in Bryant Park. When it
rains we meet online.)</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the overhead minimal and the timeline slightly
aggressive. We&#39;d be through the book in only 3 months. No crazy
commitment.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve meet twice now and are 25% done the book. Attendance has been
around 7 to 9 people each time so far, or a little less than 50%.</p>
<p>They&#39;re almost all software developers, with one manager I think, who
work for a variety of large and small tech companies.</p>
<p>I&#39;m loving it so far. And if it continues to go well, I&#39;ll probably
continue running in-person book clubs.</p>
<p>But it would only meet a few months a year, giving me a few month
breaks from running it.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways:-the-meh">Takeaways: The meh</h3><p>Organizing any event takes effort. Meetups are especially hard because
you need to find a place to run the meetup, you probably want to
provide food, and you need to find speakers.</p>
<p>Often you can find a single place to host the meetup, but you have to
constantly search for new speakers. Even one of the greatest meetups
in NYC, Papers We Love, seems to be struggling to find speakers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminar2023/">CMU Database Group</a> and the
<a href="http://charap.co/category/reading-group/">Distributed Systems Reading
Group</a> seem to have the
right idea though. They only run sessions part of the year, and they
plan out all sessions in advance (including speakers).</p>
<p>However, they are both virtual. And I&#39;m not so interested in running
virtual events anymore.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways:-the-good">Takeaways: The good</h3><p>For one, meetups are an awesome way to meet random people and expand
your network.</p>
<p>Two, they&#39;re educational. Even beyond the content you are meeting
about, there&#39;s the discussion alongside it you wouldn&#39;t get by
yourself. And you, as organizer, get to pick the topic.</p>
<p>These work out great for me. I love to meet people, and I love to
learn.</p>
<h4 id="tricks">Tricks</h4><p>Starting something new is embarassing because you&#39;re putting yourself
out there. Maybe no one in your network shares your interests (to the
degree or in the direction you do).</p>
<p>My tricks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly: keep things low key! Don&#39;t stress people
out. Before learning and networking, the point of meetups is (or should
be) fun.</li>
<li>Saying you are &#34;thinking about X&#34; is a lightweight way to gauge
interest. As compared to just saying you&#39;re &#34;starting X&#34;, which gives
you less room to back out if there turns out not to be interest.</li>
<li>Asking people to DM you with interest is less embarrassing than
asking for people to respond in public. Not everyone would want to
respond in public. If there&#39;s interest in private, you can share the
interest in public later on. But if you only ask for responses in
public and there are no responses, that can feel embarassing.</li>
<li>Indicating success criteria can help people understand how big
you&#39;re thinking of. I&#39;m normally fine with doing something as small
as only two other people, so I say that. It&#39;s kind of like how
Kickstarters work with minimum funding levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas apply to corporate planning too. I think about them when
I&#39;m sharing some new idea in company Slack as much as when I share on
Twitter.</p>
<p>A note on attendance rates: 10-20% actual attendance versus RSVP seems
normal. If you get a higher percentage of people actually attending
versus RSVP-ing you&#39;re doing pretty well!</p>
<p>One final idea is about paying for space or paying for food. Companies
with space and money for food are often willing to partner with folks
willing to do the work to run an event.</p>
<p>Running your own event in a company&#39;s space is advertising for
them. They get to be associated with cool tech. It&#39;s a chance for them
to pitch their open positions.</p>
<p>Obviously this happens often when you start a meetup hosted by your
own company. But you can also find other companies to host space.</p>
<p>The kind of people to find to make this happen are senior
developers or engineering managers, often on Twitter and sometimes on
LinkedIn.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t done this myself yet because I&#39;m not ready to commit to
running a meetup. But I see it happen. And it&#39;s the approach I&#39;d take
if I were to run a real meetup again.</p>
<p>Though now that I&#39;ve got some time off there are a few talks I&#39;d like
to do myself.</p>
