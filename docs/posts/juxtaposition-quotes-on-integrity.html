    <h1>Juxtaposition: Quotes on Integrity.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div><p><em>A juxtaposition: two things placed next to each other.</em></p><p><em>I -love- weird, ironic, or amusing juxtapositions.</em></p><p><em>Or juxtapositions that are beautiful through complementing or contrasting each-other… like two writers from different centuries who come to the same conclusion—but with language or stories that differ wildly… or like two images that seem to do nothing but contrast with each-other until you stare at them for a time.<br/></em></p><p>“There’s probably not a single act at work that requires more vulnerability than holding people responsible for ethics and values, especially when you’re alone in it or there’s a lot of money, power, or influence at stake. People will put you down, question your intentions, hate you, and sometimes try to discredit you in the process of protecting themselves. So if you don’t ‘do vulnerability and/or you have a culture that thinks vulnerability is weakness, then it’s no wonder that ethical decision making is a problem.”</p><p>—Brene Brown, “Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.”</p><p>‘…this tendency to adapt to immaturity and to sabotage strength is so often characteristic of chronically anxious systems that a good rule of thumb for leaders who are trying to pull any institution out of its regression is that when people start calling you &#34;cruel,&#34; &#34;autocratic,&#34; &#34;heartless,&#34; &#34;hardheaded,&#34; &#34;unfeeling,&#34; &#34;uncooperative,&#34; &#34;selfish,&#34; and &#34;cold,&#34; there is a good chance you are going in the right direction.’</p><p>—Edwin H. Friedman, “A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix”</p><p><em>Apologies for not posting for so long—over two months!</em></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
