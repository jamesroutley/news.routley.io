<p>I&#39;ll show the result first:</p>

<p>For the background story: I&#39;ve always had a fascination with pinball machines. Not that there were many around; in my neck of the
woods, arcade machines already were hard to find, let alone proper pinball machines. However, we had a
computer, and the Macintosh version of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set">Pinball Construction Set</a> was really
cool to play with. Later, when we also had a PC around, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Pinball">Epic Pinball</a>
and to a lesser degree <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverball">Silverball</a> were played a 
lot: like a lot of DOS pinball simulators around that time, they had great music, graphics and
gameplay.</p>

<p>Obviously, the few times I could play an actual pinball machine I was mesmerized by the plethora
of lights, coils and other electronics making the silver ball do what it does best; the mechanics
do add an extra dimension to the game, and simulation can&#39;t ever touch the intricacies of an actual
steel ball rolling around on a real playfield. As I liked it so much, I actually acquired an actual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(pinball)">Dr. Who table</a>. Unfortunately, as it&#39;s
quite hard and costly to take a pinball machine with you when you move continents, I had to leave
it in Europe when I moved to Asia.</p>

<p>Fast forward a bit, and I find myself browsing the <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource">Historical Source</a>
Github repo; a repository with source codes to a bunch of historical games in it. It&#39;s always fun
to leaf through the sources of games you might have played in the past, if only to learn a bunch of
great new expletives. Browsing through the repos, I find a name I recognize: 
<a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/pinballfantasies">&#39;pinballfantasies&#39;</a>.
Pinball Fantasies was one of those great pinball simulators of the &#39;90s, and a competitor to Epic Pinball,
developed on the Amiga by Digital Illusions (a game company which still is around, although they&#39;re 
better known by the initials DICE today.) After the Amiga release, it was ported to PC and a slew of other platforms. The
Github repo actually contained the DOS x86 version, coded by Frontier Designs, which was the commercial
disguise of the Swedish demogroup TSP or <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/55023/">The Space Pigs</a>.</p>

<p>Well, here I am. I am kinda missing my actual pinball machine, I have
