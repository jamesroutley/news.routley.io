    <h1>Hallucinating Datasets Across Epochal Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>“Dataset” is a derived notion, a psychological construct, where “versions” of the dataset are a succession of values that we perceive to be causally related. “Dataset” is a side effect.</p>
<p>Consider Rich Hickey’s epochal time model, which I have <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">written about previously</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://donnywinston.com/img/hickey_are-we-there-yet_epochal-time-model.jpg" alt="Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey&#39;s &#39;Are We There Yet&#39; talk" title="Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey&#39;s &#39;Are We There Yet&#39; talk" width="70%"/></p>
<p>Identity is a derived notion, a collecting of values and calling each value a “state”. A state is just a labeling of a value for an identity at a point in “time”. The succession of states is the identity. Identity is a side effect of choosing a timeline of value succession.</p>
<p>Consider drawing a dotted line on the figure above that encompasses all of the immutable values (boxes) and all of the ovals (pure functions). This may be considered the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#functional">functional</a> <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#phase">phase</a> of a <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#process">process</a>, where data is <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#transform">transformed</a> (<a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#accrete">accreted</a>, <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#reduce">reduced</a>, or <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#reshape">reshaped</a>), separate from the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#operational">operational</a> (i.e., <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#pull">pull</a> or <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#push">push</a>) phases of that process.</p>
<p>With this perspective, a process’s functional phase also suggests labeling its succession of values. Each value may be called “data”. That is, a value becomes data when it is an input or output for a process. Depending on where the value is in the topology of the process, it may be considered “raw data” or “derived data” with respect to that process.</p>
<p>What, then, may we call the succession of data values for the timeline of a process – what is the “identity” here, where successive values are “states”? In the <a href="https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/3808d4ab7dc0229c0f7997eda49fc00ab3947f26/spec/OpenLineage.md#openlineage-spec">OpenLineage specification</a>, the name for this identity is “dataset”. In the <a href="https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/blob/c53f66c0a3f748742eea69db5f3c287c63c929a9/docs/index.md#data-model">Marquez reference implementation</a> of OpenLineage, a “dataset version” is a read-only, immutable version of a dataset, i.e. an immutable value in the sense of the epochal time model.</p>
<p>Thus, “dataset versions” are the states, and “datasets” the identities, for the succession of values associated with the functional phase of a process. To the extent that an immutable digital object – a value – is useful in the functional phase of one or more processes, it is useful to identify it as a “dataset version”. To the extent that a succession of such values, which we perceive to be causally related via a process, is useful in whole or in part to various timelines of various processes, it is useful to identify this succession as a “dataset”.</p>
