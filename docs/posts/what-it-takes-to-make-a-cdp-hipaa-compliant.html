    <h1>What It Takes To Make A CDP HIPAA Compliant</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here’s a warning: software companies you might end up evaluating claim they’re HIPAA compliant, but they&#39;re not.</p><p>At Freshpaint, we’ve worked hand in hand with health tech companies like Osmind and Two Chairs to build a truly HIPAA compliant customer data platform that helps manage the flow of PHI to downstream tools. </p><p>And at the core of this is ID Masking, our de-identification feature.</p><h2>How does de-identification work?</h2><p>To make sure ID Masking is HIPAA compliant (and I’m going to get a bit technical here), we use cryptographic hashing. Hashing is like encryption, but it’s designed to be irreversible.</p><p>But hashing alone is not enough to be considered HIPAA compliant. You need to hash with a secret key (a secret key is like a password). </p><p>That’s because hashing without a secret key makes your data susceptible to a dictionary hack where the attackers could use cross-referencing of datasets to identify the user. In other words, a potential PHI disaster.</p><p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#rationale">The US Department of Health &amp; Human Services</a> explicitly calls out that you must use a secret key or “salt” to ensure proper handling of PHI:</p><blockquote><em>“A code corresponds to a value that is derived from a non-secure encoding mechanism. For instance, a code derived from a secure hash function without a secret key (e.g., “salt”) would be considered an identifying element. This is because the resulting value would be susceptible to compromise by the recipient of such data.”</em></blockquote><h2>The must haves for a HIPAA compliant CDP</h2><p>Freshpaint’s ID Masking cryptographically hashes user identifiers using a secret key, and when running HIPAA mode, we require information sharing server to server, so that key will never be exposed. This is the right way to build a HIPAA compliant CDP.</p><p>So, for a customer data platform to be HIPAA compliant, we need:</p><ul role="list"><li>A BAA</li><li>De-identification that uses cryptographic hashing with a secret key</li><li>Must only share data server to server</li></ul><h2>What to look out for</h2><p>So what would be an equivalent violation to not using a secret key? </p><p>The biggest offender I’ve seen is when the code is built in a way that exposes the secret key. This is the same as not having the secret at all. Using that company’s software is going to expose you to HIPAA violations.</p><p>When evaluating tools to help manage your customer data, make sure you get more than “we sign a BAA” or “yes, we’re HIPAA compliant.” The details are key here.</p><p>If you have questions about keeping your customer data HIPAA compliant,<a href="https://www.freshpaint.io/contact-sales"> reach out to us.</a> We’d be happy to talk about it.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>
