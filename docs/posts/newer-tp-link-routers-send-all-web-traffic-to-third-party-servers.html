    <h1>Newer TP-Link Routers send all web traffic to third party servers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-pin-condition="function() {return this.style.display != &#39;none&#39;;}"><form action="#" onsubmit="return post_form(this, &#39;editusertext&#39;)" id="form-t3_tbthjj4o8"><div><div><p>I recently enabled a DNS gateway to be able to see requests from my router, and network devices. Was surprised to find 80K + requests (in 24 hours) out to an Avira &#34;Safe Things&#34; subdomains <code>*.safethings.avira.com</code> (far more than any other server).</p>

<p>Digging into this more, I found that it is related to the built-in router security &#34;Home Shield&#34; that ships with newer TP-Link routers - <a href="https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers">https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers</a></p>

<p>Here is the kicker though, I have the Avira / Home Shield services completely turned off (I wasn&#39;t even subscribed to their paid service for it). The router doesn&#39;t care, and sends ALL your traffic to be &#34;analyzed&#34; anyhow. See this response from TP Link (towards bottom of review) from last year - <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:%7E:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity">https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity</a> Update: I emailed reviewer to confirm TP-Link never updated him after.</p>

<p>I contacted support about this again, and was given a non-answer about how the requests are to check subscription status. 80K + requests a day to check subscription status? Also the rate of requests is not constant, it is higher when my internet traffic is higher. To me this lack of consistent answer / response from TP-Link is as concerning as the requests themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not seeing much online about this issue, as I don&#39;t think many people realize it is even occurring (since traffic is outgoing straight from router, as opposed to an individual computer). Hoping to gain some attention on this issue and get a real answer / response from TP-Link about what exactly is going on here. As well as a <strong>concrete timeline</strong> and promise for a fix to stop these outgoing requests, when we aren&#39;t even using their anti-virus services.</p>

<p>Edit: Additional details, this is on their WiFI 6 AX3000 (Archer AX55) Router. From the XDA Review looks like this is also happening on their Deco series. If you want to easily check your own router, you can use any DNS Gateway (<a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/">Cloudflare Gateway</a> Pi-Hole etc.) Just be sure to set the DNS servers under &#34;Advanced-&gt;Network-&gt;Internet-&gt;Advanced Settings&#34; because the DHCP DNS server setting will only apply to the devices inside the network, not the router itself.</p>

<p>Edit #2: I&#39;ve also contacted Avira directly regarding the endpoints, in the hope that they&#39;ll be more straightforward than TP-Link about the purpose. Will update here when I receive a response.</p>

<p>Edit #3: If anyone knows of good industry contacts, who can dig into this more or get real answers, please send a message! I&#39;ve seen GamerNexus brought up a few times, but don&#39;t see any contact method.</p>
