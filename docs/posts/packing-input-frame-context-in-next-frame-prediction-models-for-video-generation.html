    <h1>Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video Generation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Drifting is a common problem of any next-what-what prediction model.</p>
                <p>Drifting refers to the quality degradation as the video becomes longer.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the problem is also called error accumulation or exposure bias.</p>
                <p>To see an example, you can find an arbitrary image-to-video model and
                    try to generate long videos by repeatedly using the last generated frame as inputs. The result will
                    mess up quickly after you do this 5 or 6 times, and everything will severely degrade after you do
                    this about 10 times.</p>
                <p>See also our paper for some experiments on existing methods like history noise augmentation, special cfg
                    guidance, rolling diffusion timesteps, and so on. We find out that, to solve drifting
                    fundamentally, we need to break causality and make the sampling bi-directional.</p>
                <p>Consider these sampling methods:</p>
            </div><div>
                <p>(the shadowed squares are the frames generated in each streaming inference)</p>
                <p>Note that only the &#34;vanilla sampling&#34; is causal.</p>
                <p>Both the &#34;anti-drifting sampling&#34; and &#34;inverted anti-drifting sampling&#34; are bi-directional.</p>
                <p>The &#34;inverted anti-drifting sampling&#34; is important. This method is the only one that always treats
                    the first frame as an approximation target in all inferences. This method is very suitable for
                    image-to-video.</p>
