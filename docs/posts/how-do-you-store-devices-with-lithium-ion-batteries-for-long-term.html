    <h1>Ask HN: How do you store devices with Lithium-Ion batteries for long-term?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m curious about how everyone stores old smartphones and other lithium-ion battery-dependent devices while preserving battery life.  Especially when they might want the device to keep working over several years.</p><p>I&#39;ve tried charging my backup devices to 50% and storing them in a cool, dry place, but I often forget to do so, resulting in a drained battery by the time I recharge them. I am worried this might be affecting the battery&#39;s longevity.</p><p>Does anyone have a better method, such as an automated charging system, for managing this?</p></div></div></div>
