</p><p>Are you thinking of becoming a scientist? Do you want to uncover the 
mysteries of nature, perform experiments or carry out calculations to learn how 
the world works? Forget it! 
</p><p>Science is fun and exciting. The thrill of discovery is unique. If you are 
smart, ambitious and hard working you should major in science as an 
undergraduate. But that is as far as you should take it. After graduation, you 
will have to deal with the real world. That means that you should not even 
consider going to graduate school in science. Do something else instead: medical 
school, law school, computers or engineering, or something else which appeals to 
you. 
</p><p>Why am I (a tenured professor of physics) trying to discourage you from 
following a career path which was successful for me? Because times have changed 
(I received my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure in 1976). American science no longer 
offers a reasonable career path. If you go to graduate school in science it is 
in the expectation of spending your working life doing scientific research, 
using your ingenuity and curiosity to solve important and interesting problems. 
You will almost certainly be disappointed, probably when it is too late to 
choose another career. 
</p><p>American universities train roughly twice as many Ph.D.s as there are jobs 
for them. When something, or someone, is a glut on the market, the price drops. 
In the case of Ph.D. scientists, the reduction in price takes the form of many 
years spent in ``holding pattern&#39;&#39; postdoctoral jobs. Permanent jobs don&#39;t pay 
much less than they used to, but instead of obtaining a real job two years after 
the Ph.D. (as was typical 25 years ago) most young scientists spend five, ten, 
or more years as postdocs. They have no prospect of permanent employment and 
often must obtain a new postdoctoral position and move every two years. For many 
more details consult the <a href="http://garp.univ-bpclermont.fr/guilde/emploi/ysn.html">Young Scientists&#39; 
Network</a> or read the account in the May, 2001 issue of the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Washington Monthly.</a> 
</p><p>As examples, consider two of the leading candidates for a recent Assistant 
Professorship in my department. One was 37, ten years out of graduate school (he 
didn&#39;t get the job). The leading candidate, whom everyone thinks is brilliant, 
was 35, seven years out of graduate school. Only then was he offered his first 
permanent job (that&#39;s not tenure, just the possibility of it six years later, 
and a step off the treadmill of looking for a new job every two years). The 
latest example is a 39 year old candidate for another Assistant Professorship; 
he has published 35 papers. In contrast, a doctor typically enters private 
practice at 29, a lawyer at 25 and makes partner at 31, and a computer scientist 
with a Ph.D. has a very good job at 27 (computer science and engineering are the 
few fields in which industrial demand makes it sensible to get a Ph.D.). Anyone 
with the intelligence, ambition and willingness to work hard to succeed in 
science can also succeed in any of these other professions. 
</p><p>Typical postdoctoral salaries begin at $27,000 annually in the biological 
sciences and about $35,000 in the physical sciences (graduate student stipends 
are less than half these figures). Can you support a family on that income? It 
suffices for a young couple in a small apartment, though I know of one physicist 
whose wife left him because she was tired of repeatedly moving with little 
prospect of settling down. When you are in your thirties you will need more: a 
house in a good school district and all the other necessities of ordinary middle 
class life. Science is a profession, not a religious vocation, and does not 
justify an oath of poverty or celibacy. 
</p><p>Of course, you don&#39;t go into science to get rich. So you choose not to go to 
medical or law school, even though a doctor or lawyer typically earns two to 
three times as much as a scientist (one lucky enough to have a good senior-level 
job). I made that choice too. I became a scientist in order to have the freedom 
to work on problems which interest me. But you probably won&#39;t get that freedom. 
As a postdoc you will work on someone else&#39;s ideas, and may be treated as a 
technician rather than as an independent collaborator. Eventually, you will 
probably be squeezed out of science entirely. You can get a fine job as a 
computer programmer, but why not do this at 22, rather than putting up with a 
decade of misery in the scientific job market first? The longer you spend in 
science the harder you will find it to leave, and the less attractive you will 
be to prospective employers in other fields. 
</p><p>Perhaps you are so talented that you can beat the postdoc trap; some 
university (there are hardly any industrial jobs in the physical sciences) will 
be so impressed with you that you will be hired into a tenure track position two 
years out of graduate school. Maybe. But the general cheapening of scientific 
labor means that even the most talented stay on the postdoctoral treadmill for a 
very long time; consider the job candidates described above. And many who appear 
to be very talented, with grades and recommendations to match, later find that 
the competition of research is more difficult, or at least different, and that 
they must struggle with the rest. 
</p><p>Suppose you do eventually obtain a permanent job, perhaps a tenured 
professorship. The struggle for a job is now replaced by a struggle for grant 
support, and again there is a glut of scientists. Now you spend your time 
writing proposals rather than doing research. Worse, because your proposals are 
judged by your competitors you cannot follow your curiosity, but must spend your 
effort and talents on anticipating and deflecting criticism rather than on 
solving the important scientific problems. They&#39;re not the same thing: you 
cannot put your past successes in a proposal, because they are finished work, 
and your new ideas, however original and clever, are still unproven. It is 
proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for a proposal; because 
they have not yet been proved to work (after all, that is what you are proposing 
to do) they can be, and will be, rated poorly. Having achieved the promised 
land, you find that it is not what you wanted after all. 
</p><p>What can be done? The first thing for any young person (which means anyone 
who does not have a permanent job in science) to do is to pursue another career. 
This will spare you the misery of disappointed expectations. Young Americans 
have generally woken up to the bad prospects and absence of a reasonable middle 
class career path in science and are deserting it. If you haven&#39;t yet, then join 
them. Leave graduate school to people from India and China, for whom the 
prospects at home are even worse. I have known more people whose lives have been 
ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs. 
</p><p>If you are in a position of leadership in science then you should try to 
persuade the funding agencies to train fewer Ph.D.s. The glut of scientists is 
entirely the consequence of funding policies (almost all graduate education is 
paid for by federal grants). The funding agencies are bemoaning the scarcity of 
young people interested in science when they themselves caused this scarcity by 
destroying science as a career. They could reverse this situation by matching 
the number trained to the demand, but they refuse to do so, or even to discuss 
the problem seriously (for many years the NSF propagated a dishonest prediction 
of a coming shortage of scientists, and most funding agencies still act as if 
this were true). The result is that the best young people, who should go into 
science, sensibly refuse to do so, and the graduate schools are filled with weak 
American students and with foreigners lured by the American student visa. </p>
