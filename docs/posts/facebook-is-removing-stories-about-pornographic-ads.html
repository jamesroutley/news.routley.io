<p>In early December I got the kind of tip we’ve been getting a lot over the past year. A reader had noticed a post from someone on Reddit complaining about a very graphic sexual ad appearing in their Instagram Reels. I’ve seen a lot of ads for scams or shady dating sites recently, and some of them were pretty suggestive, to put it mildly, but the ad the person on Reddit complained about was straight up a close up image of a vagina. </p><p>The reader who tipped 404 Media did exactly what I would have done, which is look up the advertiser in Facebook’s Ad Library, and found that the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;is_targeted_country=false&amp;media_type=all&amp;search_type=page&amp;view_all_page_id=450572341476695"><u>same advertiser</u></a> was running around 800 ads across all of Meta’s platforms in November, the vast majority of which are just different close-up images of vaginas. When clicked, the ad takes users to a variety of sites for &#34;confidential dating” or “hot dates” in your area. Facebook started to remove some of these ads on December 13, but at the time of writing, most of them were still undetected by its moderators according to the Ad Library.</p><p>Like I said, we get a lot of tips like this these days. We get so many, in fact, that we don’t write stories about them unless there’s something novel or that our readers need to know about them. Facebook taking money to put explicit porn in its ads despite it being a clear violation of its own policies is not new, but definitely a new low for the company and a clear indicator of <a href="https://www.404media.co/has-facebook-stopped-trying/"><u>Facebook’s “fuck it” approach</u></a> to content moderation, and moderation of its ads specifically.   </p>
