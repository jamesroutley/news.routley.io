    <h1>Doug Rushkoff is ready to renounce the digital revolution</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Despite occasionally identifying as a futurist, Rushkoff had not gamed out any Event-style scenarios. He riffed. How to make sure your head of security doesn’t slit your throat tomorrow? “Pay for his daughter’s bat mitzvah today,” he said. His suggestions didn’t go over particularly well, and the conversation turned out to be more consequential for him than for the survivalists. That moment, he tells me, prompted a “second break” with techno-optimism, one that would sever his alliance even to tech itself, and finally bring him home to Queens.</p><p>The bulk of <em>Survival of the Richest</em> isn’t about apocalypse escape routes for the super-wealthy. It’s preoccupied with something Rushkoff calls The Mindset, which roughly translates to “the way Silicon Valley technocrats think.” The Mindset is about a strategy of acceleration without a destination. It’s about blowing up humanity’s corpus of existing knowledge in favor of something—anything—new. In this relentless drive, Rushkoff perceives a self-destructive impulse. “Instead of just lording over us forever,” he writes, “the billionaires at the top of these virtual pyramids actively seek the endgame. Like the plot of a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> blockbuster, the structure of The Mindset <em>requires</em> an endgame. Everything must resolve to a one or a zero, a winner or loser, the saved or the damned.” This isn’t just Facebook’s old “Move fast and break things” motto; it’s Zuckerberg’s personal mantra: “Domination!” Why are the world’s richest people obsessed with preparing for the apocalypse? Because they’re edging us all toward it. It’s as if, Rushkoff writes, they’re trying to build a car that goes fast enough to escape from its own exhaust.</p><p>Who is afflicted with The Mindset? The archetypal subject, Rushkoff writes, was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-power-of-networks/">Jeffrey Epstein</a>: with a private island, an elite coterie of enablers and protectors, and detailed plans to impregnate 20 women at a time. Rushkoff never met Epstein, but he once wandered into his distant orbit via the celebrity literary agent John Brockman. The book recounts a dinner party Rushkoff attended at Brockman’s home that included the evolutionary biology crank <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/07/dawkins/">Richard Dawkins</a>. Dawkins proceeded to mock Rushkoff for believing in a “potentially moral universe,” to the chuckles of the assembled dignitaries. (When Epstein’s full crimes came to light, Rushkoff flashed back to this conversation—a rejection of morality, indeed!) Epstein is certainly an extreme example. But when <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> talks about his own nine (?) kids as a solution to underpopulation, one suspects Rushkoff is on to something.</p><p>In <em>Survival of the Richest</em>, Rushkoff burns the last bridges linking him to the techno-solutionist crowd. <em>Whole Earth</em> impresario and fellow tech media guru <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/backward-looking-futurism-stewart-brand/">Stewart Brand</a> comes in for particularly harsh criticism. Though a decade earlier Rushkoff had counted Brand among his close intellectual collaborators, now he endorsed <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/timothy-leary-archives/">Timothy Leary</a>’s excoriation of Brand as a petty leader of “a few smart but psychosexually immature white men who wanted all the benefits of being sealed up in their perfectly controlled and responsive environments—without ever having to face the messy, harsh reality of the real world.” During a time of intensifying wealth polarization, Brand nabbed 42 million dollars from <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/jeff-bezos/">Jeff Bezos</a> to fund a giant clock. Meanwhile, Rushkoff transformed into a middle-aged Marxist. While much of his cohort worked with <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> to put out the insipid documentary <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/social-dilemma-netflix-documentary/"><em>The</em> <em>Social Dilemma</em></a>, Rushkoff’s perceptive films stream for free on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/pbs/">PBS</a>. These days, the direction of his work fits with his thought in a way that the solutionist juggling of his earlier career never could.</p><p>A harsh critic might accuse Rushkoff of having played both sides, given that his ideas have found some overlap with the latest—and perhaps worst—generation of techno-capitalists. But this would be unfair. Rushkoff has always played for what he calls “Team Human.” What’s changed is not his loyalties, but his understanding of what can be included in humanism. “Team Human doesn’t reject technology,” he wrote in his 2019 book of the same title. “Artificial intelligence, cloning, genetic engineering, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vr/">virtual reality</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/robots/">robots</a>, nanotechnology, bio-hacking, space colonization, and autonomous machines are all likely coming, one way or another. But we must take a stand and insist that human values are folded into the development of each and every one of them.” Only a few years later, here he is rejecting not just these technologies, but technology writ large as a solution to our problems. (That is to say, he no longer talks about humanizing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/erika-nesvold-what-will-ethical-space-exploration-look-like/">space colonies</a>.)</p><p>Over noodle soup at a cheap Chinese place off the Queens College campus, I ask Rushkoff how he feels about the industry now. “It’s not just <em>Look what they did to my song</em>,” he says. “It’s that the song itself is corrupt.” He struggles to find a break in his monologuing to slurp before his bowl goes cold. “I’ve come to see these technologies as intrinsically antihuman. How far back do we have to go to find technology that’s not about controlling nature? You have to go back to fucking Indigenous people and permaculture. That’s the future.”</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"></div><p>I push Rushkoff to say more about the personal aspects of this second break, what drove him to reject Tech with a capital T. What brought him here, to a public college in Queens, while many of his old peers stayed close to Silicon Valley and its money? He takes an uncharacteristic pause.</p><p>“There is that psychosocial component,” he sighs. “There’s a domination mentality, and a fear of women and nature and earthworms.” He pauses again. “I might have had that. I was a little nerd boy and scared of girls and teased and pushed down stairs and all that, and virtual worlds feel safe. As I grew up, I realized, oh, that’s just <em>death</em>.” The dramatic comment is classic Rushkoff, but I understand that his feeling of pioneering excitement in the days of the early web, one strong enough to fuel him for decades, has finally curdled into shame and disgust. </p></div></div></div></div>
