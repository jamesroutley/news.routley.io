    <h1>Notes on Wikipedia after 10,000 edits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Wikipedia is administered by the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a> (WMF), an American non-profit, but day-to-day operations – everything from writing articles to patrolling for vandalism – are conducted by a pseudonymous army of unpaid &#34;editors&#34;, chaperoned by a cadre of privileged users called &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a>&#34;.</p>
<p>Ironically for a community with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules">quasi-anarchist ideals</a>, Wikipedia has organically developed a law code of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">policies and guidelines</a> to rival any nation-state&#39;s, and a byzantine socio-bureaucratic edifice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProjects</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Noticeboards">noticeboards</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dashboard">community forums</a>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia maintains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style">a mammoth in-house style guide</a> and detailed guidelines for everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(clergy)">naming conventions for clergy</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Figure_Skating/Style_guide">articles about figure skating</a>. The community has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost">a monthly newsletter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiCup">an annual editing competition</a>, regular &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Backlog_drive_schedule">backlog drives</a>&#39; for various kinds of clean-up, and formal peer-review processes for accrediting articles as a &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles">Good Article</a>&#39; or &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles">Featured Article</a>&#39;. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Guild_of_Copy_Editors">Guild of Copy Editors</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Counter-Vandalism_Unit">Counter-Vandalism Unit</a>. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">years-long initiative to write more articles about women</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Video_games/Nintendo">Nintendo task force</a>.</p>
<p>To administer this sprawling empire of content creation, Wikipedia has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">court system</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_elections">elections</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment">consensus-driven legislative process</a>. The &#34;back-of-house&#34; functions are so extensive that some editors barely touch mainspace – the user-facing encyclopedic articles – at all.</p>
<p>Because the editorial direction of the site is entirely determined by volunteer users, the selection and depth of topics sometimes reflects very idiosyncratic interests. Wikipedia has world-class coverage of snooker championships, New York City architecture, Great Lakes shipping, and Australian shrubs, in each case due to the predilection of a single highly industrious editor. The article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Martin">Billy Martin</a>, an American professional baseball player in the 1950s, is longer than the article on Stalin. <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles/By_length was helpful here. Length based on word count according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Prosesize. --></p>
<p>Wikipedia is, famously, the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. In actual fact, a large majority of the site&#39;s content comes from a small group of dedicated editors, small enough that veterans easily recognize each other by name. Some have been identifiable characters on the Wikipedia scene for 15 years or more.</p>
<p>For a community of people whose hobby is authoring encyclopedia articles, the tone of discourse is sometimes surprisingly acrimonious. The two most edited Wikipedia pages of all time <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_reports/Pages_with_the_most_revisions --> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism">a page to report vandalism</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents">noticeboard</a> for &#34;urgent incidents and chronic, intractable behavioral problems&#34;. Incivility is an acknowledged problem, but the community often lacks the appetite to punish longstanding and productive editors except in the most egregious of cases.</p>
<p>Underlying the rancor is the reality that editing Wikipedia is thankless work. Most edit pseudonymously. Conditions are often hostile. To be sure, vandalism, once a plague, is now a manageable problem; far more damaging are the well-intentioned but inept, and the doggedly tendentious. Someone might spend a dozen hours researching and writing an article, but in the eyes of the Wikipedia guidelines they have no stronger claim to the article than a drive-by editor who makes one change and never returns. The default posture that many seasoned editors adopt, of defensiveness verging on outright hostility, is a natural reaction to these circumstances.</p>
<p>I started editing Wikipedia 16 years ago. Long experience has bred a certain degree of cynicism. But I remain in continued awe of what is without question a supreme achievement of human collaboration, and grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in it. ∎</p>
