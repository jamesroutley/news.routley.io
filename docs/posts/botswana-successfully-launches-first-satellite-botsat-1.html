<p><span>Botswana’s first satellite, BOTSAT-1, was successfully launched aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9—Transporter 13 rideshare mission on Saturday, March 15, 2025, from the Vandenberg Space Force Base, USA. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off the Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) at 06:39 am GMT, carrying 74 satellites. These included BOTSAT-1, 26 satellites as part of the Transporter-13 rideshare mission, and a trio of CubeSats for NASA’s Electrojet Zeeman Imaging Explorer (EZIE) mission; Arvaker 1, the first microsatellite for Kongsberg NanoAvionics’ N3X constellation.</span></p>

<p><span>BOTSAT-1 is a 3U hyperspectral Earth Observation satellite developed by the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) and led by Dr Dimane Mpoeleng, BOTSAT-1’s Project Lead. The project was done in collaboration with </span><span><a href="https://www.endurosat.com/news/botsat-1-botswana-first-software-defined-satellite/">EnduroSat</a>, the satellite’s lead manufacturer. Similarly, </span><span>ExoLaunch managed the </span><a href="https://www.exolaunch.com/news_119.html"><span>launch</span></a><span> in partnership with Space X as part of the Transporter missions, a smallsat rideshare programme.</span></p>

<p><span>Botswana’s President, Duma Gideon Boko, </span><a href="https://web.facebook.com/share/p/18TzTH77vC/"><span>attended</span></a><span> the launch of BOTSAT-1 as part of his working visit to the United States of America, accompanied by BIUST Vice Chancellor Professor Totolo and other senior government officials. The President also visited various sites such as the Space X Rocket Production and Starlink Mini Production Facilities, signalling future increased collaborations with the company. The launch of BOTSAT-1 as the country’s first satellite demonstrates its space capabilities and positions Botswana to fully utilise space as a resource for its national development. </span></p>
<h2><b>Key Mission Objectives</b></h2>
<p><span>Launched at a near-polar and sun-synchronous orbit at approximately 500 kilometres, <a href="https://spaceinafrica.com/2025/02/19/botsats-success-story-a-blueprint-for-emerging-space-nations/">BOTSAT-1</a> will provide crucial Earth Observation data for the country’s national development priorities: food security, environmental conservation and urban planning. Additionally, the project has allowed for intensive Human Capacity Development (HCD) among Botswana’s engineers, who have gained practical skills in satellite development. This strengthens the country’s technical capabilities and positions it to lead future developments, such as </span><span>BOTSAT-2</span><span>, the country’s second satellite whose specifications are currently being developed. </span></p>

<p><span>BOTSAT-1 will transmit data through its fully operational ground station located at BIUST. The satellite will scan Botswana from east to west, covering a swath of approximately 32 kilometres with a resolution of 12 meters. Conceptualised in 2020, the satellite has passed through various stages of development and completed its </span><a href="https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/09/19/botsat-1-passes-major-milestone-in-preparation-for-launch/"><span>Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) phase</span></a><span> in September 2024, marking the last significant milestone before its transportation to its launch location. </span></p>
<p><span>The launch of BOTSAT-1 brings </span><a href="https://spaceinafrica.com/data-hub/"><span>Africa’s total satellite launches to 65</span></a><span>, joining 10 other countries operating Earth Observation satellites leveraging satellite data to tackle regional challenges in agriculture, resource management, and disaster preparedness.</span></p>
<h2><b>Botswana Advances Space Technology with Dragonfly Aerospace Partnership</b></h2>
<p><span>As part of Botswana’s push to integrate cutting-edge technology into its space initiatives, the mission employs the </span><a href="https://dragonflyaerospace.com/products/mantis/"><b>Mantis Hyperspectral Imager</b></a><span> from Dragonfly Aerospace, a South African-manufactured system providing <a href="https://dragonflyaerospace.com/botswana-and-dragonfly-aerospace-celebrate-the-successful-launch-of-botsat-1/">advanced imaging capabilities</a>. Furthermore, the imager delivers detailed spectral insights for environmental monitoring, resource management, and agricultural research—critical applications for sustainable development across Africa.  </span></p>
<p><span>Beyond supplying state-of-the-art imaging technology, Dragonfly Aerospace is supporting the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) in developing its </span><b>clean room facilities</b><span>. These controlled environments, essential for satellite assembly, integration, and testing (AIT), will feature industry-standard air filtration systems, static control measures, and environmental monitoring tools to meet stringent space industry requirements.  </span></p>
<p><span>This initiative will enable BIUST to build a sustainable pipeline of space technology projects while facilitating hands-on learning opportunities for students and researchers. Additionally, Dragonfly Aerospace has provided a 3U satellite structure for demonstration and training purposes, further enhancing BIUST’s satellite development capabilities.</span></p>
