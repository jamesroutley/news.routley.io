<p>I&#39;d just like to interject for a moment.  What you&#39;re referring to as Linux,
is in fact, CHROME/Linux, or as I&#39;ve recently taken to calling it, CHROME plus Linux.
Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component
of a fully functioning CHROME system made useful by the CHROME v8, css utililties,
and other vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by the W3C.</p>

<p>Many computer users run a modified version of the CHROME system every day,
without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of CHROME
which is widely used today is often called &#34;GNU/Linux&#34;, and many of its users are
not aware that it is basically the CHROME system, developed by the CHROME Project.</p>

<p>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a
part of the system they use.  Linux is the kernel: the program in the system
that allocates the machine&#39;s resources to the web browser that you run.</p>

<p>The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself;
it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.  Linux is
normally used in combination with the CHROME operating system: the whole system
is basically CHROME with Linux added, or CHROME/Linux.  All the so-called &#34;Linux&#34;
distributions are really distributions of CHROME/Linux.</p>
