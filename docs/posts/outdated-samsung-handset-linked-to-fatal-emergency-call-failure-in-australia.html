    <h1>Outdated Samsung handset linked to fatal emergency call failure in Australia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A Sydney resident died after their Samsung handset failed to connect to 000, Australia&#39;s primary emergency number, triggering a stark warning from telco TPG that outdated mobile software could be a matter of life or death.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TPG/03024249.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Tuesday, TPG Telecom confirmed that a customer using a Lebara-branded service on its network died last week after they were unable to place emergency calls. TPG, which was notified of the fatal incident on November 17, stressed that its network was fully operational at the time and that early investigations point to the user&#39;s Samsung device running software no longer compatible with emergency calling.</p>
<p>Samsung, which TPG says recently identified the issue in &#34;certain older devices,&#34; didn&#39;t respond to <em>The Register</em>&#39;s request for comment. However, the company&#39;s website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/issue-with-some-older-galaxy-devices-calling-triple-zero/" rel="nofollow">lists dozens of devices</a> that need to be updated or replaced to ensure users can make Triple Zero calls.</p>

    

<p>According to the carrier, the affected handset had not been updated despite multiple warnings. TPG says it contacted users of flagged Samsung models – which include Galaxy S7 and Note 5 series handsets – and urged them to update, with the most recent notice sent on November 7.</p>

        


        

<p>Under the federal Emergency Service Call Determination, all operators must block handsets that can&#39;t complete Triple Zero calls if they remain unpatched for 28-35 days after the first warning – a rule TPG says it followed.</p>

<p>&#34;Customer safety remains our highest priority,&#34; said CEO Iñaki Berroeta. &#34;This is a tragic incident... We urge all customers with outdated software to replace or update their devices without delay.&#34;</p>
<p>The telco noted in its ASX filing that it was disclosing the incident due to heightened public concern around emergency call reliability. Telstra also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/older-mobile-devices-calling-triple-zero-" rel="nofollow">warned</a> last month that older, non-upgradeable Samsung devices could fail Triple Zero calls and that such devices face mandatory blocking from all Australian networks if left unresolved.</p>
<p>TPG says it has notified the federal communications minister, state authorities, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and the Triple Zero Custodian as its investigation into the tragic incident continues.</p>

        

<p>Earlier this year, Australian telco Optus <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/21/optus_emergency_call_incident/">admitted</a> that a firewall update left customers unable to call emergency services for 14 hours – an incident that was linked to the deaths of three people. ®</p>

<p>In a statement sent to <em>The Register</em> after the article was published, Samsung said, &#34;We are deeply saddened to learn of this news and extend our heartfelt condolences to their family and loved ones in this difficult time. We are continuing to work closely with our carrier partners to ensure that all devices operate reliably in every emergency situation.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We strongly encourage customers to keep their mobile devices updated with the latest software, as this is critical to maintaining the highest standards of safety, security, and performance. Customers with mobile devices requiring updates or replacements have been notified by their mobile carrier with instructions,&#34; it added.</p>
