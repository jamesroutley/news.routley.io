<p>It is crazy, absolutely crazy to depend on open source to be free (as beer). It is not okay - it is not okay to consider that this labor fell from the sky and is a gift, and that the people/person behind are just doing it for their own enjoyments.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine that what we’re doing today is the only way. Begging/busking for donations, hoping to get noticed. Hoping for a <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902">lifeline</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, a solution. Or an idea, really. Incredibly half-baked. Poke all the holes you want. It’s very unwrought and <em>muy</em> unripe.</p>

<p>GitHub should charge every org $1 more per user per month and direct it into an Open Source fund, held in escrow.</p>

<p>Those funds would then be distributed by usage - every mention in a package.json or requirements.txt gets you a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>You know how the money you pay to Spotify is very very very approximately (and not really fairly) distributed among artists that you listened to? Yes, Spotify is a very flawed model and artists are not doing well. But it is <em>a</em> model??</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s the idea. Call it the “Open Source Fund” thing, <strong>make it opt-out</strong>. Give every org a magical badge - or the ability to set their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hxdhb0BE2U">profile’s background css</a>.</p>

<p>Or don’t! Let’s not do anything! People’s code and efforts - fueling incredibly critical bits of infrastructure all around the world - should just be up for grabs. Haha! Suckers!</p>

<p>Alright, I don’t <em>know</em> how you fund Linux (does Linux appear in a requirements file). Hmm. Maybe <code>FROM</code> commands from Dockerfiles are also read &amp; applied. Maybe we at least start somewhere?</p>

<p>Anyway, you all smarter than me people can figure it out. I just cannot accept that what we have is “GOOD”. xx</p>
