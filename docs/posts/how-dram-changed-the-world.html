And computers, such as they were, involved paper tape and punch card readers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That same year, Robert Dennard invented dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Two years later — 55 years ago —on June 4, 1968, the DRAM patent was granted. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To develop the technology, Dennard led a research team at IBM that experimented with binary data on a capacitor as a positive or negative charge. Since capacitors leaked charge, Dennard invented a platform where everything was handled by a single transistor, drastically decreasing the size.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Random access memory (RAM), which employed temporary memory, was widely used at the time, but was complex, bulky and used a ton of power. Large magnetic storage systems required room-sized equipment, while storing only one megabyte of information.

All of a sudden, a computer could hold a billion RAM cells on one chip.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first RAM chip, the 1103, was released in 1970.
