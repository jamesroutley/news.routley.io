<p>Sublime Text 4, build 4142 is out now with new features, performance
improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve recently moved back into our freshly renovated office after having
worked from home due to the pandemic. As well as a new office we also have a
new team member, with Valerie joining Sublime HQ last month. Feel free to come
on down to our <a href="https://discord.gg/79DKj98s3k">Discord server</a> and
say g&#39;day!</p>
