    <p>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</p></div>
