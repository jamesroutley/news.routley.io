    <h1>Austria: Pylons as sculpture for public acceptance of expanding electrification</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><article><p>As <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electrification-could-save-europe-250-135800160.html" target="_blank">electrification infrastructure expands across Europe</a>, Austria encountered a problem: the general public is not fond of how the new pylons — which resemble traditional power lines — look.</p><p>So, the <a href="https://www.apg.at/en/projects/austrian-power-giants-1/#c1908655" target="_blank">Austrian Power Giants</a> were born.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f6cc9cd16d59d990c8fca33/68fa5e18c89dc4b98f47ecbe_austrian-power-giants-power-line-animals-vienna.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A stork sculpture amid power lines in Austria"/></p><figcaption>The Stork represents the state of Burgenland.

And the stag, an animal symbol representing the wooded foothills of the Alps in Lower Austria. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f6cc9cd16d59d990c8fca33/68fa5ec4a8bb948d9e2d301b_austrian-power-giants-power-line-animals-alps.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A large metal stag sculpture is seen at a distance in the lower alps"/></p><figcaption>The Stag sculpture at a distance.

But the plan is to install them across nine federal states: Burgenland, Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Vienna.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f6cc9cd16d59d990c8fca33/68fa5e3aff32efd755a4fef0_austrian-power-giants-power-line-animals-stag.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A metal deer sculpture situated among power lines in Austria"/></p><figcaption>The Stag design sits among the Alps in Lower Austria.

Photo courtesy of GP designpartners</figcaption></figure><p>And in the meantime, stakeholders will continue testing the feasibility of implementing these awe-inspiring animals.</p><p>“The real test will be public reception once these go live. Opposition to grid infrastructure is fierce, especially in rural and scenic areas where people (understandably) don’t want their views dominated by industrial metal,” a review from <a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/10/22/austria-is-turning-its-power-lines-into-giant-metal-animals/" target="_blank">Yanko Design</a> shared.</p><p>“Austrian Power Grid is betting that regional pride and visual interest can shift that calculus. If a community sees a pylon as a landmark rather than an eyesore, the theory goes, acceptance follows.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f6cc9cd16d59d990c8fca33/68fa5e8491e57534acc63c97_austrian-power-giants-power-line-animals-deer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A deer-shaped metal power line in Austria"/></p><figcaption>A view of the Stag from the ground-up.
