						<p>Dear Alex, dear beneroth,</p>

<p>@Alex “Jo, what you write is all wrong.” – Youre the only one pil -person I forgive such a sentence …</p>

<p>@beneroth “@Jo, you are spreading misinformation.”  That’s not correct! – Do you wish, I publish the evidences? 
It would not good for the future of pil! And this is not my goal!
And please dont forget: Tey’re not the most rotten fruits, where sitting the wasps. ;-)</p>

<p>I believe, the discussion is useful for us all, so I want answer about your objections:</p>

<ol>
<li>My statement was from Nov 2017, your answers from Apr 2019.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Nearly 1.5 years are a long time in IT and your answers maybe relate to a very different situation since 2017. There was “some” changes in the IT-sector since my statement, so maybe there are some misunderstandings …  (so there’s a pil-wiki in between – thanks a lot! But – I believe – isn’t Alex german? – Why no reference in german language then? You don’t like your own folks, your own language, Alex? (Its not a personal question, but a strategic question for
the use of pil! Maybe there will be a german fork in future … ;-)   )</p>

<ol>
<li>Alex, you wrote: “every browser has a different behavior” is not true any longer, since at least a decade.” – lol – and beneroth delivered (maybe unvoluntary ;-) the right reason for that if he wrote:</li>
</ol>

<p>“since HTML5 there aren’t huge inconsistencies in browser
implementations any more, and this will further decrease as currently the single company Google is de facto writing the web standard specifications and nearly all browsers are based on Googles chromium (including Microsofts browser).”</p>

<p>Yeah, thats (lamentably) right. In light, today (2020) we have in reality only one single browser-architecture worldwide. :-(</p>

<p>But I wrote about really different(sic)
browsers/browser-architectures (like it’s worthy in a real(!) free world and not in a browser-banana-republic, only still named “free”!) and not about only one single browser, which is pushed underneath the world of computer users with different names and some minor variantes, like beneroth very truly describes.</p>

<p>I meant in my statement real different(sic)
browser-architectures. In 2017 they’re (partially!) still there – but in 2019 it’s difficult to find them already – but this was 2017 still not my topic! 
Is it fair, to compare apples with pears?</p>

<p>So the vital, strategic question (for using pil) of the way of pil is:</p>

<p>Will pil go in future the way of the (current)
US-alone-controlled (naturally with help of estrange
“auxillar-troops” – like the erectors of the first, ancient
“capitol”(Rom, not Washington!  Means: “Head of the world” –
megalomania set in stone) – banana-republic of IT (like (only nearly!) all those others), or has pil a future of real(sic) worldwide freedom? (The US-peoples and their ideas are only a handful in comparison with the “rest” ;-) of the world! We should never forget that, if we develope code for the world!)</p>

<p>I believe, mathematics should always think in mathematics, not in shortsighted “mainstream”- politics. So my role model is rather Pythagoras and not Bill Gates and his US-friends in the “whole world” ;-) My way: Future-(sic) instead shortsighted profit-orientated tricks …</p>

<p>The current “IT-banana-republic by the grace of USA” and their “private” (lol) corporations and compliably lieges in nearly the whole world aren’t the future for sure (its not only an ethical, it’s a mathematical problem at first, btw) and I believe, the development of a so much intelligent and forward-looking programming-language like pil should not go into the trap of current (f.e. “singlespybrowser-” and “OO”-) “mainstream” – because already tomorrow the (IT-/mathematical) weather can change …</p>

<p>(Means too – on the political and(!) mathematical floor: It’s not tolerable, that nearly the whole world- communication is controled today by still only one single browser-developer-monopol with unclear, apparent untrustworthy goals and potentials! And a language (which ever!), which would submitting itself under those
crazy circumstances by concept, wouldn’t be worth to be used further, because it’s on a foreseeable blind alley …</p>

<p>I mean: Picolisp should be/remain open for really(!) different(sic) (browser-) architectures (for future – but the nearly-only-browser-orientation is a basic question anyway!) – and in those cases there are still(!!) the problems, written in my first statement.)  (btw:
If I’ve a little more time, I will send you code-examples per mail, to demonstrate this. btw II: But even if im running picolisp-code in the same browser (firefox in this case) but in different versions of this browser and/or on different machines, there are different results! Thats not nicely! And: Not acceptable for a serious programming-language.</p>

<p>And my answer, proposition and trigger into the world about that (I dont want only grumble for nothing!) is:</p>

<p>Lets write an own browser (with a google-independent(!) architecture!)  or a pil-own UI-system in(!) and for
picolisp! (I know today and after decades(!) not one single satisfactorily UI) – and this new UI in the spirit of Alex’ genial ideas of a small and handy system. I believe: It’s worth!  Means: Please let’s not stop with pil halfway! There is a lot “air in the heaven” for it. )</p>

<ol>
<li>About “the gap”” between functional programming language and objectoriented database-concept:</li>
</ol>

<p>At first ( ;-)  – lisp is written in my year of birth!)  we had such things like C and relational databases.</p>

<p>Then we’ve got the “grand solution” ;-) : “objectoriented” languages – but had still those old relational databases. This was “schizophrenia 1.0”: “gap 1.0” so to say.</p>

<p>And in a short time we got – consequentially – “objectoriented” databases. 
Gap 1.0 closed? Happy end? Oh no!</p>

<p>Because the “objectorientation” wasn’t this allrounder like we believed at that time. (today I belive: the OO-approach was/is a little greenly: Reality and mathematics are part of the same world (for sure) – but not always congruent in a linear, naive way …
And this is (in my opinion), why the good old lisps (old like myself ;-) ) come back into the focus again today …)
But today we have in picolisp the same (but funnily inverse)
situation like in the past: A functional(sic) language – but: Still the old, rotten, oversophisticated  objectorientated” database-structure now. Isn’t it a “gap”?</p>

<p>And so again/still(sic) there persists the “gap” between the
concept of the programming-language-architacture and the concept of the database-architecture.</p>

<p>Thats normal in other languages – but why in pil too??
Pil has (with Alex’ philosophy) the chance to go completely(!) new (really consistent!) ways: Language- and database- architecture consequently by lambda-calculus!</p>

<p>Who not need this, should change to perl! ;-)</p>

<p>Who chooses (and why!) a slim functional(!) language like pil for this fat objectorientated programming? If I want do
objectorientated work, I will choose a completely(!)
object-orientated system (and have to hire (and pay!!) then a company -oh wrong – a division(!) of programmers )! But then clearly I’ve not the elementariness (in
more than one aspect!) of pil!</p>

<p>If I decide for pil – and then I can do jobs alone, or with 2 – 5 friends – but still(!) have the old struggle with a surprisingly fat “objectorientated” database-logic?</p>

<p>I don’t want a one-man-submarine, if I need a hundred man for bring it to the water!</p>

<p>The “gap” (in my eyes) is: The genial slim concept of pil is only bad (because kind of inconsistent) represented in this
conventional-fat-objectoriented database-part.  I belive, this database-concept isn’t optimum for pil! Too fat!  (Hey Alex, it’s clearly, that not one single person alone can stem all this and your pil- output is anyways truly giant! And me by myself have no solution for that at moment(!) So my criticism has not the goal, to cut the pil-development, but show some drags for bear down them and to animate others, to search solutions in your footprints. Your work is absolutely cogent and worth a critical word. You will never hear a word about Java, or C++ etc. from me – it would be arrant time waste.)</p>

<p>You wrote: “In PicoLisp there is no “gap between object-oriented language versus relational datamodel”. Did you even look at it? The PicoLisp database is an OO-DB.”</p>

<p>LOL! Yeah! Precisely! Thats the point! For you it is a feature – for me it is a serious trial to use pil nonstop.  Who needs an OO-DB in a functional(!) language?</p>

<p>Who needs a wood-gas-generator in a jet-plane?
(and a OO-DB architecture is a IT-wood-gas-generator for sure)</p>

<p>Why not go consistently the (genial!) slim pil- way further into the database-world?! This “gap”, this unexpected stop in front of the database-question (like the Kimbers and Teutons in front of the Rome-city! ;-)  ) makes me crazy! ;-)</p>

<p>At first we believed in OO-languages,then sequentially in
OO-databases, then we saw: OO isn’t the only way to universal happiness, so now we’re wisely going back to functional languages – but not so to an invention of “functional databases” at the same time! 
This I mean with “gap” of constistence.</p>

<p>I mean: OO is a Mammut today – good for jewellery-scrimshaw …</p>

<p>Benerorth, you wrote: “…  but a more practical one …”</p>

<p>Is OO really “more practical” just in a lisp-environment??</p>

<p>We shouldn’t forget the different developing-conditions for those two concepts:</p>

<p>OO is for big companies with divisions of programmers: Nobody knows the real world of the neighbor, so alls is managed “encapsulated”.</p>

<p>But pil??  I have no need, to “oo-encapsulate” myself, if I have to write the whole code by myself (or 2-3 friends) anyhow!  And the OO-concept has a lot of pitfalls! I mean: “Who believes, he can write a mirror of reality by OO-concept hasn’t tryed it in real!” ;-)</p>

<p>And – please let me say this for the end:</p>

<p>I see the future of pil not only in the (only currend!) commercial world, in which you live,</p>

<p>but I see the future of pil (because of his lankines!) in the world of centuries of coming “lonely-small-peoples-programmers” in all small (like pil
;-) ) angles of the world, which dont need hacking software for smart-bombs, always fat governments and shifty spy-projects, but writing code (for example) for small medical solutions for areas, where are not doctors and medical help there, and the small people have to try to help themselves – computer-assisted! (yachties, islanders, peoples without acces to the oh so very “social” systems, peoples after a war (!)  … etc.)</p>

<p>@beneroth:
You wrote: “Not much beginner hand-holding, true – but then, picolisp is made for programmers who want to be able to fully understand (grok) and control their software, so people who want much hand-holding are most likely
anyway not a overly good fit.”</p>

<p>Isn’t it an logical inconsistency (and a joke for experts), if there is an ostensibly “simple” language, but not simple enough as an entry for beginners?</p>

<p>Are beginners always idiots, which have no interest to understand, what they’re write?  Which shouöd stay on this level their whole life? Do you belive, C, C++ or Java would be better for beginners?  My belive is: There is no better language than a slim lisp-dialect for the entrance into the programming-world – and I belive: This could be pil in the future!  (Unfortunately still not in the present – there is f.e. naturally elisp(!) and racket, which is a dead-end-street in my eyes :-( , because pil is faster and
slimmer, but racket is more oblinging for small peoples (by
license-possibilities already (! commercial use possible(!)) (because: closed source possible, if I understand right – ideal for kitchen-programmers, which dont want hack for companies, but for their poor neighbors allover the world – for 5 dollars per deal!) for small developers, but(!) free ) and the inviting pedagogic concept!))</p>

<p>Is pil only written as a finger exercise for experts, which anyway have down 10 or 15 languages already?
Which of them would spend time for pil?
See you really the real (real huge!) chances of pil?</p>

<ol>
<li>We need hardware and programming-languages for selfhelp of the masses of small peoples, not only for the commercial excesses of self-proclaimed IT-“experts” in their ivory tower! But not only pil will be measured by this need …</li>
</ol>
