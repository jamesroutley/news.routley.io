    <h1>Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards">hashcards</a> is a local-first <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> app, along the lines of
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a>. Like Anki, it uses <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a>, the most advanced scheduling
algorithm yet, to schedule reviews.</p>

<p>The thing that makes hashcards unique: it doesn’t use a database. Rather, your
flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca&#39;s] area.

C: Speech is [understood] in [Wernicke&#39;s] area.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with
lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze
deletion</a> flashcards. Then, to study, you run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ hashcards drill &lt;path to the cards directory&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This opens a web interface on <code>localhost:8000</code>, where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.</p>

<p>This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards
with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repo,
track its changes, share it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with others (<a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards">as I have</a>). You can
use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a
CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your
collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig
into the internals of some app’s database.</p>

<p>Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with
both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is
very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as
an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files
in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.</p>

<p>The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I
landed on the design decisions for hashcards.</p>



<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around
forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a> for
scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are
fun to look at. And the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> feature is really good: it lets you
generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.</p>

<p>The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This
manifests in various ways.</p>

<p>First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this
diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating
process.</p>

<p>Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you
start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before
you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather,
you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I
would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a
hack.</p>

<p>And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the
keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation
more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic
things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html">TeX math</a>”.</p>

<p>Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the <em>option</em> to use
them is nice, but the experience of <em>actually</em> using most plugins is bad. The
whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature
is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.</p>



<p><a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a> feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the
interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of
WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.</p>

<p>There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write
flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can
write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Speech is [produced] in [Broca&#39;s] area.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The equivalent in Mochi is this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca&#39;s}} area.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters
longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words
from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is
frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge
gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as
possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note
types</a>. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with
fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate
flashcards asking questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the atomic number of [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has atomic number [number]?</li>
  <li>What is the symbol for [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has symbol [symbol]?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work,
more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/#templates">templates</a>, but
these are not as powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until <a href="https://x.com/MochiCardsApp/status/1924692507570667630">very
recently</a>, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by
Mochi was even simpler than <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>. It was based on <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/faq/#which-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-mochi-use">multipliers</a>:
remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number &gt;1, forgetting a card
multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the
algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR
app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely
unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced
possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for
the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user
just reaps the benefits.</p>

<p>Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>/FSRS, but my subjective
experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and
falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card
has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the
interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost
knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by
default: 0.5) down to <em>thirty days</em>. What’s the use? If I forgot something after
sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.</p>

<p>You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know
this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t
want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire:
I want the scheduler to <em>just work</em>.</p>

<p>In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather
see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get
stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system
too burdensome will hurt retention.</p>

<p>In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works
marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm
that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards,
building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age
threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn
things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my
reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they
added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.</p>

<p>Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is
simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options
for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by
different magnitudes.</p>



<p>What do I want from a spaced repetition system?</p>

<p>The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the
biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am
very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end),
it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest
bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.</p>

<p>The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write
more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in
different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same
information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape
of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges
connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.</p>

<p>And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more
solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal
flashcard is too effortful.</p>

<p>If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer
cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept
you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which
are lost.</p>

<p>So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle
behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use
square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without
pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not
two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating
flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like
so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line
flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class
citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily
visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I
spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> about what the optimal
format should be.</p>

<p>Another source of friction is not creating the cards but <em>editing</em> them. The
central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often
textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology,
and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real
ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old
flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the
undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the
graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.</p>

<p>For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the
textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the
flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each
chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.</p>

<p>Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update
them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In
hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below
a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make
the edits in place.</p>

<p>But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a
“normal” app with a database?</p>

<p>The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as
plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long
time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing
existed. At some point I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/My_implementation_of_a_personal_mnemonic_medium">Andy Matuschak’s note</a> on his
implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with
prose notes. The notation is similar to mine: <code>Q</code> and <code>A</code> tags for
question-answer cards, and <code>{curly braces}</code> for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.</p>

<p>But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority
queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my
current hashcards workflow.</p>

<p>When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown
file. Usually, I used a shorthand like <code>[foo]</code> for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the <code>{{1::foo}}</code> notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.</p>

<p>And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already
writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had
<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">already implemented FSRS</a> out of curiosity. I was looking for a
personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very
neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.</p>

<p>It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of
card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file
browser.</li>
  <li>You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a
programming language, e.g. using <code>wc</code> to get the total number of words in the
collection, or using <code>awk</code> to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.</li>
  <li>You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than
the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit,
branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.</li>
  <li>You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of
themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And
why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there
is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or
enjoyable, or worth learning.</li>
  <li>You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign
language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie
the script, data source, and target together. I <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards/blob/87b082e4723e5b1b286e3bb5378316f464cfc28f/Makefile">do this</a> in my
personal deck. Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> don’t have to be built into hashcards,
rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly
frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which
provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it
useful.</p>
