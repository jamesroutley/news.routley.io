They are just one person in a sea of online hate content. But their explanation of their actions helps shed light on the motivations behind a wider online trend. </p><p>London is being used as the backdrop for inaccurate viral videos that reach enormous audiences around the world by playing into the worst stereotypes about the capital. </p><p><strong>See that story – and what Sadiq Khan has to say about our reporting – below. </strong></p><p><em>Read to the end for Taylor Swift’s visit to a forthcoming Croydon mixed-used redevelopment, the growing number of freemasons in the Met police, and what we missed about Jeffrey Epstein’s London.</em></p><p><strong>By Katherine Denkinson and Jim Waterson</strong></p><p>The man on the recording is baffled. He can’t understand how London Centric traced his anonymous hate-filled London TikTok account back to his employer by geolocating the wheelie bins in his videos.</p><p>“I thought no one’s gonna notice that,” he says. “Why would someone?”</p><p>Last summer, the man says, he found himself sitting in his car, analysing trends on TikTok. His day job was conducting viewings for an estate agency but he was trying to come up with an idea for a viral video account that could be run as a money-making side-hustle.</p><p>“I was thinking of unique videos I can do for people,” he says on the tape. </p><p>That’s when he had a brainwave: “Hate brings views.” </p><p>At that time protests outside asylum hotels were spreading across the country. The man says he noticed “far-right people” were among the most engaged on TikTok. They were easy to rile up: “They hate such videos of illegal migrants. I was like, why not?”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg" width="1236" height="1088" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1088,&#34;width&#34;:1236,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:452687,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/187071963?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption>Typical screengrabs of videos from the viral TikTok account.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The result was the account Reform_UK_2025, which co-opted the logo and name of Nigel Farage’s political movement without permission from the party.

He claimed they were a member of the public who had been looking to rent a flat from his company.</p><p>He now accepts that was a lie – and he knew it was a lie when he told us. </p><p>Now, Wasserstrum wants to set out a different version of events. He says the person behind the camera was really a “rogue” contractor he employed for two years as a viewings agent to show potential residents around the properties. Wasserstrum says he had no idea that his employee had been running the hate-filled TikTok account until we first approached his company in November. He says the employee was sacked soon afterwards and he regrets ever telling us that a client was responsible.</p><p>To back up his case, Wasserstrum provided London Centric with multiple lengthy audio recordings of what he says is him confronting the anonymous employee.

He even suggests that Wasserstrum should not be concerned by London Centric’s reporting because </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jimwaterson/video/7599207225571233046?lang=en" rel="">our own video</a><span> didn’t attract anything like as many viewers as his original hate-filled fake uploads. </span></p><p>“Their video didn’t even go that viral,” he offers by way of defence, arguing it could therefore be ignored. “They only got like 200,000 views on TikTok. It’s probably gonna die. It’s not gonna last long.”</p><p>The man tells Wasserstrum that he does not want to own up to running the account because “it’s going to make it much worse” and could “ruin [his] life”. In any case, he says, journalists would simply think he was a “paid actor”.</p><p>Wasserstrum can be heard on the recordings spelling out to the man how London Centric had approached the business. “They came to the office... they had every single fact you can think about,” he says. “They’ve cross referenced everything… We’ve had management companies calling us, councils calling us up, saying you’re putting our clients in danger.”</p><p>The man appears confused by the fuss his actions have caused. He gives the impression that he considered TikTok’s algorithm and the site’s content regulation policies to be the ultimate arbiter of whether a video crossed a line. </p><p>He insists the impact on tenants whose faces are visible in some of the videos was limited because they “didn’t get a lot of views” compared to his other content.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg" width="494" height="229" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:229,&#34;width&#34;:494,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:10844,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/187071963?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>A comment left by the account creator on one of his videos.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“It wasn’t racist,” the man says of his account.

We recognise the very real threat that these videos posed to the individuals filmed and to whom false views were attributed. We have reported the matter to the police.</p><p>“We conducted a thorough investigation as soon as the matter was brought to our attention. We established that the videos were created by a third-party contractor who acted without the authority, knowledge, or consent of the company. We severed all ties with the contractor immediately. We are appalled by his actions and condemn them in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>“We are committed to acting transparently and rebuilding trust with our partners and the communities we serve. We are fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and to assist with any investigation.”</p><p>Despite fostering online hatred, the man recorded by Wasserstrum insists he doesn’t personally share the views expressed on his TikTok account. Instead, he suggests his fake anti-migrant house tour videos were just a way to game the algorithm, build an audience, and hopefully make money.</p><p>”I didn’t do anything because of hate,” he says on the tape. “I didn’t care.
