    <h1>Eggs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K332YM3GDGR9.jpg"><img src="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K332YM3GDGR9.jpg?w=1024" alt="eggs"/></a></p>
<p>Team, a few weeks ago, I decided to stop eating eggs for breakfast. There&#39;s two main reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Price. A dozen large eggs is currently running around $10 here.</li>
<li>Fear. Bird Flu is kinda freaking me out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Historically, my breakfast for the last five or so years has been two eggs, and sometimes some toast, prepared in basically any way. I&#39;ve gone through omelet phases. Hard boiled. Fried. Scrambled. With hot sauce. With Avocado. With Spam. With all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>That means I&#39;m buying and consuming one carton of eggs a week at least. Money is a little tight, so while ~$520 a year isn&#39;t oppressive, it isn&#39;t nothing.</p>
<p>As for bird flu, I don&#39;t know if I am being irrational or not here. But podcast episodes like <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1235173135">NPR Up First March 1st</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1263339284">Why scientists&#39; fears about bird flu are intensifying</a> and articles like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296672/cdc-bird-flu-study-mmwr-veterinarians">CDC releases data signaling bird flu spread undetected in cows and people</a> have got me concerned.</p>
<p>So given all of that, I decided to stop eating eggs for breakfast.</p>
<p>I first tried going back to my youth and having cereal for breakfast. This did not work well. A bowl of honey nut cherries in oat milk is delicious, but with a cup of coffee, I found myself running out of energy quickly, and much more irritable than normal.</p>
<p>So! I reached out to the internet. I asked four communities that I feel close to and posted some variation of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi friends, I need some breakfast recommendations. With bird flu in the US, I&#39;m going to change up my morning routine of two eggs, toast and coffee.</p>
<p>Suggestions for other protein sources for breakfast? I can&#39;t have peanuts and I am lactose intolerant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The communities I asked are <a href="https://merveilles.town/@icco/114098901204873621">Merveilles.town</a>, <a href="https://gunksgamingguild.com/">Gunks Gaming Guild Discord</a>, The Waystone Discord and Time Owls Discord.</p>
<p>Some of the responses I got (edited for clarity) included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein powder</li>
<li>Some kind of grain (cereal, toast, bagel etc) and then just nomming on a piece of corned beef or sliced pork belly</li>
<li>Breakfast Sausages</li>
<li>Protein Muffins</li>
<li>Trader Joes Protein Pancakes</li>
<li>a hummus wrap with vegan protein crumbles and veggies</li>
<li>Locally produced eggs are less likely to be contaminated</li>
<li><a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/sausage/plant-based-impossible-savory-sausage-patties">Impossible breakfast sausages</a> in a sandwich</li>
<li>Smoked salmon or other fish paired with capers and other pickled items. Can do them with sliced cucumber and a bit of hummus</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ju.st/">Just Egg</a></li>
<li>Sandwich with sliced firm tofu and coleslaw or fresh cabbage. salt/pepper/onions/hot sauce to taste</li>
<li>Oats or granola with modifiers (nuts / nut butters, chia / hemp / sunflower seeds, yogurt, fruit / berries, syrup, chocolate chips, spices...)</li>
<li>Good bread, toasted, and spread with plain yogurt, and a salty/savory topper</li>
<li>Oatmeal porridge with fresh berries or jam and an apple</li>
<li>Tofu scramble (use a pinch of Kala Namak, black salt), nut butter, hummus or any other bean spread</li>
<li>A bagel with onion and chive cream cheese + bacon</li>
<li>Cottage cheese with fruit and a slight drizzle of honey</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all fantastic suggestions, and made me a bit excited to experiment.</p>
<p>I made a trip to <a href="https://adamsfarms.com/">Adams</a> which is our local green grocer. Not as cheap as other grocery stores in the area, but have the best produce by far.</p>
<p>My goal was to put together a list of things that would be close to or cheaper than eggs, taste good, and allow for experimenting. I bought two large containers of hummus (each about $4), sprouts ($2), radishes ($1), a pound of raw breakfast sausage ($3), good sourdough sliced loaf ($6). I tried to find good egg substitute, tofu and vegan breakfast meats, but all were either too expensive or sold out (also tried Target a few days later and had same experience, need to go to another grocery store and/or Walmart and try again).</p>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<p><a href="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K332ZYHMDGME.jpg"><img src="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K332ZYHMDGME.jpg?w=500" alt="Grid item 1" width="500"/></a><a href="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K33302WWDGY2.jpg"><img src="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0K33302WWDGY2.jpg?w=500" alt="Grid item 2" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>In the first photo I have radishes, sprouts and hummus on toasted sourdough. In the second, sprouts and hummus on toasted sourdough with a side of breakfast sausage. To save more money, I&#39;ll definitely need to switch to making my own hummus. I also still want to try the fake egg things. But so far, this was delicious.</p>
<p>Let me know about your breakfast habits and if you have any tips on egg replacements.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
