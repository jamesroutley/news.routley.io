The company has allegedly been using large amounts of user data - including geolocations - in <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/targeted-marketing">targeted advertising campaigns</a>. Consequently, Datatilsynet has banned such activities within Norwegian borders.</p><p>This is no small thing, with the company collecting data on what people post or comment, the unencrypted messages sent and received, hashtag usage and so forth. And when brought together, this information can be used to reveal incredibly personal information about users, from musical tastes and menstrual cycles to addictions and wider health issues.</p></div></div></div><div id="c97248"><div id="growing-concerns-about-meta’s-privacy-and-security-measures"><div><div><div><div><div><figure><picture><source data-variant="default" data-maxwidth="1100" media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_5db9e0790e.jpg 1x"/><source data-variant="large" data-maxwidth="920" media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_fcf3d9b1d0.jpg 1x"/><source data-variant="medium" data-maxwidth="680" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_4e5a47d762.jpg 1x"/><source data-variant="small" data-maxwidth="500" media="(min-width: 576px)" srcset="/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_59bc8d6803.jpg 1x"/><source data-variant="extrasmall" data-maxwidth="374" srcset="/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_86b7d8b77c.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.twipla.com/fileadmin/_processed_/c/d/csm_meta_data_privacy_problems_oslo_03799660fd.jpg" width="1100" height="1100" alt=""/></picture><figcaption>The sun&#39;s setting on Meta&#39;s data privacy transgressions in Norway and beyond</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>By acting upon its previous threats, Datatilsynet made clear its dissatisfaction with the solutions that Meta proposed since July. </p><p>Their plan was to request EU customers for consent for advertisement targeting, with data captured from their in-platform behavior. Datatilsynet felt this insufficient, and that Meta should instead halt any data processing until an effective consent mechanism is activated. </p><p>Neither Facebook nor Instagram is banned in Norway. But the sentence underlines Datatilsynet efforts to persuade Meta to bring its data practices in line with EU standards. Norway’s DPA believes that Meta is brazenly exploiting its users by harvesting <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/what-constitutes-personal-data-gdpr">personal data</a> excessively, and without consideration - infringing on what is a human right under both the European Union and United Nations.</p><p>The challenges Meta faces in Norway are not isolated. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/Data-Protection-Commission-announces-conclusion-of-inquiry-into-Meta-Ireland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Irish Data Protection Commissioner</a>, which acts as Meta&#39;s lead EU regulator, called on the company to re-evaluate the legal foundations of its ad-targeting processes. The directive stemmed from allegations that Meta had made adjustments to its algorithms. Still, subsequent investigations by European courts determined that these changes didn&#39;t meet the stringent standards of European privacy regulations.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="c97249"><div id=""><div><p>The crusade against Meta’s data practices has only intensified, with the decision in Norway seen by European regulators as the opportunity it is to get the company singing from their hymn sheet.</p><p>And while Norway isn’t a de facto member of the EU, its membership of the Single Market makes it EU-adjacent enough to sense that this ruling will be a common precedent across Europe. Put another way, it’s like this Scandinavian hammer blow to Meta will cause a ripple effect across Europe. For if Datatilsynet&#39;s decision is endorsed by the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">European Data Protection Board</a>, the fines imposed on Meta could become permanent, broadening their territorial scope to encompass the entirety of Europe.</p><p>As of now, the daily fines against Meta are scheduled to continue until November 3. With the stakes set high, and with increasing scrutiny from European nations, it remains to be seen how Meta will navigate this complex regulatory landscape.</p></div></div></div><div id="c97250"><div id=""><div><p>This action against Meta is further evidence that European DPAs are finally learning how to effectively enforce GDPR standards, and it follows soon after <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/swedish-regulator-cracks-down-on-google-analytics-issues-1m-in-privacy-fines">similar legal action in Sweden against Google Analytics</a>. It’s also clear from recent events in Sweden that all business types are liable for the misuse of EU citizen data, and all signs point to fines and other penalties increasing in the future.</p><p>Businesses that want to stay compliant should move away from cookies and other digital tech that collects personal user data. </p><p>However, the arrival of privacy-first internet technologies like <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/why-us/why-you-should-use-twipla">TWIPLA</a> means that they can still collect the data they need to drive business growth without infringing on the security of internet users or breaking data privacy requirements. <a href="https://app.visitor-analytics.io/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sign up today</a>, and start migrating your digital technologies away from those that collect personal data.</p></div></div></div><a href="https://app.visitor-analytics.io/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><div><div><div><h2>Get Started for Free</h2><p>Gain World-Class Insights &amp; Offer Innovative Privacy &amp; Security</p></div><p><img src="https://www.twipla.com/fileadmin/visitor-analytics/theme/images/twipla/mac-laptop.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"/></p></div></div></a></div></div><div><div><div><p><span><img height="20" width="26" src="https://www.twipla.com/fileadmin/visitor-analytics/theme/newvisa/_mail-insigh.svg" alt="_mail-insigh.svg"/></span></p><h4>Insights to Your Inbox</h4></div><p>Receive a monthly summary of website intelligence news, advice, and updates.
