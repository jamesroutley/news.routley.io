      <p>It turns out that you can’t trust any USB type A power adapter to be within spec.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://www.catit.com/products/drinking-fountains/flower-fountain/">Catit Flower Fountain</a>
for my two adorable cats. The idea of a water fountain for cats may sound odd,
but having one really helps with cats staying hydrated and that alone avoids all
sorts of health issues.</p>
<p>At one point I wanted to see if I could create a sort of a DIY UPS for the
water fountain. It would be quite bad if I was at work and a power outage results
in cats not being able to drink water (they don’t really care for normal water
bowls after getting the fountain). I had some battery banks available for testing,
and I noticed that the pump for the water fountain is powered over a USB type A cable.</p>
<p>Should be easy, right?</p>
<p>Apparently not.</p>
<p>I tried multiple different power banks between the water fountain and the
USB power adapter that came with it, and all of them would work for a bit
and turn off after some time. I didn’t think much of it back then, but I did
notice that two of the power banks I used started glitching out during
normal use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Months later, I attached an IKEA power strip to the side of my work desk
to make charging various things easier. It also has two USB type A ports and the
water fountain was near the desk temporarily, so I plugged it in there. It worked,
but I noticed that the water fountain was quieter now, the “hum” that it makes
was almost gone. That made me curious, so I used the original adapter again
and the “hum” was there again.</p>
<p>I took a look at the original power adapter specs to see if there’s a difference
in the amount of current that these two different USB power sources provide.
What I discovered instead was that the power adapter that comes with the fountain
outputs a solid <em><strong>7.5V</strong></em>. USB type A ports typically provide about 5V, with a maximum
of 5.25V from my observations in the real world.</p>

<p>7.5V over USB type A is <em>probably</em> not safe with other devices, especially since a normal person
only sees a USB port on the adapter and thinks that it is perfectly safe to use
it to charge their phone or other devices. Yes, properly implemented USB type <em><strong>C</strong></em>
ports can negotiate all sorts of voltages, but this is not one of them.</p>
<p>Probably explains why my power banks are acting odd now and glitching out.</p>
<p>This is why I have trust issues.</p>
