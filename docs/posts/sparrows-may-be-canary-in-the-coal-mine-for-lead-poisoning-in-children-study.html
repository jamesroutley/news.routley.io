They then used the new data with the model to predict Mount Isa children&#39;s blood lead levels, and compared those results with actual blood tests.</p><p>&#34;We perfectly predicted the likely incidence of lead poisoning in kids in the town, sector by sector,&#34; Professor Griffith said.</p><p>&#34;People have always looked at urban animals and said they might be able to tell us something about exposures, but this was the best demonstration that shows it actually works extremely well, and means that there&#39;s a good way of potentially monitoring [health] risks to people.&#34;</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Lead poisoning in kids &#39;not improving fast enough&#39;</h2><p>Children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead, which can severely affect their mental and physical development.</p><p>A child with lead poisoning will often show <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/lead-poisoning-in-children" data-component="Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no initial signs or symptoms</a>, but those with higher levels may experience behaviour and learning problems, abdominal pains or anaemia.</p><p>At very high levels, lead can also cause confusion, seizures, coma and death.</p><p>In Broken Hill, <a href="https://leadsmart.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Broken-Hill-Lead-Program-Annual-Report-2022.pdf" data-component="Link">almost 40 per cent of children aged 1 to 5 years</a> recorded blood lead levels above the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/reports/managing-individual-exposure-lead.pdf" data-component="Link">national intervention guideline</a>, which is the point at which a lead exposure source should be investigated and reduced.</p><p>Professor Griffith said the children&#39;s lead levels have improved over the past few decades due to targeted environmental interventions, &#34;but it&#39;s not improving fast enough because we want those kids to have zero.</p><p>&#34;Every month, kids are still exceeding the safe limit, and the safe limit is zero.
