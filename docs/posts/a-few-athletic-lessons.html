<p data-block-key="sy724">I have learned or re-learned a smattering of lessons in the last few months, concerning athletic activities and inhabiting my body in general.</p><p data-block-key="38j9q">Sometimes, when I do crunches or sit-ups or similar abdominal exercises, my neck tenses up and gets stiff. I mentioned this to the trainer who leads the <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/three-ways-i-exercise-in-my-apartment/">weekly videocall strength training class I take</a>. He suggested two tips. One: imagine myself leading from my sternum, not my head. Two (and he prefaced this tip with &#34;this one is weird&#34;): put the tip of my tongue between my teeth. Basically, it&#39;s a feedback mechanism. The jaw and neck tend to tense up together. So if I feel my teeth getting a bit bitey on my tongue, that&#39;s a reminder to loosen that up, which generally also relaxes the neck. I tried both of these and they definitely worked for me!</p><p data-block-key="67bba">I am incrementally getting stronger and otherwise fitter. Consistent guided strength exercise works! I can lift heavier things, spend longer in a plank pose, and bike better and longer and harder.</p><p data-block-key="fjfnd">Stairs are inherently hard, especially while wearing an N95 mask. There&#39;s usually no need to rush, and if I&#39;m going up several flights, it&#39;s okay that I need a little time at the end to gather my breath.</p><p data-block-key="6ik8n">I got to try outdoor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_rope_climbing">top rope rock climbing</a> for the first time last year, and then got to do some outdoor gym bouldering. I had a great time, and one particularly cool aspect was the puzzley, problem-solving aspect of it. I&#39;ve heard that from a lot of rock climbers before, that they liked learning how to solve a climbing problem. But until I got into it, I didn&#39;t internalize a crucial part of the whole hobby: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"><i>the validity of route ratings or &#34;grades&#34;</i></a>. At climbing gyms and outdoors, local consensus arrives at a numerical score for how difficult it is to ascend a particular route, and I can feel some reasonable assurance that there is a path for a novice like me to climb a 5.1 or a 5.2. The problem is soluble, though it offers no visible pointers on <i>how</i> to solve it. This feels like a rare, interesting experience in my life right now. I have problems that I know are soluble and where I&#39;m fairly sure I know the steps, and problems that don&#39;t have guarantees of being soluble at all.</p><p data-block-key="femn5">Puzzles as a social hobby often don&#39;t work for me, but rock climbing seems to be an exception. I am dubious about computer games, or most competitive board games, or puzzles within scavenger hunts, where I&#39;m asked to put my trust in the creators that they&#39;ve made a fun pathway, yet it might be buggy in some hidden way that will make it unplayable/unwinnable -- and I won&#39;t find out for a while. It&#39;s hard for me to have fun like that. In contrast, rock climbing on well-known graded routes feels more like chess: thoroughly debugged through a zillion people&#39;s experiences, and thus more emotionally safe, and thus fun-able.</p><p data-block-key="cjjhs">My function and my mood improve significantly when I attend to adequate rest, hydration, food intake, protein intake and electrolytes intake in particular, and intentional movement. Adequate hydration is much more than I was used to, especially in winter, and drinking an entire liter of cold herbal tisane within an hour upon waking up is a marvelous pick-me-up. (And I&#39;m now even more critical of my mother&#39;s habit, back when I was a child, of criticizing me at dinnertime for drinking too much water.)</p><p data-block-key="ajqg">A day with a bike ride in it has a kind of floor to it; it&#39;s very hard for a day with a bike ride to feel particularly bad, all in all.</p><p data-block-key="6rdqr">If I&#39;m a bit upset, I can work out about it, and it usually helps. Getting sweaty is helpful in completing a stress response cycle (per Emily Nagoski).</p><p data-block-key="cmgam">I aspire to be a jock, in the sense that I aspire to regularly rejoice in intentional movement, improve my physical capabilities, and bring <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2012/getting-a-habit-into-my-muscle-memory/">lessons</a> from that fitness practice into other parts of my life. And I figure I&#39;ll be living in this thing till the end of the line and I may as well make friends.</p>
