<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/">Tesla is the subject of a new investigation</a> by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration due to the company&#39;s cars&#39; propensity to inappropriately activate their emergency braking function. This week, it&#39;s Honda&#39;s turn in the spotlight.</p>
<p>The NHTSA <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INOA-PE22003-5540.PDF">opened a preliminary investigation into the problem on February 21</a> after receiving 278 complaints about Hondas that suddenly decelerated despite nothing in their path.</p>
<p>The problem affects approximately 1.7 million cars in total, split between model year 2017-2019 CR-V crossovers and 2018-2019 Accord sedans. (It&#39;s worth noting that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/the-2018-honda-accord-proves-theres-still-life-in-the-family-sedan/">when we reviewed the 2018 Honda Accord</a>, we specifically called out the sensitivity of its forward-collision warning system, although we did not experience any automatic emergency brake activations.)</p>
<p>However, of the 278 complaints, the NHTSA says that only six of them alleged collisions with minor injuries, and no severe incidents have been reported.</p>
