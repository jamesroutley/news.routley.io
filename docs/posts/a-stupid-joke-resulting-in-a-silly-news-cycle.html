    <h1>A stupid joke resulting in a silly news cycle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    
    <p>
      I was just reminded of an event I inadvertently caused. I found some
      screenshots I took of a few websites. The websites all touched on a joke I
      made. I wrote it on a subreddit dedicated to finding comedy in programming
      topics: /r/ProgrammerHumor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was suprised to find that the joke was taken out of context from
      /r/ProgrammerHumor and used as a real explanation to a real problem. This
      is a story of how misinformation can spread.

    <h2>background</h2>
    <p>
      The video game
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a>
      was released in 2019 to a very hyped world. Expectations were not managed.
      The game made a lot of money in presales and the world hated the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were having a lot of fun ridiculing the game. That typical maniacal
      frenzy was formed. Strangers on the internet were bonding while sharpening
      their pitchforks. Of course, the news was there to document the carnage
      and make a buck or two.
    </p>
    <p>Then... a wild software bug appeared in the midst of the frenzy.</p>

    <h2>my headspace</h2>
    <p>
      I was very early in my professional software development career at the
      time. A lot of the concepts that folks with a computer science degree take
      for granted seemed totally magical to me. They still do.
    </p>
    <p>
      At work, we needed to save some files uploaded by the user of our
      websites. All the files went into a big folder. Some errors were occurring
      if the user uploaded a file with the same name as a previously uploaded
      file. To fix this, we saved the files with a filename as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">random UUID</a>
      and kept track of the original filename in our database.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worked, but it didn&#39;t <em>really</em> fix the problem. It just made
      the problem incredibly improbable. The odds of two UUIDs being generated
      with the same values on the same system is very low. How low? Well, say
      you had a bunch of kindergartners at school. The first thing they do when
      they get to school is randomly put their backpacks into a tray in a cubby.
      They can&#39;t really see the cubby because they&#39;re too short. They&#39;re too
      young to remember a cubby assignment. How many trays does your cubby need
      to prevent two kindergartners from accidentally colliding their backpacks?
      How about a 340,<wbr/>282,<wbr/>366,<wbr/>920,<wbr/>938,<wbr/>463,<wbr/>463,<wbr/>374,<wbr/>607,<wbr/>431,<wbr/>768,<wbr/>211,<wbr/>456-tray
      capacity cubby? That oughta do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole lot of <em>very</em> important software in the world is built on
      this concept of improbability. We use this binary explosion of space all
      the time knowing that the odds of collision are minuscule. Some systems
      most probably won&#39;t have a collision happen even if they ran from now
      until the heat death of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except it could still happen. You usually get some hand-waiving from
      software engineers when you say this, but... collisions could still
      happen.
      <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">Google found one</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find the absurdity of this concept intrinsically hilarious. This was all
      very fresh on my mind when I saw that Reddit post or /r/ProgrammerHumor
      titled:
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/dy0p86">How do you even begin to debug something like this</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>the joke</h2>
    <p>
      I was still waking up and half asleep. I was brain dead and taking a dump.
      This is the settings in which all Reddit comments are created. So, I made
      my own comment.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Pokémon sends a network discovery packet to each device on port
        26037. Roku also listen on that port for LAN based updates so that
        multiple devices on the same network can update each other. It was an
        obvious decision. Saved Roku around a quarter million dollars in CDN
        traffic costs. Roku is popular in the commercial space where it&#39;s often
        used as a media source to control sometimes 100s of TVs on the same
        network. It just so happens that Pokémon&#39;s network discovery packet
        shares the exact same bytes as Roku&#39;s signed bytecode to reboot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The odds are astronomically low. We could have wound up with an alien
        planet full of Justin Timberlake clones, but the universe decided this
        was our colossal fluke.

    <p>
      Using the term &#34;joke&#34; is perhaps a bit aggrandizing. I&#39;d say it was more
      of a slightly funny hypothetical. I thought it would be comical if our
      universe&#39;s moment of breaking wound up being &#34;used&#34; on a Pokémon
      game. I empathized with the poor developers at Roku and Nintendo trying to
      figure it out.
    </p>
    <h2>internet response</h2>
    <p>
      I forgot about it. I was surprised when I looked at it a week or so later.
      People took the joke as truth. There was some discussion on
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21566921">Hacker News</a>
      trying to make sense of it, but mainly they seemed to just be annoyed by
      it.
      <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970743/roku-pokemon-sword-and-shield-crashing-boot-loop-fix">The Verge</a>
      mentioned it as theory, but the internet game-of-telephone caused their
      sister-site
      <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970743/roku-pokemon-sword-and-shield-crashing-boot-loop-fix">Polygon</a>
      to use wording that seemed to state it as fact. There are a few other
      sources that touched on it;
      <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bizarre-pokemon-sword-and-shieldroku-issue-has-bee/1100-6471534/">GameSpot</a>
      came up on a search for &#34;port 26037&#34;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roku seemed to have pushed out a fix for the real issue pretty quickly.
      Most importantly, the story seemed to have died within 24 hours of it
      starting. It was old news by the time I noticed. Everyone was on to some
      other aspect of the Pokémon game they could ceremoniously foam at the
      mouth over. So I just sort of slinked away.

    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This rambling has no point. It&#39;s not an apology. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done
      anything wrong. If someone reports about the most improbable thing in the
      universe happening, then you ought to check on sources. Maybe first see if
      it is written in a subreddit where jokes are written. It&#39;s not meant to
      bash news outlets over journalistic integrity. The internet is a difficult
      thing to document. It&#39;s not meant to justify my joke. If you don&#39;t think
      it was funny... OK. Depending on the day I&#39;m sure I&#39;d agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there.&#34; I guess I
      just wanted to share my observations on it. I found it fascinating. It
      makes me think of the fragility of information: what we think we know and
      how we got started thinking we know someting. It all feels a bit fickle.
      Like systems built upon a foundation of randomness.
