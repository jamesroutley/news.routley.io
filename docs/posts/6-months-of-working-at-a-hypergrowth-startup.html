<p>I joined Scale AI late last summer. Itâ€™s been a crazy experience â€” Scale is growing incredibly fast right now, hitting a valuation of over <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/13/scale-ai-valuation-new-funding-fundraising-data-labeling-company-startups-vc/">$7 billion</a> last year and recently signing a <a href="https://daystech.org/scale-ai-awarded-250m-ai-contract-by-department-of-defense/">$250 million</a> contract with the DoD. Personally, Iâ€™ve made over 100 PRs and conducted about 40 interviews already! Itâ€™s also by far the largest company Iâ€™ve worked for. Here are some lessons Iâ€™ve learned:</p>



<p><strong>Working in a New Codebase</strong></p>



<ul><li>Itâ€™s often faster to check directly if something works than to prove it in your head</li><li>Finding the answer is less important than learning how to solve that category of problem</li><li>Global searches for strings/regular expressions are often the best way to gain context</li><li>You can configure your IDE to ignore log/build/dependency directoriesÂ </li><li>Turn on Git Blame so you can track down the PR that was responsible for a given line of code</li><li>You will need some of the (slightly) fancier features of Git, eg workflows based on git rebase and stacking branches</li><li>Strongly typed code is nice. Pay it forward</li><li>Your product probably has very informative logs/instrumentation if you know where to look</li><li>Some things youâ€™re allowed to do when debugging:<ul><li>Checkout an older version of the codebase</li><li>Checkout the latest version of the codebase</li><li>Comment out sections of code that are distracting or throwing errors</li><li>Use the debugger</li><li>Use specialized debuggers (eg React dev tools, Node.js debugger)</li><li>Refresh the page as many times as you like</li><li>Run as a different user/group/role</li><li>Print out the inputs to your function</li><li>Inspect network traffic</li></ul></li><li>Sometimes you just need to read the whole schema/file/README to figure out how a system works</li><li>You are being paid, in part, for your capacity to be frustrated and stressed for hours at a time</li><li>Ask lots of questions, preferably in public forums. Start learning strategies to resolve specific categories of questions on your own: eg, documentation X, slack channel Y, schema Z.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Working in a Big Organization</strong></p>



<p>(Size is relative; for me, 500 people is pretty darn big)</p>



<ul><li>Follow up, over and over again</li><li>Youâ€™ll forget to follow up, so make a system that includes reminders</li><li>Find ways to be engaged outside of your team, eg engineering help channels or volunteer programs</li><li>There are performance reviews now. Make sure that you get actionable feedback well before the review cycle starts</li><li>Learn whatâ€™s important to to your manager and department, and figure out how your role aligns with those goals</li><li>Take notes during the week about questions/concerns/problems you can share in a 1:1 with yourÂ  managerÂ </li><li>If working remote: turn on the camera during Zoom calls (I donâ€™t always do this but #goals :-))</li><li>Actively manage your calendar. Make sure you accept important events so other events donâ€™t get scheduled on top. Decline events if you can</li><li>If you have a personal or interpersonal problem that affects work, there should be at least one person (your manager, HR business partner, etc) that you can bring it to</li><li>If no one is talking in a meeting, speak up. If lots of people are talking, be quiet. Donâ€™t push meetings in tangents (that one is mostly for me :-))Â </li><li>When you build something new, make a short video to demo what you built and share it in your team channel and, if appropriate, with end users</li><li>Look for opportunities to present your work to larger groups of people within the org. Speaking/presenting is fun and a good skill to develop</li><li>Be very deliberate about replacing existing tools/workflows. Announce what youâ€™re changing before you change it, let people opt in before you force them to opt out, and wait a long time to completely remove the old way.</li><li>Measure everything and insist on metrics to validate non-trivial projects. Thereâ€™s too many initiatives to choose from otherwise, and the opportunity cost is enormous.Â </li><li>Documentation goes out of date extremely fast. Try to consolidate and keep the core docs in a trafficked location.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Hiring and Interviews</strong></p>



<ul><li>This is an incredibly tight market for engineering talent.Â </li><li>Itâ€™s important to make people feel at ease right away in an interview. Relax and show interest in them and their story</li><li>Youâ€™re only trying to answer one question: Would this person be a good addition to the team?</li><li>Remember to sell your company to the candidate too, since the good ones will have options. </li><li>Use interview questions that are programming-language agnosticÂ </li><li>Avoid miscommunication at all costs. You donâ€™t want a candidate to struggle because you were unclear. Ask candidates to walk through a simple example based on a sketch of their solution before they starting writing code.Â </li><li>Donâ€™t help candidates too quickly when they run into a concrete problem. Give them a chance to figure it out! This is a high-signal moment in the interview</li><li>Take notes throughout the interview stream-of-consciousness and edit them after youâ€™re done.</li><li>Simple questions are often better than complex questions because they leave less up to the skill of the interviewer</li></ul>



<p><strong>Code reviewsÂ </strong></p>



<ul><li>If you are an active reviewer, you will gain valuable context that will help you debug problems faster</li><li>If someone approves your PR it doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ve validated that your code works. You should find alternate ways to ensure this. For example:<ul><li>Write tests</li><li>Work with QA, if available</li><li>Partner with an end user to conduct acceptance testing</li></ul></li><li>There are many things a code review could cover. The fact that one of them is reviewed doesnâ€™t mean that the rest are okay:<ul><li>Code style</li><li>UX</li><li>Correctness</li><li>Performance</li><li>Security</li><li>Architecture</li><li>Consistency with similar features</li><li>Dependencies</li><li>Logging/observability</li></ul></li><li>Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t have a lot of context on a pull request. Try to contribute one useful thing. One of the best ways is to check it out locally and take the feature for a test run!</li><li>On finding reviewers for your code: Try to get at least one other engineer interested in your project so theyâ€™re motivated to give you feedback</li></ul>
