These include predictable low fees in a dedicated payments lane, stablecoin neutrality, a built-in stablecoin exchange, high throughput, low latency, private transactions, payment memos compatible with standards like ISO 20022, compliance hooks, and more.</p></div><div><h2><span>02 ::</span> Who can build on Tempo?</h2><p>Tempo is a neutral, permissionless blockchain open for anyone to build on.
