    <h1>Advancing finance with Claude Opus 4.6</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="a753a9ea-9716-f23f-a1a8-d6215be0d3a6" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="a753a9ea-9716-f23f-a1a8-d6215be0d3a6">Claude Opus 4.6</a> marks a step forward in AI for finance. It can be used to help professionals make decisions based on accurate information and clear analysis, and it produces deliverables with real polish. The model is substantially better than others in the market at financial reasoning, multitasking, and maintaining focus over longer multi-step tasks. </p><p>Alongside Claude Opus 4.6, we’re updating some of our existing products—and introducing a new one—to put these capabilities where analysts spend the majority of their time. <a href="https://claude.com/product/cowork" data-wf-native-id-path="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a1f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a1f">Cowork</a> now delivers more polished outputs, such as financial models and presentations, on the first pass. <a href="https://claude.com/claude-in-excel" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a22" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a22">Claude in Excel</a> is now better at handling long-running tasks, with Claude Opus 4.6 staying focused and accurate as financial models become more complex. And we’re releasing <a href="https://claude.com/claude-in-powerpoint" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a25" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="ca8b9fe6-cfc2-caa4-f3d9-38aa00082a25">Claude in PowerPoint</a> as a research preview in beta for natively building and iterating on decks and presentations.</p><p>Our internal Real-World Finance evaluation measures Claude’s performance on ~50 investment and financial analysis use cases spanning spreadsheets, slide decks, and word document generation and review. These are tasks commonly performed by analysts across investment banking, private equity, public investing, and corporate finance. Claude Opus 4.6 improves by over 23 percentage points on Claude Sonnet 4.5, our state-of-the-art model just a few months ago.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6984b66b95b2a1a24ab26f64_Opus-4-6-Chart-Real-world-finance-no-subtext%402x%20(1).png" loading="lazy"/></p><figcaption><em>This eval tests a combination of code execution and tool use agentic harnesses, and was scored based on a combination of rubrics and preferences that gauge finance domain knowledge, task completeness and accuracy, and presentation quality.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Together, these updates make Claude a much stronger partner for those across financial services and corporate finance.</p><div><p>

</p></div><h2>Research, analyze, create</h2><p>Financial professionals use AI to research effectively across multiple data sources, support financial analyses, and create deliverables that their teams and customers can act on. Claude Opus 4.6 is best in class across all three dimensions.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6984ad0f7e9fc5edd808036e_Opus_4-6_Finance-Tasks-Benchmark.png" loading="lazy"/></p></figure><p>On research, Claude Opus 4.6 improves on both BrowseComp and DeepSearchQA, two benchmarks that test a model’s ability to extract specific information from large, unstructured data sources. In practice, this means that users can hand Claude a dense set of documents and receive a specific, focused answer, rather than a simple summary.</p><p>On analysis, Claude Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art at 60.7% (achieving a 5.47% improvement from Opus 4.5) on <a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/finance_agent" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="55fd61c4-806a-ac0c-9e3d-349d7eb212eb" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="55fd61c4-806a-ac0c-9e3d-349d7eb212eb">Finance Agent</a>, an external benchmark from Vals AI that evaluates models on research of SEC filings of public companies. Opus 4.6 is also state-of-the-art on the <a href="https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/tax_eval_v2" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="55fd61c4-806a-ac0c-9e3d-349d7eb212ee" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="55fd61c4-806a-ac0c-9e3d-349d7eb212ee">TaxEval</a> by Vals AI at 76.0%. </p><p>On creation, we use GDPval-AA to measure Claude’s performance on complex knowledge work, in addition to our Real-World Finance evaluation. With Claude Opus 4.6, structured outputs like spreadsheets and presentations come out right more often on the first pass. The side-by-side outputs below show how output quality has improved from Claude Opus 4.5 to Opus 4.6. These are examples of Claude’s first-pass performance on a commercial due diligence task (evaluating a potential acquisition)—the kind of work that would typically take a senior analyst two to three weeks to complete.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6984ad5009743c8b1c1e8520_Opus-46-Blog-Comparison-Excel.png" loading="lazy"/></p></figure><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6984ad6c24663845c852c1cf_Opus-46-Blog-Comparison-PowerPoint.png" loading="lazy"/></p></figure><blockquote>“With Claude Opus 4.6, creating financial PowerPoints that used to take hours now takes minutes.

Claude is able to read, edit, and create new files directly in that folder. For finance teams, this means you can kick off several analyses at once, while steering Claude’s thought process as it creates each deliverable to meet your standard.</p><p>Cowork can also be customized <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-plugins" target="_blank" data-wf-native-id-path="18977ce7-d6eb-5321-97c4-31884aa409d2" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="18977ce7-d6eb-5321-97c4-31884aa409d2">with plugins</a>—bundles of skills (which specify how to complete a task) and connectors to data on other platforms.

It also now supports pivot table editing, chart modifications, conditional formatting, sorting and filtering, data validation, and finance-grade formatting. </p><p>Finally, we’ve added usability improvements, including auto-compaction for long conversations and drag-and-drop multi-file support. This means you’ll need to do much less copying and pasting between tabs.
