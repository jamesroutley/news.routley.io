    <p>In 2021, I managed to give <a href="https://vishnubharathi.codes/blog/my-first-ever-conference-talk/">my first-ever conference talk</a>. In 2022, I managed to pull off my second conference talk.</p>
<p>I had the same level of excitement this time too! I feel pretty good about how it turned out to be!</p>
<p>It was a CI/CD conference hosted by buildkite: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buildkite.com/unblock">https://buildkite.com/unblock</a></p>
<p>I am going to copy paste my talk abstract here (to see if I can get you intrigued :D)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A World Tour of Dynamic Pipelines</p>
<p>This is the story of how the engineering team at Hasura burned down 2000 lines of YAML with the help of dynamic pipelines. The complexity of the CI/CD configuration grew as the team grew, which led the team to rewrite their configuration in a statically-typed programming languageâ€“dynamically generating pipelines.</p>
<p>This talk is a practical view into Hasuraâ€™s current system and a documentary on the lessons and insights the team gained over the past year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that feels like something that you would spend 18 minutes and 45 seconds listening to, you are lucky.</p>
<p>Because my second-ever conference talk is available on YouTube!</p>
