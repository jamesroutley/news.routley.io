    <h1>How I Run Speech to Text on Fedora Linux for Free</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I switched to Fedora as my daily driver last year and generally have enjoyed it. I&#39;ve also been doing a lot of <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_stop-vibe-coding">vibe engineering</a> - using AI to speed up my dev workflows.</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_ai-engineering-best-practices">streamlined my vibe engineering workflows</a>, I&#39;ve found that dictation (speech to text) is useful for quickly providing a lot of context to AIs. AIs do better with more context so it&#39;s useful to have a quick way to do this and dictation is typically a LOT faster than typing - Fast typers can type 120 - 150 wpm while I&#39;m sitting around 100 and most below 60 while most people can speak 120-160 wpm easily with dictation.</p>
<p>Mac has pretty good dictation built in and Mac / Windows both have access to commercial solutions like Whisperflow but I haven&#39;t found any off the shelf software I was super happy with on Fedora.</p>
<p>So in this post I wanted to share my workaround so you can use it if you&#39;re in a similar position.</p>

<p>My solution is pretty dumb, requires an internet connection, and requires some copy pasting but it still saves me time when trying to context dump paragraphs for an AI.</p>
<p>My solution: Google Docs and their built-in dictation</p>
<p>Why this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well supported across OS and distros - Google Chrome is very well supported with active development and GDocs runs in the browser</li>
<li>Free - If there are limits to dictation, I haven&#39;t seen / hit them</li>
<li>Relatively fast</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires an internet connection (though most SOTA AIs also require this so don&#39;t mind too much)</li>
<li>Not the most accurate (but most AIs can figure out what you meant even with misspellings / grammar issues - and you can always review their plan / answer followups to make sure)</li>
<li>Still need to copy paste (but still saves time for large context dumps)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a bookmarked Google Doc called &#34;Speech to Text Doc&#34; that I use for all my adhoc speech to text. Here&#39;s what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code># Speech to Text doc

Goal: Provide a simple dumping ground for speech to text using GDocs. Helpful on systems that don’t have great integrated stuff.

To use: 

* Put cursor in playground area  
* Hit CTRL+SHIFT+S to start mic  
* Start talking  
* Cut and paste your words to wherever you need them

## Sandbox: (Cursor below here \- will be deleted later)

</code></pre>

<p>So that&#39;s how I&#39;m doing speech to text. I&#39;d love to have a reliable, local-first version that was fast, cheap, and could run anywhere with output appearing at my cursor but haven&#39;t found one yet.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not quite to the point where I&#39;m ready to build my own version as that seems like it will require a lot of learning ab different distros, AIs, and rendering systems but might end up being a good project for my time at <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_recurse-center-statement">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
