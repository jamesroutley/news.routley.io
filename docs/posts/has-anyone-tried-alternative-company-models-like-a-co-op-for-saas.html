    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone tried alternative company models (like a co-op) for SaaS?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Long story short, I&#39;m building a new product and will likely launch it as a yearly SaaS with a permissive license. I&#39;m later in my career and am mostly building it for fun, but I think it has potential to be a good, small business that I&#39;d have fun fiddling with for a  long time.</p><p>I went through and set up the usual LLC, but was curious about how I could set it up to be a member or worker-owned company. Has anyone done anything like that from the beginning? Should I just worry about this later?</p><p>With licensing, the typical model has been to make your core permissive, and keep the hosting / billing application private. Has anyone made even that part of their SaaS open? I know that would make is really easy to fork the business, but was thinking something like a time-gated Functional Source License (FSL) might work?</p><p>I&#39;m open to ideas. I don&#39;t see this discussed commonly on HN, so figured it was a good topic.</p></div></div></div>
