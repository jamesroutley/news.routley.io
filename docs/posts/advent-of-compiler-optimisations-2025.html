        <p>Today I’m announcing a project that’s been in the making for around a year. As my time off draws to a close, I’ve been working on an “Advent of” type project, to be released one a day from the 1st of December until the 25th.</p>
<p>This December will be the Advent of Compiler Optimisations: I’ll release one blog post and video each day, each detailing a fun and interesting C or C++ optimisation that your compiler can do. I’ll go into the details of when it applies, how to interpret the assembly, and perhaps as importantly, when it doesn’t apply.</p>
<p>I’ll be covering some very low-level, architecture-specific tricks as well as larger, more high-level optimisations. While I mostly cover x86-64, I do touch on 64-bit and 32-bit ARM as well.</p>
<p>You can follow along by watching the <a href="https://xania.org/AoCO2025">AoCO2025 tag</a> on this blog, subscribing to me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/mattgodbolt">YouTube</a>, or following the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2HVqYf7If8cY4wLk7JUQ2f0JXY_xMQm2&amp;si=rEu5UQ2EuNafCvii">YouTube playlist</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a colossal amount of work, but a lot of fun too. I hope you enjoy learning how amazing compilers are as much as I do!</p>
<p>See you on the first of December!</p>
