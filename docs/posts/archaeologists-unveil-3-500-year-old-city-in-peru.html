It is believed to have developed in isolation to other comparative early civilisations in India, Egypt, Sumeria and China.</p><p>Dr Ruth Shady, the archaeologist who led the recent research into Peñico and the excavation of Caral in the 1990s, said that the discovery was important for understanding what became of the Caral civilisation after it was decimated by climate change.</p><p>The Peñico community was &#34;situated in a strategic location for trade, for exchange with societies from the coast, the highlands and the jungle&#34;, Dr Shady told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>At a news conference unveiling the findings on Thursday, archaeologist Marco Machacuay, a researcher with the Ministry of Culture, said that Peñico&#39;s significance lies in it being a continuation of the Caral society.</p><p>Peru is home to many of the Americas&#39; most significant archaeological discoveries, including the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu in the Andes and the mysterious Nazca Lines etched into the desert along the central coast.</p></div></div></article></main></div></div>
