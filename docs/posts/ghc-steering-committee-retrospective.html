    <h1>GHC Steering Committee Retrospective</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After seven years of service as member and secretary on the GHC Steering Committee, I have resigned from that role. So this is a good time to look back and retrace the formation of the GHC proposal process and committee.</p>
<p>In my memory, I helped define and shape the proposal process, optimizing it for effectiveness and throughput, but memory can be misleading, and judging from the paper trail in my email archives, this was indeed mostly Ben Gamari‚Äôs and Richard Eisenberg‚Äôs achievement: Already in Summer of 2016, Ben Gamari set up the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals">ghc-proposals Github repository</a> with a sketch of a process and sent out a <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2016-September/026396.html">call for nominations</a> on the GHC user‚Äôs mailing list, which I replied to. The Simons picked the first set of members, and in the fall of 2016 we discussed the committee‚Äôs by-laws and procedures. As so often, Richard was an influential shaping force here.</p>
<h3 id="three-ingredients">Three ingredients</h3>
<p>For example, it was him that suggested that for each proposal we have one committee member be the ‚ÄúShepherd‚Äù, overseeing the discussion. I believe this was one ingredient for the process effectiveness: There is always one person in charge, and thus we avoid the delays incurred when any one of a non-singleton set of volunteers have to do the next step (and everyone hopes someone else does it).</p>
<p>The next ingredient was that we do not usually require a vote among all members (again, not easy with volunteers with limited bandwidth and occasional phases of absence). Instead, the shepherd makes a recommendation (accept/reject), and if the other committee members do not complain, this silence is taken as consent, and we come to a decision. It seems this idea can also be traced back on Richard, who suggested that ‚Äúonce a decision is requested, the shepherd [generates] consensus. If consensus is elusive, then we vote.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the end of the year we agreed and wrote down these rules, created the mailing list for our internal, but <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/">publicly archived committee discussions</a>, and began accepting proposals, starting with <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/6">Adam Gundry‚Äôs <code>OverloadedRecordFields</code></a>.</p>
<p>At that point, there was no ‚Äúsecretary‚Äù role yet, so how I did become one? It seems that in February 2017 I started to <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2017-February/000040.html">clean-up and refine the process documentation</a>, fixing ‚Äúbugs in the process‚Äù (like requiring authors to set Github labels when they don‚Äôt even have permissions to do that). This in particular meant that someone from the committee had to manually handle submissions and so on, and by the aforementioned principle that at every step there ought to be exactly one person in change, the role of a secretary followed naturally. In the <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2017-February/000044.html">email in which I described that role</a> I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simon already shoved me towards picking up the ‚Äúsecretary‚Äù hat, to reduce load on Ben.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when I <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/commit/63d050c380b2aa380581cc9b9aafb2a7c022556a">merged the updated process documentation</a>, I already listed myself ‚Äúsecretary‚Äù.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt just Simon‚Äôs shoving that put my into the role, though. I dug out my original self-nomination email to Ben, and among other things I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also hope that there is going to be clear responsibilities and a clear workflow among the committee. E.g. someone (possibly rotating), maybe called the secretary, who is in charge of having an initial look at proposals and then assigning it to a member who shepherds the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is hardly a surprise that I became secretary, when it was dear to my heart to have a smooth continuous process here.</p>
<p>I am rather content with the result: These three ingredients ‚Äì single secretary, per-proposal shepherds, silence-is-consent ‚Äì helped the committee to be effective throughout its existence, even as every once in a while individual members dropped out.</p>
<h3 id="ulterior-motivation">Ulterior motivation</h3>
<p>I must admit, however, there was an ulterior motivation behind me grabbing the secretary role: Yes, I <em>did</em> want the committee to succeed, and I <em>did</em> want that authors receive timely, good and decisive feedback on their proposals ‚Äì but I <em>did not</em> really want to have to do that part.</p>
<p>I am, in fact, a lousy proposal reviewer. I am too generous when reading proposals, and more likely mentally fill gaps in a specification rather than spotting them. Always optimistically assuming that the authors surely know what they are doing, rather than critically assessing the impact, the implementation cost and the interaction with other language features.</p>
<p>And, maybe more importantly: why should I know which changes are good and which are not so good in the long run? Clearly, the authors cared enough about a proposal to put it forward, so there is some need‚Ä¶ and I do believe that Haskell should stay an evolving and innovating language‚Ä¶ but how does this help me decide about this or that particular feature.</p>
<p>I even, during the formation of the committee, explicitly asked that we write down some guidance on ‚ÄúVision and Guideline‚Äù; do we want to foster change or innovation, or be selective gatekeepers? Should we accept features that are proven to be useful, or should we accept features so that they can prove to be useful? This discussion, however, did not lead to a concrete result, and the assessment of proposals relied on the sum of each member‚Äôs personal preference, expertise and gut feeling. I am not saying that this was a mistake: It is hard to come up with a general guideline here, and even harder to find one that does justice to each individual proposal.</p>
<p>So the secret motivation for me to grab the secretary post was that I could contribute without having to judge proposals. Being secretary allowed me to assign most proposals to others to shepherd, and only once in a while myself took care of a proposal, when it seemed to be very straight-forward. Sneaky, ain‚Äôt it?</p>
<h3 id="years-later">7 Years later</h3>
<p>For years to come I happily played secretary: When an author finished their proposal and public discussion ebbed down they would ping me on GitHub, I would <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2022-July/002837.html">pick a suitable shepherd</a> among the committee and ask them to judge the proposal. Eventually, the committee would come to a conclusion, usually by implicit consent, sometimes by voting, and I‚Äôd merge the pull request and update the metadata thereon. Every few months I‚Äôd <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2024-January/003683.html">summarize the current state of affairs</a> to the committee (what happened since the last update, which proposals are currently on our plate), and once per year gathered the data for <a href="https://youtu.be/LFIL0myeOlo?si=P316QJs0EBSWe4Uy&amp;t=3955">Simon Peyton Jones‚Äô annually GHC Status Report</a>. Sometimes some members needed a nudge or two to act. Some would eventually step down, and I‚Äôd sent around a call for nominations and when the nominations came in, distributed them off-list among the committee and tallied the votes.</p>
<p>Initially, that was exciting. For a long while it was a pleasant and rewarding routine. Eventually, it became a mere chore. I noticed that I didn‚Äôt quite care so much anymore about some of the discussion, and there was a decent amount of naval-gazing, meta-discussions and some wrangling about claims of authority that was probably useful and necessary, but wasn‚Äôt particularly fun.</p>
<p>I also began to notice weaknesses in the processes that I helped shape: We could really use some more automation for showing proposal statuses, notifying people when they have to act, and nudging them when they don‚Äôt. The whole silence-is-assent approach is good for throughput, but not necessary great for quality, and maybe the committee members need to be pushed more firmly to engage with each proposal. Like GHC itself, the committee processes deserve continuous refinement and refactoring, and since I could not muster the motivation to change my now well-trod secretarial ways, it was time for me to step down.</p>
<p>Luckily, Adam Gundry volunteered to take over, and that makes me feel much less bad for quitting. Thanks for that!</p>
<p>And although I am for my day job now <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">enjoying a language</a> that has many of the things out of the box that for Haskell are still only language extensions or even just future proposals (dependent types, <code>BlockArguments</code>, <code>do</code> notation with <code>(‚Üê foo)</code> expressions and üíú Unicode), I‚Äôm still around, hosting the <a href="https://haskell.foundation/podcast/">Haskell Interlude Podcast</a>, writing on this blog and hanging out at ZuriHac etc.</p></div></div>
