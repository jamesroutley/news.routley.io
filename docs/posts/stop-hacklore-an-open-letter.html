  <p>Released Nov-24-2025</p><p>To the public, employers, journalists, and policymakers:</p><p>We are a group of current and former Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security leaders, and practitioners who have seen how compromises unfold in the real world across industry, academia, and government. We write to correct a set of persistent myths about digital risk to everyday people and small businesses (as opposed to high-risk individuals) that continue to circulate widely online and in public advice columns.</p><h2><strong>The outdated advice</strong></h2><p>Specifically, we aim to retire the following outdated pieces of advice:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Avoid public WiFi:</strong> Large-scale compromises via public WiFi are exceedingly rare today. Modern products use encryption technologies to protect your traffic even on open networks, and operating systems and browsers now warn users about untrusted connections. Personal VPN services offer little additional security or privacy benefit for most people and don’t stop the most common attacks. </p></li><li><p><strong>Never scan QR codes</strong>: There is no evidence of widespread crime originating from QR-code scanning itself. The true risk is social engineering scams, which is mitigated by existing browser and OS protections, and by being cautious about the information you give any website. </p></li><li><p><strong>Never charge devices from public USB ports</strong>: There are no verified cases of “juice jacking” in the wild affecting everyday users. Modern devices prompt before enabling data transfer, default to restricted charging modes, and authenticate connected accessories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn off Bluetooth and NFC</strong>: Wireless exploits in the wild are extraordinarily rare and typically require specialized hardware, physical proximity, and unpatched devices. Modern phones and laptops isolate these components and require user consent for pairing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regularly “clear cookies”</strong>: Clearing (or deleting) cookies doesn’t meaningfully improve security or stop modern tracking, which now includes identifiers and fingerprinting other than cookies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regularly change passwords</strong>: Frequent password changes were once common advice, but there is no evidence it reduces crime, and it often leads to weaker passwords and reuse across accounts. </p></li></ol><p>This kind of advice is well-intentioned but misleading. It consumes the limited time people have to protect themselves and diverts attention from actions that truly reduce the likelihood and impact of real compromises.</p><p>Sound security guidance should be accurate, proportional, and actionable. With that standard in mind, we recommend replacing the above advice with clear, fact-based guidance that helps people and organizations manage real risk while enabling modern, connected use of technology.</p><h2><strong>Recommendations for the public</strong></h2><p>While the news is often filled with exotic attacks against high-value individuals and organizations, the truth is that for most people the basics are still the basics and should be the foundation of any security advice to the everyday person or small business.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Keep critical devices and applications updated</strong>: Focus your attention on the devices and applications you use to access essential services such as email, financial accounts, cloud storage, and identity-related apps. Enable automatic updates wherever possible so these core tools receive the latest security fixes. And when a device or app is no longer supported with security updates, it’s worth considering an upgrade.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable multi-factor authentication (“MFA”, sometimes called 2FA)</strong>: Prioritize protecting sensitive accounts with real value to malicious actors such as email, file storage, social media, and financial systems. When possible, consider “passkeys”, a newer sign-in technology built into everyday devices that replaces passwords with encryption that resists phishing scams — so even if attackers steal a password, they can’t log in. Use SMS one-time codes as a last resort if other methods are not available. </p></li><li><p><strong>Use strong pass<em>phrases</em></strong> (not just passwords): <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" target="_blank"><span>Passphrases</span></a> for your important accounts should be “strong.” A “strong” password or passphrase is <em>long</em> (16+ characters), <em>unique</em> (never reused under any circumstances), and <em>randomly generated</em> (which humans are notoriously bad at doing). Uniqueness is critical: using the same password in more than one place dramatically increases your risk, because a breach at one site can compromise others instantly. A passphrase, such as a short sentence of 4–5 words (spaces are fine), is an easy way to get sufficient length. Of course, doing this for many accounts is difficult, which leads us to…</p></li><li><p><strong>Use a password manager</strong>: A password manager solves this by generating strong passwords, storing them in an encrypted vault, and filling them in for you when you need them. A password manager will only enter your passwords on legitimate sites, giving you extra protection against phishing. Password managers can also store passkeys alongside passwords. For the password manager, use a strong pass<em>phrase</em> since it protects all the others, and enable MFA.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Recommendations for organizations</strong></h2><p>Organizations should build systems that don’t fail catastrophically when people make mistakes—especially when they are victimized by malicious actors. Create clear, simple ways for employees to report and escalate suspicious activity, and acknowledge those reports quickly so people feel supported, not blamed. If an employee’s mistake creates significant harm to the organization, the design of the system was brittle—and not resilient—by design. For system administrators, require phishing-resistant MFA and commit to a plan to eliminate reliance on passwords across the organization.</p><h2><strong>Recommendations for software manufacturers</strong></h2><p>Finally, to be clear, no software or system is perfectly secure. Every day, new weaknesses are discovered in modern devices, operating systems, and applications. But how we handle those reports is what determines the real outcome. The responsibility for preventing harm should not rest with the public or enterprises; it lies with software manufacturers to fix their defective code—not with over a billion users to modify their behavior.</p><p>We call on software manufacturers to take responsibility for building software that is <em>secure by design and secure by default</em>—engineered to be safe before it ever reaches users—and to publish clear roadmaps showing how they will achieve that goal. They should ensure all network traffic is protected with modern encryption protocols and incentivize independent security researchers through formal, responsive bounty programs that include explicit safe-harbor protections. Manufacturers must also commit to publishing CVE records—the public catalog of known software vulnerabilities—that are complete, accurate, and timely for all issues that could put users at risk, including those discovered internally.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We urge communicators and decision-makers to stop promoting “hacklore”—catchy but inaccurate advice—and instead share guidance that meaningfully reduces harm. We stand ready to help public agencies, employers, and media organizations reframe cybersecurity advice so it is practical, proportionate, and based on current realities.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Ben Adida, VotingWorks</p><p>Heather Adkins, VP, Cybersecurity Resilience Officer, Google</p><p>JJ Agha, CISO, FanDuel</p><p>Ian Amit, former CSO Cimpress, Rapid7.
