		<p>Photocatalytic process enables water to be activated / Published in “Nature” journal</p>
		<p>Hydrogen is seen as an energy source of the future – at least, when it is produced in a climate-friendly way. Hydrogen can also be important for the production of active ingredients and other important substances. To produce hydrogen, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) can be converted into hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) by means of a series of chemical processes. However, as water molecules are very stable, splitting them into hydrogen and oxygen presents a big challenge to chemists. For it to succeed at all, the water first has to be activated using a catalyst – then it reacts more easily. A team of researchers led by Prof. Armido Studer at the Institute of Organic Chemistry at Münster University has developed a photocatalytic process in which water, under mild reaction conditions, is activated through triaryl phosphines and not, as in most other processes, through transition metal complexes.</p>

<p>This strategy, which has now been published in the “Nature” journal, will open a new door in the highly active field of research relating to radical chemistry, says the team. Radicals are, as a rule, highly reactive intermediates. The team uses a special intermediate – a phosphine-water radical cation – as activated water, from which hydrogen atoms from H<sub>2</sub>O can be easily split off and transferred to a further substrate. The reaction is driven by light energy. “Our system,” says Armido Studer, “offers an ideal platform for investigating unresearched chemical processes which use the hydrogen atom as a reagent in synthesis.”</p>

<p>Dr. Christian Mück-Lichtenfeld, who analysed the activated water complexes using theoretical methods, says, “The hydrogen-oxygen bond in this intermediate is extraordinarily weak, making it possible to transfer a hydrogen atom to various compounds.” Dr. Jingjing Zhang, who carried out the experimental work, adds: “The hydrogen atoms of the activated water can be transferred to alkenes and arenes under very mild conditions, in so-called hydrogenation reactions.” Hydrogenation reactions are enormously important in pharmaceutical research, in the agrochemical industry and in materials sciences.</p>

<p>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation provided financial support for the work.</p>
