		    <h2>How to Read the Book</h2>
		    <div>
			    <p>
				The book is separated into six standalone parts, each part covering several chapters:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Part 1: Developer career fundamentals
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 2: The competent software developer
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 3: The well-rounded senior engineer
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 4: The pragmatic tech lead
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 5: Role-model staff and principal engineers
					</li>
					<li>
						Part 6: Conclusion
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Parts 1 and 6 apply to all engineering levels: from entry-level software developers to principal or above engineers. Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 cover increasingly senior engineering levels. These four parts group topics in chapters – such as ones on software engineering, collaboration, getting things done, and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>This book is more of a reference book that you can refer back to, as you grow in your career.</strong> I suggest skimming over the career levels and chapters that you are familiar with, and focus reading on topics you struggle with, or career levels where you are aiming to get to. Keep in mind that expectations can vary greatly between companies. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In this book, I’ve aimed to align the topics and leveling definitions closer to what is typical at Big Tech and scaleups: but you might find some of the topics relevant for lower career levels in later chapters. For example, we cover logging, montiroing and oncall in Part 5: “Reliable software systems” in-depth: but it’s useful – and oftentimes necessary! – to know about these practices below the staff engineer levels.

					  <p>I&#39;d like to think so! The book can help you get ideas on how to help software engineers on your team grow.

I <i>have</i> written this book with software engineers as the target group, and the bulk of the book applies for them. Part 1 is more generally applicable career advice: but that&#39;s still smaller subset of the book.

		    <div>
			    <p>
					I&#39;ve been a software engineer for a decade — working at JP Morgan, Skype/Microsoft, Skyscanner and Uber — and then an engineering manager for another several years. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As an engineering manager, I did my best to support people on my team to improve professionally, get the promotions they deserved, and give clear, actionable feedback when I thought colleagues weren’t ready for the next level, just yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					As my team grew and I took on skip-level reports, I had less and less time to mentor teammates in-depth. I also started to see patterns in the feedback I gave, so began to publish blog posts of the advice I found myself giving repeatedly; about <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/">writing well</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/good-code-reviews-better-code-reviews/">doing good code reviews</a>. These posts were warmly received, and a lot more people than I expected read and shared them with colleagues. This is when I began writing this book.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>The book took four years to write.</strong> By year two of the writing process, I had a draft that could be ready to publish. However, at that time I launched <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter</a>. The focus of this newsletter is keeping the pulse of today’s tech market, plus regular deepdives into how well-known, international companies operate, software engineering trends, and occasional interviews with interesting tech people. Writing the newsletter made me realize just how many “gaps” were in the book draft. The past two years have been spent rewriting and honing its contents, one chapter at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, The Pragmatic Newsletter is the <a href="https://substack.com/leaderboard/technology/paid">#1 technology newsletter on Substack</a> — with more than 500,000 readers. The newsletter has helped me improve the book; I’ve learned lots about interesting trends and new tools that feel like they are here to stay for a decade or longer, such as AI coding tools, cloud development environments, and developer portals. These technologies are referenced in this book in much less detail than you will find in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">the newsletter</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>I hope you discover useful ideas in this book, which serve you well for years to come.</strong>
