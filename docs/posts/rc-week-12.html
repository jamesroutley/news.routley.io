    <h1>RC Week 12</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="mon">Mon</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee chat and pairing with @<strong>Elizabeth</strong>  on today’s Leetle</li>
  <li>Finally fixed the user flow for saving letters in Open When, ready for tomorrow’s demo-palooza. It’s a hacky fix but it’s good enough for me.</li>
  <li>Started going through the Django tutorial to implement my own backend to Open When</li>
  <li>Read about ways that people have trained AI agents to play Mancala. Interested in exploring that post-batch, among other things!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tues">Tues</h2>

<p>yesterday:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mushroom image classification ML Jam – thanks for organizing @<strong>Keerthi</strong></li>
  <li>Presented Open When at demo-palooza and got to see other people’s demos – really liked seeing @<strong>Teon</strong>’s scrapbooking site and @<strong>Basil</strong>’s ray tracing maze game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weds">Weds</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Got my training and validation DataLoaders working for my <a href="https://github.com/grkw/mushroom-classifier">mushroom image classifier</a> on Colab. I realized it’s been about a year since I took my ML courses so it’s nice to refresh myself while looking at pictures of mushrooms. I think there’s some interesting ways I can take the project like trying a compositional/hierarchical approach, interpretable/explainable architectures (attention mechanisms??), transfer learning, fine-tuning, heck maybe generative models like transformers and diffusion.</li>
  <li>Chatted with @<strong>Suhith</strong>  about ML infra, ML performance, and the self-driving industry</li>
  <li>Caught up with @<strong>Kevin</strong>  and did a nice DP problem</li>
  <li>Non-programming talks: I want to read my height in books, would be easier for me than @<strong>Spencer</strong> haha and I’m glad I was reminded of Neetcode and other great job search resources thanks to @<strong>Elijah</strong> for future SWE internships (or full-time jobs, if it turns out I get rejected from all my grad schools)</li>
  <li>Gave my last non-programming talk in batch, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v7HTwWv5GmIHm5H9eWs8lz9S-4wyAcGpsKuQ7woo3tM/edit?usp=sharing">Staying in my Lane</a>! Thank you to @<strong>Suhith</strong>  and @<strong>Kevin</strong>  for encouraging me to present it — I was so close to not doing it because I was like, I don’t even have anything together really… but I got really nice feedback on it and I’m really happy I did it</li>
  <li>Did <a href="https://leetle.app/?date=2025-02-12">today’s Leetle</a> (with help from chatgpt) and <a href="https://leetle.app/?date=2025-02-11">yesterday’s Leetle</a> (I wrote my own solution inspired by Kadane’s algorithm for finding the max subarray sum, which I’m proud of because I could never remember the details to Kadane’s algorithm!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Today was a good day.</p>

<p>edit: so good that I forgot to mention I got rejected from CMU Robotics lol. and i simply cannot be bothered to feel bad about it</p>

<h2 id="thurs">Thurs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Popped in on Fast.ai group! Really enjoyed the meeting (thank you for presenting @<strong>Karen</strong> ) and planning on continuing to come next month</li>
  <li>Paired with @<strong>Karen</strong>  on setting up Tailscale and nginx on my old linux MacBookPro so I can self-host my apps and who knows, maybe I’ll store photos and docs and stuff too. This was so so fun and I really felt the magic of RC</li>
  <li>Presentations and niceties and end of batch celebration</li>
</ul>

<p>edit: thank you @<strong>Sam</strong> for being with me as I opened my rejection letter from UW</p>

<h2 id="fri">Fri</h2>

<p>today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>End of batch reflection — planning to write it up into a return statement this weekend</li>
  <li>Backed up my college files on my linux Mac using Tailscale taildrop – loving this new tool, thanks @<strong>Karen</strong></li>
  <li>Chatted/paired with @<strong>Nadja</strong> — I need to try running Ollama locally on my M2 Mac!</li>
  <li>Had the honor of signing @<strong>Ross</strong> ’s copy of my book The Glitch (signed @<strong>Jess</strong> ’s the other day, and thanks to @<strong>Marc</strong>  and @<strong>Priya</strong>  for buying copies too)</li>
  <li>Finally finished writing niceties throughout the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>What a joy it has been. Have moved to #<strong>alumni checkins&gt;Grace Kwak</strong> for future updates.</p>
