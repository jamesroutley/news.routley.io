  <p dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Hi everyone

I am very sad to announce - officially - that Weaveworks will be closing its doors and shutting down commercial operations.  Customers and partners will be working with a financial trustee whom we shall announce soon. 

The company was turning over double digit (&gt;$10M) revenue and had more than doubled the number of new product logos in 2023.  However this sales growth was lumpy and our cash position, consequently volatile.  We needed a partner or investor for long term growth.  Finally a very promising M&amp;A process with a larger company fell through at the 11th hour.  And so we decided to shut down.  

I can only apologize to everyone for this difficult turn.   I could say that this should not have happened, but I know that we are not alone in this market.  Bigger vessels have gone astray.  The Weaveworks team is a special group and it has been a long and tough journey.  I know that everyone has been so motivated to do their very best for our customers, our open source community, and each other.  You have done well and can be proud.  We shall always have a shared story.

Our story has been so exciting - from the first days of containers, struggling to be born.  The day when someone got Kubernetes working for the first time on Azure.  The start of the CNCF.  The day when we wiped out our systems with a keypress.  The first months of the Covid pandemic.  Then investment and our work to figure out GitOps for a lot of great enterprise customers.  And there have been dire moments too but we figured most of them out together. You’ve shared all of this and all deserve every memory of a good place to work, and with the privilege of knowing that all of you are among the best.

The story does not end here - our open source software is used everywhere.  I am working with several large organizations to make sure CNCF Flux is in the healthiest state.  More on that soon.  And I would invite anyone who reads this and wants to know what is next or offer some help, please get in touch with me!  Thank you.

We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
