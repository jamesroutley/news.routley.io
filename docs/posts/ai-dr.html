        <p>(ai; didn&#39;t read)</p>
<p>For me, writing is the most direct window into how someone thinks, perceives, and groks the world. Once you outsource that to an LLM, I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;re even doing here. Why should I bother to read something someone else couldn&#39;t be bothered to write? </p>
<h2>Before you get your pitchforks out..</h2>
<p>..and call me an AI luddite, I use LLMs pretty extensively for work. Claude Code has been tearing into my token budget for months now. I can&#39;t imaging writing code by myself again, specially documentation, tests and most scaffolding. </p>
<h2>When it comes to content..</h2>
<p>..I need to know there was intention behind it. That someone wanted to get their thoughts out and did so, deliberately, rather than chucking a bullet list at an AI to expand. That someone needed to articulate the chaos in their head, and wrestle it into shape. That someone spent the time and effort — rudimentary proofs of work from a pre-AI era. </p>
<p>I&#39;m having a hard time articulating this but AI-generated code feels like progress and efficiency, while AI-generated articles and posts feel low-effort and make the dead internet theory harder to dismiss.</p>
<h2>Broken is now better?</h2>
<p>Growing up, typos and grammatical errors were a negative signal. Funnily enough, that’s completely flipped for me. The less polished and coherent something is, the more value I assign to it.</p>
<p>But eh, broken English and a lack of capitalization is now just a simple skill away so does it even matter?</p>
