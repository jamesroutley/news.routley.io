    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many years ago, my family discovered a secret about the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.grandwailea.com/" target="_blank">Grand Wailea</a>: amongst all their wonderful amenities, none managed to surpass the quality of their in-room body wash. A good product and a great one are worlds apart, and until recently, the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://shopatgrandwailea.com/collections/honey-mango/products/honey-mango-body-wash-1" target="_blank">Honey Mango scrub</a> was one of the best. I want to take a moment to appreciate what it was and honor a beautiful work by observing its passing.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p><img alt="An image representative of the old body wash." src="https://figbert.com/posts/fall-of-great-product/old.webp"/></p><p>Three things made the body wash an excellent product: it smelled phenomenal, it <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lather#dictionary-entry-2" target="_blank">lathered</a> well, and it had a shining amber color. Combined, these qualities made the exclusive wash not just the best in terms of performance—cleaning dirt and imbuing scent—but also in terms of operation. It was fun. I have fond memories of carrying the nuclear-orange bottle home from the package center and watching it glint in the sun. I enjoyed smelling like Maui every day.</p><p>This was the deal—quality for inconvenience. For half a decade, we would trade money (in literal cost) and time (in slow shipping to the mainland) for a superior product from <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://shopatgrandwailea.com/" target="_blank">their online store</a>. We were happy with the arrangement; not compromising on little, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NDLKQC5/" target="_blank">day-to-day experiences</a> compounds and happiness is a good deal at any price. I am grateful for the years of excellent body wash in a way that most readers will likely find ridiculous.</p><p><img alt="The new body wash." src="https://figbert.com/posts/fall-of-great-product/new.webp"/></p><p>It wasn’t to last. Last year, the product line suffered a refresh. Each of its finest aspects was decimated: the smell was less sweet, the lather unimpressive, and the color—now hidden behind dark blue plastic—approached transparent. But the consultants who had made a mockery of this wonderful soap did not stop there. They found new insults. The 32oz size, the most economical option, was eliminated. And the new pump was designed with a sharp edge that sliced my fingers repeatedly. This last offense in particular seemed an omen. I conferred with my dad, who revealed that he had also cut his fingers on a bottle of the scrub, and we came to a solemn conclusion: it was time to move on.</p><p>I do not expect I will find something quite as magical as the original soap anytime soon. But I have found <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.treehutshea.com/collections/body-washes/products/coco-colada-foaming-gel-wash" target="_blank">a replacement</a>: a lather as good—if not better—than the original, a slightly inferior scent and color, and a much improved retail experience. It will do.</p><p>A soap may seem too trivial a thing to memorialize. But what is a life but a compendium of little wonders? This was one of mine.</p></div></div>
