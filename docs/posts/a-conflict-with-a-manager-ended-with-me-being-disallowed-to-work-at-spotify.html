<p>How a conflict with a manager ended with me being disallowed to work anywhere within Spotify</p>
<p>This story is about lessons learned in a harsh way and about the realities of a tech workplace. The conversations below are not verbatim, but my summarized impression of them. Also the order of events is probably jumbled. Be aware that I am party to the conflict and my story is biased. I hope to get some closure by writing it down and to do my therapy work by handling the thoughts and emotions resulting from it.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>My IT career started in 2009. I went from network engineer at a large corporation to managing a smaller data center and from there on to virtualization, cloud migrations. I learned programming and landed a job at a promising startup. I credit the startup journey with most of the skills I have in backend development, CI/CD platforms, project management, client negotiations. Unfortunately the startup didn&#39;t take off and I proceeded to become a consultant, a contractor for Spotify, a company which in many ways shared the work culture which makes for efficient software development.</p>
<p>I had an amazing year at Spotify in a team of very smart and motivated people. We had an ambitious year long project to deliver before a deadline and we managed to do it in time! We used lightweight tools to plan our work, had great retrospectives, adjusted our ways of working to try new ideas. During dedicated hack time I developed a chat integration for open code reviews which would keep chat messages up to date with the current status of the code review. It was great fun and I was eager to come back to Spotify for other projects.</p>
<h2 id="honeymoon">Honeymoon</h2>
<p>A few months later I landed a new contract at Spotify. It was very exciting to come back. The chat integration I wrote was now used by eight teams! The onboarding went at record speed. I felt right at home and was delivering value from the very first month using the lessons learned in the previous team. Just like my previous team the new team consisted of smart and motivated people. This was my first time in a cross-functional team of both backend and mobile developers and it was cool to get a glimpse of other ways of working. Feedback time came by and I got very supportive and touching reviews from my team mates. The manager congratulated me, credited my personality for how well we work together. So far so good, but here is where it started getting strange.</p>
<h2 id="the-trouble-begins">The trouble begins</h2>
<p>For context, the whole time of this second contract was during covid times where nobody was allowed in the office. From interviews to onboarding to work and the dramatic end - it all happened in chat and video calls. There was no hanging out in the office or lunch together.</p>
<p>The first time I was surprised about the manager&#39;s behavior was when he pulled half the team into a spontaneous video meeting and asked our opinion on some decision. Our response did not satisfy him. It was hard to understand what he wanted. I asked what he thought we should go with and he responded saying it was the team&#39;s decision. I was confused about what was going on and pinged a colleague right after the meeting to ask about it. The colleague thought it was strange and had no idea either.</p>
<p>It would happen now and then that the manager was displeased with how we responded to a decision he presented to us. Here is a paraphrased example of when he offered us another decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Do you want to own product X?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It is a low maintenance system so it takes very little of our time. It&#39;s not expensive to own it.&#34;</p>
<p>The manager was displeased.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you really think product X aligns with our team&#39;s mission?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Historically I can see why we own it. It sounds to me that maybe you don&#39;t want us to own it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s the team&#39;s decision.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I talked about the weird interaction in my one-on-one meeting with the manager. He hinted that the team might take on a more ambitious project in the future and it might be a good idea to hand over some products to other teams. So there was more context to the &#34;decision&#34; he presented to us and I agreed that it makes sense not to own it.</p>
<p>Another time out of the blue he pulled us backend engineers into a meeting and said that he is selecting an intern to join us. We were surprised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;I thought it would help you to have another resource.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A new team member takes a while to onboard, maybe a month or more to get productive. During that time it takes time from the two of us and we have just now taken on this new big task which takes all of our time. Maybe later?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe the intern can learn the ropes without taking much of your time.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That&#39;s the thing with new team members - they do require communication. Also if we do end up getting an intern I really want to help that person out. I am ok with delaying the project, but I am not ok with messing with a person&#39;s career.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was visibly upset.</p>
<p>He was also upset when I asked if I could opt out of the manager led career development process. As a consultant I was not climbing the internal ranks so I had previously been suggested to not bother with that process.</p>
<h2 id="scrum-vs-kanban">Scrum vs Kanban</h2>
<p>I really felt like I stepped on the manager&#39;s toes when I, during retrospective, talked about our Scrum sprint process. During all sprints I had observed that we kept creating new urgent tasks and shoving them into the current sprint. With the task planning tool we used it was a process with many steps. I showed the team how using the same tool in Kanban configuration it took only one step to make a new task visible on the board. I had been using it that way for less friction and administration. The manager protested, saying that a sprint adds focus. I reiterated that the reality was that urgent tasks kept appearing during the sprint and also that others could keep using the sprints - the Kanban board could peacefully coexist in parallel.</p>
<p>About the urgent tasks by the way - they all came from the manager forwarding all requests to us. Almost every day we would get a ping in chat with a request from another team and the manager&#39;s comment to get it done &#34;before end of day&#34;. I would talk to the requester for more context and we would agree that it was not at all that urgent. When I, in private, talked to the manager about filtering incoming requests so that the team is protected from interruptions, he truly did not understand me. I cautiously did what I had done to my previous manager at Spotify - I suggested he&#39;d take a look at a chapter in the book Peopleware - Productive Projects and Teams, which would make a more succinct argument than I could replicate. This did not go well. I think he felt insulted. I totally boggled that interaction.</p>
<p>At a retrospective the manager pulled up the topic of me using the task tool in Kanban configuration. He wanted to know what the team thought of it - that one of us was working differently. To his surprise, the team went &#34;yeah that sounds easier&#34; and promptly decided to all use Kanban. Visibly annoyed, he indicated that he did not agree with the reasoning, but that it also was the team&#39;s decision. I was happy that the team supported me, but very anxious about a growing conflict.</p>
<h2 id="downwards-spiral">Downwards spiral</h2>
<p>There was a dedicated chat channel where the manager often pinged us backend engineers with questions. Literally only him and us two in the channel. We had bizarre interactions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;What is the current priority of your tasks?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We do X, then Y, then Z.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Hold on, I&#39;ll check with the higher-ups.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he replied that after checking with higher-ups the priorities were exactly what I wrote. He copy-pasted the list I made back to me. These daily interactions were annoying when we had to do concentrated work. He also kept asking us about stuff further ahead in our backlog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;For Z, will you go with a push or pull based approach?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure. We&#39;re concentrating on X and Y for now. Z is new territory. We will need to spend some exploratory time to figure out the right way to do it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think you should go for push based. What do you think?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;As I said, we haven&#39;t explored it yet because we&#39;re busy with other stuff. Do you want to go for push based?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think that is better and it is also the Spotify convention of the right way to do things.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Gotcha.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t understand why he was getting into implementation details. At some point he said &#34;think of me as a developer&#34; as an explanation for his involvement. However he wasn&#39;t going to code or maintain the solution. Evidently he didn&#39;t feel like he needed to present an argument for a technical decision, as I would expect from another developer.</p>
<p>At this point these conversations felt so weird that I started screenshotting the strangest ones of them. The manager often asked the same questions and did not remember past conversations so I felt like I might need to prove something was said some time in the future.</p>
<p>The daily interruptions were getting on my nerves, especially since they felt like they didn&#39;t lead to anything useful. I hoped he would just let us be for a while so we could do our job in peace. He spontaneously booked recurring sync meetings with other teams and created tasks on our board with very vague names. His following request for technical details unfortunately made me lose my temper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;What types of data will Z provide?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A, B and later C.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t phrase it right. Which individual endpoints will the API have?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I am curious why you are asking that question. That seems like a technical implementation detail.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I am writing tickets for you and don&#39;t want to add overhead.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want to add overhead maybe you can define business needs and we can write the technical implementation tickets?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My colleague supported me, explaining how it adds additional workload if we have to rewrite the implementation tickets anyway. A task the manager had created called &#34;Error Handling&#34; without a description was a clear example. Error handling is something every engineer at Spotify considers at every step of the way - not as a separate task. The manager got upset and later complained to my colleague that it felt like we were turning against him. In addition to the added workload he provided, my colleague now also had to handle the manager&#39;s paranoia.</p>
<p>I made another mistake in creating a parody ticket to the ones he created. I think I called it something like &#34;Scalability&#34;, without any description, like his tickets. He sent me a private message asking about it. I realized I had gone too far and explained that I wanted to illustrate the vagueness but that I had done it in an unhelpful way. I apologized to him. &#34;Apology accepted&#34; he replied.</p>
<h2 id="time-estimation-catastrophe">Time estimation catastrophe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Can you tell me how long X, Y and Z will take?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re almost finished with X, so only days left there. Y will take a few weeks, but I cannot estimate Z. It&#39;s something we have never done before and without exploration time I don&#39;t even know the scope of the work.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I need the time anyway. Provide it in a spreadsheet by end of day.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I can roughly guess X and Y. Of course, it might vary depending on appearance of sudden interrupting tasks. But I really cannot know about Z. It could potentially be months.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Months?!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Look, I really don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Just put something in.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I cannot stand for an estimate of something I don&#39;t know. Can&#39;t you then just put something in?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Call me.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a video chat where once again he wouldn&#39;t accept my reasoning that I could estimate most of what he requested, but not the last item. I urged him to just explain it to whoever was requesting this that it was yet an unknown. He wouldn&#39;t budge on the spreadsheet request. I felt so frustrated, anxious and hopeless. I wasn&#39;t getting through to him. It also felt like he was shifting management duties to us who were already swamped with work. The ultimatum to produce an estimate ruined my entire weekend. I was frantically thinking how I would solve this in the best way. My next mistake was a big one. I thought we could just talk it out with the product manager present. Monday came around and in the morning the product manager joined our standup meeting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I: &#34;I want to talk about the requested time estimates for our work on X, Y and Z&#34;</p>
<p>Manager: &#34;Let&#39;s take it offline.&#34;</p>
<p>I: &#34;No, I want to do it now with the product manager present. So we will finish X in a few days, Y in 2-3 weeks. When it comes to Z, it is something we haven&#39;t done before and until we start exploring it we don&#39;t know how long it will take.&#34;</p>
<p>Product manager: &#34;Perfect. That is exactly what I wanted to know.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was where the manager went ballistic. He made an angry outburst that I did not even try to estimate the work! He expected more from a senior engineer! Then he ragequit the meeting. Everyone left was stunned. I was shaking. After the meeting a colleague called me up. I was crying uncontrollably. He was surprised to learn about all the weird requests that us two backend engineering had had. I realized that since we were 100% remote, most of the conflict had been invisible to the rest of the team. When the strange stuff happened in private channels, in private messages and in private video calls the rest of the team had no chance to see it and react, to provide support and a sanity check before it went too far. Since we didn&#39;t hang around in an office or for lunch, the rest of the team did not notice the declining mental health and wellbeing of us backend people.</p>
<p>I shared a lot with my colleague. I was broken and in despair. I told him that I no longer had any hope to remain in this team. There was no way we could get back to working together. I would just finish X and then look for a new team. My colleague ensured me that the team was with me and we would all together fix this. Also my colleague admitted that he had had management tasks assigned to him but had successfully pushed them back to the manager.</p>
<p>Next day the manager scheduled a meeting with the team where he apologized for the outburst and said that it should not have happened. He said that the meeting was a space for him to listen to our feedback. We started carefully by wondering whether he could have a role to filter requests from other teams as urgent or non-urgent, to help us get things done with fewer interruptions. He proceeded to defend every time he had pinged us to do something &#34;before end of day&#34;. So much for listening to feedback. Could he leave writing technical implementation tickets to us? He defended his actions once again. He also mentioned that he was surprised that we had this sort of cultural mismatch since he had worked with many different ethnicities before. The meeting went nowhere and I once again lost hope of a future in this team.</p>
<p>I tried to find any internal documents which would define the role of a manager in Spotify, since I agreed with him that we viewed his role differently. To my surprise, in a company which ensured engineering excellence by providing outstanding technical and cultural documentation for engineers I found almost nothing about the role of a manager. On an internal site I found a short mention that a manager is expected to be a leader.</p>
<h2 id="youre-fired">You&#39;re fired</h2>
<p>For two days the manager was absent. This helped us concentrate on our work and I finished working on a bugfix. Next morning the manager sent me a private message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Do you have time for a video call?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry, but I will only do it if anyone else is present on the call.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ok. Your contract is terminated as of today.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was shocked. So this is what he had been busy with. I messaged our team channel that I had been fired. This made him angry in our private conversation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;Remove your message from our channel.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The team deserves to know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I decide what the team deserves to know and when.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a weird standup meeting where I said that I finished the bugfix which was ready for code review, and that I had learned I was fired. The manager said that I would be leaving the team and stiffly thanked me for my contributions. I told them I needed to transfer ownership of the chat integration which I maintained and which was used by more than eight teams at this point. I got a bunch of private messages. The product manager assured me he was not informed of this decision. I messaged the people I knew from before at the company and I managed to throw my phone number out to my team mates before I was abruptly logged out from all systems, 2 hours after I had learned I was fired. My previous manager contacted me and said he had never seen anyone&#39;s accounts get locked so quickly.</p>
<h2 id="youre-almost-hired">You&#39;re almost hired</h2>
<p>A manager of a different team mailed me, saying that he really needed a backend engineer and he heard I was available now. Turns out he needed help with code which I helped write during my successful contract. I would be working in a team where most people had worked with me before. Wow, that sounded great! But before that he wanted to know what my thoughts were on the story with the manager. I answered truthfully that I was hurt and sad after being forced out of a team of great people, but that I was relieved to be outside of his sphere of influence now. I felt safer. Also I didn&#39;t foresee any trouble since these teams were in entirely different business units within the company.</p>
<p>The very next morning my accounts started getting reactivated. Then I lost contact again and I asked my onboarding contact what was up. At this part of the story I am not entirely sure what happened. The new hiring manager got called into a meeting with HR and after that refused to have any contact with me. He redirected me to an HR representative. The HR representative told me that my new contract was cancelled. I was deemed to not live up to Spotify&#39;s corporate values. They tended not to rehire people who had been fired for these reasons. I asked them how a single manager could make HR ban me forever across all business units, regardless of business needs or past achievements. HR replied that the manager did not make that decision alone. It was taken by a troika consisting of the manager, the manager&#39;s manager and an HR representative. Well, I had not had any contact whatsoever with the other two...</p>
<p>Later I learned that one of my colleagues confronted the manager&#39;s manager about this, who denied participating. Also I learned that the manager who fired me had all this time been on a probation period. It&#39;s common in Sweden for new hires to have a 6 month probation period where it is possible to let them go without a cause. After this incident the probation period ran out and the manager became a trusted and protected employee. The product manager, the designer and a developer promptly left the team.</p>
<h2 id="the-aftermath">The aftermath</h2>
<p>I want to stress to you, the reader, how brutal the cutoff was. This was during covid times where we all were struggling to cope with our life of indoor isolation. An outlet for me was pouring my time into work which I was appreciated for. I had been part of more than that team - I was part of the technical community within Spotify, hanging out in various technical topic channels, helping people out. Being suddenly torn away and banned for life was very traumatic and I struggled with depression. Anxiety was somewhat better though because I felt less threatened, less like I could expect something underhanded at any time. I convinced myself that I was safe from retaliation at this point - how much further could he even go?</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have motivation to hop into another contract for a while. I went to a gettogether IRL with the team I was fired from where we had a great time. I found a good therapist to help me through the resulting feelings. I mailed a question to HR a bit later, but my contact had an out-of-office message that he was leaving the company. I never got a reply.</p>
<p>Time passed and I thought a lot about what I could have done to avoid escalating the conflict. Even if I was unable to fix the situation I should learn from it. I formalized rules for myself to avoid trouble in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep the hiring manager happy. Better work environment, completed work - that is only possible when the manager is cooperating. What is the point of improving the workplace if the cost is being ejected from that place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the cost of keeping the manager happy is too high, then leave and find another place. It doesn&#39;t matter that everyone else supports you. The penalty of a disapproving manager is much worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not expect a hierarchical authoritative organization like a corporation to have a fair process, especially as a contractor not covered by employee protection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="understanding-and-compassion">Understanding and compassion</h2>
<p>It is easy to vilify a person who hurt you and blame problems on that person. It is however not honest. I have thought a lot of the experience of others involved in this conflict.</p>
<p>Imagine being a new manager in a big company. You are trying to prove yourself and build a career. You are stuck at home in covid times managing a small team of developers. Outside of meetings it is awfully quiet and you might feel out of touch with what is happening. You do your best to try to help the team by alerting them to anything relevant which they might have missed in chat channels. You think ahead about their future needs and whenever you have time you ask them for information and plans to try to understand future needs better. You even try your hand at writing tickets for them, to ease their workload. You try to find an intern to help them out. In return it feels like you are unappreciated and criticized. It is suggested that you should do less of the helping and it hurts because you are doing it with good intentions. You can honestly explain the motivation behind every action.</p>
<p>The team decides to change ways of working to ones you are not familiar with. It feels scary, like losing control over the familiar sprint process you&#39;re used to. You get a task from above to deliver time estimates and since the team has more context you ask them to provide them, but a person refuses. Furthermore, that person even embarasses you in a meeting by bypassing you and reporting directly to the product manager. You are angry and humiliated. There is no way you can work together. Anger and shame are powerful motivators. You manage to quickly fire that person from your team, but learn that he is back the very next day! You use all tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>When it comes to being the manager&#39;s manager, or an HR representative - I am sure they didn&#39;t even care about the situation. It&#39;s just about a resource, someone they have never heard of that a manager says he has problems with. What he tells you sounds bad indeed. No worries, a consultant is very easy to get rid of and move on with life.</p>
<h2 id="lifelong-ban">Lifelong ban</h2>
<p>A year passed and I did some other contracts. I missed the productivity within Spotify. At times I would get a message from a Spotify manager about an open position. I would warn them that there had been a conflict and that maybe HR would be in the way. I didn&#39;t hear from them again.</p>
<p>Then a previous colleague messaged me saying that the manager and the manager&#39;s manager had left the company. I felt hope rekindled again. Maybe Spotify wouldn&#39;t see me as a threat when nobody who disapproved of me even worked there anymore. I applied for two contracts to see how far I&#39;d get. I landed an interview. Did this mean I was allowed again? The interview went well, but then communication fell silent. One of the teams rejected me saying I was marked in an HR system as &#34;bad culture fit&#34;.</p>
<p>Jeez, bad culture fit. This is like the experiment with <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6828/was-the-experiment-with-five-monkeys-a-ladder-a-banana-and-a-water-spray-condu">monkeys and the ladder</a>. The system enforces a ban when nobody is even left who remembers why it is there. Well, the people I worked well with are still there, but their opinions don&#39;t seem to count.</p>
<p>A bizarre thought is that, in total, I had worked at Spotify longer than the manager lasted. One of us is branded as a bad culture fit.</p>
<p>All in all, this painful story has been a learning experience of navigating power structures and professional relationships. Even more so, it has been a journey of handling my self-critical thoughts, of regaining self-esteem and self-respect.</p>
<h2 id="pitch-for-work">Pitch for work</h2>
<p>I have other, more positive stories to tell too. If you are looking for an experienced software developer on consultant contract basis to work with your smart and motivated developers, shoot me a mail at my first name at cloudspike.com. I can either work remotely or meet IRL in Stockholm/Gothenburg in Sweden.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>
