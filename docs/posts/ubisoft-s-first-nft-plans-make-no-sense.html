<p>Ubisoft became the first big-name game publisher to jump on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/ars-technicas-non-fungible-guide-to-nfts/">the non-fungible token bandwagon</a> Tuesday. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/big-name-publishers-see-nfts-as-a-big-part-of-gamings-future/">teasing its interest in the space last month</a>, the company is officially <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/welcome/">rolling out Quartz</a>, a system of in-game cosmetic items powered by a new kind of NFT, called &#34;Digits.&#34;</p>
<p>By using a decentralized NFT blockchain, Ubisoft promises its Quartz system will &#34;grant players more control than ever&#34; and &#34;more autonomy and agency&#34; in order to &#34;genuinely make players stakeholders of our games.&#34; But as currently described, Ubisoft&#39;s Quartz system seems like an overcomplicated repackaging of a run-of-the-mill system of DLC cosmetics—but now with extra buzzwords and artificial scarcity layered on top.
</p><p>And despite all the bold talk of &#34;decentralization,&#34; the Quartz system is still so deeply controlled by Ubisoft that we wonder whether a simple internal database managed directly by the company would be a better fit.</p>
<h2>Quartz, explained</h2>
<p>Quartz—which rolls out later this month—is simply a system that provides access to cosmetic items for a single game, <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em>. The first three such cosmetics—representing a specific gun, a face mask, and &#34;enhanced pants&#34; in the game—will be available for free on three days in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional DLC, where supply is unlimited and every purchased copy is identical, Ubisoft stresses three ways in which Quartz cosmetics are unique:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited editions:</strong> Each Quartz NFT &#34;edition&#34; will be limited to a set number, ranging from &#34;a few units to a few thousands,&#34; Ubisoft says. It&#39;s not clear how many will be available for each of these first three &#34;free&#34; editions.</li>
<li><strong>Serial Numbers:</strong> Each individual NFT in a single edition has a unique serial number that &#34;is displayed on the collectible and on the in-game item.&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Player names:</strong> A Digit&#39;s metadata will contain &#34;the history of its previous owners,&#34; represented by their Ubisoft player names.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in practice, your &#34;Wolf Enhanced Helmet A&#34; will look and function a lot like mine. But if you look closely, you&#39;ll see a different number etched into the virtual forehead of that helmet. And if you dig into the NFT&#39;s metadata, you&#39;ll be able to see who used to own that particular copy of the helmet.</p>
<p>Ubisoft seems to foresee a chase-the-collectible metagame forming around these minor differences. &#34;Owning a Digit will make you an actual part of its history,&#34; the company <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/ubisoft-quartz-and-digits/what-does-it-bring-to-my-gaming-experience">says in its FAQ</a>. Elsewhere, Ubisoft <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/faq/ubisoft-quartz-and-digits/what-makes-digits-unique">encourages players</a> to &#34;be the first owner of a particular Digit or chase the one of your favorite streamer.&#34;</p>
<p>OK, sure. Maybe some people will get really excited about &#34;owning&#34; the only digital pair of Wolf Enhanced Pants numbered &#34;69420&#34; and once owned by Ninja. We can&#39;t say that <em>we&#39;re</em> excited about it, but there may be <em>some</em> market for such a thing.</p>
<p>But marketing rare or unique in-game items—and letting players resell them—isn&#39;t a new thing. Ubisoft doesn&#39;t need NFTs or &#34;the blockchain&#34; to enable this kind of artificially scarce digital collectible; a basic centrally controlled database could do the same thing much more simply.</p>
<p>Anyone who has <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Special_Edition_Ships">sold a special-edition ship</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/how-eve-online-builds-emotion-out-of-its-strict-in-game-economy/"><em>Eve Online</em>&#39;s strictly regulated economy</a> knows how this can work. The same goes for anyone who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/valve-scraps-revamped-artifact-dumps-free-unfinished-2-0-version-on-steam/">bought and sold <em>Artifact</em> cards</a> on the Steam marketplace or those who remember the ill-fated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/diablo-3-says-goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-the-auction-house/"><em>Diablo III</em> real-money auction house</a>.</p>
<p>All these examples and more predated the widespread adoption of NFTs and didn&#39;t need the technology for any of the features Ubisoft is touting here.</p>
