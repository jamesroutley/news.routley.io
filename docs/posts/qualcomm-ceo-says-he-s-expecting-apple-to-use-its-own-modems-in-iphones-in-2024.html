The legal battle between two of the world&#39;s biggest chip designers comes as Qualcomm seeks to grow in the PC market; to do so, it <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/qualcomm-acquire-nuvia" target="_blank">acquired</a> a company called Nuvia, whose server chips are based on Arm architecture. </p><p>Arm contends it needs a license to use the chip designs and is seeking damages and to force Qualcomm to destroy various information and hardware related to the purchase.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s very unfortunate, this litigation, but the reality is we have very broad rights to the Arm IP, one of their early licensees,&#34; Amon said. &#34;We feel pretty good about a solution and we&#39;re just moving forward with our plans. And all of our customers are very excited about what we&#39;re doing in this area.&#34;</p><p>On a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-chips-huawei-idUSFWN3582WR" target="_blank">report</a> by the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. government is considering revoking export licenses for U.S. suppliers to Huawei, Amon said: &#34;We do have licenses to sell 4G chips to Huawei. We&#39;re being compliant through our license, but we have not yet seen any action.&#34;</p><p>He called the U.S. Chips and Science Act a &#34;great thing&#34; that had encouraged companies like TSMC and Samsung to build facilities in the country.</p><p>A revocation of its license would result in a financial hit to Qualcomm, he said, but stressed the company was more diversified and provided companies including Samsung and Honor with modems and was growing in automotives and the internet of things.</p></div></div></div>
