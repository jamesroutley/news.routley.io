    <h1>Show HN: I used AI to recreate a $4000 piece of audio hardware as a plugin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi Hacker News,</p><p>This is definitely out of my comfort zone. I&#39;ve never programmed DSP before. But I was able to use Claude code and have it help me build this using CMajor.</p><p>I just wanted to show you guys because I&#39;m super proud of it. It&#39;s a 100% faithful recreation based off of the schematics, patents, and ROMs that were found online.</p><p>So please watch the video and tell me what you think</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/auOlZXI1VxA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/auOlZXI1VxA</a></p><p>The reason why I think this is relevant is because I&#39;ve been a programmer for 25 years and AI scares the shit out of me.</p><p>I&#39;m not a programmer anymore. I&#39;m something else now. I don&#39;t know what it is but it&#39;s multi-disciplinary, and it doesn&#39;t involve writing code myself--for better or worse!</p><p>Thanks!</p></div></div></div>
