<p>My <a href="https://utahjs.com/">UtahJS</a> talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">&#34;Building the Hundred-Year Web Service&#34;</a>, was put online this week!
It&#39;s about how to build software infrastructure that lasts a very long time.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not a software engineer (very unlikely that you&#39;re reading this blog if so, but it&#39;s possible) the first 11 minutes of the talk are non-technical, and have some insights about the future of the internet that I hope to expand on soon, in other contexts.
So it&#39;s worth watching up until that point, before I start explaining to web developers how I think they should be making web services.</p>

<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor link for: summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This is my first stab at publicly articulating something that has been on my mind for a while: is it possible to build software infrastructure with longevity and maintenance characteristics that rival those of physical infrastructure?
A lot of people think this is basically impossibleâ€”our computational capabilities are increasing too rapidly, and our software is changing too frequently, that the only way to keep up is a constant and significant expenditure of resources.
I disagree.</p>
<p>In the talk, I analogize this moment in software to the building of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg_Bridge">Williamsburg Bridge</a>.
The Williamsburg Bridge was conceived in the 1800s, and built with horse-drawn carriage in mind, yet we&#39;ve been able to adapt that structure to the needs of a 21st-century city (well, sort of; it should have more bike lanes, but that&#39;s a political problem).
Maintaining that bridge today, we make use of the work of engineers who could not possibly have imagined what we&#39;re using it for; the invention of the automobile did not require us to <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">&#34;write&#34; the bridge from scratch</a>.</p>
<p>If you consider what software abstractions could plausibly be used to build hundred-year software infrastructure, so far there&#39;s really only one: The Web.
This talk takes seriously the idea that something you put online today could remain online and useful for 100 years, and walks through some technology choices that I believe would make that outcome more likely.</p>

<li>Describe the actions of your service with <a href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/form-http-methods#REST-in%20Practice">HTTP verbs and methods</a> as much as possible</li>
<li>Write plain HTML (with templates); enhance it sparsely; use isolated scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of specifics in the second half of the talk, and <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog">this blog you&#39;re reading now</a> has other explainers that synthesize with that design philosophy.</p>
<p>And of course, the ideas expressed here are why it&#39;s so important to (carefully, deliberately) <a href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">enhance HTML with proper HTTP Method support and more dynamic functionality</a>.</p>
