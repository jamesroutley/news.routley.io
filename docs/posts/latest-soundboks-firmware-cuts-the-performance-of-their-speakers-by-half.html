The output dB has decreased and when turned to &#34;11&#34; (yes, that&#39;s an actual featute) the speaker output power which used to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VNWFLlGNKwM">outright amazing</a> is now just meh and is what &#34;5&#34; was before the firmware update...</p><p>Now, as a reminder - I own two speakers - both speakers have had their performance nerfed by this firmware update.
