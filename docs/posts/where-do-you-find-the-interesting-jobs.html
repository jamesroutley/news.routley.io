I&#39;ve changed jobs a few times in recent years, every time I had interviews being told about interesting projects, great practices and so on, but once actually there was made to work on mind-numbing useless stuff.</p><p>It honestly makes me feel like my skills and time are being wasted. I&#39;ll be honest and say I consider myself to be pretty good at what I do (and it&#39;s been confirmed at my past jobs where I quickly get that reputation), but I just don&#39;t know where to find interesting opportunities that don&#39;t feel like either a grift or being a parasite making money out of arguably evil things.</p><p>How do you find interesting gigs?</p></td></tr>
