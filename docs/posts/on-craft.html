I was in PDX for a company off-site, where I got COVID (for the fourth time). I quarantined in a hotel until I was negative, then flew home and quarantined for a few more days in my home.</p>
<p>During this, I started playing around with the idea of rewriting my blog. I had tried this once about a year ago, and I found my partial rewrite did not work. I tried picking up the git branch I had started, but it was a mess, and COVID brain kept me from making any real progress.</p>
<p>A week after this, I went to a wedding in Bermuda for my friend Matt.</p>

<p>It was a lovely time, but in my free time, I started researching how to best rewrite a markdown / MDX blog. During this research I learned about two new things: <a href="https://contentlayer.dev/">contentlayer</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">NextJS 13&#39;s app router</a>.</p>
<p><em>contentlayer</em> is super cool. Basically it precompiles your content into Typescript so it can be imported and typed. It&#39;s a neat mix of static site builder while still separating the content and presentation of the content.</p>
<p><em>App Router</em> is slightly less exciting, but it was interesting to learn how Zeit was redesigning the developer experience of NextJS after all of this time.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out, but I have no doubt there are a few bugs (I thought I made the rss feed identical, but I apparently did not, for example). If you come across something missing, please file a bug at <a href="https://github.com/icco/writing/issues">https://github.com/icco/writing/issues</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:nat@natwelch.com">nat@natwelch.com</a></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
