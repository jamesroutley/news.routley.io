<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1mhntjh/unpopular_opinion_teacher_ai_use_is_already_out/"><p>I teach HS Science in the south. I can only speak for my district, but a few teacher work days in the wave of enthusiasm I&#39;m seeing for AI tools is overwhelming. We&#39;re getting district approved ads for AI tools by email, Admin and ICs are pushing it on us, and at least half of the teaching staff seems all in at this point.</p>
<p>I was just in a meeting with my team and one of the older teachers brought out a powerpoint for our first lesson and almost everyone agreed to use it after a quick scan - but it was missing important tested material, repetitive, and just totally airy and meaningless. Just slide after slide of the same handful of sentences rephrased with random loosely related stock photos. When I asked him if it was AI generated, he said &#39;of course&#39;, like it was a strange question. [...]</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have a leg to stand on to teach them anything about originality, academic integrity/intellectual honesty, or the importance of doing things for themselves when they catch us indulging in it just to save time at work.</p></blockquote>
