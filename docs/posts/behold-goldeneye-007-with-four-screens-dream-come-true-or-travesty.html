    <h1>Behold GoldenEye 007 with four screens – dream come true or travesty?</h1>

  <p id="90VV5D">Friends, the moment has arrived: the most influential first-person shooter in gaming history* has transcended the limitations of a single screen. Yes, <em>GoldenEye 007</em> for the Nintendo 64 can now be played <em>without screen cheating</em> because <a href="https://twitter.com/computermuseum/status/1521823363588624386">a British museum rigged up $10,000 worth of hardware to give each player their very own screen</a>. It’s all in honor of the game’s 25th anniversary. </p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4 screen GoldenEye on the original N64 hardware! No screencheating here! …but how? </p>— Computing History (@computermuseum) <a href="https://twitter.com/computermuseum/status/1521823363588624386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2022</a>

<p id="IqkKdl">As my former colleague <a href="https://gizmodo.com/goldeneye-007-gets-four-screen-multiplayer-using-10-00-1848885109">Andrew Liszewski at <em>Gizmodo </em>points out</a>, this would radically change the experience of one of the greatest multiplayer games of all time, one that required you and three friends to huddle around a boxy television when the game debuted 25 years ago. </p>
<p id="5d46OX">On that, we agree. But this?</p>
<blockquote><p id="DIKxgk">Multiplayer on a console before everything was connected to the internet wasn’t perfect, however. Four players had to share the same screen, which eliminated some FPS strategies like finding a secret place to camp and snipe at opponents.</p></blockquote>
<p id="zTW6as">Sacrilege, Liszewski!</p>
<p id="Vk5QaT">Yes, <em>GoldenEye</em>’s screen cheating eliminated camping and sniping — but that was a damn good thing in a single-joystick shooter where you can barely turn around and can’t freely aim while moving. Not to mention those situations when a sniper armed with a scoped AR33 is zoomed in on a sticky mine placed somewhere you can’t possibly see it when you round the corner, and you get instantly blown to kingdom come.</p>
<p id="asuRMx">Screen cheating made so many <em>GoldenEye</em> tricks tolerable because even if you weren’t actively peeking at the other corners of the TV to see exactly what your opponents were doing, you’d know they were setting up a trap when those corners stopped moving. I’ve played <em>GoldenEye</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12457748/goldeneye-007-source-mod-pc-remake-multplayer-gaming">unofficial PC multiplayer remake</a>, and it’s just not the same, with all the camping and sniping that the OG developers didn’t have to consider when they were building a game for Nintendo. </p>
<p id="fZ02zA">Admittedly, part of this is sour grapes! I would jump at the chance to try it if I could magically teleport to the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge this weekend; it’s part of <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/67834/25-Years-of-GoldenEye-Exhibition-7th-8th-May-2022/#">what sounds like an incredible exhibition</a>, which may <em>also</em> feature a<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267913/goldeneye-007-xbox-360-live-arcade-nintendo-64-remake-remaster-rare"> fully playable version of the canceled <em>GoldenEye Remastered</em></a> for the Xbox 360.</p>
<p id="it2lfC">Hopefully, the museum will also be preserving what it was like to <em>actually</em> play <em>GoldenEye </em>on a Nintendo 64, too. </p>
<p id="DCwcwn">BTW if you’re nostalgic for screen cheating, I would also highly recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301970/Screencheat/">trying <em>Screencheat</em> the PC game</a>, where you <em>have</em> to screen cheat because every player is invisible.</p>
