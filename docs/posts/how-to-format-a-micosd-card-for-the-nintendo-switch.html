    <h1>How to Format a micoSD Card for the Nintendo Switch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I burnt vastly too much time on this today, after having already figured this out a week ago, so here it goes in writing. In one sentence: format everything in exFAT and use the Master Boot Record partition scheme.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>Spoiler for my Y3Q1 quarterly reflection: this year my dorm room is awesome. One of the new goodies that we have is a TV, and so I brought my basically unused Switch out of retirement to see if console gaming might be entertaining now. It is! We’ve been playing the hits (Mario Kart, Overcooked, etc.) and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.loversinadangerousspacetime.com/" target="_blank">some indies</a>. And as the Switch’s popularity among my friends has grown, so has the demand for more games.</p><p>This, of course, presents an issue: games take up much space, and the onboard storage of the Switch is not infinite. So I ponied up for an upgrade to my existing external storage (8GB) and bought a 128GB microSD card off Amazon. Of course, I had at this point forgotten how I set up the first card.</p><p>I took a big, painful detour trying to create a disk image of the old card with Disk Utility, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html" target="_blank">SuperDuper</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">CCC7</a>, <code>hdiutil</code>, and <code>dd</code> before realizing that I could just copy the data like any other files (Nintendo conveniently puts everything in one top-level folder).</p><p>After that, the partition scheme was just trial and error.</p><p>I’m looking forward to the expansion: my first round of purchases includes <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://stray.iam8bit.com/en" target="_blank">Stray</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.factorio.com/" target="_blank">Factorio</a>, and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://interconnected.org/home/2025/10/23/wholesome" target="_blank">A Short Hike</a>. If the habit proves more permanent, I’m sure my now-dormant <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://backloggd.com/u/figbert/" target="_blank">Backloggd</a> will make its way onto my homepage.</p></div></div>
