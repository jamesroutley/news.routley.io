<h2 id="impossible-stuff-day"><a href="#impossible-stuff-day">Impossible Stuff Day</a></h2>
<p>Tuesday was <a href="https://pjg1.site/rc05#fn:1">Impossible Stuff Day</a> at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a">Recurse Center</a>, so I took this as an opportunity to do something I&#39;d been putting off for a while - cleaning the dust underneath the keys of my laptop by removing them.</p>
<p>It took about half a day - I started at around 5PM and ended at 1:30AM (with breaks of course). There was A LOT of dust in there.</p>
<p>My laptop was switched off the entire time, which meant I got lots of off-screen time aside from the occasional phone checks. I was TIRED by the time I was done, and the exhaustion continued into Wednesday as well.</p>
<h2 id="completing-cool-project-idea"><a href="#completing-cool-project-idea">Completing cool project idea</a></h2>
<p>I initially hoped to publish the code and write a post about it this week. However, getting the code to a publishable state took time as I basically ended up having to re-arrange and/or re-write parts of the code.</p>
<p>I did manage to fix some buggy parts of the code in the process, which was nice. I started drafting a post yesterday, and it should be up sometime this week.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-how-to-read-a-file-in-the-ext4-filesystem"><a href="#figuring-out-how-to-read-a-file-in-the-ext4-filesystem">Figuring out how to read a file in the ext4 filesystem</a></h2>
<p>I was reading an article from my Reading List - <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/series/reading-files-the-hard-way/part-3">Reading files the hard way - Part 3</a>. I&#39;d learnt about aspects of the ext4 filesystem from different articles, but didn&#39;t understand how they all connected together.</p>
<p>The latter half of the post explains this step by step through Rust code. Simply reading along was getting a little boring, so I decided it to port the code to C as I read the post!</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t completed the post yet, but I progressed enough to understand how it all works! Also somewhat figured how to read Rust code along the way, so that was a plus!</p>
<h2 id="slow-progress-on-mission-revamp"><a href="#slow-progress-on-mission-revamp">Slow progress on mission revamp</a></h2>
<p>I fell down a theme rabbit hole, and came out of it liking my original theme once again! There were some elements of the redesign I liked though, so I&#39;m slowly adding those changes in.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even get to the static site generator side of things, so I&#39;ll stick to my current setup for the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="reflections"><a href="#reflections">Reflections</a></h2>
<p>I generally tend to figure out what to do as the week progresses. This works for most things, except ones that take more effort to get started or aren&#39;t as fun.</p>
<p>As I have a bunch of those kind of tasks right now (writing a blog post, completing mission revamp, finishing up projects that are close to done), I&#39;m going to try being more structured this week and see how that goes.</p>
