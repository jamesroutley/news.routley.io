    <h1>Bashforth: A Forth interpreter, written as bash script</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
          <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This Forth interpreter, entirely written as bash script, is a FÂ³ (Fully Functional Forth), albeit a tad slow.
Some would call it &#34;sluggish&#34;. As rough indication, an ARM SBC which I&#39;m running Bashforth on takes about 15 second
for an empty loop of 100,000 iterations. It has built-in <em>doc</em> and <em>see</em> facilities, simplifying exploration of Bashforth.
Bashforth lacks floating point support and vocabularies, but comes with essentials like defining word builder,
exception handling. It also provides an extra string stack, along with a set of words, operating on string stack.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those interested in bashforth might like <a href="https://github.com/Bushmills/yoda">yoda</a> which does away with the virtual machine
and compiles directly to bash functions. As consequence can a substantial performance difference be realised (yoda is faster by a factor of somewhere between 30 and 50 times).</p>
