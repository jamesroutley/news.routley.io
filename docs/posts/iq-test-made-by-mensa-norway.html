        <p>Made by Mensa Norway</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>This online test gives an indication of general cognitive abilities, represented by an IQ-score between 85 and 145 where 100 is the population average. This test does not serve as a substitute for a professional intelligence test, such as those administrated by a psychologists or Mensa â€“ which has a license to offer a selection of intelligence tests.</p>
        <p>This test consists of 35 problems that must be solved within a 25 minute time limit. All the items consist of entirely visual patterns with progressive difficulty, and do not require specialized knowledge or mathematical skills. Each correct answer gives one point, and all items are weighted equally. There is no bonus for rapid completion or penalty for wrong answers so it is in your advantage to use the time well and to guess whenever unsure.</p><p>For the results to be as valid as possible, make sure that the room you sit in is properly ventilated and free from distractions and that you can work uninterrupted for 25 minutes.</p>
