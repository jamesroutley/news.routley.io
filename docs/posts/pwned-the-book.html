<p>The first time I ever wrote publicly about a company&#39;s security vulnerabilities, my boss came to have a word with me after seeing my name in the news headlines.</p><p>One of the worst days I&#39;ve ever had was right in the middle of the Have I Been Pwned sale process, and it left me an absolute emotional wreck.</p><p>When I wrote about how I deal with online abuse, it was off the back of some pretty nasty stuff... which I&#39;ve now included in this book ðŸ˜Š</p><p>These are the stories behind the stories and finally, the book about it all is here:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/10/Preview-Cover.jpg" alt="Pwned - The Collected Blog Posts of Troy Hunt"/></figure><p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/im-writing-a-book-with-rob-conery-and-its-gonna-be-awesome/">I announced the book back in April last year</a> after Rob, Charlotte and I had already invested a heap of effort before <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/pwned-the-collected-blog-posts-of-troy-hunt-preview/">releasing a preview in October</a>. I&#39;d hoped to have it out by Christmas... but it wasn&#39;t perfect. Ok, so it&#39;ll never be <em>perfect</em> without faults of any kind, but it had to meet an extremely high bar for me to be happy with an end result we could charge people money for. I completely rewrote the intro, changed a bunch of the posts we decided to include, reordered them all and edited a heap of the personal stuff. Rob wrote an <em>amazing </em>intro (I genuinely felt emotional reading it, given the time of both our lives he refers to), and both Charlotte and I wrote pieces at the end of it all. That bit in particular is <em>very </em>personal, and it&#39;s what was the most natural to us at the time. With our wedding being only next week, it just felt... right. That&#39;s why we&#39;re publishing today; to get this story about the earlier phases of my life out before the next phase begins. There are things we both wanted to say, and I hope you enjoying reading them ðŸ˜Š</p><p>We actually pushed the book out to a preview audience a couple of weeks ago and requested feedback to make it even better before releasing to the masses. We got two kinds of feedback: typos, which we&#39;ve now fixed and testimonials, which have been <em>awesome:</em></p><blockquote>Great read! Troy has the technical know-how, and is able to effectively communicate complex topics so that anyone understands them. The personal stories kept me hooked!</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>I haven&#39;t been able to put the book down.</strong> The added intros and epilogue on each post in particular and the retrospectives from today&#39;s perspective are particularly interesting... Captivating stuff, apart from infosec, you really feel as though <strong>youâ€™ve been taken on a journey with Troy</strong> through the years of living in paradise a.k.a. Gold Coast, craft beer, good coffeeâ€™s, travel and jet skis. Top of my list for resources I point anyone new to the space to. Simply Outstanding read - 10/10.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Love, love, LOVE the intros</strong> - i&#39;m only familiar with Lars in terms of his online identity and videos, but the &#34;commendations&#34; from Richard Campbell, and in particular Rob Conery are fantastic and really anchor an emotional aspect to the book, that i was not expecting. Great to see a book deliver this authenticity - we&#39;re all only human after all!. I &#34;cheated&#34; and also skipped to read Charlotte&#39;s epilogue and again was blown away by the depth and genuine nature of the emotion on display. <strong>I honestly was not expecting there to be so much heart on display, but am very glad there is</strong>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A famous American newsman used to call this &#34;The rest of the story.&#34; <strong>This is the kind of insight that only comes with time</strong>, as the author can reflect and pick out important details that didn&#39;t get the coverage they deserved and these then find a life of their own. This book provides &#34;the rest of the story&#34; behind other stories which broke months or years ago. <strong>It gives these stories new life</strong>, and new significance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PWNED! Troy Hunt takes us on his life journey, ups and downs, explaining how haveIbeenpwned came to be, raising awareness of the worldâ€™s poor password and online security habits... <strong>This book has it all</strong>. Plenty of tech, data breaches, career hacks, IoT, Cloud, password management, application security, and more, <strong>delivered in a fun way</strong>. This info is gold, and has improved and complemented my career in IT, and also my digital life at home too. I highly recommend this book as it explains cyber security so well, and hope you <strong>have your eureka moment</strong> and improve your cyber hygiene too.</blockquote><p>I never imagined turning blog posts into a book, but here we are, and it&#39;s come out awesome ðŸ˜Ž This book is a labour of love the three of us have poured ourselves into over the last couple of years. It&#39;s a personal story I&#39;m publishing at a very personal time and it&#39;s now live at <a href="https://book.troyhunt.com/">book.troyhunt.com</a></p>
