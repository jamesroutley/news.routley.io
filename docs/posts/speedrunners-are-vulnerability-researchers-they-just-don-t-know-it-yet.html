<p>Thousands of video game enthusiasts are developing experience in the cybersecurity industry by accident. They have a fun hobby, pouring over the details of their favorite games, and they don&#39;t know they could be doing something very similar… by becoming a vulnerability researcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That probably requires some backstory, especially from a cybersecurity company&#39;s blog!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-a-speedrun">What&#39;s a speedrun?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Basically as soon as video games were released, people have been trying to beat them faster than their friends (or enemies) can. Gamers will do this for practically any game on the planet – but the most popular games, or the ones with the most cultural weight and cultish following, naturally end up with the fiercest competition. Speedrunners will run through their favorite game hundreds or thousands of times in order to get to get to the top of community-driven leaderboards for the fastest time… which puts incentives on that video game&#39;s community to find the <em>absolute fastest</em> way to clear the game, no matter how strange.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#34;Any percent&#34; speedruns, or &#34;any%&#34; more commonly, are usually one of the most popular categories of speedrun for any given game. In it, all rules are off and no weird behavior is disallowed: intentionally triggering bugs in the game, which the developers never intended for the players to be able to perform, often have the potential to shave double-digit percentages of time off existing routes by cutting out entire swathes of the game from having to be played at all. Why do 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 if you can do a cool trick and skip from 1 -&gt; 3 directly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of these glitches revolve around extremely precise movement… but for the most dedicated fans, they&#39;ll go even further.</p>

<h2 id="h-glitch-hunting-is-reverse-engineering">Glitch hunting is reverse engineering</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entire groups will spring up inside a game&#39;s speedrunning community dedicated to discovering new glitches, and oftentimes they&#39;ll apply <em>engineering</em> to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These enthusiasts won&#39;t just try weird things in the game over and over (although that definitely helps!) – they&#39;ll use tools that are standard in the cybersecurity industry to pull apart how software works internally, such as <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>IDA Pro</span></a> or <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Ghidra</span></a>, to discover <em>exactly</em> what makes their target video game tick. On top of static analysis, they&#39;ll leverage dynamic analysis as well: glitch hunters will use dynamic introspection and debugging tools, like the Dolphin Emulator’s memory viewer or Cheat Engine, to get a GDB-like interface for figuring out the program&#39;s internal data structures and how information is recorded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even further, they&#39;ll develop entirely new tooling: I&#39;ve seen groups like the <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em> community reverse engineer game file formats and <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>create Ghidra program loaders</span></a>, or other groups completely re-implement Ghidra disassembled code in C so they can stick it under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>fuzzer</span></a> in isolation. Some of the speedrun glitch hunters are incredibly technically competent, using the exact same tooling and techniques that people in the cybersecurity industry use for reverse engineering every day.</p>

<h2 id="h-and-it-s-vulnerability-research">…And it’s vulnerability research</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only do these groups do reverse engineering, but they also are doing <em>vulnerability research.</em> Remember, they don&#39;t only try to figure out how games work, but they try to break the game in any way possible. These glitches end up looking stunningly similar to how memory corruption exploits work for any other computer program: they&#39;ll find <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/how-security-flaws-work-the-buffer-overflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>buffer overflows</span></a>, <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>use-after-frees</span></a>, and incorrect state machine transitions in their target games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And perhaps most impressively, they&#39;ll <em>productize</em> their exploits, unlike a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry. Some vulnerability researchers will develop a proof-of-concept to demonstrate a bug – but never actually develop the technical chops on how that exploit would need to be developed further for an adversary to <em>use</em> it. They might intellectually know how to weaponize a buffer overflow, or a use-after-free, but speedrunning groups by necessity are actually <em>doing</em> it. Oftentimes, actually using these glitches requires working through extremely restrictive constraints, both for what inputs they have control over and what parts of the program they can influence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Super Mario World</em> runners will place items in extremely precise locations so that the X,Y coordinates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14wqBA5Q1yc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>form shellcode</span></a> they can jump to with a dangling reference. <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> players will do <a href="https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/srm/srm-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>heap grooming</span></a> and write a function pointer using the IEEE-754 floating point number bit representation so the game “wrong warps” directly to the end credit sequence... with nothing more than a game controller and a steady hand.</p>

<p>Some of the game communities will even take it a step further! Tool-assisted speedruns, or &#34;TAS&#34; runs, will perform glitches so precise that they can&#39;t reliably be performed by human beings <em>at all</em>. They&#39;ll leverage frame-by-frame input recordings in order to hit the right angle on a game controller&#39;s stick, every time; they&#39;ll hit buttons on the exact video game tick, every time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And because they have such precise control over their actions in games, they&#39;ll likewise be able to consider game glitches with exacting precision. TAS authors are able to leverage inspecting the video game with memory debuggers to craft a use-after-free with the perfect heap spray, or <a href="https://tasvideos.org/5384S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>write multiple stages</span></a> of shellcode payload in their player inventory with button presses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There&#39;s even an entire event at the most popular speedrunning conference, Awesome Games Done Quick/AGDQ, called &#34;TASbot.&#34; During it, a robot does all the inputs via a hard-wired controller to perform a tool-assisted speedrun in <em>real time</em> – so it can do things like get arbitrary code execution and use that to replace the video game with an entirely new one, using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnZ2NNYySuE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>nothing but controller inputs</span></a>.</p>

<p>The fact these people are so technically competent only throws in stark relief how disconnected some of them are from the larger cybersecurity industry. Speedrun glitch hunters will develop heap use-after-free exploits, with accompanied technical write-ups on the level of Google Project Zero… and in doing so, refer to it as an &#34;item storage&#34; glitch, because they developed the knowledge from first principles without ever reading a <a href="https://phrack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Phrack</span></a> article. They&#39;ll re-implement disassembled code from Ghidra in C for automated glitch discovery, but without any exposure to <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>American Fuzzy Lop</span></a> or the large academic body of work driving fuzzer research.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, critically for us here at Zetier, they don&#39;t know you can get paid to do a job <em>very</em> close to finding video game glitches, and so they don&#39;t know to apply to our reverse engineering or vulnerability research <a href="https://zetier.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>job postings</span></a>. A lot of these video game glitch hunters, even the ones writing novel Ghidra loaders or runtime memory analysis scripts, don&#39;t think of what they&#39;re doing as anything more than a fun hobby; they might go become a normal software engineer, if that. Some of them will look up &#34;IDA Pro&#34; on LinkedIn and see a million malware analysis job postings. No offense to my malware analysis friends, but malware reverse engineering and vulnerability research are two very different roles!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vulnerability research in industry, unlike more “normal” malware analysis jobs, is usually in the form of an engineer spending significant time investigating exactly how a program works. Like video game glitch discovery, they don’t just care about <em>what</em> it does, but <em>how</em> it does it – and <em>why</em> the authors implemented it in that way, along with how that behavior may affect other parts of the program. Oftentimes, you end up building up a repertoire of small, innocuous “huh that’s weird”-style bugs that are individually useless… until you find some missing piece. And like game glitches, the most satisfying of discoveries on the job are from realizations that there’s a fundamental gap in thinking by the authors, where you don’t just find one glitch but an entire <em>family</em> of glitches, all from the same root cause.</p>

<p>I personally love reading the technical game glitch write-ups that come out of speedrunning communities. Lots of my coworkers, and other people in the industry, likewise enjoy them. I love glitch write-ups <em>because</em> they remind me of the great parts of my job: extremely deep dives into the internals of how programs work, and working around odd constraints. Exploiting vulnerabilities requires performing mental gymnastics in order to chain seemingly innocuous primitives, like <a href="https://archives.glitchcity.info/forums/board-110/thread-7770/page-0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>walking around</span></a> out-of-bounds in Pokemon, together to <em>do the thing</em> in a way that allows the author to express their creativity and mastery over a piece of software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking to people in speedrunning communities who love pouring over Assembly, or figuring out exactly what the implications are for a 1-byte buffer overflow in a textbox, only for them to shrug and explain they&#39;re reluctantly working in a non-technical industry, comes across to me as a shame. If any of these descriptions speak to you, or bring to mind one of your friends, reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@zetier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hello@zetier.com</span></a>.
