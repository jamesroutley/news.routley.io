    <h1>Dagger Python SDK: Develop Your CI/CD Pipelines as Code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are proud to introduce the <a href="https://docs.dagger.io/sdk/python">Dagger Python SDK</a>: a new way to develop your CI/CD pipelines as code and run them anywhere.</p>
<p>​
<strong>The Dagger Python SDK may be a good fit if you are...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Python developer wishing your CI pipelines were Python code that you can run locally in seconds, instead of YAML that can only run on a proprietary service</li>
<li>A developer who needs CI/CD, and is looking for an excuse to learn Python</li>
<li>Your team&#39;s &#34;designated devops person&#34;, hoping to replace a pile of artisanal scripts with something more powerful</li>
<li>A platform engineer writing custom Python tooling, with the goal of unifying continuous delivery across organizational silos</li>
<li>A data engineer looking to better integrate with your organization&#39;s CI/CD pipelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just two weeks ago we announced the <a href="https://docs.dagger.io/sdk/go">Dagger Go SDK</a>, and will continue to release more SDKs in the future. Our ultimate goal is to ensure all developers can develop their CI/CD pipelines with the language of their choice, and enjoy all the benefits of running them with Dagger.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a different SDK, let us know by <a href="https://blocklayer.typeform.com/to/a6m5gKSS?typeform-source=deploy-preview-1019--dagger-io.netlify.app">filling this form</a>. We will notify you when your SDK is ready.</p>
<p><strong>What is Dagger again?</strong></p>
<p>Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs your pipelines in containers.</p>
<p><strong>Programmable:</strong> develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.</p>
<p><strong>Runs your pipelines in containers:</strong> Dagger executes your pipelines entirely as <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">standard OCI containers</a>. This has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant local testing</li>
<li>Portability: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service.</li>
<li>Superior caching: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere</li>
<li>Compatibility with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline</li>
<li>Cross-language instrumentation: teams can use each other’s tools without learning each other’s language</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Dagger Python SDK in Action</strong></h3>
<p>In this demo, we’ll show you how to create a CI tool to test your Python application against multiple Python versions.</p>
