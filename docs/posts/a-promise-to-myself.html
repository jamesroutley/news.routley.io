    <h1>A promise to myself</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The year is half-over. It is 10:40 PM on June 30. I&#39;m fighting against the clock.</p>
<p>Every month since last September, I&#39;ve posted an essay to liquidbrain.net. Now, my streak is in doubt.</p>
<p>This blog has lost steam. I&#39;m a journalist (in training) now; every word I write here is a word I could have written for work. We&#39;ll see how I manage the transition; it&#39;s been rough so far.</p>
<p>Yet whether I&#39;m prolific here, and whether anyone reads this, I want to keep a promise to myself that I never made.</p>
<p>I want to keep writing this blog.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I&#39;ve been reflecting recently on whether I enjoy writing. I think I do, but only in those final moments before the deadline, where all I can focus is on the page. Before I start, I&#39;m a wreck of constipated expectation.</p>
<p>The only way I write is by forcing myself to take out a notebook. I dread that moment; I hate the first few hours; and then ... it&#39;s okay.</p>
<p>Every first sentence I make is a promise to myself.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It&#39;s 11:00 PM now. I have to go.</p>
