    <h1>Kaspersky exposes hidden malware on GitHub stealing personal data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Kaspersky Global Research &amp; Analysis Team (GReAT) discovered hundreds of open source repositories with multistaged malware targeting gamers and cryptoinvestors within a new campaign that was dubbed by Kaspersky as GitVenom. The infected projects include an automation instrument for interacting with Instagram accounts, a Telegram bot that enables the remote management of Bitcoin wallets and a crack tool to play the Valorant game. All of this alleged project functionality was fake, and cybercriminals behind the campaign stole personal and banking data and hijacked cryptowallet addresses from the clipboard. As a result of the malicious activity cybercriminals were able to steal 5 Bitcoins (around $485,000 at the time of investigation). Kaspersky detected the use of the infected repositories worldwide, with most cases in Brazil, Turkiye, and Russia.</strong></p><div><p>These repositories have
        been stored on GitHub, a platform that allows developers to manage and share
        their code, for several years. The attackers strived to make the repositories
        on GitHub appear legitimate to potential targets by using attractive project
        descriptions that have likely been generated with AI. If the code from these
        repositories was launched, the victim’s device would become infected with
        malware and could be remotely controlled by the attackers. </p>

<p>While the projects were
        written in multiple programming languages – Python, JavaScript, C, C++ and C# –
    the malicious payloads stored inside the infected projects had the same
        goal: to download other malicious components from an attacker-controlled GitHub
        repository and execute them. These components include a stealer that collects passwords,
        bank account information, saved credentials, cryptocurrency
        wallet data and browsing history, packs it into a .7z archive and uploads it to
        attackers via Telegram.</p><p><em><img alt="Data sent to the attackers" src="https://content.kaspersky-labs.com/fm/press-releases/81/81cc46e79c8143553786198bbf8c74d6/processed/gitvenom-illustration-q93.png"/></em><em>Structure of the
            archive which the stealer sends to attackers</em></p>

<p>Other downloaded
        malicious components include remote administration tools that can be used to remotely monitor and control a victim’s computer
        through a secure encrypted connection, and a clipboard hijacker
        which searches the clipboard contents for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and
        replaces them with attacker-controlled ones. Notably, the attacker-controlled
        Bitcoin wallet received a sum of about 5 BTC (approximately $485,000 at the
        time of research) in November 2024.</p>

<p>“<em>As code sharing platforms such as GitHub are used by millions of
            developers worldwide, threat actors will certainly continue using fake software
            as an infection lure in the future. For that reason, it is crucial to handle processing
            of third-party code very carefully. Before attempting to run such code or
            integrate it into an existing project, it is paramount to thoroughly check what
            actions are performed by it. This way, it will be very easy to spot fake
            projects and prevent malicious code placed in them from being used to
            compromise the development environment</em>,” comments Georgy Kucherin, Security
        Researcher at Kaspersky GReAT.</p><p>Read more on <a href="https://securelist.com/gitvenom-campaign/115694/" target="_blank">Securelist.com</a>. </p>
