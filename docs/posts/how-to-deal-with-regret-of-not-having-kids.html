    <h1>Ask HN: How to deal with regret of not having kids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>&#34;75% of the time we spend with our kids in our lifetime will be spent by age 12&#34;</p><p>I was one of those ppl that made the decision of not having kids. I am a 40 yr old man now. This was the single worst decision I&#39;ve ever made in my whole life. My spouse is 39 so the window has closed for biological children, more or less.</p><p>My life is now dominated by regret every day. I just can&#39;t get over that feeling. I&#39;ve tried many things like therapy, counseling ect. It only helps for a little bit but I am still doing therapy. Some nights I wake up with panic and stay up all night with shallow breathing and high heart rate.</p><p>I used to LOVE working and all things tech, now just make do and do bare minimum to not get fired. I &#39;ve gotten few promotions here and there but nowhere near my potential of where my career could&#39;ve been. Everything is just secondary, nothing is interesting.</p><p>I am constantly triggered by families and young kids. Even reading that post sent my heart rate soaring (apple watch) with anxiety . I just don&#39;t know what to do, its too unbearable. I fantasize about things like getting cancer and that seems to calm me down a little bit. Sometimes I fantasize about leaving my spouse, who I love to death, find someone who I can have a child with.</p></div></div></div>
