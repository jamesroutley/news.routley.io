	<p><a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2024/vertical-monitor-time/">Turning one of my monitors vertical</a> appeared to exacerbate an issue with the power button to the point where it stopped working. I did my first soldering job in years and was able to get it working again, so I’m documenting it.</p>
<p>The power button on my LG 27UL500-W is a 4-direction control stick with a center push action for power functions and navigating the OSD. The center push action had always felt stiffer than on my other monitor and sometimes it wouldn’t register, but a stronger repeat push made it work. Until Thursday, that is.</p>
<p>I went looking for workarounds. There’s a number of macOS utilities that will let you change the backlight brightness over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel">DDC</a>, but none will let you change inputs or other settings. Same for LG’s OnScreen Control, which is a heinous excuse of a program that refused to detect my monitors on macOS. On Windows it confused the rotation of the vertical panel, leaving me with a comically sideways cursor on the horizontal panel locked inside an invisible bounding box. I’m not even sure why it was trying to handle rotation anyway, I didn’t ask it to. I uninstalled it in a rage.</p>
<p>The warranty expired a few years ago and I had nothing stopping me from tearing the monitor apart. Multifunction buttons have burned me in the past, as they’re usually sealed shut inside a plastic box and impossible to repair, but I figured I’d at least take a look and see if I could get a replacement part off eBay.</p>

</div>

<p>First thing was to pull the rear housing off. There’s one screw on the back and then I had to slowly work my way around the front bezel, unsnapping it as I went. The front bezel doesn’t come off all the way because the bottom has a couple screws attached to the metal frame behind the power button.</p>

</div>

<p>With the rear housing off I had access to the power button housing—it’s the white plastic thing at the bottom center of the panel. While the logic board and power components are covered by a metal box, I must emphasize that even while unplugged it’s still possible to encounter spicy levels of current lurking inside the capacitors in the power supply. Be careful if you try this at home.</p>

</div>

<p>I disconnected the power button module from the logic board and pulled it out. I removed the cable and detached the circuit board from the housing—it’s attached with two little plastic clips straight through the board.</p>

  </picture>


</div>

<p>With the circuit board out, the last part to remove to get to the button itself was the plastic power button-shaped hat. The hat was stuck on there real good, so I heated up my soldering iron and held it in the air between the plastic hat and the top of the button for a few seconds, and then I was able to pull it right off.</p>
<p>While my soldering iron was hot enough to get the hat off, it struggled when it came to desoldering the button itself. I set it to the max temp, waited a few minutes, and then pulled out my infrared thermometer to take a ballpark reading. The soldering iron got nowhere close to its set temp.</p>

<p>I checked the tip and it looked absolutely abysmal; I think it’s the original tip that came with the soldering iron when I bought it in 2016. I looked at ordering new tips, but then the intrusive <em>what ifs</em> started popping up in my mind, and I fast-forwarded to a completely ridiculous and improbable Catch-22 situation where I might need to repair the soldering iron controller with a soldering iron. Okay brain, checkmate, you win.</p>
<p>I remembered my pal Nathan recently <a href="https://nthp.me/blog/2025/bad-tools/">wrote about the Pinecil V2</a>. A quick email confirmed he still liked his, so into the virtual cart it went, along with new tips for the old one. Everything arrived Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>It tickles me to know that there’s an operating system aptly named IronOS running on a tiny RISC-V processor in there. It has a cute little display on the side that <em>rotates</em> when you switch hands! And the temp readout is super helpful. But does it melt the extra tough lead free solder they use for mass produced electronics?</p>

</div>

<p>Yes it does. Desoldering was still a tedious process though. I had two pads to work on, and the golden tube that goes pop (I can’t remember the name) couldn’t vacuum up the solder, so I slowly worked the solder bead off the edge of the metal plate that wraps across the top of the plastic button housing.</p>

  </picture>


</div>

<p>Pulling off the metal plate revealed the inside of the button housing, with a sheet of five little discs. Each of the discs are a button whose function is similar to the freshness indicator on the lid of a jam jar. I held my screwdriver near them and they leapt out of the housing to stick to the tip.</p>
<div>

  </picture>


</div>

<p>These button sheets are super thin and smaller than a pencil eraser. Their size made them incredibly difficult to work with, and I quickly discovered all my tools—even my tweezers—are magnetized, compounding things. The middle disc in the sheet is for the malfunctioning push action, and the surrounding four are for navigation.</p>
<p>And this is where I discovered the issue. The bottom left of the photo above shows a discolored button sheet and a detached circle. The circle was at the bottom of the stack of button sheets, in the center where the malfunctioning push action is. Both the circle and the button sheet that rests on top of it show signs of overheating and corrosion, which at first I thought was from desoldering, but then I saw the tiny wear marks on top of the discoloring. Which combined with the fact that this button was acting up from the beginning leads me to believe that it came from the factory like this.</p>

</div>

<p>I got the meter out to do continuity testing, and found that the center contact point connected with the middle of the three pads exiting the southwest side. I put the button sheets back in the same way they came out and pushed the tip of one my meter leads directly down the middle to simulate a button press, and had no continuity.</p>

  </picture>


</div>

<p>Nothing a little DeOxIt and a q-tip can’t solve though. After cleaning the contacts on the bottom I restacked the button sheets with one of the shinier sheets at the bottom and the discolored one in the middle. I left out the detached circle part in the center because it was going to be impossible to get it back in there. And the scratchy beeps of my meter confirmed that we were making contact again. Just to be sure, I put the plastic actuator and metal lid back on and had Lauren press the button for me while I held the leads in place.</p>

</div>

<p>Next, I resoldered the metal lid back on and brought the panel over to do a quick test. Pushing the button brought up the OSD immediately. Success!</p>

</div>

<p>The button is a lot less stiff to operate and I can change inputs again. And my old soldering iron from 2016 appears to be working a lot better with the new tips.</p>
