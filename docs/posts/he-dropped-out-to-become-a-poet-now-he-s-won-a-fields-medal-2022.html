						<p>We use a security system called <a href="http://cloudflare.com" onclick="__gaTracker(&#39;send&#39;, &#39;event&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://cloudflare.com&#39;, &#39;CloudFlare&#39;);">CloudFlare</a> to help protect the website from malware, “Denial of Service” attacks, and other nasty things. 99.99% of the time it works great. But every now and then we get a “false positive” and somebody cannot access the website, even though they’ve done nothing wrong. If you’re reading this, that’s probably you.</p>
<p>The most common reasons this can happen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re using a browser the system doesn’t recognize or your browser is configured in a way that makes CloudFlare nervous.</li>
<li>You’re connecting from an IP address that has previously been used for malicious activity. (That doesn’t necessarily mean it was you!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you have been inappropriately blocked, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:quanta@simonsfoundation.org?subject=Quanta Blocked">quanta@simonsfoundation.org</a> so we can assist you.</p>
<p>We certainly apologize for the inconvenience and hope you will return soon.</p>
