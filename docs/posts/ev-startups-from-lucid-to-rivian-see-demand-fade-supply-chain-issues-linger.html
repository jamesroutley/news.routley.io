    <h1>EV startups from Lucid to Rivian see demand fade, supply chain issues linger</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">SAN FRANCISCO, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle startups are seeing an unsettling trend, with demand evaporating as potential customers look for deals or hold off on purchases altogether.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">Quarterly reports from several companies indicated weakening interest for many of their newer products, a bad sign for companies wrestling with high costs.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Luxury sedan maker Lucid <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/LCID.O" target="_blank">(LCID.O)</a>, pickup and SUV maker Rivian <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/RIVN.O" target="_blank">(RIVN.O)</a> and electric semi truck maker Nikola <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NKLA.O" target="_blank">(NKLA.O)</a> all flagged economic pressure, with industry experts saying price cuts by industry behemoth Tesla and the availability of cheaper EV models from traditional automakers sapped demand for the startups&#39; new vehicles.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">An exception was Fisker <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FSR.N" target="_blank">(FSR.N)</a>, which has barely kicked off production of a $37,499 SUV. That is one of the cheapest prices in the EV group, and Fisker, which has produced only 56 vehicles so far, saw orders improve.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The Model Y from Tesla &lt;TSLA.O&gt; retails for at least $54,990 after recent price cuts, Rivian&#39;s R1S SUV is priced around $78,000 and Lucid sells its Air Pure sedans for about $87,400.</p><div data-testid="Latest Updates" data-variant-id="article-latest-updates"><div><h3 data-testid="Heading">Latest Updates</h3><p data-testid="Body">View 2 more stories<!-- --> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11 7" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10.413.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0L5.5 4.474 1.613.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0 .709.709 0 0 0 0 1.027l4.4 4.4c.147.147.367.22.513.22a.79.79 0 0 0 .513-.22l4.4-4.4a.71.71 0 0 0 0-1.027h.001Z"></path></svg></p></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Shares of Rivian fell about 13%, while those of Lucid, Nikola and Fisker were down between 2% and 4%.

And on the other hand, inflation, creating a situation where a consumer is thinking hard about the choices that they make now.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">New federal incentives of up to $7,500 for electric cars made in America raised expectations that demand in the sector would jump, although conditions for what counts as U.S.-made have tempered enthusiasm.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Tesla also ignited a price war this year by aggressively slashing vehicle prices, financially secure in its industry-leading profit margins.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">By contrast, Lucid <a data-testid="Link" href="https://reut.rs/3Y9AsSb" target="_blank">reported</a> a slump in reservations to over 28,000 as of Feb. 21 from 34,000 on Nov. 7, adding it would not disclose the number going ahead. Nikola <a data-testid="Link" href="https://reut.rs/3Z7QhKz" target="_blank">said</a> issues hurting demand for its battery-powered trucks would not ease any time soon.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Rivian <a data-testid="Link" href="https://reut.rs/3kyIvKB" target="_blank">forecast</a> 2023 production well below analyst estimates on Tuesday, citing nagging supply chain shortages, sending shares down 8% in after-hours trading.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">&#34;Certainly, what we&#39;re witnessing in the macro and what we&#39;re seeing in terms of interest rate is ... across the industry, having an effective moderating overall demand,&#34; Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said on a Tuesday conference call.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Rivian did not provide current orders, a number they have updated every quarter.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Lucid and Nikola shares have fallen about 9% and 5% respectively since releasing results, while Fisker has jumped 31% since reporting a rise in orders.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Venture capitalist Cassie Bowe, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, sees demand picking up from next year as the current sentiment forces EV makers to cut prices and introduce lower-priced models this year, and as the supply chain improves.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Bowe oversees investments in a host of startups, including EV charging companies, and said she was looking at investment opportunities in EV makers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">But the four companies have already lost a combined $84 billion in value over the past year, given production woes and supply chain disruptions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">&#34;Across the world, there&#39;s a little dose of realism that&#39;s coming in saying, maybe the targets that have been set up for EVs aren&#39;t realistic and cannot be achieved,&#34; said Bala Lakshman, a partner at KPMG&#39;s automotive strategy advisory.</p><figure data-testid="graphic-1"><div><div data-testid="StatefulImage"><div data-testid="Image"></div></div></div><figcaption data-testid="Body">Production, delivery issues and demand concerns have weighed on the shares</figcaption></figure><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Bernadette Baum</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
