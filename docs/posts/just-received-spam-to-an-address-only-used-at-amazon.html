    <h1>Ask HN: Just received spam to an address only used at Amazon?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Like many of us I have an email address for Amazon (.co.uk) which I don&#39;t use anywhere else.</p><p>A few minutes ago, I received a pretty nonsense spam mail to that address.</p><p>I contacted Amazon support who said &#39;we&#39;re investigating&#39; in a way that made me think I might not be alone.. and advised I forward it on to stop-spoofing@amazon.com.</p><p>Just curious if anyone else has recently had similar?</p><p>(To head it off: no it shouldn&#39;t be third-party sellers - they don&#39;t get your email, any disputes etc. are through a unique-id@marketplace.amazon.co.uk address in my experience.)</p></div></div></div>
