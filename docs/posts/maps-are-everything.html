    <h1>Maps Are Everything</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>About 3 months ago, I woke up with an idea in my head: maps<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, as they are often used in programming, are frozen computation. I had a vague idea how to represent various types of computation and data structures in terms of maps, and I wrote <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/mae">a prototype of a programming language</a> to see what it would look like. I mostly left it alone after that.</p>
<p>I had assumed that one could make something akin to a lambda calculus with maps, but at this point computation (as functions) was a separate concept from data (as maps). I shared the language with a few esolang-minded friends from the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and gave a little lightning talk about it. Someone suggested that it was similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano’s arithmetic using sets</a>, and I saw the connection right away. At that point something clicked.</p>
<p>I realized that, if I wanted to, I could define a (pure) function as simply a possibly infinite, lazy set that maps inputs to outputs by computation. In fact, this is not even that much of a mind-bending idea.</p>
<p>Equipped with the knowledge that would enable me to reconcile the differences between functions and maps, I got to work again, and produced a version of mae that simply had finite data maps, and infinite computation maps. Well, and names. And an incidental Lisp syntax, because it is easy to parse even without a parser.</p>
<p>Let’s discover how to define absolutely everything as maps while slowly descending into the realm of the unspeakable, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="section"><code>{}</code></h2>
<p>First, let’s define booleans.</p>
<pre><code>; false is the empty map
(def false {})

; true is the map with one entry
(def true {{} {}}))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 1: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.
</p>
<p>We define <code>false</code> to be the empty map. This will come in handy later. Similarly, <code>true</code> as the map with one entry, mapping the empty map to the empty map, is a very simple and somewhat sleek definition.</p>
<p>Of course, we could also define any map that isn’t empty to be <code>true</code>, but I’d like to make that explicit.</p>
<pre><code>; empty is the same as false
(def empty {})

; empty? maps its input to whether it is equal to
; the empty map or not
(def empty? {(m) -&gt; (= m empty)})

; neg negates booleans by mapping false to true
; and true to false
(def neg {true false false true})

(def truthy? {(m) -&gt; (neg (empty? m))})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: Truthiness.
</p>
<p>We introduced a different concept in Figure 2, computational/infinite maps, and this bears explanation. Computational maps take a list of inputs in parentheses and an expression that turns this into an output, separated by an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). You could think of this as an anonymous function with arguments and body, but where would be the fun in that?</p>
<p>Knowing this, when we look at <code>empty?</code>, we see that it takes a map <code>m</code> and computes emptiness by comparing it to the empty map <code>{}</code>. <code>=</code> is a builtin.</p>
<p>Side tidbit to understand how we use <code>neg</code>: data maps can be indexed into by applying them to an argument. This means that if I were to call <code>(neg true)</code>, this would be the same as using <code>neg[true]</code> in some of the more conventional—read: boring—programming languages.</p>
<p>With booleans out of the way, let’s define conditionals. <code>if</code> should be enough to be worthwhile.</p>
<pre><code>; if takes a condition, a then and an else branch
; and produces the result of either branch
(def if
  {(cond then else) -&gt;
    ({true then false else} cond)})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: <code>if</code> as a map.
</p>
<p>Using all we know about maps now, we conjure conditionals from the abyss by building a boolean map and indexing into it with our condition. We map <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to our branches and then use <code>cond</code> to select the right one.</p>
<p>This is well and good, but we usually expect <code>if</code> to be lazy, and to only compute the branches when it takes them. We can rectify this by summoning another set of our trusty parentheses.</p>
<pre><code>(def if
  {(cond then else) -&gt;
    (({true then false else} cond))})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: lazy <code>if</code> as a map.
</p>
<p>The difference is barely noticeable, but deep. Let’s see it in action before I even try to explain it:</p>
<pre><code>; prn soils our beautiful pure garden by cementing
; the pillar of outputting values (“printing”) in
; its middle

; old: it will print both true and false
(if true (prn true) (prn false))

; new: it will only print true
(if true {() -&gt; (prn true)} {() -&gt; (prn false)})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: <code>if</code> in action.
</p>
<p>This particular spell, like many others, was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates">the scripture of λ</a>, reimagined to include our new prophet <code>{}</code>.</p>
<p>We now have booleans and a way of working with them.</p>
<h2 id="section-1"><code>{{} {}}</code></h2>
<p>Even further in the eldritch deeps lurk numbers. They have a convenient way of being summoned through literals, but do not let their form deceive you: numbers are maps.</p>
<pre><code>0 ; =&gt; {}
1 ; =&gt; {{} {}}
2 ; =&gt; {{} {} {{} {}} {}}</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: Numbers and their true forms.
</p>
<p>Each number contains the previous number as its key alongside all the numbers before it. This form shows how linked <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are to the concept of truth, resembling <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Every hammer is both a weapon and a tool.</p>
<p>To work with numbers, we need to be able to increment them and decrement them.</p>
<pre><code>; add and rem are primitives
; add merges two or more maps
; rem removes a key (and its value) from a map

; filter filters a map using a predicate—we
; will define it later

; inc takes a number and returns the number
; one greater by folding it into itself
(def inc {(n) -&gt; (add n {n {}})})

; dec takes a number and returns the number
; one lesser by removing the entry that, when
; removed, is equal to the map
(def dec
  {(n) -&gt;
    (filter {(k v) -&gt; (neg (= (rem n k) k))} n)})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 7: Incrementing and decrementing.
</p>
<p>The structure of our number sigils draw the magic circles that transform them.</p>
<p>Our powers include arithmetic now. Because I gave you a glimpse of our full powers of folding and filtering, let’s use them to grow and shrink our numbers.</p>
<pre><code>; foldr is reduce, it accumulates

; we trick foldr into bending into addition
(def +
  {(m n) -&gt; (foldr {(k v acc) -&gt; (inc acc)} m n)})

; a sleight of the other hand, and we have
; subtraction
(def -
  {(m n) -&gt; (foldr {(k v acc) -&gt; (dec acc)} m n)})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 8: Growing and shrinking.
</p>
<p>We clap our hands, and the numbers dance.</p>
<h2 id="section-2"><code>{{} {} {{} {}} {}}</code></h2>
<p>Our spellbook needs a last chapter. Let us fill it with control structures: folding, filtering, and mapping.</p>
<p>First, let’s rip apart the cult of λ and take their favorite spell, whose names gleam in the night: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. Through alchymical experiments no calculus should ever endure, we bind them to <code>this</code> and <code>next</code>. <code>this</code> gives us the first entry in a map, <code>next</code> gives us the rest. Calling <code>this</code> again on the result of <code>this</code> will give us the key, calling <code>next</code> will give us the value. Such is the name of the beast of our creation.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath, and stare into the void until it burns the definition of <code>size</code> into your editor.</p>
<pre><code>; size shows a map’s true manifold
(def size
  {(m) -&gt;
    (if (empty? m)
      {() -&gt; 0}
      {() -&gt; (inc (size (next m)))})})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 9: <code>size</code>.
</p>
<p>Let us use it to bind <code>foldr</code>.</p>
<pre><code>; our ultimate spell, foldr, burns maps into
; maps, it bends and warps until many become one
(def foldr
  {(f e m) -&gt;
     (if (empty? m)
       {() -&gt; e}
       {() -&gt;
         (if (= (size m) 1)
           {() -&gt; (f (this m) (next m) e)}
           {() -&gt; (f (this (this m))
                     (next (this m))
                     (foldr f e (next m)))})})})</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 10: <code>foldr</code>, our ultimate power.
</p>
<p>Click your tongue one last time, and <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> flicker into existence.</p>
<pre><code>; map transforms
(def map
  {(f m) -&gt;
    (foldr {(k v m) -&gt; (add m (f k v))} {} m)})

; filter takes away
(def filter
  {(f m) -&gt;
    (foldr
      {(k v m) -&gt;
        (if (f k v)
          {() -&gt; (add m {k v})}
          {() -&gt; m})}
      {} m)})</code></pre>
<p>

<p>Close your eyes and look around in your mind. Survey the valleys and peaks of thought, and let creation shine through your heart into the world.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>You awake, sweating. You realize you wanted to write, but you cannot remember what it was you meant to say. There is a tome in front of you, written in your hand.</p>
<p>On your computer, there is a browser window with two tabs open, one telling the tale of “the thing on the doorstep”, and the other of job interviews and database consistency.</p>
<p>Your eyes feel heavy, and your heart feels empty. What the fuck just happened?</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> I mean hash maps or dictionaries here, not the Open Street or Google kind.</p>
