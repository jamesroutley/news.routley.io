<p>no technology is (un)natural. no technology is inevitable. no implementation is made without a human decision somewhere in the chain.</p>
<h2 id="part-one-machine">part one: machine</h2><p>a list of apps and subscription technology services i am trying to boycott for ethical reasons (various), in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>substack</li>
<li>spotify (and other music streaming services)</li>
<li>gmail</li>
<li>google search</li>
<li>netflix</li>
<li>chat gpt (and other generative <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai</a> services)</li>
<li>uber</li>
<li>instagram</li>
<li>x (sorta already done)</li>
</ul>
<p>i&#39;m deeply inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdj14_jdumI">be your own algorithm by pagemelt</a> and the many faces of the indie web.</p>
<p>if you&#39;re interested in a long list of whys feel free to <a href="https://olu.online/contact">contact me</a> but this is mostly a what and a little bit of how post.</p>
<h2 id="part-two-breaking">part two: breaking</h2><p>some people say the price you pay for community is inconvenience. some people say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e32D9iMAPUM">solidarity is supposed to be hard</a>. some people say being kind doesn&#39;t cost a thing. some people say if you want to have a village you have to be a villager. people say all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p>i think i have had to get over myself in this process. in a way i see the modern boycott as the boycott as an act of self-purification, the hair shirt of the secular leftist. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott">montgomery bus boycott</a> aka not a modern, individualised boycott, or in other words an organised, focused, successful boycott, i deeply respect and admire.</p>
<p>i still ping between &#34;is this just a pointless guilt response?&#34; and &#34;is this just solidarity being hard?&#34;. honestly i think exploring guilt in this way is worthwhile; what can i give up? what&#39;s pointless? what&#39;s impactful?</p>
<h2 id="part-3-protocol">part 3: protocol</h2><p>the big one i am starting out with is music. i&#39;ve been off gmail before but fastmail started having flaky delivery both sending and receiving and i got too petrified and went skulking back. i am not ashamed to go one step forward, two steps back on this path at all. it&#39;s difficult and in no way incentivised.</p>
<p>bandcamp is way better than i remember, youtube has everything obviously when i just &#34;need&#34; music, and i&#39;m going slowly slowly purchasing and radio listening.</p>
<p>i found the spotify way of consuming music was making me not appreciate and engage with it in the open eyed (and eared) way i really want to. i want to be saturated and i was at best lightly coloured by the music i&#39;ve been picking up the last few years lol (save for hozier!).</p>
<p>substack i still use but don&#39;t have any paid subscriptions any more. uber i use when bolt or free now fail to find rides, but that&#39;s part of where my enthusiasm for learning to ride a bike comes from. these ones feel exciting and easy.</p>
<p>harder is google search; yes it sucks but i do a lot of image reverse searching, and have an android phone, so i dunno how much i can reasonably divest from the google ecosystem (same with apple, though i have no subscriptions with them right now).</p>
<p>hardest is instagram; the gay people in my phone aren&#39;t going anywhere en masse, and i am not leaving them for other platforms that don&#39;t quite fill the same need any time soon.</p>
<p>but it&#39;s okay. i am not perfect and neither is the process.</p>
<p>are you choosing to divest yourself from any platforms or tech habits at the minute? what ones? feel free to <a href="https://olu.online/contact">contact me</a> to discuss.</p>
