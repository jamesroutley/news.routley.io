<p data-block-key="o4n1l"><b>Work approaches that can help</b>: As a maintainer, you have choices about how you run your project. And changing some of your project&#39;s structures and expectations can help with the availability expectations, toil, and bruised feelings that contribute to burnout.</p><p data-block-key="3vq2b">We as an industry ought to normalize that <i>different projects might have different levels of openness to contribution</i>.</p><p data-block-key="bocgm">As an analogy: we sometimes use <a href="http://unmaintained.tech/">the &#34;No Maintenance Intended&#34; badge</a> to indicate that we&#39;re just sharing a codebase for public reuse but aren&#39;t expecting to update it, respond to bug reports, or integrate patches. Similarly, we ought to recognize that sometimes an open source project with an OSI-compliant license is &#34;open source&#34; on a legal sense but is not <i>culturally, socially</i> open source in its workflow -- and that it&#39;s <b>okay</b> for some projects to intentionally choose that approach, as long as they are clear and kind in setting and explaining expectations!</p><p data-block-key="55ig2">I say &#34;some projects&#34; because I feel different when Android does this compared to when SQLite does this. For one thing, I hear SQLite is clearer in laying down guidelines about what will and won&#39;t be accepted, from whom, and why. Here it&#39;s worth considering the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MZOTS_OS_Archetypes_report_ext_scr.pdf">ten project archetypes that Mozilla and Open Tech Strategies described</a> (<a href="https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/open-source-archetypes">source</a>), where some project types (such as Trusted Vendor, Bathwater, and Rocket Ship to Mars) simply are not interested in welcoming contributions from users. More recently, <a href="https://project-types.github.io/">Nadia Eghbal&#39;s 4 quadrants divided by high-to-low contributor growth and user growth</a> help us consider &#34;stadium&#34; and &#34;toy&#34; projects using different expectations for openness to contribution.</p><p data-block-key="bigs8">Maintainers, and maintainer teams, should also actively <b>take vacations</b>. For instance, one open space participant pointed to GoToSocial, which takes several weeks off every December and January. The team shuts down all of its incoming communications and doesn&#39;t read issues at that time, and <a href="https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/@gotosocial/statuses/01GXP5ZRN5ZBRRYB7KE836YSH3">announces that ahead of time</a> so people can have clear expectations. Open space participants agreed, I think, on the idea that maintainers should take at least one month off per year.</p><p data-block-key="fbv0j">Another timing suggestion from a participant: delay releasing a new version until a bit after putting all the work in for the release. I believe the reasoning is: rest a little bit, and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment. Then get mentally prepared for the new questions, support requests, and bug reports you&#39;ll get after publishing the new version, including invalid bug reports and unfair criticism. And then hit Publish.</p><p data-block-key="bh1cj">Unfair criticism is a hazard maintainers often deal with. One participant suggested avoiding reading feedback that comes from drive-by critics on Reddit and similar sites, since even those who aren&#39;t being intentionally malicious often lack context and so their criticisms are nearly useless. (In fact, I&#39;d argue that such complaints <i>are not feedback at all</i>! Feedback is when output from a system is directed back into it, and when we use it in an interpersonal sense, we mean that the giver of the feedback is intentionally offering it to the system in the hopes of improving how the system works. If the person complaining is writing to be read by other users, and their goal is to advise them or to vent their spleens rather than to improve the project in question, then it might be informative and relevant, but it&#39;s not <i>feedback</i>.)</p><p data-block-key="d33ti">I suggest maintainers do what people who face online harassment frequently do: use the buddy system. Ask a colleague from another project to go read the rants people have written about you over on various social media platforms, and report back with a summary of any genuine threats or useful bug reports, and then return the favor for them sometime.</p><p data-block-key="6c07u">Reducing how <i>personal</i> these things feel is partly an interior, mental skill, but as one participant pointed out, bureaucracy can take pressure off individuals too. If a release comes from The Release Team, or a report&#39;s supposed to go through a formal procedure, then any one maintainer is perceived to have less personal responsibility for any particular unpopular decision or backlogged task.</p>
