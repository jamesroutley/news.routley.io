<p>I may be unable to do much right now but this won’t last forever, and in the mean time, I can still contribute in small but helpful ways.</p>
<p>– The Mantra of Microcontributions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, there’s always been something special about the online web developer community. In other fields, it felt like your knowledge was your advantage and <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2014/11/26/go-online/">you needed to protect it</a>.</p>
<p>But us web-devs seem to have this ethos of sharing. Maybe it comes from our open-source origins, or a sense of reciprocity for all the times a web search gave us the answer we needed. Whatever it is, I’ve always felt a lot of satisfaction from sharing my own code and content with anyone who might find it helpful.</p>
<p>We don’t all have the same amount of time to make these kinds of contributions. Life goes through phases and that’s ok.</p>
<p>I went through one of these phases last year where my blog went quiet and open source just wasn’t going to happen. It felt bad, but I realized that I didn’t have to let everything go to zero. I could still make microcontributions. For me, this could include…</p>
<ul>
<li>Upvoting a Stack Overflow answer that helped me</li>
<li>Making a small edit to a Stack Overflow answer (if I found a typo or bad formatting)</li>
<li>Putting some code in a Github gist (instead of a full repo)</li>
<li>Adding an emoji to a Github issue comment that helped me</li>
<li>Posting something I learned on social media (instead of a nice, well-formed, blog post)</li>
<li>Resharing/retweeting/boosting something I learned (again on social media)</li>
<li>Leaving a comment</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things were pretty quick and low-maintenance. I could do them as I went about my normal working day.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it helped me feel better. It made the break feel sustainable and resentment-free.</p>
<p>Whatever microcontributions look like for you, I hope you see them as a tool for fighting the <a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/all-or-nothing-thinking-examples">all-or-nothing thinking</a> that often afflicts the ambitious.</p>
