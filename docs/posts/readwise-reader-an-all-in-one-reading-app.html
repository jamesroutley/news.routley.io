                  Having tried every read-it-later app out there, I cried tears of joy once I got my hands on Reader.
                  It&#39;s the smoothest experience to turn highlights into insights. Plus, I can finally highlight images!

                  Reader is the first reading app that helps you process information rather than hoard it. The keyboard
                  nav and minimalist interface lead you into a deep flow state. A must for any knowledge worker!

                  I used to dump links into Pocket, but I never went back. Reader changes that. Now I feel on top of my
                  reading. Plus the pace of execution of the Readwise team is insane.

                  Readwise is one of my favorite products of the last 5 years. Reader takes it to the next level. I no
                  longer have to duct-tape together 7 different tools. Readwise just leapfrogged the status quo.

            Our read-it-later apps should improve over time. Instead, they worsen. Why? Because we save more stuff than
            we have time to deal with.

              We&#39;re calling this release a “public beta” because the surface area of the product is vast. We basically built five different kinds of reading apps at the same time without accidentally developing the software equivalent of a spork. Meanwhile, we had to make sure the app works well on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari as well as iOS and Android. We’re hoping the “public beta” label buys us some leeway for the next few months while we hunt down new corner cases 🙂
          </p>

          <p>
              Once Reader officially exits beta sometime in 2023, we intend to reprice Readwise/Reader for new subscribers thereafter. Pricing is really hard and complex so we candidly haven&#39;t figured out the exact plans yet. But regardless, we don&#39;t intend to increase pricing on existing full subscribers at that time. This means that if you subscribe while Reader is in beta, you&#39;ll get lifetime access for $7.99/month (billed annually) as part of our current Readwise Full plan.
            </p>

          <p>
              Yes! Reader is available on iOS and Android as well as a local-first web app. The entire experience is cross-platform meaning all data is continuously synced between all your devices. Please note that “local-first web app” does not refer to a native app you install on your computer, but you can install the app as a Chrome app or with a Safari wrapper to get native-like experience.
            </p>

          <p>
              Yes! You can import your existing read-it-later library from Instapaper, Pocket, and a handful of others. You can also import your existing RSS feeds from other feed readers using OPML.
            </p>

          <p>
              Right now, you can think of Reader as another reading app that integrates with Readwise (albeit seamlessly because they share a database). Every highlight you make in Reader instantly syncs with Readwise and then from Readwise to your note-taking apps. Over time, the vision is to create a unified experience between Readwise and Reader within Reader. Regardless, if you have a Readwise Full plan, you get access to both apps.
