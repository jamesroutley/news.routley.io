At a <a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-convenes-ceos-athletes-entrepreneurs-and-experts-for-first-of-its-kind-leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">conference</a> hosted by General Electric on Wednesday called &#34;The Lean Mindset: The Pursuit of Progress,&#34; he recalled finding it &#34;difficult to understand the product.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Honestly, what led me to deliver was that I was going, pardon my French, frickin&#39; crazy at home during COVID — and I wanted to get the hell out of the house, and I wanted to find some way to be constructive out of the house, so I got an e-bike, and I started delivering food for Uber,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;And it was a great experience. It was tiring — it was difficult to understand the product. And, for me, once I saw what I believe was a lack of quality with the product as it related to delivering, then I bought a Tesla, and I started driving as well.&#34;</p><p>Khosrowshahi said both experiences taught him the company wasn&#39;t giving enough attention to drivers&#39; and delivery workers&#39; experience using the app.</p><p>&#34;It showed me, literally, that we as a company culturally were very much focused on the rider and the eater product because we used them ourselves — we took a lot of pride in it all the time,&#34; he said. &#34;But we didn&#39;t take pride in the driver product because very few of us drove.&#34;</p><p>Khosrowshahi later shared what he learned behind the wheel for Uber in an all-hands presentation titled &#34;Why we suck,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t a pleasant all-hands with the company, but it set a tone, and we set that expectation — we started celebrating employees going out there delivering, employees driving,&#34; he said. &#34;It is a point of pride for employees now — when they drive they get a little badge on their corporate profile, etc.&#34;</p><p>In a Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-3ee8f97e" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">interview</a> last month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-most-nightmarish-experience-driver-got-lost-report-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Khosrowshahi said the most nightmarish part of Uber delivery driving</a> was &#34;trying to deliver food, and I couldn&#39;t find where to drop it off.&#34;</p><p>He separately <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-ceo-will-always-say-his-company-sucks/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">told</a> Wired that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-disliked-passengers-talking-speaker-phone-tip-baiting-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">his pet peeve as a driver was passengers who talked on speakerphone</a> during the ride and that he&#39;d experienced <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-became-undercover-boss-used-tesla-surprised-rude-riders-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">the frustrating phenomenon of &#34;tip-baiting,</a>&#34; where customers entice drivers or delivery workers with big tips at the outset before later reducing them or nixing them altogether once the ride or delivery is over.</p><p>Despite his time moonlighting as a driver, though, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-shocked-price-cost-ride-icrease-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Khosrowshahi is still a bit off when it comes to Uber&#39;s fares</a>: When Wired&#39;s editor at large, Steven Levy, asked him to estimate the cost of a 2.95-mile Uber ride in New York City, Khosrowshahi ventured &#34;20 bucks&#34; — less than half the actual price of $51.69, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-tipping-trends-getting-worse-taylor-swift-riders-best-2023-4" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-tipping-trends-getting-worse-taylor-swift-riders-best-2023-4" data-uri="9945fa6efb976671f2fc9d5eca38778d">a tip for the driver</a>.</p>
