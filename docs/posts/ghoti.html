    <h1>Ghoti</h1>

<h2>Ghoti (/fɪʃ/)</h2>
<p>This fallacy arises from the incorrect application of the rules linking orthography to phonology<sup>1</sup>, resulting in an argument that &#39;<strong>ghoti</strong>&#39; should be pronounced similarly to &#39;<strong>fish</strong>&#39;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>gh</strong>, pronounced [f] as in <em>enough</em> [ɪˈnʌf] or <em>tough</em> [tʌf];</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>, pronounced [ɪ] as in <em>women</em> [ˈwɪmɪn]; and</p>
<p><strong>ti</strong>, pronounced [ʃ] as in <em>nation</em> [ˈneɪ̯ʃən] or <em>motion</em> [ˈməʊʃən].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sub>This is not a definitive list.</sub></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Key to the phenomenon is that the pronunciations of the constructed word&#39;s three parts are inconsistent with how they would be pronounced in those placements.</strong> To illustrate: <em>gh</em> can only resemble <em>f</em> when following the letters <em>ou</em> / <em>au</em> at the end of certain morphemes (&#34;cough&#34;, &#34;laugh&#34;), while <em>ti</em> can only resemble <em>sh</em> when followed by the letters -on / -al (&#34;confidential&#34;, &#34;spatial&#34;) etc.</p>
<p>Also of interest is that at the time (around mid-1800s) many persons were intrigued with the &#39;<em>Phonotypy and Phonography</em>&#39; of English, with Alexander J. Ellis presenting a number of absurd respellings, like turning <em>scissors</em> into &#39;<em>schiesourrhce</em>&#39; by combining parts of <strong>sch</strong>ism, s<strong>ie</strong>ve, a<strong>s</strong>, hon<strong>ou</strong>r, my<strong>rrh</strong> and sacrifi<strong>ce</strong>.  (Sacrifice was historically pronounced with a [z])</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Thanks to <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/users/130346/azor-ahai">Azor-Ahai</a> for confirming this.  I originally thought it was an error with phonemes.</p>
